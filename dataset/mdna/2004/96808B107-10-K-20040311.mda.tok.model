overview wild oats markets  inc is one of the largest natural food supermarket chains in north america  with stores in states and british columbia  canada  as of march  we have always differentiated our stores and our products from our competitors by our uncompromising commitment to natural and organic products and to our customers education in the areas of health and wellness 
in fiscal  we implemented a number of new strategies to promote our areas of differentiation in the consumer s mind  including refinement of our brand identity as a leader in the natural and organic products industry investment in new store signage and merchanding to improve consumer understanding of recent issues surrounding food safety and the integral role of nutrition and diet in overall wellbeing continued training of staff to ensure detailed product knowledge  an ability to assist consumers with health and wellness issues re engineering of key departments in our stores creation of a body of in store consumer education materials through a variety of media active sampling and demonstration programs creation of new private label product lines 
our identification as a leading retailer of the broadest selection of natural and organic products is the foundation of our differentiation from our competition 
along with providing great tasting products in a welcoming and invigorating store environment  we view consumer education as one important key to attracting and retaining loyal customers and increasing basket size 
we have introduced new strategies to communicate information on certain food safety concerns and dietary trends  such as our product signage that our beef comes from exclusively grain fed cattle and our introduction of are you counting carbs signage and merchandising in the first quarter of we have implemented new training programs to enhance consumer service 
in  we commenced the re engineering of our vitamin  supplement and body care department to be reintroduced as our holistic health department  including a full redesign of fixtures  lighting  flooring  navigational signage and custom product displays 
as part of that re engineering  we have designed advanced training programs in product knowledge and selling techniques for our holistic health staff  along with department oriented incentive programs  and we are updating and expanding our consumer education materials ranging from product specific and issue related brochures to educational videos and access to computer research tools on health and wellness 
this newly re engineered holistic health department will be introduced in mid in  we introduced active sampling of products from our perishables departments and private label lines  which expanded our existing vendor sponsored demonstration programs as a way to introduce our customers to our new products and encourage shopping of all departments of our stores 
we continue to expand our private label product lines with the introduction of unique products from around the world  including two new  custom created lines of vitamins  minerals and supplements 
in  we will be re engineering our deli departments to enhance product offerings  including our grab and go and entree offerings  offer seasonal menus  increase informational signage and improve overall customer service 
our revenues are primarily derived from the retail sale of products at our stores 
internally  we look to a variety of indicators to evaluate our periodic financial performance  including comparable store sales  sales per square foot  average basket size  customer count  inventory turns ie  how quickly inventory is sold  percentage of total sales by department  department margins  and staff productivity 
in fiscal  we continued to focus on increasing comparable store sales results  basket size and customer count through improvements in store level customer service  execution and presentation  as well as regional and national promotion of wild oats natural marketplace and henry s marketplace as brand identities 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  comparable stores customer traffic increased and the average transaction per customer increased  while average basket size in the fourth quarter of fiscal was  compared to in the fourth quarter of fiscal average weekly store sales increased and sales per square foot increased in the fourth quarter of fiscal  as compared to the same period in fiscal major initiatives implemented and completed during fiscal and aimed at our targeted areas of improvement included increased staff training and revised incentive programs resetting of merchandise according to item movement and customer preference refreshing of stores environments through remodels and the installation of new decor packages improved store level informational and sale signage investment in labor scheduling programs to ensure proper staffing levels at all times inventory reduction programs to ensure shelf space for new products shift to centralized buying  pricing and scale hosting to ensure consistency chainwide  and refocus store staff energies on customer service we built brand awareness in through a number of methods  including the re engineering of our existing private label product lines and the introduction of new private label products  consumer education campaigns regarding a number of issues key to the natural products industry  including trans fats  genetically modified organisms and the sustainability of certain seafood  brand specific education and advertising on issues of concern to all consumers  including the safety of our meat and seafood in light of mad cow disease and concerns over contaminants in farm raised fish  and the availability in our stores of products for specific diet regimes  such as gluten free diets and lower carbohydrate diets 
we believe all these programs  together with overall operational improvements  resulted in increased store sales  customer count and average transaction size nationwide in fiscal strikes by grocery store workers in conventional grocery stores in missouri in mid and in southern california commencing in october and continuing through february resulted in increased sales and customer counts in our henry s market and five wild oats natural marketplace stores in those regions 
we expect that in southern california  like our experience in missouri after that strike ended  we will retain some increased business in the affected stores 
it is possible that in  other conventional grocery store strikes in other areas of the country may occur as area labor contracts expire and negotiations stall over issues of pay and health care costs 
we have developed strategies to service conventional customers during labor strikes  including modification of some product mix and increased customer service  with the goal of customer retention 
store format and new store growth 
we operate in one retail grocery operating segment with two store formats the natural foods supermarket  under the wild oats natural marketplace name nationwide and capers community market in canada  and the farmers market formats  under henry s marketplace in southern california and sun harvest in texas 
both formats emphasize natural and organic products with a wide selection of products in a full service environment 
the formats share a core demographic customer profile 
many of the support services to the stores are provided centrally from our boulder  colorado location 
all of our stores  regardless of format  purchase from the same primary distributor based on centralized negotiations  merchandising and marketing strategies 
perishables for all of our stores in the western united states are supplied by our new distribution facility 
distinguishing characteristics of the formats are characteristics of format types natural foods supermarket format farmers market format full range of products  with perishables emphasis emphasis on produce all organic and natural products mostly natural products  with a regional mix of conventional and organic produce  to  square feet in size  to  square feet in size suburban and regional locations historically neighborhood locations target shopper is interested in health and wellness  customer service and an upscale shopping experience target shopper is price conscious and seeks freshness  value and authenticity in and  we focused on redesigning both of our store format prototypes to increase the navigability of the stores  emphasize certain departments and expand perishable departments 
the following table shows the new prototype store openings in fiscal and through march  by brand and format store openings by brand and format for fiscal and through march  wild oats natural marketplace henry s marketplace portland  maine costa mesa  california louisville  kentucky chino hills  california lexington  kentucky franklin  tennessee relocation sw denver  colorado park city  utah colorado springs  colorado at december   we had stores located in states and canada  as compared to stores in states and canada as of the end of fiscal  and stores in states and canada as of the end of fiscal a summary of store openings  acquisitions  closures and sales is as follows total store count fiscal year ending period endingmarch  store count at beginning of period stores opened stores closed stores sold store count at end of period as has been our practice in the past  we will continue to evaluate the profitability  strategic positioning  impact of potential competition  and sales growth potential of all of our stores on an ongoing basis 
we may  from time to time  make decisions regarding closures  disposals  relocations or remodels in accordance with such evaluations 
in fiscal and through the date of this report  we have closed five under performing stores in tucson and phoenix  arizona  irvine and los angeles  california  and nashville  tennessee  and sold one store which did not fit our real estate strategy or formats in new york  new york 
of the closed stores  one lease has terminated  two locations have been sublet and one is being remodeled for opening as a farmers market format store 
we have also consolidated the operations of two warehouse facilities into our new riverside  california distribution center 
in first half of  we plan to close the third warehouse facility as a part of the consolidations 
we are continuing to execute on our real estate strategy  which is focused on adding stores in those existing markets with proven past performance  and in locations in those markets that are defensible from a competitive standpoint  as well as adding selected new markets on a strategic basis 
we have identified strategic markets for expansion of our farmers market format outside of southern california and will be opening the first of the new farmers market stores in arizona in to the date of this report we have signed leases or letters of intent for new sites opening in fiscal and fiscal  including wild oats locations selected for the excellence of the projects  the position in new segments of existing markets indiana  nebraska and ohio or in strategic new markets and their defensibility from competitive attack  and henry s marketplace locations in easily accessible and highly visible locations in densely populated metropolitan los angeles and san diego  california and our newest expansion market for henry s in metropolitan phoenix  arizona 
we anticipate opening new stores in fiscal in the following stateslocations metropolitan phoenix  arizona  metropolitan san diego and los angeles  california  colorado springs already open and superior  colorado  indiana  nebraska  ohio  metropolitan portland  oregon and salt lake city  utah 
we currently have an inventory of vacant sites comprising closed store and office locations and excess unoccupied space acquired during acquisitions or other leasing transactions  for which we have rent obligations  appropriate accruals have been made for such obligations 
in fiscal  we sublet or negotiated the termination of six excess properties from our inventory of vacant sites  and we added four store sites that were closed in fiscal to our inventory  of which two have been sublet 
we are actively seeking subtenants or assignees for the spaces  although many of the sites are difficult to sublease or assign because of unusual site characteristics  surpluses of vacant retail space in the markets in which the sites are located  or because the remaining lease terms are relatively short 
in february of  we completed a refinancing of million with a group of banks led by the lead bank in our former credit facility 
in december of  we expanded the existing facility under its terms by million and added one new lender 
as of the end of fiscal  we had million in total borrowings outstanding under the credit facility million less than was outstanding at the end of fiscal see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
the expansion of the credit facility  together with cash generated from operations  ensures that we have sufficient capital resources to fund our projected new store growth over the next several years 
comparable store sales results 
sales of a store are deemed to be comparable commencing in the thirteenth full month of operations for new  relocated and acquired stores 
a variety of factors affect our comparable store sales results  including  among others general economic conditions the opening of stores by us or by our competitors in markets where we have existing stores the relative proportion of new or relocated stores to mature stores the timing of advertising and promotional events store remodels store closures our ability to capitalize on distribution efficiencies and execute operating plans changes in consumer preferences for natural foods and products availability of produce and other seasonal merchandise labor unrest in area grocery stores 
past increases in comparable store sales may not be indicative of future performance 
the farmers market format stores  which depend heavily on produce sales  are more susceptible to sales fluctuations resulting from the availability and pricing of certain produce items 
comparable store sales chain wide increased by in fiscal  as compared to in fiscal due to nationwide operational improvements and marketing strategies which were evidenced by a strengthening of comparable store sales in all markets in which we operate  and the continuing southern california conventional grocery store strikes already mentioned  comparable store sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal increased to  as compared to in the third quarter of fiscal  and in the fourth quarter of fiscal without the fourth quarter increase in comparable store sales attributable to the positive impact of the southern california grocery store strike on of our stores  estimated comp store sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal would have been 
pre opening expenses 
pre opening expenses include labor  rent  advertising  utilities  supplies and certain other costs incurred prior to a store s opening 
the amount per store may vary depending on whether the store is the first to be opened in a market or is part of a cluster of stores in that market 
as a result of increased marketing and training costs  our pre opening expenses have increased to  to  per natural foods supermarket store  and  to  per farmers market store  depending on whether the store is the first in a geographic area  the date of rent commencement negotiated under the lease  and the extent of grand opening advertising and staff training activities 
restructuring and asset impairment activity 
during fiscal  due to changes in facts and circumstances as well as certain decisions made by management relating to our operations  estimates of prior restructuring and asset impairment charges were revised  resulting in net restructuring and asset impairment expense income of    and  for the fourth  third  second  and first quarters of fiscal  respectively 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate the continued appropriateness of our accounting policies and resulting estimates  including those related to goodwill valuation asset impairment charges restructuring charges and store closing costs inventory valuation and reserves self insurance reserves reserves for contingencies and litigation we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements goodwill 
goodwill consists of the excess cost of acquired companies over the sum of the fair market value of their underlying tangible and identifible intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
prior to  goodwill was recorded at the store level  and amortized over years 
with adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we record goodwill at the enterprise level 
it is no longer amortized but is tested for impairment annually  or more frequently if certain indicators of impairment exist 
our annual evaluation for impairment requires management to exercise a high degree of judgment in developing assumptions and fair value estimates used in the calculation  which have the potential of significantly impacting the results 
impairment of long lived assets 
we monitor the carrying value of our long lived assets  including finite lived intangible assets  for potential impairment whenever changes in circumstances indicate a potential for impairment may exist 
the triggering events for evaluations of finite lived intangible assets include a significant decrease in the market value of an asset  acquisition and construction costs in excess of budget  or current store operating losses combined with a history of losses or a projection of continuing losses 
if an impairment is identified  based on undiscounted future cash flows  management compares the asset s future cash flows  discounted to present value using a risk adjusted discount rate  to its current carrying value and records a provision for impairment as appropriate 
with respect to equipment and leasehold improvements associated with closed stores  the value of these assets is adjusted to reflect recoverable values estimated based on our previous efforts to dispose of similar assets  with consideration for current economic conditions 
restructuring and asset impairment costs 
we plan to complete store closures or sales within a one year period following the commitment date 
costs related to store closures and sales are reflected in the income statement as restructuring and asset impairment charges 
for stores we intend to sell  we actively market the stores to potential buyers 
stores held for disposal are reduced to their estimated net realizable value 
prior to  when we commited to close a store  a lease related liability was recorded for the present value of the estimated remaining non cancelable lease payments after the anticipated closing date  net of estimated subtenant income  or for estimated lease settlement costs 
in addition  we recorded a liability for costs to be incurred after the store closing which are required under leases or local ordinances for site preservation during the period before lease termination 
the value of equipment and leasehold improvements related to a closed store was reduced to reflect recoverable values based on our previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and current economic conditions 
in accordance with the new requirements of sfas no 
see notes to consolidated financial statements note organization and summary of significant accounting policies new accounting pronouncements for a discussion of sfas no 
 as of fiscal  we recognized such lease related costs at the time of the actual store closing 
as of the date of the commitment to close or relocate a store  depreciation of store assets is accelerated over the remaining months of operation as necessary in order to bring their net carrying cost down to net realizable value as of the date of closure severance costs incurred in connection with store closings are recorded when the employees have been identified and notified of the termination benefits to be made to the employees 
lease related liabilities and the recoverability of assets to be disposed of are reviewed quarterly  and changes in previous estimates are reflected in operations 
significant cash payments associated with closed stores relate to ongoing payments of rent  common area maintenance  insurance charges  and real property taxes as required under continuing lease obligations 
inventories 
store inventories are valued principally at the lower of cost or market  with cost primarily determined under the retail method on a first in  first out fifo basis 
fifo cost is determined using the retail method for approximately of inventories and using the item cost method for highly perishable products representing approximately of inventories 
under the retail inventory method  the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are determined by applying a cost to retail ratio for various categories of similar items to the retail value of inventories 
inherent in the retail inventory method calculations are certain management judgments and estimates  including shrinkage  which could impact the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as the resulting gross margins 
we maintain allowances for excess or unsaleable inventory as a percentage of its gross inventory balance based on historical experience and assumptions about market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  or if we expand our forward buying of inventory  which will increase our inventory levels  then additional inventory write downs may be required 
self insurance 
we are self insured for certain losses relating to worker s compensation claims  general liability and employee medical and dental benefits 
we have purchased stop loss coverage in order to limit its exposure to any significant levels of claims 
self insured losses are accrued based upon our estimates of the aggregate uninsured claims incurred using certain actuarial assumptions followed in the insurance industry and our historical experiences 
a high degree of management judgment is required in developing these estimates and assumptions  which have the potential for significantly impacting the required reserve amounts 
contingencies and litigation 
we maintain reserves for contingencies and litigation based on management s best estimates of potential liability in the event of a judgment against us  possible settlement costs  as well as existing facts and circumstances 
future adverse changes related to current contingencies and litigation could necessitate additional reserves in the future 
new accounting pronouncements 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb fin which was subsequently revised in december fin r the primary objectives of fin r are to provide guidance on the identification of entities for which control is achieved through means other than through voting rights variable interest entities or vies and how to determine when and which business enterprise should consolidate the vie the primary beneficiary 
this new model for consolidation applies to an entity which either the equity investors if any do not have a controlling financial interest or the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entity s activities without receiving additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
in addition  fin r requires that both the primary beneficiary and all other enterprises with a significant variable interest in a vie make additional disclosures 
as of december   the company was not a party to a vie  therefore  fin r did not have a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  was issued on july  sfas no 
will require companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they occur rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
sfas no 
became effective for the company on january   and did not have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
on august   the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations which requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
the associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset 
sfas no 
will be effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after june  under sfas no 
 an entity shall recognize the cumulative effect of the adoption of sfas no 
as a change in accounting principle 
sfas no 
did not have a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
the fasb s emerging issues task force eitf issued eitf no 
 accounting by a customer including a reseller for cash consideration received from a vendor  addressed the accounting treatment for vendor allowances 
the adoption of eitf issue no 
in fiscal did not have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  resulting primarily from decisions reached by the fasb derivatives implementation group subsequent to the original issuance of sfas no 
this statement is generally effective prospectively for contracts and hedging relationships entered into after june  the company has not entered into any such agreements since the effective date  therefore  the adoption of sfas no 
has had no impact on the company 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
this statement establishes standards for an issuer to classify and measure certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
it requires an issuer to classify a financial instrument with certain characteristics as a liability  or an asset in some circumstances 
this statement is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  it is to be implemented by reporting the cumulative effect of a change in an accounting principle for financial instruments created before the issuance date of the statement and still existing at the beginning of the interim period of adoption 
restatement is not permitted 
the company currently has no financial instruments falling within the scope of this statement  therefore  the adoption of sfas no 
has had no impact on the company 
in november  the fasb s emerging issue task force eitf reached a consensus on eitf no 
 application of issue no 
by resellers to sales incentives offered to consumers by manufacturers 
the consensus required that consideration received by a reseller from a vendor that is a reimbursement by the vendor for honoring the vendor s sales incentives offered directly to consumers such as coupons be recorded as revenue rather than as a reduction of cost of goods sold 
the company has historically accounted for such reimbursements in accordance with eitf  therefore its adoption will have no impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
factors impacting results of operations our results of operations have been and will continue to be affected by  among other things the number  timing and mix of store openings  acquisitions  relocations  remodels or closings fluctuations in quarterly results of operations impact of merchandising and marketing initiatives on store performance economic conditions construction adjacent to operating stores costs associated with store closings and relocations competition labor issues loss of key management government regulations changes in and performance by suppliers  distributors and manufacturers unavailability of product volatility in our stock price 
new stores build their sales volumes and refine their merchandise selection gradually and  as a result  generally have lower gross margins and higher operating expenses as a percentage of sales than more mature stores 
new stores opened prior to experienced operating losses for the first to months of operation  in accordance with historical trends  stores opened based on our new real estate strategy and using the prototype floor plans in fiscal and fiscal  based on our rates throughout the year  are projected to incur operating losses for six to months 
we substantially completed the remodeling or remerchandising of of our older stores in fiscal we plan to complete significant remodels to an additional four stores in fiscal  and to remerchandise a number of stores 
remodels and remerchandising typically cause short term disruption in sales volume and related increases in certain expenses as a percentage of sales  such as payroll 
we cannot predict whether sales disruptions and the related impact on earnings may be greater than projected in future remodeled or remerchandised stores 
the construction or acquisition of new stores  remodeling of existing stores  as well as completion of capital purchases of new technology systems required for efficient operation of our business require substantial capital expenditures 
in the past  cash generated from operations  bank debt and equity financing proceeds has funded our capital expenditures 
these sources of capital may not be available to us in the future 
in addition  our new credit agreement contains limitations on our ability to make capital expenditures that may constrain future growth without additional equity financing 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
our quarterly results of operations may differ materially from quarter to quarter for a variety of reasons  including the timing and success of new store openings  overall store performance  changes in the economy  seasonality and the timing of holidays  significant increases or decreases in prices for or availability of goods and services  competitive pressure and labor disturbances  shrink and spoilage  fluctuations in profit margins for discontinued items  as well as other factors mentioned in this section 
downturns in general economic conditions in communities  states  regions or the nation as a whole can affect our results of operations 
while purchases of food generally do not decrease in a slower economy  consumers may choose less expensive alternative sources for food purchases 
in addition  downturns in the economy make the disposition of excess properties  for which we continue to pay rent and other carrying costs  substantially more difficult as the markets become saturated with vacant space and market rents decrease below our contractual rent obligations 
construction on roads and in parking lots and shopping center common areas adjacent to our operating stores is an ongoing and unpredictable variable in the operation of our stores 
such activity historically has negatively impacted our results of operations by reducing customer traffic and lowering sales volumes 
as mentioned previously  we compete with both natural foods and conventional grocers 
as competition in certain markets intensifies  our results of operations may be negatively impacted through loss of sales  reduction in margin from competitive price modifications  and disruptions in our employee base 
from time to time  unions will attempt to organize employees or portions of the employee base at stores or our distribution or manufacturing facilities 
responses to organization attempts require substantial management and employee time and are disruptive to operations 
in addition  from time to time certain of our stores may be subject to informational picketing  which can discourage customer traffic and lower sales volumes 
our ability to attract  hire and retain qualified employees at store and home office levels is critical to our continued success 
our future direction and success is dependent in large part on the continued services of certain key executive officers 
loss of any key officer may have an adverse affect on current operations and future growth programs 
we are subject to a myriad of local  state and federal regulations governing the operation of our stores and support facilities  including licensing laws governing the sale of particular categories of products  health and sanitation laws  laws governing the manufacture  labeling and importation of private label products  labor laws controlling wages  benefits and employment conditions of our employees and advertising regulations governing the manner in which we may advertise products we sell 
consumer and regulatory concerns regarding food safety issues  new technology or competitive pressures may trigger modifications in existing laws and the implementation of new laws governing components of our business operations 
such modifications can have a material impact on our sales volume  costs of goods and direct store expenses 
modification of such laws may also impact the vendors and manufacturers who provide goods and services to us  raising the cost of such items or decreasing their availability 
in addition  from time to time we are audited by various governmental agencies for compliance with existing laws  and we could be subject to fines or operational modifications as a result of noncompliance 
in october of  we announced that due to the parties inability to leverage the buying synergies and reach the supply chain efficiencies expected from our primary distribution arrangement with tree of life  inc  the parties had reached agreement to terminate our arrangement 
we also announced at that time that we would be exercising a right to convert an existing secondary distribution with unfi to a primary distribution relationship 
in january of  we executed a new five year primary distribution agreement with unfi  and we have commenced the process of transititioning our primary ordering to unfi 
we expect that the transition will be substantially completed by the end of the first quarter of  however  delays in the transition process or difficulties in completing the transition may impact sales and operating results 
from time to time  we may experience product shortages due to the impact of adverse weather conditions  such as drought or flood  or disruptions in the supply chain from product shortages  transportation disruptions or other conditions 
our current transition to a new primary distributor in the first quarter of fiscal may result in product shortages or delivery disruptions 
product shortages may result in a material impact to our sales volume  cost of goods or customer counts 
our stock price has been and continues to be fairly volatile 
our stock price is affected by our quarterly and year end results  results of our major competitors and suppliers  general market and economic conditions and publicity about our competitors  our vendors  our industry or us 
volatility in our stock price may affect our future ability to renegotiate our existing credit agreement or enter into a new borrowing relationship  or affect our ability to obtain new store sites on favorable economic terms 
results of operations our net income for fiscal was million  or per diluted share  compared with a net income of million  or per diluted share  in fiscal the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain selected income statement data expressed as a percentage of sales fiscal year sales cost of goods sold and occupancy costs gross profit direct store expenses store contribution selling  general and administrative expenses loss on disposal of assets  net pre opening expenses restructuring and asset impairment charges income income loss from operations interest income interest expense income loss before income taxes income tax expense benefit net income loss the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain selected income statement data in dollars in thousands fiscal year sales gross profit direct store expenses selling  general and administrative expenses pre opening expenses restructuring and asset impairment charges income  net interest income interest expense income tax expense benefit net income loss year over year comparisons of certain selected income statement data the following narrative compares those selected income statement data with material changes from year to year 
sales 
net sales for the fiscal year ended december   were million  an increase of  compared with million in fiscal increases were attributable to the addition of eight new stores in fiscal  despite the closure of four stores during the fiscal year  as we ended the year with total square footage of million square feet  which is an increase of compared with million square feet at the end of  as well as increased store sales at stores positively impacted by labor strikes california during fiscal we generated million in net sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal  a increase from million in last year s fourth quarter 
comparable store sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal were  as compared to in the same quarter of the increase in sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal can be attributed  in part  to the benefit of the southern california conventional grocery strike  without which  estimated comparable store sales in the fourth quarter were  despite continued supply chain issues 
net sales in fiscal were impacted by a number of factors  including the disruption caused by our sku reduction program  extensive resets and remodels  the impact of road construction on the ability to easily access a number of our stores in the first half of fiscal and our inability to leverage certain expected supply chain efficiencies throughout we expect sales to increase at a slightly faster rate in fiscal  due to operational improvements nationwide  the projected opening of up to new stores in fiscal  improvements in supply chain efficiencies upon completion of our new distributor transition at the end of the first quarter  as well as continued strong sales in the first two months of fiscal in the southern california stores positively impacted by the conventional grocery store strike 
sales for the fiscal year ended december  were million  an increase of as compared to fiscal the increase was primarily due to the opening of one new store in the second quarter of fiscal  operational improvements implemented throughout fiscal  as well as the rollout in the first half of fiscal of our new marketing and merchandising program in of our natural foods supermarket format stores 
gross profit 
gross profit for the fiscal year ended december  increased as compared to fiscal  while gross profit margins declined slightly to  compared with in fiscal  largely due to million in accelerated depreciation for the planned closure or relocation of distribution centers  warehouses and stores  along with certain supply chain issues and planned inventory reduction 
we anticipate that gross profit margins will improve slightly in fiscal  due to improvement in supply chain  the expansion of our private label lines and the ramp up of our new perishables distribution center in california 
gross profit margins for the fiscal year ended december   increased to from in fiscal due to more disciplined pricing strategies  a new category management structure  vendor consolidation and the substantial completion of our sku rationalization program 
direct store expenses 
direct store expenses for the fiscal year ended december   remained constant as a percent of sales in fiscal as compared to fiscal direct store expenses increased as a result of the addition of eight new stores and an overall increase in sales and customer traffic 
we anticipate that we will see decreases in direct store expenses as a percent of sales in fiscal and beyond as a result of the rollout in fiscal of labor scheduling programs to maximize labor efficiencies and reduce overstaffing 
on an absolute basis  we expect direct store expenses to increase in fiscal with the addition of a projected new stores 
direct store expenses for the fiscal year ended december   decreased to from in  as a result of better expense management at store level  as well as the centralization of certain non retail contracts for items such as supplies  maintenance  in store music  linens and other service contracts selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended december   increased as compared to fiscal the increases are attributable to costs to improve information systems  headcount increases to continue to build infrastructure to support new store growth plans  as well as costs incurred to audit and amend certain of our benefit plans 
many of these expenditures will not be repeated in  and we anticipate that the benefit plans audit will be concluded during the second fiscal quarter of we expect that selling  general and administrative expenses will remain flat in absolute dollars and decrease slightly as a percentage of sales in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended december   increased as compared to fiscal the increases in fiscal over fiscal are attributable to investments in information systems to support centralized purchasing and pricing  store level signage production and a new data warehouse  as well as increases in advertising and merchandising expenses related to the implementation of our marketing and merchandising program and expenses for expanded infrastructure at our headquarters to support new store growth and centralized purchasing and pricing 
loss on disposal of assets 
as a result of the significant store closings  remodels and resets  the company undertook a review of all fixtures and equipment in its stores  offices  and support facilities  including a physical inventory in conjunction with an asset tagging exercise 
the company completed the review and recorded in fiscal a million loss on disposal of fixtures and equipment 
loss on disposal amounts for prior years relate to assets disposed of in the normal course of business and have been relatively immaterial 
pre opening expenses 
pre opening expenses for the fiscal year ended december   increased as compared to fiscal  primarily as a result of the increase in new store openings in fiscal as compared to fiscal as part of increased marketing and training efforts  we anticipate that pre opening expenses will average  per new store across both formats  and pre opening expenses will increase in absolute dollars in fiscal as we open new stores  compared to eight new store openings in pre opening expenses for the fiscal year ended december   increased as compared to fiscal but remained constant as a percentage of sales 
the increase in pre opening expenses was attributable to an overall increase in advertising and marketing expenditures per store

changes in estimate related to lease related liabilities for sites previously identified for closure  in restructuring expense 
during the fourth quarter  we secured a viable subtenant for a location in los angeles  california resulting in restructuring income of  also  during the quarter  we determined that additional time will be needed to dispose of certain lease obligations for vacant sites in nashville  tennessee and pinecrest  florida  resulting in restructuring expense of  based on a current assessment of changing real estate market conditions in the area as well as undesirable site characteristics  we determined the likelihood of disposing of our lease obligations related to certain space adjacent to a store in fort collins  colorado  was remote  and therefore restructuring expense of  was recorded to adjust the reserve balance to the net present value of the remaining lease payments 
in february  the superior court of arizona  maricopa county upheld a judgment against the company which resulted in a  charge to restructuring expense 
based on these changes in facts and circumstances and the related changes in estimates  we adjusted or reversed the remaining lease related liabilities previously recorded for these locations and recognized net restructuring expense of  insurance settlement received for impaired assets previously written off  in asset impairment income 
during the fourth quarter  we received  in insurance proceeds as partial reimbursement for property losses and incremental expenses incurred during the first quarter of caused by a roof collapse at a support facility in federal heights  colorado 
the support facility had been previously identified for closure during the fourth quarter of fiscal  and the carrying value of its fixed assets were written off as an impairment charge at that time 
therefore  we recorded a gain in the amount of the insurance proceeds received of  severance fo r employees notified of termination during the fourth quarter  restructuring expense 
during the fourth quarter  employees were terminated in conjunction with the closing of a store in tucson  arizona  a warehouse in san diego  and a restaurant operating within a store in west vancouver  british columbia 
the employees were notified of their involuntary termination during the fourth quarter of fiscal as of december    of involuntary termination benefits had been paid to terminated employees 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we recorded a restructuring and asset impairment charge of  details of the significant components are as follows lease related liabilty for site closed during the third quarter of fiscal  of restructuring expense 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we closed a store in nashville  tennessee  as part of a relocation to a larger site 
based upon the facts and circumstances  we expected either the lease would be terminated or the space subleased to a viable subtenant within six months from the date of closure  and  as a result  we recognized a restructuring charge of  changes in estimate related to lease related liabilities for sites previously identified for closure or sale  of restructuring income 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we secured a viable subtenant for a location in memphis  tennessee 
additional information received in the third quarter resulted in a revision in the net restructuring charges previously recorded for a store in irvine  california 
as a result  we recorded restructuring income of  to reduce the accrual to the required amount 
this was offset by a restructuring charge of  for the costs associated with restoring a space to its original condition for a location previously included in a restructuring charge 
based on these changes in facts and circumstances and the related changes in estimates  we adjusted or reversed the remaining lease related liabilities previously recorded for these locations and recognized net restructuring income of  during the third quarter of fiscal asset impairment  of asset impairment charges 
in addition to the restructuring income described above  management also identified asset impairment charges of  in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets for two stores held for use 
these assets became impaired during the third quarter of fiscal because the projected cash flows of each store at the time were not sufficient to fully recover the carrying value of the stores long lived assets 
in determining whether an impairment exists  we estimate the stores future cash flows on an undiscounted basis  and if the cash flows are not sufficient to recover the carrying value  then we use a discounted cash flow based on a risk adjusted discount rate  to adjust its carrying value of the assets and records a provision for impairment as appropriate 
management believes the weak performance from the stores included in the asset impairment charge was caused by depressed markets and increased competition 
we continually reevaluate our stores performance to monitor the carrying value of our long lived assets in comparison to projected cash flows 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we recorded restructuring income of  details of the significant components are as follows change in estimate related to lease related liabilities for sites previously identified for closure or sale that were closed  sold or disposed of during the second quarter of fiscal  of restructuring income 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we concluded a sublease transaction with a subtenant in irvine  california  the viability of whose business led us to determine that the subtenant s business stability and the expected sublease income supported reversal of the remaining reserves of  severance for employees terminated in the second quarter of fiscal  of restructuring expense 
during the second quarter of fiscal  employees were notified of their involuntary termination in conjunction with the closure of two stores in irvine and los angeles  california 
as of december   all  of the involuntary termination benefits had been paid to terminated employees 
changes in estimate related to lease related liabilities for sites previously identified for closure or sale  of restructuring expense 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we determined that additional time will be needed to dispose of certain lease obligations for four vacant sites 
this determination was largely driven by results of our current disposition efforts  and is attributable to poor marketability and or unattractive characteristics of the space  which may require improvement allowances and rent concessions 
as a result  we increased our estimated reserves for these sites by  offsetting this charge was  in restructuring income related to the early termination of leases in cleveland  ohio and santa fe  new mexico 
based on these changes in facts and circumstances and the related changes in estimates  we adjusted or reversed the remaining lease related liabilities previously recorded for these locations and recognized net restructuring expense of  during the second quarter of fiscal during the first quarter of fiscal  we recorded restructuring income of  details of the significant components are as follows change in estimate related to lease related liabilities for sites previously identified for closure or sale that were closed  sold or disposed of during the first quarter of fiscal  of restructuring income 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we completed payment obligations for amounts less than previously estimated under a lease for excess space located in west hartford  connecticut  and under lease termination agreements for sites located in west hollywood  california and kansas city  missouri 
we closed a commissary facility in federal heights  colorado  after weather related structural damage rendered the facility untenantable 
based on these changes in facts and circumstances  we reversed the remaining lease related liabilities previously recorded for these locations and  therefore  recognized restructuring income of  during the first quarter of fiscal changes in estimate related to lease related liabilities for sites previously identified for closure or sale  of restructuring income 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we reviewed the viability of a subtenant in fort collins  colorado  and determined the subtenant s business stability and the expected sublease income supported reversal of the remaining reserves of  which had been previously established 
subsequent to the first quarter of fiscal  we negotiated the early termination of leases in cleveland  ohio and santa fe  new mexico  with payment obligations to terminate in the second and fourth quarters of fiscal  respectively 
the settlement amounts were less than previously estimated and accrued  and  was reversed to income 
offsetting this income  we recorded a charge of  for the difference between the terms of a new signed sublease for a closed location in hartford  connecticut  and the terms of a prior sublease for the same location under which the prior subtenant had defaulted 
based on these changes in facts and circumstances and the related changes in estimates  we adjusted or reversed the remaining lease related liabilities previously recorded for these locations and recognized net restructuring income of  during the first quarter of fiscal a summary of restructuring activity by store count is as follows restructuring store count period fiscal year ending ending march  stores remaining at commencement of period stores identified in fiscal for closure or sale stores identified in fiscal for closure or sale stores identified in fiscal for closure  relocation or conversion support facilities identified in fiscal for closure relocation identified stores closed or abandoned identified stores sold identified support facilities closed reversal of stores identified for closure or sale identified stores and support facilities remaining at period end as of december   four of the stores identified in fiscal for closure or sale were closed or abandoned and the remaining two stores were removed from our closure or sale list due to changes in facts and circumstances 
of those stores identified in fiscal  all have been sold or closed as of december  of the five stores and four support facilities identified in fiscal for closure  relocation  sale  or conversion  one has been relocated as of december   one was sold in january   four were closed in the first quarter of  two will be closed or relocated during fiscal  and the one store remaining will be closed in fiscal management will decide to close or relocate stores in circumstances where the existing store is under performing and or a more desirable location in the same market becomes available 
warehouses and support facilities will be closed  consolidated  or relocated when opportunities arise to reduce overall costs of operations in these facilities  and therefore improve gross profit margins and overall cash flows 
we anticipate that we will close up to five additional stores and three warehouses in  all but one of which will be closed upon the expiration of their respective lease terms 
two of the five anticipated store closures involve relocations to other sites 
as of the date of this report  we have consolidated the operation of two warehouse facilities into our new riverside  california distribution center 
in the first half of  we plan to close the third warehouse facility as a part of the consolidation 
we expect the closure and or relocation of these stores and warehouses to ultimately result in improved store contributions and cash flows for the company in the long term 
the short term cash flow effects of these closures and or relocations usually involve some severance costs which  for these closures  we expect to be minimal as we anticipate that a majority of the employees will accept positions at relocated stores and warehouses or other positions within the company 
costs for removal of furniture  fixtures  and inventory for these closures are expected to be minimal 
the expected non cash impact on operating results in due to accelerated depreciation of assets in stores and facilities targeted for closure is expected to be approximately million

see notes to consolidated financial statements note restructuring and asset impairment charges for details of the significant components of the expense income 
interest income 
interest income for the fiscal year ended december   remained relatively constant as compared to fiscal interest income for the fiscal year ended december   decreased as compared to fiscal the decrease was attributable to lower interest rates and reduced levels of invested cash 
interest expense 
interest expense for the fiscal year ended december   decreased as compared to fiscal  due to an overall decrease in borrowings under our new credit facility  a substantial decrease in our overall borrowing rate under the new credit facility and the expiration in august of an interest rate swap agreement required by our prior credit facility 
under our second amended and restated credit facility  effective february   interest rates decreased from libor plus the rate under our prior credit facility through february  to libor plus 
we project that interest expense will decrease substantially in fiscal over fiscal  as a result of the reduction in overall borrowings and the decrease in interest rates resulting from our new credit facility 
interest expense for the fiscal year ended december   decreased as compared to fiscal  due to higher average borrowings in fiscal and higher swap related interest rates on the term portion of the credit facility in fiscal income tax expense benefit 
the effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended december  was as compared to for fiscal and for fiscal the effective tax rate in was higher relative to and due to the fact that in  the rate was adversely impacted by our inability to utilize foreign tax credits due to net operating losses 
in addition  the write off of certain deferred tax assets having no future taxable benefit negatively impacted the effective tax rate for by percentage points 
as of december   we had a net deferred tax asset of million 
the realization of the net deferred tax asset is not assured 
we believe it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient taxable income in the future to realize the full amount of the deferred tax asset  except for certain state net operating loss carry forwards which we believe will not result in a future realizable tax benefit based upon projected taxable income in those states during the carry forward period 
our assessment of the portion of the deferred tax asset we believe to be realizable is based on projections that assume that we can maintain our current store contribution margin 
furthermore  we expect to maintain the sales growth experienced over the past five years that would generate additional taxable income 
uncertainty related to the realization of the deferred tax asset is attributable to the aforementioned risks to our ability to achieve our four year business plan and generate future taxable income to realize the full amount of the deferred tax asset 
we believe that the sales  gross margin  store contribution margin  and selling  general and administrative expenses assumptions in our four year business plan are reasonable and  more likely than not  attainable 
we will continue to assess the recoverability of the net deferred tax asset and to the extent it is determined in the future that an adjustment to the valuation allowance is required  it will be recognized as a charge to earnings at that time 
for the fiscal year ended december   we recorded a million income tax expense 
for the fiscal year ended december   we recorded a million income tax benefit  primarily as a result of the loss before taxes of million during the period 
net income 
in fiscal  we generated net income of million  or per diluted share  compared with net income of million or per diluted shares in supply chain issues were a primary contributor to our decline in net income in the second half of we are currently in the process of transitioning our primary distribution business to unfi 
commencing in the first quarter of fiscal  we began the process of transitioning our perishables distribuition in the western region of the country to our new  state of the art distribution center 
as part of that transistion  we consolidated two older distribution facilities into the new perishables distribution center  and anticipate the consolidation of a third warehouse facility in the first half of fiscal in southern california 
disruptions in the transitions mentioned above may impact net income 
both the distributor and warehouse transitions will be completed by the end of the first half of fiscal net income in fiscal was million  or per diluted share  as compared to a net loss in fiscal of million  or per diluted share 
net income in fiscal benefited from decreases in direct store expenses and interest expense 
in fiscal  net income was negatively impacted by the recordation of a million restructuring and asset impairment charge in the second quarter resulting from a comprehensive review conducted by our new chief executive officer of the business and strategic repositioning efforts of the company 
net income for fiscal also was negatively impacted by substantial increases in selling  general and administrative expenses incurred for consulting and professional fees resulting from a comprehensive review of our business and strategic position  severance costs for senior executives and other costs and fees  including advertising and marketing expenses related to the implementation of a major marketing initiative 
see notes to consolidated financial statements note restructuring and asset impairment charges for details of the significant components of the charge 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements to disclose 
liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of capital have been cash flow from operations which includes trade payables  bank indebtedness  and the sale of equity securities 
primary uses of cash have been the financing of new store development  new store openings  relocations  remodels  replacement capital expenditures and acquisitions and repayment of debt 
net cash provided by operating activities was million during fiscal as compared to million during fiscal increases in cash from operating activities during this period were attributable to overall improvements in working capital levels primarily due in large part to inventory reductions in our existing store base exclusive of new store inventory 
accounts payable balances as of december  increased to million from million as of december  this increase was primarily attributable to an increase in construction related payables at the end of  longer average vendor payment terms  and increased sales volume in the fourth quarter of additional paid time off benefits offered to employees starting in  as well as a normal increase in workers compensation self insurance reserves resulted in an overall increase in accrued liabilities of million as of the fiscal year ended as compared to fiscal year ended net cash used in investing activities was million during fiscal as compared to million during fiscal the increase is due to an increase in capital expenditures for eight new stores constructed in fiscal net cash used in financing activities was million during fiscal as compared to net cash provided of million during fiscal the change reflects the net proceeds from an equity offering completed in fiscal  net of reductions in our outstanding balance on our credit facility 
we have a net deferred tax asset of million on our balance sheet  primarily as a result of the million of restructuring and asset impairment charges recorded during fiscal the net deferred tax asset will reduce cash required for payment of federal and state income taxes  as we believe we will generate sufficient taxable income for realization of the asset in the future 
the following is a summary of our lease and debt obligations  construction commitments and outstanding letters of credit as of december  summary of obligations and commercial commitments in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years after years contractual obligations long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases construction commitments total contractual cash obligations amount of commitment expiration per period total less than year years years after years other commercial commitments letters of credit total commercial commitments refinancing and expansion of credit facility 
in february of  we completed the refinancing of our credit facility with wells fargo bank na  our former administrative agent  again acting as lead bank and administrative agent 
our new facility initially had a million limit  which was increased to million in december with the addition of one new bank to the lending group  and has a three year term with a one year renewal option 
management believes this facility is adequate for our borrowing needs 
under the new facility  we have the option to increase the total facility to million through the addition of new lenders and through the agreement of the current lending group to increase their total commitments 
as part of the new facility  we have given our lenders collateral in the form of cash  equipment and fixtures  inventory and other assets 
we have also granted leasehold mortgages in those leasehold interests previously mortgaged to secure our former credit facility  although we have no obligation to provide an interest in any new leaseholds 
the new facility contains limitations on capital expenditures and the signing of new leases  although we believe such limitations will not restrict our previously announced growth plans of to stores in fiscal and to stores in fiscal the interest rate on the facility is currently either prime plus or one month libor plus  at our election  and the rates modify depending on the ratio of average total funded debt  as defined under the credit facility  plus six times rent expense  to ebitdar for the four fiscal quarter periods then ended  as calculated on our quarterly compliance certificate 
additionally  we are charged a commitment fee on the unused portion of the line ranging from to based on performance objectives as defined in the credit agreement 
we believe that cash generated from operations and available under our credit facility will be sufficient to meet our capital expenditure requirements for the next several years 
we anticipate that we will continue to comply with the monthly and quarterly financial covenants in the credit agreement 
in the event that business conditions worsen  management has identified contingency actions to enable us to remain in compliance with the financial covenants 
even if we remain in compliance with our monetary covenants  a technical default could result due to a breach of the financial covenants 
in the absence of a waiver or amendment to such financial covenants  such non compliance would constitute a default under the credit agreement  and the lenders would be entitled to accelerate the maturity of the indebtedness outstanding thereunder 
in the event that such non compliance appears likely  or occurs  we will seek approval  as we have in the past  from the lenders to renegotiate financial covenants and or obtain waivers  as required 
however  there can be no assurance that future amendments or waivers will be obtained 
in accordance with the requirements of our former credit facility and our interest rate risk management strategy  in september we entered into a swap agreement to hedge the interest rate on million of its borrowings 
the swap agreement locks in a one month libor rate of and expired in august under our new facility  we are not obligated to enter into any such rate contracts  however  we may choose to do so if we believe such to be appropriate and in line with our risk management strategy 
capital expenditures 
we spent approximately million during fiscal for new store construction  development  remodels and other capital expenditures 
our average capital expenditures to open a leased store  including leasehold improvements  equipment and fixtures  have ranged from approximately million to million historically  excluding inventory costs and initial operating losses 
in fiscal  we expect to spend between and million in capital expenditures to construct new stores and complete significant remodels on four additional stores 
as part of our reexamination of our operating strategies  we anticipate that the average capital expenditures to open a natural foods supermarket format store will be million to million in the future  however  our ability to negotiate turnkey leases in the future will result in a substantially lower capital expenditure per store  in return for a slightly higher rent rate over the lease term 
our average capital expenditures to open a farmers market format store are estimated at million to million in the future 
delays in opening new stores may result in increased capital expenditures and increased pre opening costs for the site  as well as lower than planned sales for the company 
the cost of initial inventory for a new store is approximately  to  depending on the store format  however  we obtain vendor financing for most of this cost 
pre opening costs for natural foods supermarket format stores in the future are projected to be  to  per store  and pre opening costs for farmers market format stores are projected to be  to  as a result of increased advertising and travel expenses for new stores 
all pre opening costs are expensed as incurred 
the amounts and timing of such pre opening costs will depend upon the availability of new store sites and other factors  including the location of the store and whether it is in a new or existing market for us  the size of the store  and the required build out at the site 
costs to acquire future stores  if any  are impossible to predict and could vary materially from the cost to open new stores 
there can be no assurance that actual capital expenditures will not exceed anticipated levels  although our amended credit facility contains aggregate limits on the amounts of capital expenditures we may make 
we believe that cash generated from operations and available under our existing credit facility will be sufficient to satisfy our budgeted cash requirements through fiscal we believe that cash generated from operations and available borrowings under our existing credit facility will be sufficient to satisfy our capital needs to execute our store growth plans over the next three years 
in the past  we have primarily used cash flows generated from operations  improvements in working capital and equity proceeds to fund store growth and have used any excess cash to reduce debt 
as our store development plan accelerates  we expect that a greater proportion of our capital will funded through borrowings on the line of credit than we have utilized in the past 
we will continually evaluate other sources of capital and will seek those considered appropriate for future acquisition or accelerated store growth opportunities

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  the company is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and the value of foreign currency 
the company employs various financial instruments to manage certain exposures when practical 
the company is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk 
the company owns and operates three natural foods supermarkets and a commissary kitchen in british columbia  canada 
the commissary supports the three canadian stores and does not independently generate sales revenue 
sales made from the canadian stores are made in exchange for canadian dollars 
to the extent that those revenues are repatriated to the united states  the amounts repatriated are subject to the exchange rate fluctuations between the two currencies 
the company does not hedge against this risk because of the small amounts of funds at risk 
the company s exposure to interest rate changes is primarily related to its variable rate debt issued under its credit facility 
in  the company refinanced the credit facility and reduced the total commitment available to a million revolving line of credit  with a three year term expiring february  the interest rate on the amended facility is currently either prime plus or one month libor plus  at our election  and the rates modify depending on the ratio of average total funded debt  as defined under the credit facility  plus six times rent expense  to ebitdar for the four fiscal quarter periods then ended  as calculated on our quarterly compliance certificate 
because the interest rate on the facility is variable  based upon the prime rate or libor  the company s interest expense and net income are affected by interest rate fluctuations 
if interest rates were to increase or decrease by basis points  the result  based upon the existing outstanding non hedged variable rate debt as of december   would be an annual increase or decrease of approximately  in interest expense and a corresponding decrease or increase of approximately  in the company s net income after taxes 
in september  as required by the company s former credit facility  the company entered into an interest rate swap to hedge its exposure on variable rate debt positions 
variable rates were predominantly linked to libor as determined by one month intervals 
the interest rate provided by the swap fixed one month libor at 

at december   the notional principal amount of the interest rate swap agreement was million  and expired in august there is no obligation to renew the swap under the refinanced facility 
the notional amount is the amount used for the calculation of interest payments that are exchanged over the life of the swap transaction on the amortized principal balance 
in fiscal through its expiration in august of  the loss of  net of taxes  was reclassified into earnings from other comprehensive income for this cash flow hedge
