when used in this annual report  the terms questcor  company  we  our  ours and us refer to questcor pharmaceuticals  inc and its consolidated subsidiaries 
overview we are a specialty pharmaceutical company that acquires  markets and sells brand name prescription drugs through our us direct sales force and international commercialization partners 
we focus on the treatment of central nervous system cns diseases and gastroenterological disorders  which are served by a concentrated group of physicians such as neurologists and gastroenterologists 
our strategy is to acquire pharmaceutical products that we believe have sales growth potential  are promotionally responsive to a focused and targeted sales and marketing effort  and complement our existing products 
in addition  through corporate collaborations  we intend to develop new patented intranasal formulations of medications previously approved by the food and drug administration fda 
for the year ended december   our total revenues were million 
large multinational companies dominate the us prescription pharmaceutical market 
these companies tend to focus on drugs with annual sales in excess of billion and often divest products that  as a result of consolidation or lack of strategic fit  do not meet the threshold level of sales required for continued marketing and promotion 
since our inception  we have acquired and licensed products from aventis pharmaceuticals  inc aventis  schwartz pharma ag  nastech pharmaceutical company  inc nastech and other pharmaceutical companies 
smaller drug development or biotech companies that do not have the capabilities to effectively market and sell fda approved products will also be sources of products 
in we acquired an fda approved product from nastech 
since  we have introduced products and currently market products in the united states 
we promote certain of our products through our nationwide sales and marketing force of approximately professionals  targeting high prescribing acute care and specialty physicians such as gastroenterologists and neurologists 
we contract with third parties for the manufacture of all our products as well as the warehousing and distribution of our products 
our current products are hp acthar gel acthar  an injectable drug that is approved for the treatment of certain cns disorders with an inflammatory component  including the treatment of flares associated with multiple sclerosis ms  and is also commonly used in treating patients with infantile spasm  nascobal  the only prescription nasal gel used for the treatment of various vitamin b deficiencies  ethamolin  an injectable drug used to treat enlarged weakened blood vessels at the entrance to the stomach that have recently bled  known as esophageal varices  glofil  an injectable agent that assesses how well the kidney is working by measuring glomerular filtration rate  or kidney function  and vsl  a patented probiotic marketed as a dietary supplement to promote normal gastrointestinal function 
probiotics are living organisms in food and dietary supplements  which  upon ingestion in certain numbers  improve the health of the host beyond their inherent basic nutrition 
due to minimal demand and increasing production costs  we discontinued marketing and selling inulin in september and neoflo in in june  we acquired nascobal  an fda approved nasal gel formulation of cyanocobalamin usp vitamin b  from nastech  a leading formulation science company 
we began distributing nascobal in july we are marketing nascobal for patients with ms and crohn s disease  since these patients are at 
table of contents high risk of developing severe deficiencies of vitamin b due to a compromised ability to absorb vitamin b through the gastrointestinal system 
consistent with our efforts to focus on sales and marketing  our spending on research and development activities is minimal 
we have entered into several agreements with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to further the development of certain acquired technology 
in june  we signed a definitive license agreement with fabre kramer pharmaceuticals  inc fabre kramer  whereby we granted fabre kramer exclusive worldwide rights to develop and commercialize hypnostat tm intranasal triazolam for the treatment of insomnia and panistat tm intranasal alprazolam for the treatment of panic disorders 
we have partnered with rigel pharmaceuticals  inc rigel of south san francisco  california for our antiviral drug discovery program  and partnered with dainippon pharmaceuticals co  ltd 
dainippon of osaka  japan for our antibacterial program 
we have rights to the following registered trademarks hp acthar gel  ethamolin  nascobal and glofil we also have the following unregistered trademarks migrastat tm  emitasol tm  hypnostat tm and panistat tm 
vsl is owned by vsl pharmaceuticals  inc pramidin is owned by sirton pharmaceuticals spa sirton 
emitasol is approved in italy as pramidin and has been marketed in the past by sirton 
each other trademark  trade name or service mark appearing in this document belongs to its respective holder 
questcor is the surviving corporation of a merger between cypros pharmaceutical corporation and ribogene  inc ribogene 
the merger was completed on november  our principal office is located at whipple road  union city  california and our telephone number is our corporate internet address is www

we do not intend for the information contained on our website to be part of this annual report 
strategy we believe that our ability to market and acquire brand name products and our ability to increase our sales and improve our marketing infrastructure uniquely positions us to continue to grow 
the key elements of our strategy include increase sales of products through targeted promotion 
we seek to increase sales by promoting certain of our products to high prescribing specialty physicians through our nationwide sales and marketing organization that includes approximately professionals 
our current target audience for nascobal are gastroenterologists  bariatric surgeons and neurologists  and neurologists for acthar 
product usage and recommendations by these specialists generally influence usage by primary care physicians 
identify and license or acquire brand name prescription products 
we seek to acquire the rights to brand name pharmaceutical products that we believe will i benefit from increased marketing efforts directed at high prescribing specialty physicians  ii leverage our existing sales infrastructure  and iii complement our existing products 
since our inception  we have acquired or licensed seven products 
products to be considered for acquisition would have to be complementary to our existing products  synergistic with promotional efforts currently being undertaken by our sales force  and contribute to our gross margin 
there is no assurance we will be able to acquire such products or  if acquired  that they will produce attractive gross margins 
we intend to purchase products with cash generated from operations  if any  or from capital raised through the sale of equity on terms acceptable to us 
acquire companies that sell products that complement our current products and sales strategy 
we regularly review opportunities to acquire companies that sell products that complement the current products that we sell and target the physicians to whom we promote our products 
we intend to acquire companies using our common stock  if such stock is at acceptable levels  or cash generated from operations  if any  or from capital raised through the sale of equity on terms acceptable to us 

table of contents marketed pharmaceutical and related healthcare products our marketed products as of december  include acthar  which we acquired in july  nascobal  which we acquired in june  ethamolin  which we acquired in november  glofil  which we acquired in august  and vsl  which we acquired the rights to market and sell pursuant to a promotion agreement effective january acthar 
hp acthar gel acthar is a natural source  highly purified preparation of the adrenal corticotropin hormone acth 
unlike acth  acthar is specially formulated to provide prolonged release after intramuscular or subcutaneous injection 
it works by stimulating the adrenal cortex to secrete the natural endogenous corticosteroids  including cortisol  corticosterone  aldosterone  and a number of weakly androgenic substances 
in july  we signed an agreement with aventis to acquire the worldwide rights to acthar 
due to limited distribution of acthar prior to our acquisition of the product from aventis  drug wholesalers did not have access to acthar 
we began shipping acthar to drug wholesalers at the end of the third quarter of as part of our agreement with aventis  aventis agreed to manufacture and supply acthar for us through july at a fixed price per vial 
aventis produced their final batch of acthar for us in july which had a january expiration date 
under our agreement with aventis  we purchased the active pharmaceutical ingredient the api and other inventory residing at aventis 
we produced our first batch of finished acthar vials using the api from aventis at our contract manufacturer  chesapeake biological laboratories  inc  and commenced shipment of finished product during we have also made plans to produce our first batch of the api at our new contract manufacturer during and we expect to use the api for the production of finished vials for commercial use during based on internal sales forecasts  our existing inventory of the api  previously manufactured for us by aventis  should be adequate to supply the annual demand for acthar through however  there can be no assurance that the existing inventory of the api will be sufficient to meet our demand through or that our third party manufacturers will be able to supply acthar 
additionally  under our prior arrangement  aventis supplied acthar at a fixed price per vial through july the transfer of manufacturing from aventis to new third party manufacturers will likely result in higher unit costs  which would result in a decrease of our gross margins on sales of acthar 
acthar gross margins were for the year ended december  acthar is used in a wide variety of conditions  including the treatment of infantile spasm is  periodic flare associated with ms  and various forms of arthritis  collectively called joint pain 
although the fda approved package labeling does not include is  acthar has been used to treat this condition 
we believe is is the disease with the most compelling need for acthar treatment 
is is an epileptic syndrome characterized by the triad of infantile spasm generalized seizures  hypsarrhythmia and arrest of psychomotor development at seizure onset 
we estimate that as many as  children annually experience bouts of this devastating syndrome in the us in of children with is  the spasms occur during the first year of life  typically between to months of age 
the age of first onset rarely occurs after the age of two 
patients left untreated or treated inadequately have a poor prognosis for intellectual and functional development 
about two thirds of patients are neurologically impaired prior to the onset of is  while one third are otherwise normal 
rapid and aggressive therapy to control the abnormal seizure activity appears to improve the chances that these children will develop to their fullest potential 
the market for is therapies has not changed much over the last several years 
acthar remains the treatment of choice  however  acthar s availability in the several years before our acquisition from aventis was very restricted 
as such  many physicians used synthetic steroids and even sought to obtain vigabatrin from canada  an unapproved product in the united states 
vigabatrin  an enzyme inhibitor  is marketed under the trade name sabril in canada 
a symposium on is  sponsored by the child neurology society  discussed the fact that there has been no clinical evidence to show that any therapy is better than acthar for the treatment of is 
the proceedings of that symposium have been made available to all pediatric neurologists as a continuing medical education monograph 
acthar is indicated for use in acute exacerbations of ms and is prescribed currently for patients that have ms and experience painful  episodic flares 
during  we began to promote acthar as an alternative to 
table of contents intravenous methylprednisolone  a corticosteroid  for the treatment of exacerbations of ms 
intravenous methylprednisolone is currently the treatment of choice for this indication 
the primary advantage of acthar in this setting is that it provides the patient with the freedom and convenience of intramuscular or subcutaneous administration at home  rather than the intravenous administration of methylprednisolone  without sacrificing efficacy or tolerability 
sales promotion of acthar for joint pain is not anticipated at this point 
acthar may be challenged by newer agents  such as synthetic corticosteriods  immune system suppressants known as immunosuppressants  and anti seizure medications in the case of infantile spasms and other types of anti inflammatory products for various autoimmune conditions that have inflammation as a clinical aspect of the disease 
solu medrol  the primary competitive product to acthar for the treatment of ms flare  is now available to patients after an announced shortage in nascobal 
cyanocobalamin is one of the b cobalamin class of vitamins 
cyanocobalamin is the principal member of the class  and the most widely employed in medicine in the united states 
it is currently commercially available over the counter in an oral formulation and by prescription in injectable and nasal formulations 
the diets of most adult americans provide the recommended intake of vitamin b  but deficiency can still occur 
vitamin b deficiency has a number of causes  including malabsorption of vitamin b resulting from structural or functional damage to the gastrointestinal system  caused by surgery or various disease states 
vitamin b deficiency of this type has traditionally been treated with an intramuscular injection of vitamin b most individuals who develop a vitamin b deficiency resulting from structural or functional damage to the gastrointestinal system have an underlying stomach or intestinal disorder that limits the absorption of vitamin b characteristic signs of vitamin b deficiency include fatigue  weakness  nausea  constipation  flatulence gas  loss of appetite and weight loss 
deficiency also can lead to neurological changes such as numbness and tingling in the hands and feet 
additional symptoms of vitamin b deficiency are difficulty in maintaining balance  depression  confusion  poor memory and soreness of the mouth or tongue 
sometimes the only symptom of these intestinal disorders is anemia resulting from vitamin b deficiency 
dietary deficiency of vitamin b has also been seen in strict vegetarians but this type of deficiency can be treated with oral vitamin b supplements 
currently in the united states approximately million injection dosages of vitamin b are prescribed annually to address all causes of vitamin b deficiency 
although the potential market for the use of nascobal is large  we will initially focus our promotional efforts on patients who through surgery or as a result of disease cannot readily absorb vitamin b the initial promotional efforts will focus on patients who are susceptible to a vitamin b deficiency caused by crohn s disease  gastric bypass surgery or multiple sclerosis 
people with crohn s disease may have difficulty absorbing vitamin b because of intestinal inflammation 
crohn s patients who have had both a primary and secondary surgical resection of their small bowel may develop vitamin b deficiency 
vitamin b deficiency can also predate surgery in crohn s patients 
a study in patients with crohn s disease found that up to of those who had not had surgery showed signs of vitamin b deficiency  probably due to the malabsorption caused by the disease itself 
surgical procedures of the gastrointestinal tract  such as surgery to remove all or part of the stomach  often result in a loss of cells that secrete stomach acid and intrinsic factor  a substance normally present in the stomach 
surgical removal of the distal ileum  a section of the intestines  also can result in the inability to absorb vitamin b individuals who have had either of these surgeries usually require lifelong supplemental vitamin b to prevent a deficiency 
in the us alone there are approximately  crohn s patients  of which approximately  are candidates for vitamin b therapy 
gastric bypass surgery is a surgical procedure performed on morbidly obese patients 
obesity is a major health problem in the united states and it is estimated that over million americans are classified as morbidly obese 
to assist with weight loss  bariatric surgeons perform a variety of surgical procedures on the stomach and intestines designed to restrict or limit the intake of food 
as a result of these procedures  the absorption of vitamin b through diet is extremely limited 
in fact  approximately of patients two years 
table of contents after surgery had significant vitamin and mineral deficiency 
in  it is estimated that  gastric bypass surgeries were performed and the number of procedures is expected to increase to  in a study of multiple sclerosis ms patients found that over had abnormally low serum vitamin b levels 
cerebral spinal fluid levels of vitamin b were also reduced in patients with ms 
it is speculated that vitamin b associated transmethylation may be an important component in the demyelination that is characteristic of ms 
over  people in the us have ms 
vitamin b deficiency may also result from a variety of disease states 
it is estimated that of the us population approximately  people will develop pernicious anemia in their lifetime 
pernicious anemia is a rare blood disorder characterized by the inability of the body to properly utilize vitamin b pernicious anemia occurs when there is an absence of intrinsic factor  a substance normally present in the stomach 
vitamin b deficiency is found in up to of patients over years old 
another study suggests that approximately half of americans over can not absorb the vitamin b contained in their food 
among the estimated  hiv and aids patients in the us  to or approximately  people are vitamin b deficient 
current maintenance treatment for vitamin b deficiency calls for injections of vitamin b once per month for life 
this chronic need for vitamin b replacement therapy often requires frequent trips to a health care professional s office or visits by a home health care professional to receive injections 
nascobal gel is the only intranasal vitamin b available  and is the only non injectable prescription vitamin b therapy 
it is administered once a week which can enhance compliance and provide more consistent blood levels than monthly injections of vitamin b nascobal is covered by most major pharmaceutical benefit programs 
in september  the fda approved our request to have nascobal labeled for first line use for all vitamin b deficiencies except pernicious anemia 
previously  the approved nascobal labeling required the initial stabilization of vitamin b levels with injectable vitamin b before switching to nascobal 
as part of our acquisition of nascobal  we also acquired the rights to nascobal nasal spray  a new dosage form  for which a new drug application was filed by nastech with the fda in december nascobal competes in the market for vitamin b replacement therapy 
this market on a unit basis is dominated by inexpensive generic vitamin b injections 
the vitamin b injection requires the additional expense of a doctor s office visit once a month 
some patients may also receive over the counter vitamin b tablets or sublingual formulations of vitamin b  however  the effectiveness of tablets and sublingual formulation is questionable in the patients for whom nascobal is marketed 
ethamolin 
end stage liver disease  also known as hepatic cirrhosis  results in approximately  deaths annually in the united states 
hepatic cirrhosis promotes the formation of enlarged weakened blood vessels at the entrance to the stomach that have recently bled  known as esophageal varices  through development of portal hypertension 
when portal venous blood pressure rises  the varicosities that develop may cause life threatening upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage and are associated with a high mortality rate 
at least  patients in the united states have either actively bleeding esophageal varices or esophageal varices that are at imminent risk of bleeding 
early and effective treatment of esophageal varices to achieve hemostasis is essential to a favorable outcome in a bleeding patient 
the most common pharmaceutical treatment protocol involves the injection of a sclerosing agent into the varix  achieving clot formation and obliteration of the varix 
sclerotherapy agents are chemicals that are injected into varicose veins that damage and scar the inside of the vein  causing it to close 
this form of hemostasis is called sclerotherapy and usually requires multiple treatment sessions 
ethamolin is the only sclerotherapy agent approved by the fda for the treatment of esophageal varices that have recently bled 
however  there is strong competition from band ligation  a form of surgery  that is becoming the treatment of choice for this emergent clinical condition 
at the present time  we are not actively promoting ethamolin 

table of contents several companies may offer less expensive sclerotherapy agents that compete with ethamolin 
however  ethamolin is the only product which is fda approved for treating esophageal varices 
other competitive agents include scleromate tm an injectable agent used to treat varicose veins and spider veins  rubber band ligation methods procedures in which bleeding esophageal varices are tied off at their base with rubber bands  cutting off the blood flow such as the multi band superview manufactured by boston scientific  the multi band six shooter manufactured by wilson cook  and the multi band ligator manufactured by bard 
other products may reduce the number of bleeding esophageal varices by lowering portal hypertension  such as sandostatin manufactured by novartis 
the competition to market fda approved active bleeding esophageal varices therapies is intense 
glofil glofil is approved by the fda for measuring glomerular filtration rate gfr  a measurement of kidney function 
nephrology  transplant  oncology and nuclear medicine departments at major medical centers are the primary users of glofil glofil is an injectable radioisotope diagnostic agent  which provides rapid information on gfr with great accuracy 
radioisotopes have very short half lives and require special handling 
present diagnostic procedures for measuring kidney function include serum creatinine and creatinine clearance tests 
these two tests are the most commonly performed methods of measuring kidney function because of their low cost 
however  both methods may significantly overestimate kidney function in the estimated  patients with severe renal disease 
the utility of glofil has been established in published clinical studies as being a more direct and accurate measure of kidney function yielding much more reliable results than serum creatinine or creatinine clearance tests 
this improved accuracy can be essential in monitoring disease progression  implementing appropriate interventions and assessing the degree of success of kidney grafts  post transplant 
however  most early stage patients are not deemed to require this degree of accuracy in the determination of renal function 
due to its high degree of accuracy  glofil has also been used in clinical trials administered by the national institutes of health 
use of glofil in clinical trials can provide the trial administrators with an accurate measure of kidney function and illustrate the effects of the drug being studied on normal kidney function 
the biggest impediment to future growth in the sales of glofil is the current lack of availability of the test to practicing clinicians 
the main reason for this is because routine testing with glofil requires dedicated laboratory facilities and trained technicians 
due to the lack of strategic fit  as well as the acquisition and growth potential of nascobal  the promotional efforts on glofil will be limited to supporting existing users 
there are numerous products that may be viewed as competitors to glofil these include intrinsic tests  such as serum creatinine tests and creatinine clearance tests  both of which are used to measure how quickly the kidneys are able to clear creatinine  an endogenously produced chemical from the blood 
extrinsic tests use such products as tc dtpa  manufactured by mallinckrodt  inc  omnipaque an injectable contrast media agent  manufactured by sanofi  a division of sanofi synthelabo  and conray iothalamate meglumine another injectable contrast medium  manufactured by mallinckrodt  inc there is intense competition among both fda and non fda approved products to measure kidney function 
vsl we acquired us promotion rights from vsl pharmaceuticals  inc for vsl under an agreement effective january vsl is a patented over the counter probiotic preparation of eight live freeze dried lactic acid bacterial species 
probiotics are living organisms in foods and dietary supplements  which  upon ingestion in certain numbers  improve the health of the host beyond their inherent basic nutrition 
we formally launched vsl to the market as a dietary supplement to promote normal gastrointestinal gi function at the annual digestive disease week meeting in may we believe the emerging role for probiotics in the management of patients with inflammatory bowel disease ibd offers an attractive market opportunity for vsl which at the same time effectively complements our current promotion of nascobal to this same group of gastroenterologists 
ibd is one of the most common chronic gastrointestinal illnesses and consists mainly of two conditions ulcerative colitis and crohn s disease 
it is estimated that almost one million americans have ibd  with roughly due to ulcerative colitis and due to crohn s disease 
about to of ulcerative colitis patients eventually 
table of contents must have their colon removed because of massive bleeding  severe illness  rupture of the colon  or risk of cancer 
a number of surgeries may be performed for ulcerative colitis 
one such procedure  which is becoming increasingly common for ulcerative colitis  is ileal pouch anal anastomosis surgery 
this operation allows the patient to have relatively normal bowel movements because it preserves part of the rectum 
a major long term complication that occurs as a result of this surgery is pouchitis 
pouchitis is the non specific inflammation of the ileal reservoir that appears to be associated with bacterial overgrowth and dysbiosis 
published clinical trials have reported that vsl is effective in maintaining remission of pouchitis and in preventing pouchitis 
vsl has received orphan drug designation from the office of orphan products development at the fda for two indications the treatment of active chronic pouchitis  and the prevention of disease relapse in patients with chronic pouchitis 
orphan drug designation applies to diseases and disease states with a prevalence of less than  patients in the united states 
orphan drug designation confers certain protection such as market exclusivity for seven years once the product has been approved 
for vsl pharmaceuticals  inc and us to take advantage of this designation  vsl would have to be approved as a new biological prescription product by the fda 
we do not control the clinical or product development strategy for vsl there can be no assurance that vsl will ever be approved as a new biological product by the fda or that it will ever enjoy the benefits of this orphan drug designation 
effective january   vsl pharmaceuticals  inc assigned the promotion agreement for vsl to sigma tau pharmaceuticals  inc and its affiliates sigma tau 
sigma tau entered into a promotion agreement with inkine pharmaceutical company  inc inkine 
under the terms of the agreement  sigma tau will pay to inkine a fixed fee to promote vsl to gastroenterologists as a second detail 
in the short term  we could benefit from this increased promotion effort in that we are responsible for taking orders and shipping vsl directly to customers 
as such  we recognize the revenues for the sales of vsl in the united states regardless of which company promotes the product 
we are currently in discussion with sigma tau about an extension or renewal of the promotion agreement 
there is no assurance that our promotion agreement will be renewed  or if it is renewed  that the terms of the agreement will not be substantially different than the current terms of the agreement 
if the agreement is not renewed  we will not recognize any revenue from vsl sales once the agreement expires in january virtually any number of manufacturers of probiotics may be considered competitors to vsl among the most notable are culturelle tm by conagra and probiotica by johnson johnson 
inulin 
due to minimal demand  increasing production costs and lack of strategic fit  we discontinued marketing and selling inulin in september in december we sold the nda for inulin 
drug development our development stage products include the intranasal drugs emitasol  hypnostat and panistat 
intranasal drugs emitasol through our merger with ribogene  we acquired emitasol  an intranasal form of metoclopramide 
metoclopramide is an approved antiemetic and is available in both oral and intravenous forms to treat diabetic gastroparesis and to prevent acute chemotherapy induced emesis 
we  through future strategic partners  may also choose to investigate emitasol for the treatment of diabetic gastroparesis and delayed onset emesis nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy 
emitasol was being developed and marketed in certain countries throughout the world through corporate partners 
it is approved in italy as pramidin  and during was distributed by sirton under our existing license agreement in italy for the treatment of a variety of gastrointestinal disorders and emesis 
for the year ended december   sirton distributed approximately  units of pramidin in italy 
this agreement expired in accordance with terms in june we entered into a marketing agreement in december with ahn gook pharmaceuticals ahn gook  for intranasal metoclopramide  to be marketed under the trade name emitasol  in korea 
ahn gook also signed an agreement with sirton to obtain the intranasal 
table of contents metoclopramide finished product 
emitasol has been approved in korea  and is distributed by ahn gook in korea for the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders and emesis  on a hospital by hospital basis 
in the united states  emitasol could be proposed as a method to control diabetic gastroparesis and to prevent delayed onset emesis associated with cancer chemotherapy 
prior to  there were no drugs specifically approved to treat delayed onset emesis 
however  on march   the fda approved merck s emend aprepitant with ht antagonist for various indications  including delayed onset emesis 
on july   the fda also approved mgi pharma s aloxi palonsetron hydrochloride for the prevention of acute nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy and the prevention of delayed nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy 
given these recent approvals  our potential to develop emitasol for delayed onset emesis has diminished 
we will continue to partner or to seek funding for the development of emitasol on a limited basis 
if we are not successful in finding a development partner or in obtaining funding for the development of emitasol  we plan to abandon our emitasol project 
hypnostat and panistat through our merger with ribogene  we acquired hypnostat  an intranasal form of triazolam for the treatment of insomnia  and panistat  an intranasal alprazolam for the treatment of panic disorders 
in june  we signed a definitive license agreement with fabre kramer  whereby we granted fabre kramer exclusive worldwide rights to develop and commercialize hypnostat and panistat 
immediately after the license agreement was signed  we received a cash payment of  for the transfer of all technology related to the products 
we are entitled to future payments from fabre kramer when specific developmental milestones are met 
we received a milestone payment from fabre kramer of  in the first quarter of fiscal year  which we recognized as revenue as there were no continuing obligations 
we will also receive a milestone payment upon the acceptance of a new drug application and the approval of a new drug application for hypnostat and panistat  provided fabre kramer has not entered into an agreement prior to these events 
if fabre kramer has entered into an agreement  we will share the payments received by them under the agreement 
in addition  we are entitled to a share of future worldwide product related fabre kramer revenues  based on a percentage of total revenues 
fabre kramer is developing hypnostat for the short term treatment of insomnia 
we believe that hypnostat  when given intranasally  may be effective in treating insomnia 
advantages of hypnostat as compared to alternatives may include ease of administration  an increased level of efficacy  cost effectiveness  and possibly reduced side effects 
the potential advantages of hypnostat are significant in light of the fact that thirty to forty million americans suffer from serious sleep disorders which are often untreated or inadequately treated 
continued sleep impairment may cause severe health effects 
oral triazolam halcion has been one of the most successful and most prescribed sleep inducing agents in the world  with over billion prescriptions filled 
oral triazolam is considered safer in terms of overdose  drug interactions  and addictive potential as compared to barbiturates 
in addition  oral triazolam produces less morning grogginess  as compared to other benzodiazepines 
oral triazolam and other benzodiazepines are recommended for short term use in conservative doses 
zolpidem ambien and zaleplon sonata are newer hypnosedative agents that are chemically unrelated to benzodiazepines 
however  both zolpidem and zaleplon have similar pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects and do not differ with respect to efficacy  tolerability  residual effects  memory impairment  rebound insomnia  or abuse potential compared to oral triazolam 
over the counter medications containing diphenhydramine such as benadryl and sominex have been shown to increase the risk of symptoms of delirium including disorganized speech  poor attention level  and altered consciousness in the elderly 
other over the counter medications such as valerian and melatonin may be useful in alleviating mild short term insomnia  but further clinical trials are required to fully evaluate efficacy and safety 
prior clinical trials for hypnostat support that triazolam is absorbed and effective when given intranasally 
phase i trials indicated that the overall amount of triazolam which reaches the plasma is very similar whether the drug is given intranasally or orally 
given the similarity in uptake of the two dosage forms  similarity might also be expected in their clinical performance 
the expected similarity in performance is supported for the intranasal dosage form 
in a prior phase ii pilot study  hypnostat at mg was superior to oral triazolam at 
table of contents mg for time to sleep onset p  effective sleep time p  and stage two sleep time p and was equivalent to oral triazolam at mg for quality of sleep 
we therefore anticipate that intranasal triazolam may be effective for treating insomnia 
hypnostat is currently in the phase ii stage of development and fabre kramer is conducting the clinical testing 
we believe it will be several years  if ever  before hypnostat is commercially available 
fabre kramer intends to develop panistat for the management of panic disorder or the short term relief of anxiety symptoms 
we believe that panistat  when given intranasally  may be effective in treating panic disorders 
advantages of panistat as compared to alternatives may include ease of administration  an increased level of efficacy  and cost effectiveness 
the potential advantages of panistat are significant in light of the fact that anxiety disorders are the most common mental disorder in the united states  affecting approximately million people 
according to the national institute of mental health  approximately of those affected by anxiety disorders seek treatment 
generalized anxiety disorder is characterized by constant uncontrollable worry 
panic disorder is characterized by acute  spontaneous  and repeated anxiety attacks which involve an intense  terrifying  and unfocused fear in the absence of any external threat 
panic attacks typically last for approximately to minutes and may cause racing heartbeat  chest pains  difficulty breathing  choking sensations  dizziness  and numbness 
panic attacks can occur as often as several times per week or several times per day 
approximately million people in the united states suffer from panic disorder  which often progresses into chronic anxiety and agoraphobia 
early treatment can help keep a panic disorder from progressing 
benzodiazepines  including oral alprazolam xanax  have proven to be safe and effective for treating panic disorder for over years 
benzodiazepines block panic attacks during the first or second day of treatment 
surprisingly low rates of abuse of this and other medicines are reported in persons with panic disorder 
many antidepressants  including doxepin sinequan  sertraline zoloft  fluoxetine prozac  imipramine tofranil  and paroxetine hydrochloride paxil  are useful in treating panic attacks without causing physical dependence 
however  successful treatment requires full strength dosage and usually takes four to eight weeks for therapeutic effects to be observed 
in addition  antidepressants cause panic attacks to initially increase in approximately half of panic disorder sufferers 
phenelzine sulfate nardil is effective for panic disorder  but is complicated to use 
although phenelzine sulfate is safe when used by an experienced physician  it is typically reserved for cases where simpler medications have failed or cannot be used 
unsafe elevations of blood pressure for several hours can occur if one does not adhere to diet and medication restrictions 
cognitive behavioral therapy cbt teaches the patient to anticipate and prepare for situations and bodily sensations that may trigger panic attacks 
cbt generally requires at least eight to twelve weeks for the patient to learn the skills and put them into practice 
cbt requires a motivated patient and a specially trained therapist 
clinical experience suggests that for many patients with panic disorder  a combination of cbt and medication may be the best treatment 
other treatment options include relaxation  breathing techniques  hypnotherapy  and psychotherapy 
to date  no clinical work has been performed on panistat 
we believe it will be several years  if ever  before panistat is commercially available 
glial excitotoxin release inhibitors geris the geris are neuroprotective compounds that may prevent ischemic brain damage originating from astrocytes astroglial cells 
astrocytes serve important metabolic functions and are thought to be responsible for the bulk of brain swelling following stroke or injury 
the geri compounds were being funded by a small business innovation research sbir grant from the nih 
the grant was terminated on july  although we have had some preliminary discussions with potential corporate partners regarding the geri compounds  there can be no assurance that we will enter into a collaboration to fund future research on these compounds 
we do not intend to expend any additional resources on these compounds 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in licensing the geri program or that we will realize license fees or revenues from such programs 

table of contents other strategic alliances and collaborations the dainippon agreement we have an exclusive  worldwide license agreement with dainippon to use our antibacterial peptide deformylase and ppgpp degradase technology for the research  development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products 
we have retained the right to co promote  in europe and the united states  certain products resulting from the arrangement 
we will be entitled to receive potential milestone payments upon the achievement of clinical and regulatory milestones up to the amount of million in japan and million in one other major market 
the first milestone payment will occur upon the initiation of a human clinical trial using a compound included in the agreement 
we will receive a potential royalty on net sales that will range from to  depending on sales volume and territory 
dainippon has been conducting research on two specific bacterial targets  peptide deformylase and ppgpp degradase 
to date  dainippon has focused most of their efforts on the deformylase project 
their efforts on the ppgpp degradase project have ended 
several compounds have been synthesized and tested in vivo against drug resistant bacteria 
although the compounds have shown good in vivo activity  dainippon has not selected any compounds for clinical studies in animals 
there can be no assurance that dainippon will ever select any compounds for preclinical studies or if selected that these compounds will eventually be approved as drugs 
there can also be no assurance that we will ever receive any milestone payments or royalties under our agreement with dainippon 
the rigel pharmaceuticals agreement we have an exclusive agreement with rigel pharmaceuticals  inc rigel to use our antiviral technology 
under the agreement  we have assigned to rigel certain antiviral technology  including our hepatitis c virus internal ribosome entry site and nsa drug discovery technology  for the research  development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products 
we will be entitled to potential future milestone payments upon the achievement of certain clinical and regulatory milestones  including the selection of a compound developed under the agreement for submission as an investigational new drug  and royalty payments on sales 
the status of this project is on going at rigel 
there can also be no assurance that we will ever receive any milestone payments or royalties under our agreement with rigel 
licenses and distribution agreements csc pharmaceuticals handels gmbh csc 
in april  ribogene entered into an agreement with csc which was assigned to us upon our merger with ribogene 
the agreement grants csc an exclusive license to market and sell emitasol in austria  poland  the czech republic  bulgaria  russia  hungary  the slovak republic  romania  and the remaining community of independent states and eight other eastern european countries 
csc has agreed to pay us a royalty based on net sales within the countries listed above 
the agreement will expire on a country by country basis years after the first commercial sale in that country 
although we can terminate the license if csc did not obtain approval in any country contained in the agreement by april   we have not done so  since csc has filed for regulatory approval in austria  russia  hungary and the slovak republic 
in  csc received approval to market emitasol in poland and the czech republic 
csc has also filed for approval in several other countries 
as of the end of  csc has not begun to market emitasol in poland and the czech republic and has no immediate plans to do so 
it is difficult to predict when  if ever  csc will begin to market emitasol in their approved territories 
laboratorios silesia sa 
in december  we signed a license agreement with laboratorios silesia sa for marketing intranasal metoclopramide  to be marketed under the trade name emitasol  in chile 
laboratories silesia sa also signed an agreement with sirton to obtain the intranasal metoclopramide  finished product under the trade name pramidin 
this product is marketed as pramidin in italy 
we received a small up front payment and will receive royalties on net sales  if any  of emitasol in this territory 
the product was submitted for approval in chile and was rejected 
as of december  the status of this product remains uncertain 

table of contents ahn gook pharmaceutical co  ltd 
we entered into a license agreement in december and amended in december with ahn gook for marketing intranasal metoclopramide  to be marketed in korea under the trade name emitasol 
ahn gook received government approval to market emitasol in ahn gook began selling emitasol in the republic of korea in the first half of through  the sales of the product are minimal 
ahn gook intends to manufacture emitasol in korea 
we received an up front cash payment of  in and a milestone payment of  in upon transfer of technology and will earn future royalties based on actual sales in korea 
in december  we expanded the license agreement to include twelve additional countries in asia and since we have no future obligations  we recognized  in revenues related to the up front cash payment and milestone payment under the agreement 
we will receive an up front payment and additional royalties upon commercialization of emitasol in each of these new countries 
manufacturing we do not currently manufacture any of our acquired products or our products in development 
our commercial products  acthar  nascobal  ethamolin  vsl and glofil  are manufactured for us by approved contract manufacturers 
as part of our agreement with aventis to acquire acthar  aventis agreed to manufacture the finished goods from existing inventory of the active pharmaceutical ingredient the api through july aventis produced its final batch of finished acthar in july the production of acthar requires the production of the api and the production of the finished product 
the api is an extraction from porcine pituitary glands 
although the extraction process is well known by individuals within aventis  the extraction may be difficult to reproduce at a new vendor 
under our agreement with aventis  we purchased the api and other inventory residing at aventis 
based on internal sales forecasts  our existing inventory of the api  previously manufactured for us by aventis  should be adequate to supply the annual demand for acthar through we are transferring the manufacturing process of the api to a new third party manufacturer  biovectra  dcl biovectra 
we have signed an agreement with biovectra  which requires minimum production totaling million during the term of the agreement 
the agreement terminates on december  and includes two one year extension options 
the production of the first batch of api is scheduled to begin in we have contracted with a third party manufacturer  chesapeake biological laboratories  inc  for acthar finished product 
during our first batch of acthar vials were produced by chesapeake biological laboratories  inc using api from aventis and shipment to customers commenced in september the production of the api and the finished product are subject to inspection and ultimate approval by the fda 
while we have reviewed our plans and progress to date with the fda  and received a positive response  additional approvals will be required through the transfer process 
on november   we met with the fda to discuss our manufacturing transfer plan for acthar 
in connection with that meeting  the fda approved our supplemental new drug application filed on september  to extend the labeled shelf life of acthar from twelve months to months from the date of manufacture 
we released an acthar lot with month dating in the transfer of manufacturing of acthar from aventis to new third party manufacturers will result in higher unit costs 
we have experienced delays and cost overruns in the validation of the potency release assay being transferred from aventis to our new third party contract laboratory 
beginning in january  we initiated a plan designed to assist with the successful transfer of this assay 
there are no assurances that we will be successful in transferring this assay to a third party contract laboratory 
if we are unable to efficiently and timely validate the potency release assay prior to the date when aventis can no longer conduct this assay  we will not be able to release both api and finished goods and therefore we may not be able to meet the expected demand for acthar 
we anticipate that aventis will continue to conduct this assay through the end of the acthar site transfer process has numerous risks that could have a materially adverse impact on our financial results in future years 
such risks include the ability of the new independent third party contractors to produce qualified api and finished goods in sufficient quantities  on a timely basis and at an acceptable cost  that the production facilities and the processes will be approved by the fda and that the api and finished product will be similar in potency and efficacy as the aventis api and finished product historically produced 
table of contents by aventis 
although we believe we have adequate time and resources to ensure that the site transfer of acthar will occur timely and correctly with minimal impact on future revenues  there can be no assurance that the site transfer will occur timely and correctly and that the transfer will not have a materially adverse impact on the company in the future 
nascobal is manufactured by nastech under a long term supply agreement at a fixed price per unit  under which nastech will continue to manufacture nascobal at its fda approved  current good manufacturing practice cgmp manufacturing facility in hauppauge  new york 
nastech plans on transferring nascobal manufacturing in to a new facility in bothell  washington 
during  we successfully transferred the manufacturing of ethamolin from schering plough to ben venue laboratories ben venue 
we obtained full fda approval for the transfer to ben venue in september ben venue manufactures ethamolin for us on a purchase order basis 
we believe we have sufficient product on hand to cover demand through late we obtain vsl from sigma tau pharmaceuticals  inc sigma tau under our promotion agreement with them 
however  we have no experience with manufacturing vsl  and we are relying completely on sigma tau to supply us with the product 
due to our lack of experience with vsl and our reliance on sigma tau  we can provide no assurances as to the timely manufacture of this product 
our manufacturer of glofil was subject to an inspection by the fda in july as a result of this inspection  our manufacturer received notification that several items required attention in order to comply with fda regulations 
we are working with our manufacturer on addressing any outstanding issues resulting from the fda inspection 
based on the information available  we believe that the manufacture of glofil will not be affected 
there can be no assurance that any of our bulk or finished goods contract manufacturers will continue to meet our requirements for quality  quantity and timeliness or the fda s cgmp requirements 
also  there can be no assurance that we will be able to complete the production of acthar api  nor that our contract manufacturers will be able to meet all cgmp requirements  nor that lots will not have to be recalled with the attendant financial consequences to us 
our dependence upon others for the manufacture of bulk or finished forms of our products may adversely affect the future profit margin on the sale of those products and our ability to develop and deliver products on a timely and competitive basis 
we do not have substitute suppliers for any of our products although we strive to plan appropriately and maintain safety stocks of product to cover unforeseen events at manufacturing sites 
in the event we are unable to manufacture our products  either directly or indirectly through others or on commercially acceptable terms  if at all  we may not be able to commercialize our products as planned 
sales and marketing as of december   we have hired  trained and deployed a total of product specialists and marketing personnel to support the commercialization of our primary promoted products  acthar  nascobal and vsl our current strategic focus is neurology and gastroenterology 
our promotion and educational efforts of acthar are focused on pediatric neurologists and on a subset of high potential neurologists dedicated to the treatment of multiple sclerosis in adults 
we market nascobal to physicians who treat patients at high risk of developing deficiencies of vitamin b our priority targets for nascobal are gastroenterologists crohn s disease  bariatric surgeons gastric bypass surgery  and neurologists ms  dementia 
each of these physician specialists sees a high number of patients with a compromised ability to absorb vitamin b through the gastrointestinal system 
we market vsl to gastroenterologists 
we are not actively marketing ethamolin and glofil at this time 

table of contents international distribution agreements beacon pharmaceuticals  ltd 
in october we signed an agreement with beacon pharmaceuticals  ltd 
of tunbridge wells  kent  uk  for the exclusive marketing and distribution of acthar in the united kingdom on a named patient basis 
sales to beacon pharmaceuticals  ltd 
in were  idis limited in november  we signed an agreement with idis limited of sirbiton  surrey  uk for the exclusive distribution of acthar  ethamolin and nascobal on a named patient basis 
the agreement covers all countries of the world except the united states  australia and new zealand where acthar and ethamolin are sold through a distributor  uk  where acthar is sold through beacon pharmaceuticals  ltd  and israel where nascobal is sold through a distributor 
competition the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are intensely competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change 
a number of companies are pursuing the development of pharmaceuticals and products that target the same diseases and conditions that we will target 
there are products and treatments on the market that compete with acthar  nascobal  ethamolin  glofil and vsl moreover  technology controlled by third parties that may be advantageous to our business may be acquired or licensed by our competitors  which may prevent us from obtaining this technology on favorable terms  or at all 
our ability to compete will depend on our ability to acquire and commercialize pharmaceutical products that address critical medical needs  as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel  and secure sufficient capital resources for the acquisition of products 
most of our competitors are larger than us and have substantially greater financial  marketing and technical resources than we have 
in addition  many of these competitors have substantially greater experience than we do in acquiring  developing  testing and obtaining fda and other approvals of pharmaceuticals 
furthermore  if we commence commercial sales of products that are currently in the development stage  when they are approved  we will also be competing with respect to manufacturing efficiency and marketing capabilities  areas in which we have limited experience 
if any of the competitors develop new products that are superior to our products  our ability to expand into the pharmaceutical markets may be materially and adversely affected 
competition among products will be based  among other things  on product efficacy  safety  reliability  availability  price and patent position 
an important factor will be the timing of market introduction of our or our competitors products 
accordingly  the relative speed with which we can acquire products and supply commercial quantities of the products to the market is expected to be an important competitive factor 
our competitive position will also depend upon our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel and to secure sufficient capital resources for product acquisition and commercialization of products 
government regulation marketed pharmaceutical products the processes carried out in the production of pharmaceutical products by pharmaceutical firms  including manufacturers from whom we purchase products  are subject to regulation by the fda 
any restrictions or prohibitions applicable to sales of products we market could materially and adversely affect our business 
we market prescription drug products that have been approved by the fda 
the fda has the authority to revoke existing approvals if new information reveals that they are not safe or effective 
the fda also regulates the promotion  including advertisement  of prescription drugs 

table of contents drug products must be manufactured  packaged  and labeled in accordance with their approvals and in conformity with cgmp standards and other requirements 
drug manufacturing facilities must be registered with and approved by the fda and must list with the fda the drug products they intend to manufacture or distribute 
the manufacturer is subject to inspections by the fda and periodic inspections by other regulatory agencies 
the fda has extensive enforcement powers over the activities of pharmaceutical manufacturers  including authority to seize and prohibit the sale of unapproved or non complying products  and to halt manufacturing operations that are not in compliance with current cgmps 
the fda may impose criminal penalties arising from non compliance with applicable regulations 
drugs in development our products in development through our partners are subject to extensive regulation by the us  principally under the federal food  drug and cosmetic act fdca and the public health service act  and foreign governmental authorities prior to commercialization 
in particular  drugs and biological products are subject to rigorous preclinical and clinical testing and other approval requirements by the fda  state and local authorities and comparable foreign regulatory authorities 
the process for obtaining the required regulatory approvals from the fda and other regulatory authorities takes many years and is very expensive 
there can be no assurance that any product developed by us or our development partners will prove to meet all of the applicable standards to receive marketing approval in the us or abroad 
there can be no assurance that these approvals will be granted on a timely basis  if at all 
delays and costs in obtaining these approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal  state and local statutes and regulations could materially adversely affect our ability to commercialize our products and our ability to earn sales revenues 
vsl we are marketing vsl as a dietary supplement 
if approval of vsl as a biological product is pursued by sigma tau at a later date  the regulatory hurdles discussed above will apply 
the manufacturing  distribution  and sale of dietary supplements and medical foods are subject to regulation by one or more federal agencies  principally the fda and the federal trade commission the ftc 
our activities are also regulated by various governmental agencies for the states and localities in which vsl is distributed and sold 
among other matters  the fda and ftc are concerned with product safety and claims that refer to a product s ability to provide dietary support for health related conditions 
the regulation of dietary supplements is principally governed by the dietary supplement health and education act dshea  which was enacted in  amending the fdca 
dshea establishes a statutory class of dietary supplements  which includes vitamins  minerals  herbs  amino acids and other dietary ingredients for human use to supplement the diet 
dietary ingredients that were not on the market as of october  require the submission by the manufacturer or distributor to the fda of evidence of a history of use or other evidence of safety establishing that the ingredient will reasonably be expected to be safe 
among other things  dshea prevents the further regulation of dietary ingredients as food additives and allows the use of statements of nutritional support on product labels 
the fda has issued proposed and final regulations in this area and indicates that further guidance and regulations are forthcoming 
in november  the ftc bureau of consumer protection announced its new advertising guidelines for the dietary supplement industry  which it labeled dietary supplements an advertising guide for industry 
these guidelines reiterate many of the policies the ftc has announced over the years  including requirements for substantiation of claims made in advertising about dietary supplements 
the fda has announced its intent to issue cgmp regulations for the dietary supplement industry 
the fda has published an advance notice of proposed rulemaking  and on march  published proposed regulations 
this rule is not yet final 
the comment period on the proposed cgmp regulations federal register docket no 
n was extended from june  to august  comments have been received by the fda and the regulation is in revision 
we are evaluating the proposed cgmp regulations and will assess the impact of the final cgmp rules on our operations 

table of contents patents and proprietary rights our success may depend in part upon our ability to maintain confidentiality  operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of third parties  and obtain patent protection for our products 
we have obtained patent coverage  either directly or through licenses from third parties  for nascobal and some of our products in development or marketed overseas 
we currently own or have licensed a total of thirty four issued us and foreign patents covering all formulations of nascobal  eighteen issued us and foreign patents covering hypnostat  six issued us and foreign patents covering emitasol  and nine issued us and foreign patents covering our other technology 
we also hold the right to a patent application for a new and improved spray formulation of nascobal 
however  we may not be renewing our foreign patents relating to nascobal  since nascobal is only approved in sweden and our current plans do not include seeking approval in additional foreign countries 
we acquired intellectual property associated with our intranasal program  including emitasol for diabetic gastroparesis and delayed onset emesis associated with chemotherapy  migrastat intranasal propranolol for migraine treatment  and intranasal benzodiazepines such as hypnostat and panistat for various conditions such as anxiety  seizures  panic attacks and sleep disorders 
we have licensed rights to intranasal metoclopramide in italy  chile  south korea  austria  the russian federation  asia excluding japan and certain former eastern european countries 
the former italian licensee  sirton  received approval to market intranasal metoclopramide pramidin in italy 
the agreement with sirton expired according to terms in june there can be no assurance that the foreign licensees will obtain the necessary regulatory approvals to market emitasol  or that  in the event such approvals are obtained  emitasol will achieve market acceptance in such countries  or that we will ever realize royalties on sales of emitasol in such countries 
we have also filed several other patent applications in the us and abroad on our various products and expect to file additional applications in the future 
employees at december   we had full time employees as compared to full time employees at december  
our success will depend in large part on our ability to attract and retain key employees 
at december   we had employees engaged directly in the marketing and selling of our on market products 
we believe that our relationship with our employees is good 
none of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement  nor have we experienced work stoppages

table of contents risk factors we have a history of operating losses and may never generate sufficient revenue to achieve profitability 
we have a history of recurring operating losses 
our accumulated deficit through december  is million  of which million represented the net loss applicable to common stockholders for the twelve months ended december   million represented the net loss for the year ended december   and million represented the net loss for the year ended december  operating losses are expected to continue at least through the end of to date  our revenues have been generated principally from sales of acthar  nascobal  ethamolin  glofil  inulin and vsl in july  we began selling nascobal  a product that we acquired in june we discontinued selling inulin in september we do not expect emitasol  hypnostat or panistat to be commercially available for a number of years  if at all 
our ability to achieve a consistent  profitable level of operations will be dependent in large part upon our ability to increase sales of current products  finance and acquire additional marketed products  finance the future growth of our sales marketing and customer service organization  finance operations with external capital until consistent positive cash flows are achieved  properly and timely complete the transfer of the manufacturing of acthar api to the new contract manufacturer and the transfer of the release assay to a third party laboratory including receiving the appropriate approvals from the fda and other regulatory authorities  continue to receive products from our sole source contract manufacturers on a timely basis and at acceptable costs  continue to control our operating expenses  and ensure customers compliance with our sales and exchange policies 
if we are unable to generate sufficient revenues from the sale of our products  or if we are unable to contain costs and expenses  we may not achieve profitability and may ultimately be unable to fund our operations 
if our revenues from product sales decline or fail to grow  we may not have sufficient revenues to fund our operations 
we rely heavily on sales of acthar and nascobal 
acthar revenues comprised  and of our total net product revenues for the years ended december   and sales of acthar began in september  respectively 
nascobal sales comprised of net product revenues for the year ended december  sales of nascobal began in july  while promotion began in october 
we anticipate that as a percentage of our total sales  nascobal will increase and acthar will decrease 
we review external data sources to estimate customer demand for our products 
in the event that demand for our products is less than our sales to wholesalers  excess inventory may result at the wholesaler level  which may impact future product sales 
if the supply of acthar or nascobal available at the wholesale level exceeds the future demand  our future revenues from the sales of acthar or nascobal may be affected adversely 
we monitor the amount of acthar and nascobal at the wholesale level as well as prescription data obtained from third party sources to help assess product demand in we expect that acthar and nascobal will continue to constitute a significant portion of our revenues in although our goal is to actively promote acthar and nascobal  and we have no reason to believe that our promotion of acthar and nascobal will not be successful  we cannot predict whether the demand for acthar and nascobal will continue in the future or that we will continue to generate significant revenues from sales of acthar and nascobal 
we may choose  in the future  to reallocate our sales and promotion efforts for acthar and nascobal which may 
table of contents result in a decrease in revenues from one or both of the products 
if the demand for acthar or nascobal declines  or if we are forced to reduce the prices  or if exchanges of expired products are higher than anticipated  or if we are forced to re negotiate contracts or terms  or if our customers do not comply with our existing policies  our revenues from the sale of acthar or nascobal would decline 
if the cost to produce acthar increases  and we are unable to raise the price correspondingly  our gross margins on the sale of acthar would decline 
if our revenues from the sale of acthar or nascobal decline or fail to grow  our total revenues  gross margins and operating results would be harmed and we may not have sufficient revenues to fund our operations 
effective january   vsl pharmaceuticals  inc assigned the vsl promotion agreement to sigma tau 
sigma tau entered into a promotion agreement with inkine pharmaceutical company  inc inkine 
under the terms of the agreement  sigma tau will pay to inkine a fixed fee to promote vsl to gastroenterologists as a second detail 
in the short term  we could benefit from this increased promotion effort in that we are responsible for taking orders and shipping vsl directly to customers 
as such  we recognize the revenues for the sale of vsl in the united states regardless of which company promotes the product 
there is no assurance that our promotion agreement will be renewed or if it is renewed that the terms of the agreement will not be substantially different than the current terms of the agreement 
if the agreement is not renewed  we will not recognize any revenue from vsl sales once the agreement expires in january if we are unsuccessful in completing the acthar site transfer  we may be unable to meet the demand for acthar and lose potential revenues 
any delays or problems associated with the site transfer of the manufacturers or third party contract laboratories for testing of acthar could reduce the amount of the product that will be available for sale and adversely affect our operating results 
under our agreement with aventis pharmaceuticals  inc aventis  aventis manufactured and supplied acthar through july during  we signed a definitive agreement with chesapeake biological laboratories cbl  a contract manufacturer for acthar finished product  and transferred the final fill and packaging process from aventis to cbl 
under our agreement with aventis  we purchased the active pharmaceutical ingredient api and other inventory residing at aventis 
we believe that this api should be sufficient to meet our forecasted demand through cbl  the new final fill manufacturer  began supplying to us finished product during using the api manufactured by aventis 
we have selected a new contract laboratory to perform various bioassays associated with the release of api and finished product 
these assays have been performed and are continuing to be performed by aventis 
however  we have experienced delays and cost overruns in the validation of the potency bioassay from aventis to our new third party contract laboratory 
beginning in  we will resume the testing necessary to transfer the assay to a new contact laboratory 
if this laboratory is unable to validate this specific assay  we may be forced to find a new contractor to complete this work  which in turn could increase our costs substantially 
if we are unable to efficiently and timely validate the potency assay before the date when aventis can no longer conduct this assay  we will not be able to release api and finished goods and therefore we may not be able to meet the expected demand for acthar 
as described above  the process of manufacturing acthar is complex and we may encounter problems associated with the site transfer 
once the site transfer to our new api manufacturer  biovectra  has been completed and the bioassays have been validated and they begin supplying released api to us  the cost of the product is expected to increase which may cause our gross margins to decline 
in addition  if the site transfer and the corresponding approval by the fda and other regulatory authorities do not occur on a timely basis at the appropriate costs to us  we will lose sales 
moreover  contract manufacturers that we may use must continually adhere to current good manufacturing practices regulations enforced by the fda 
if the facilities of these manufacturers cannot pass an inspection  we may lose the fda approval of our products 
failure to obtain products for sale for any reason may result in an inability to meet product demand and a loss of potential revenues 

table of contents if our customers do not comply with our exchange policy and or demand that we implement a return policy  our revenues would be significantly impacted 
we have an exchange policy in which we will ship replacement product for expired product returned to us within six months after expiration 
this policy is not commonplace in the industry as the standard policy is to issue credit memoranda in exchange for expired product that is returned 
our customers have expressed dissatisfaction with our exchange policy and  although they have complied to date  have suggested that they may choose not to adhere to it in the future 
since we sell a majority of our products to the three largest distributors and no viable alternatives exist  we may be forced to change our current policy to a return policy in which credit memoranda are issued 
in the event this occurred  the negative financial impact on our revenues  operations and cash position would be substantial in the near term 
in december  we noted that certain of our customers were not complying with our expired product exchange policy 
these customers were deducting from amounts owed to us the full price of expired acthar they planned to return to us 
while we reached an agreement with these customers to pay these short remittances returns receivable upon their receipt of replacement product for the acthar that expired in november and may  customers have continued to deduct from amounts owed to us the full price of expired acthar they return to us 
additionally  certain customers received an administration fee from us for the expired product that was exchanged 
certain of our customers continued to short remit for expired product returns in as of december   the returns receivable amount is  a majority of returns of expired product  which in turn has created this returns receivable  have been replaced in accordance with our exchange policy  and we are in the process of seeking reimbursement 
the next batches of acthar expire in january and december  the next batches of ethamolin expire in january and february and the next nascobal batch expires in february we expect that our customers will continue to short remit us in the future as these batches expire and our customers seek to return expired product 
should our customers not reimburse us for the returns receivable upon shipment of replacement product  the negative impact on our cash and operations would be substantial 
in and  the acthar vials we sold had a one year shelf life and  in the first quarter of  we began shipping product which expired in january in november  the shelf life of acthar was increased to months 
due to the short shelf life of acthar  significant quantities could expire at the wholesale or pharmacy level  which could then be returned for replacement product under our exchange policy 
we are actively monitoring inventory levels at the wholesalers and have implemented a plan designed to minimize the amount of returns of expired product  however there can be no assurance that our actions will be effective in reducing the return of expired product or minimizing the negative impact on receivables and future sales 
such shipment of replacement product may displace future sales 
see the critical accounting policies section in the management discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations for further discussion of our exchange policy 
we have little or no control over our wholesalers buying patterns  which may impact future revenues  exchanges and excess inventory 
we sell our products primarily through major drug wholesalers located in the united states 
consistent with the pharmaceutical industry  most of our revenues are derived from the three largest drug wholesalers 
our three largest customers represented over of our net product sales for fiscal year while we attempt to estimate inventory levels of our products at our major wholesale customers using inventory data obtained from these customers  historical prescription information and historical purchase patterns  this process is inherently imprecise 
we rely solely upon our wholesale customers to effect the distribution allocation of our products 
there can be no assurance that these customers will adequately manage their local and regional inventories to avoid outages or inventory build ups 
we noted in the second quarter of that one of our major customers had purchased ethamolin units in excess of what we estimated their historical demand to be 
this build up of inventory adversely impacted ethamolin sales in and may adversely impact future sales of ethamolin 

table of contents our therapeutic pharmaceutical products have expiration dates that range from to months from date of manufacture 
we will generally accept for exchange pharmaceutical products that have reached the expiration date 
we establish reserves for these exchanges at the time of sale 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to accurately forecast the reserve requirement that will be needed in the future 
although our estimates are reviewed quarterly for reasonableness  our product return activity could differ significantly from our estimates because our analysis of product shipments  prescription trends and the amount of product in the distribution channel may not be accurate 
judgment is required in estimating these reserves 
the actual amounts could be different from the estimates and differences are accounted for in the period in which they become known 
we do not control or significantly influence the purchasing patterns of wholesale customers 
these are highly sophisticated customers that purchase our products in a manner consistent with their industry practices and perceived business interests 
our sales are subject to the purchase requirements of our major customers  which  presumably  are based upon their projected demand levels 
purchases by any customer  during any period  may be above or below actual prescription volumes of one or more of our products during the same period  resulting in increases or decreases in product inventory existing in the distribution channel 
we provide reserves for potentially excess  dated or otherwise impaired inventory 
reserves for excess inventory are based on an analysis of expected future sales that will occur before the inventory on hand will expire 
judgment is required in estimating reserves for excess inventories 
the actual amounts of required reserves could be different from the estimates and differences are accounted for in the period in which they become known 
we have limited experience marketing nascobal and may be unsuccessful in doing so 
in june  we acquired nascobal  a nasal gel used for the treatment of various vitamin b deficiencies 
we currently have limited sales and marketing experience with respect to nascobal 
we also cannot predict what the demand for nascobal will be 
if the demand for nascobal is less than we anticipate  or if we are unsuccessful in marketing nascobal  our revenues from the sale of nascobal will be less than we are currently anticipating 
as part of the acquisition  questcor also acquired the rights to nascobal nasal spray  a new dosage form  for which an nda was filed with the fda by nastech in december subject to the approval of the nda for the new nascobal nasal spray dosage form by the fda  we will make a million payment to nastech for the transfer of the nda from nastech to questcor 
further  subject to the approval of the nda by the fda for the new nascobal nasal spray dosage form and upon issuance of a pending us patent for the new nascobal nasal spray dosage form  we will make a second million payment to nastech 
we need to generate revenues from sales of nascobal in order to raise the necessary funds to make these payments 
if we are not successful in marketing nascobal  we may need to seek other sources of cash to make such payments or to fund operations 
moreover  if the amount of nascobal inventory at the wholesale level at the time that we purchased nascobal was higher than we anticipated  this may also affect the demand for nascobal in the near term 
our inability to secure additional funding could lead to a loss of your investment 
while we raised gross proceeds of million through a private placement of series b preferred stock in january  million through a private placement of common stock in june  and million and the surrender of outstanding warrants through a private placement of common stock in january  we anticipate that our capital resources based on our internal forecasts and projections will be adequate to fund operations and capital expenditures through at least december   unless a substantial portion of our cash is used for product acquisition or our fiscal year revenues are less than we expect 
if nastech is successful in obtaining approval for the nda covering the nasal spray formulation  and if the patent covering this formulation issues after the approval of the nda  we would be required to pay million to nastech 
if we experience unanticipated cash requirements  or if revenues fail to grow  or we are required to make the milestone payments to nastech  we could be required to raise additional funds 
regardless  we may seek additional funds  before the end of  through public or private equity financing or from other sources to potentially avoid the payment of additional dividends of under our series b convertible preferred stock  to 
table of contents acquire additional products  to expand our operations or to meet future obligations 
additionally  we may seek to raise capital whenever conditions in the financial markets are favorable  even if we do not have an immediate need for additional cash at that time 
there can be no assurance that additional funds can be obtained on desirable terms or at all 
in order to conduct our operating activities  we may require substantial additional capital resources in order to acquire new products  increase sales of existing products  and maintain our operations 
in addition  if revenues from product sales do not significantly increase or if further capital investments do not materialize  or if such investments cannot be completed at attractive terms to us  or if we are unable to receive any additional capital investments at all  this may further limit our ability to fund operations 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the following existing product sales performance  cost maintenance and potential future expansion of our sales force  the cost and timing of the acthar site transfer  achieving better operating efficiencies  maintaining customer compliance with our policies  obtaining product from our sole source contract manufacturers and completing the site transfer to new contract manufacturers  and acquiring additional products 
we anticipate obtaining additional financing through public or private debt or equity financings 
however  additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms  if at all 
further  additional equity financings will be dilutive to our shareholders 
if sufficient capital is not available  then we may be required to reduce our operations or to delay  reduce the scope of  eliminate or divest one or more of our products  product acquisition or manufacturing efforts 
if we are unable to contract with third party manufacturers  we may be unable to meet the demand for our products and lose potential revenues 
we will rely on third party contract manufacturers to produce our marketed products  acthar  nascobal  ethamolin  glofil and vsl  and other products that we may develop  commercialize or acquire in the future 
third party manufacturers may not be able to meet our needs with respect to timing  cost  quantity or quality 
all of our manufacturers are sole source manufacturers and no currently qualified alternative suppliers exist 
ethamolin is currently being manufactured by ben venue laboratories ben venue 
we do not have a formal ethamolin manufacturing contract in place with ben venue  rather we have an agreement on terms and conditions  and we purchase product on a purchase order basis under these agreed upon terms and conditions 
glofil is manufactured by iso tex diagnostics  inc from whom we purchase on a lot by lot basis 
nascobal is manufactured by nastech under a long term supply agreement 
vsl is supplied by sigma tau pharmaceuticals under a promotion agreement we have with them 
sigma tau pharmaceuticals has the sole responsibility for manufacturing and or acquiring the vsl product 
see if we are unsuccessful in completing the acthar site transfer  we may be unable to meet the demand for acthar and lose potential revenues for discussion of third party manufacturers of acthar 
if we are unable to contract for a sufficient supply of our required products and services on acceptable terms  or if we should encounter delays or difficulties in our relationships with our manufacturers  or if the site transfer and the corresponding approval by the fda and other regulatory authorities does not occur on a timely basis at the appropriate costs to us  we will lose sales 
moreover  contract manufacturers that we may use must continually adhere to current good manufacturing practices enforced by the fda 
if the facilities of these manufacturers cannot pass an inspection  we may lose the fda approval of our products 
failure to 
table of contents obtain products for sale for any reason may result in an inability to meet product demand and a loss of potential revenues 
if our third party distributors are unable to distribute our products  we will lose potential revenues 
we currently outsource certain functions previously performed in our carlsbad  california distribution center  including  but not limited to  warehousing  shipping and quality control studies 
the outsourcing of these functions is complex  and we may experience difficulties at the third party contractor level that could result in the non shipment of our products 
we have transferred the distribution of acthar  nascobal  ethamolin and glofil to third party distributors  and we distribute vsl from our union city facility 
if we encounter problems with the distribution of these products at the third party distribution level the products could become unavailable and we could lose revenues  or the costs to distribute these products could become higher than we anticipated 
if we lose the services of certain key personnel or are unable to hire skilled personnel in the future  our business will be harmed 
we are highly dependent on the services of our chairman  president  and chief executive officer  mr 
charles j 
casamento  our senior vice president of finance and administration and chief financial officer  mr 
timothy e 
morris  and our vice president of sales and marketing  mr 
r 
jerald beers 
if we were to lose mr 
casamento  mr 
morris or mr 
beers as employees  our business could be harmed 
moreover  we do not carry key person life insurance for our senior management or other personnel 
additionally  the future potential growth and expansion of our business is expected to place increased demands on our management skills and resources 
although only minor increases in staffing levels are expected during  recruiting and retaining management and operational personnel to perform sales and marketing  business development  regulatory affairs  quality assurance  medical affairs and contract manufacturing in the future will also be critical to our success 
we do not know if we will be able to attract and retain skilled and experienced management and operational personnel in the future on acceptable terms given the intense competition among numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for such personnel 
if we are unable to hire necessary skilled personnel in the future  our business could be harmed 
our commercial products and our products in the development stage may not be accepted by the market  which may result in lower future revenues as well as a decline in our competitive positioning 
our commercial products and any products that we successfully develop  if approved for marketing  may never achieve market acceptance 
these products  if successfully developed  will compete with drugs and therapies manufactured and marketed by major pharmaceutical and other biotechnology companies 
physicians  patients or the medical community in general may not accept and utilize the products that we may develop or that our corporate partners may develop 
the degree of market acceptance of our commercial products and any products that we successfully develop will depend on a number of factors  including the establishment and demonstration of the clinical efficacy and safety of the product candidates  their potential advantage over alternative treatment methods and competing products  reimbursement policies of government and third party payers  and our ability to market and promote the products effectively 
the failure of our products to achieve market acceptance may result in lower future revenues as well as a decline in our competitive positioning 

table of contents a large percentage of our voting stock is beneficially owned by a small number of shareholders  who in the future could attempt to take over control of our management and operations or exercise voting power to advance their own best interests and not necessarily those of other shareholders 
sigma tau finanziaria spa and its affiliates  or sigma tau  beneficially own  directly or indirectly  approximately of the voting power of our outstanding voting capital stock  and they beneficially own  including shares of our common stock issuable upon conversion of a convertible debenture  approximately of our outstanding common stock  as of march  additionally  as reported on amendment no 
to schedule d  filed with the sec on february   corporate opportunities fund  lp and its affiliates and montreux equity partners ii sbic  lp and its affiliates beneficially own approximately of our voting capital stock 
accordingly  these shareholders  acting individually or together  could control the outcome of certain shareholder votes  including votes concerning the election of directors  the adoption or amendment of provisions in our articles of incorporation  and the approval of mergers and other significant corporate transactions 
this level of concentrated ownership may  at a minimum  have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in the management or voting control of us by a third party 
it may also place us in the position of having these large shareholders take control of us and having new management inserted and new objectives adopted 
if competitors develop and market products that are more effective than ours  our commercial opportunity will be reduced or eliminated 
the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are intensely competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change 
a number of companies are pursuing the development of pharmaceuticals and products that target the same diseases and conditions that we target 
for example  there are products on the market that compete with acthar  nascobal  ethamolin  glofil  and vsl moreover  technology controlled by third parties that may be advantageous to our business may be acquired or licensed by competitors of ours  preventing us from obtaining this technology on favorable terms  or at all 
our ability to compete will depend on our ability to create and maintain scientifically advanced technology  and to develop  acquire and commercialize pharmaceutical products based on this technology  as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel  obtain patent protection  or otherwise develop proprietary technology or processes  and secure sufficient capital resources for the expected substantial time period between technological conception and commercial sales of products based upon our technology 
many of the companies developing competing technologies and products have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in development  manufacturing  obtaining regulatory approvals  and marketing than we do 
other smaller companies may also prove to be significant competitors  particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies 
academic institutions  government agencies and other public and private research organizations may also seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for clinical development  manufacturing  and marketing of products similar to ours 
these companies and institutions will compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified sales and marketing and management personnel  as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to our programs 
we will face competition with respect to product efficacy and safety  the timing and scope of regulatory approvals  availability of resources  price  and patent position  including potentially dominant patent positions of others 
if our competitors succeed in developing technologies and drugs that are more effective or less costly than any that we are developing  our technology and future drugs may be rendered obsolete and noncompetitive 
in addition  our competitors may succeed in obtaining the approval of the fda or other regulatory approvals for 
table of contents drug candidates more rapidly than we will 
companies that complete clinical trials  obtain required regulatory agency approvals and commence commercial sale of their drugs before their competitors may achieve a significant competitive advantage  including patent and fda marketing exclusivity rights that would delay our ability to market specific products 
we do not know if drugs resulting from the joint efforts of our existing or future collaborative partners will be able to compete successfully with our competitors existing products or products under development or whether we will obtain regulatory approval in the us or elsewhere 
if we fail to maintain or enter into new contracts related to collaborations and in licensed or acquired technology and products  our product development and commercialization could be delayed 
our business model has been dependent on our ability to enter into licensing and acquisition arrangements with commercial or academic entities to obtain technology for commercialization or marketed products 
if we are unable to enter into any new agreements in the future  our development and commercialization efforts will be delayed 
disputes may arise regarding the inventorship and corresponding rights in inventions and know how resulting from the joint creation or use of intellectual property by us and our licensors or scientific collaborators 
we may not be able to negotiate additional license and acquisition agreements in the future on acceptable terms  if at all 
in addition  current license and acquisition agreements may be terminated  and we may not be able to maintain the exclusivity of our exclusive licenses 
if collaborators do not commit sufficient development resources  technology  regulatory expertise  manufacturing  marketing and other resources towards developing  promoting and commercializing products incorporating our discoveries  the development of our licensed products progress will be stalled 
further  competitive conflicts may arise among these third parties that could prevent them from working cooperatively with us 
the amount and timing of resources devoted to these activities by the parties could depend on the achievement of milestones by us and otherwise generally may be controlled by other parties 
in addition  we expect that our agreements with future collaborators will likely permit the collaborators to terminate their agreements upon written notice to us 
this type of termination would substantially reduce the likelihood that the applicable research program or any lead candidate or candidates would be developed into a drug candidate  would obtain regulatory approvals and would be manufactured and successfully commercialized 
if none of our collaborations are successful in developing and commercializing products  or if we do not receive milestone payments or generate revenues from royalties sufficient to offset our significant investment in product development and other costs  then our business could be harmed 
disagreements with our collaborators could lead to delays or interruptions in  or termination of  development and commercialization of certain potential products or could require or result in litigation or arbitration  which could be time consuming and expensive and may result in lost revenues and substantial legal costs which could negatively impact our results from operations 
in addition  if we are unable to acquire new marketed products on a timely basis at an appropriate purchase price and terms  we may not reach profitability and may not generate sufficient cash to fund operations 
if we are unable to protect our proprietary rights  we may lose our competitive position and future revenues 
our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain patents for our products and technologies  protect trade secrets  operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others  and prevent others from infringing on our proprietary rights 
we will only be able to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third parties to the extent that these rights are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets and are otherwise protectable under applicable law 
we will attempt to protect our proprietary position by filing 
table of contents us and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary products  technology  inventions and improvements that are important to the development of our business 
the patent positions of biotechnology and biopharmaceutical companies involve complex legal and factual questions and  therefore  enforceability cannot be predicted with certainty 
patents  if issued  may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented 
thus  any patents that we own or license from third parties may not provide any protection against competitors 
pending patent applications we may file in the future  or those we may license from third parties  may not result in patents being issued 
also  patent rights may not provide us with proprietary protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar technology 
furthermore  others may independently develop similar technologies or duplicate any technology that we have developed or we will develop 
the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
in addition to patents  we rely on trade secrets and proprietary know how 
we currently seek protection  in part  through confidentiality and proprietary information agreements 
these agreements may not provide meaningful protection or adequate remedies for proprietary technology in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of confidential and proprietary information 
the parties may not comply or may breach these agreements 
furthermore  our trade secrets may otherwise become known to  or be independently developed by competitors 
our success will further depend  in part  on our ability to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others 
if our activities infringe on patents owned by others  we could incur substantial costs in defending ourselves in suits brought against a licensor or us 
should our products or technologies be found to infringe on patents issued to third parties  the manufacture  use and sale of our products could be enjoined  and we could be required to pay substantial damages 
in addition  we  in connection with the development and use of our products and technologies  may be required to obtain licenses to patents or other proprietary rights of third parties  which may not be made available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
since we must obtain regulatory approval to market our products in the united states and in foreign jurisdictions  we cannot predict whether or when we will be permitted to commercialize our products 
any products that we develop are subject to regulation by federal  state and local governmental authorities in the united states  including the fda  and by similar agencies in other countries 
any product that we develop must receive all relevant regulatory approvals or clearances before it may be marketed in a particular country 
the regulatory process  which includes extensive pre clinical studies and clinical trials of each product to establish its safety and efficacy  is uncertain  can take many years and requires the expenditure of substantial resources 
data obtained from pre clinical and clinical activities are susceptible to varying interpretations that could delay  limit or prevent regulatory approval or clearance 
in addition  delays or rejections may be encountered based upon changes in regulatory policy during the period of product development and the period of review of any application for regulatory approval or clearance for a product 
delays in obtaining regulatory approvals or clearances could stall the marketing  selling and distribution of any products that our corporate partners or we develop  impose significant additional costs on our corporate partners and us  diminish any competitive advantages that we or our corporate partners may attain  and decrease our ability to receive royalties and generate revenues and profits 
regulatory approval  if granted  may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which a new product may be marketed that could limit the potential market for the product 
product approvals  once granted  may be withdrawn if problems occur after initial marketing 
furthermore  manufacturers of approved products are subject to pervasive review  including compliance with detailed regulations governing fda good manufacturing practices 
the fda periodically revises the good manufacturing practices regulations 
failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in warning letters  fines  injunctions  civil penalties  recall or 
table of contents seizure of products  total or partial suspension of production  refusal of the government to grant marketing applications and criminal prosecution 
in addition  we cannot predict the extent of government regulations or the impact of new governmental regulations that may result in a delay in the development  production and marketing of our products 
as such  we may be required to incur significant costs to comply with current or future laws or regulations 
for example  successful late stage phase iii clinical trials for such potentially important treatments such as diabetic gastroparesis and delayed onset emesis may require the enrollment of many patients 
together  the costs of these trials  if funded solely by us  could exceed our current financial resources 
our ability to generate revenues is affected by the availability of reimbursement on our products  and our ability to generate revenues will be diminished if we fail to obtain an adequate level of reimbursement for our products from third party payors 
in both domestic and foreign markets  sales of our products will depend in part on the availability of reimbursement from third party payors such as state and federal governments for example  under medicare and medicaid programs in the united states and private insurance plans 
because of vsl s non prescription status  it is not widely covered by third party payors 
in certain foreign markets  the pricing and profitability of our products generally are subject to government controls 
in the united states  there have been  and we expect there will continue to be  a number of state and federal proposals that limit the amount that state or federal governments will pay to reimburse the cost of drugs 
we believe the increasing emphasis on managed care in the united states has and will continue to put pressure on the price and usage of our products  which may also impact product sales 
further  when a new therapeutic is approved  the reimbursement status and rate of such a product is uncertain 
in addition  current reimbursement policies for existing products may change at any time 
changes in reimbursement or our failure to obtain reimbursement for our products may reduce the demand for  or the price of  our products  which could result in lower product sales or revenues  thereby weakening our competitive position and negatively impacting our results of operations 
in the united states  proposals have called for substantial changes in the medicare and medicaid programs 
any such changes enacted may require significant reductions from currently projected government expenditures for these programs 
the medicare prescription drug improvement act  enacted in december  provides for  among other things  an immediate reduction in the medicare reimbursement rates for many drugs administered in a physician s office 
the medicare act  as well as other changes in government legislation or regulation or in private third party payors policies toward reimbursement for our products  may reduce or eliminate reimbursement of our products costs 
driven by budget concerns  medicaid managed care systems have been implemented in several states and local metropolitan areas 
if the medicare and medicaid programs implement changes that restrict the access of a significant population of patients to its innovative medicines  the market acceptance of these products may be reduced 
we are unable to predict what impact the medicare act or other future legislation  if any  relating to third party reimbursement  will have on our product sales 
to facilitate the availability of our products for medicaid patients  we have contracted with the center for medicare and medicaid services 
as a result  we pay quarterly rebates consistent with the utilization of our products by individual states 
we also must give discounts under contract on purchases or reimbursements of pharmaceutical products by certain other federal and state agencies and programs 
if these discounts and rebates become burdensome to us and we are not able to sell our products through these channels  our net sales could decline 
our stock price has a history of volatility  and an investment in our stock could decline in value 
the price of our common stock  like that of other specialty pharmaceutical companies  is subject to significant volatility 
our stock price has ranged in value from to over the last two years 
any number of events  both internal and external to us  may continue to affect our stock price 
these include  without limitation  the quarterly and yearly revenues and earnings losses  our ability to acquire and market appropriate pharmaceuticals  announcement by us or our competitors regarding product development efforts  
table of contents including the status of regulatory approval applications  the outcome of legal proceedings  including claims filed by us against third parties to enforce our patents and claims filed by third parties against us relating to patents held by the third parties  the launch of competing products  our ability to obtain product from our contract manufacturers  the resolution of or failure to resolve disputes with collaboration partners and corporate restructuring by us 
if product liability lawsuits are successfully brought against us or we become subject to other forms of litigation  we may incur substantial liabilities and costs and may be required to limit commercialization of our products 
our business will expose us to potential liability risks that are inherent in the testing  manufacturing and marketing of pharmaceutical products 
the use of any drug candidates ultimately developed by us or our collaborators in clinical trials may expose us to product liability claims and possible adverse publicity 
these risks will expand for any of our drug candidates that receive regulatory approval for commercial sale and for those products we currently market 
product liability insurance for the pharmaceutical industry is generally expensive  if available at all 
we currently have product liability insurance for claims up to  however  if we are unable to maintain insurance coverage at acceptable costs  in a sufficient amount  or at all  or if we become subject to a product liability claim  our reputation  stock price and ability to devote the necessary resources to the commercialization of our products could be negatively impacted

factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed in this section  as well as item business of questcor  including without limitation risk factors  as well as those discussed in any documents incorporated by reference herein or therein 
we are a specialty pharmaceutical company that acquires  markets and sells brand name prescription drugs through our us direct sales force and international commercialization partners 
we focus on the treatment of central nervous system cns diseases and gastroenterological disorders which are served by a concentrated group of physicians such as neurologists and gastroenterologists 
our strategy is to acquire pharmaceutical products that we believe have sales growth potential  are promotionally responsive to a focused and targeted sales and marketing effort and complement our existing products 
we currently market five products in the united states hp acthar gel acthar  an injectable drug that is approved for the treatment of certain cns disorders with an inflammatory component including the treatment of flares associated with multiple sclerosis ms and is also commonly used in treating patients with infantile spasm  nascobal  the only prescription nasal gel used for the treatment of various vitamin b deficiencies including vitamin b deficiencies associated with crohn s disease  gastric bypass surgery and ms  ethamolin  an injectable drug used to treat enlarged weakened blood vessels at the entrance to the stomach that have recently bled  known as esophageal varices  glofil  an injectable agent that assesses how well the kidney is working by measuring glomerular filtration rate  or kidney function  and vsl  a patented probiotic marketed as a dietary supplement to promote normal gastrointestinal function 
probiotics are living organisms in food and dietary supplements  which  upon ingestion in certain numbers  improve the health of the host beyond their inherent basic nutrition 
due to minimal demand and increasing production costs  we discontinued marketing and selling inulin in september in june  we acquired nascobal  an fda approved nasal gel formulation of cyanocobalamin usp vitamin b  from nastech pharmaceutical company  inc nastech for million 
we began distributing nascobal in july we are marketing nascobal for patients with crohn s disease and ms  and patients who are at high risk of developing severe deficiencies of vitamin b due to a compromised ability to absorb vitamin b through the gastrointestinal system 
we are also marketing nascobal for patients who have undergone gastric bypass surgery or other conditions that lead to a malabsorbtive state 
consistent with our focus on sales and marketing  our spending on research and development activities is minimal 
expenses incurred for the acthar manufacturing site transfer and medical and regulatory affairs are classified as research and development expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
we have entered into agreements with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to further the development of certain acquired technology 
we have incurred an accumulated deficit of million at december  at december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  and in january we raised an additional million through the private placement of common stock for cash and the surrender of warrants 
results of operations may vary significantly from quarter to quarter depending on  among other factors  the results of our sales efforts  timing of expiration of our products and the resulting shipment of replacement product under our exchange policy  the availability of finished goods from our sole source manufacturers  the 
table of contents timing of certain expenses including the acthar site transfer costs  the acquisition of marketed products  the establishment of strategic alliances and corporate partnering  and the receipt of milestone payments 
critical accounting policies our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to product returns  sales allowances  bad debts  inventories  investments  and intangible assets 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
product returns  rebates and sales allowances we have estimated allowances for product returns from wholesalers and pharmacies  government chargebacks for goods purchased by certain federal government organizations including the veterans administration  medicaid rebates from all states for goods purchased by patients covered by medicaid  and cash discounts for prompt payment 
we estimate our allowances by utilizing historical information for existing products and data obtained from external sources 
for new products  we estimate our allowances for product returns  government chargebacks and rebates on specific terms for product returns  chargebacks and rebates  and our experience with similar products 
effective august   we changed our return goods policy such that we no longer issue credit memorandums for returns  rather returns are exchanged for replacement product exchange policy 
the estimated costs for such potential exchanges  which include actual product costs and related shipping charges  are included in cost of product sales 
in estimating returns  for each product  we analyze i historical returns and sales patterns  ii current inventory on hand at wholesalers and in the distribution channel  and the remaining shelf life of that inventory ranging from months to years for all products except glofil  and iii changes in demand measured by prescriptions as provided by an independent third party source and our internal estimates 
for glofil  we accept no returns for expired product 
we continually assess our historical experience including customers compliance with the exchange policy  and we adjust our allowances as appropriate 
in december  we noted that certain customers were not complying with our exchange policy 
these customers were deducting from amounts owed to us the full price of expired acthar they planned to return to us 
we reached an agreement with these customers to reverse these short remittances and to accept replacement product for the acthar expiring in november and may certain customers received an administration fee from us 
it remains our customers standard practice to deduct from payments to us the amount of the sales value of expired product returns receivable that they have requested for return 
the returns receivable of  at december  was an increase of  from the december  balance of  primarily due to the expiration of batches of acthar in november and may customers have indicated that they will reimburse us for these deductions upon the replacement of expired units in accordance with our exchange policy  however  our experience has been the timing of such reimbursements is slower than the collection of our normal trade receivables 
as of december   replacement units have been shipped relating to over two thirds of the amounts owing to us and we are seeking reimbursement from these customers 
as long as our customer s standard practice is to deduct amounts related to the return of expired product  a returns receivable will arise 
should our customers not comply with 
table of contents our exchange policy  the amounts deducted by them for returns may not be collectible  and we would increase our allowance for bad debts 
our exchange policy is not commonplace in the pharmaceutical industry as the standard policy is to issue credit memorandums in exchange for expired product that is returned 
our customers have expressed dissatisfaction with our exchange policy  and although they have complied to date  our ability to enforce this policy on customers whose influence and resources are far greater than ours  is extremely limited 
if our customers do not comply with our policies  our options are limited 
we could either not sell our products to them see wholesalers buying patterns  in the risk factor section or we could be forced to change our policy to allow for the issuance of credit memoranda in exchange for returned expired products 
under such a policy  we would no longer issue replacement product 
the issuance of credit memoranda would negatively impact cash flow in the short term but may increase future sales as shipment of replacement product at no cost would no longer occur 
should we be forced to change to a returns policy in which credit memoranda are issued in exchange for expired product  an allowance for returns credit memorandums would be necessary and would be recorded with an offset to net product sales at the time of the policy change 
the allowance would be based on an estimate of the future credit memorandums to be issued based upon historical return rates by product  applied to the quantity of product sold that has not yet expired 
further  if such a policy change were made the currently recorded allowance for product exchanges would be eliminated resulting in a reduction of cost of product sales 
on acthar  the historical return rate has been approximately to due to the short shelf life of the product and the nature of the disease for which it is presented 
a change in our business policy to a return for credit memoranda basis would have a significant negative financial impact at the time of the change 
using historical return rates for each product  if we adopted a policy of issuing credit memorandums for expired product  allowances of up to million to million might be needed 
a change in the business policy to issuing credit memorandums for expired product would be considered a change in accounting estimate and would be accounted for on a prospective basis 
the impact of a change to a return for credit memoranda policy would be to reduce net product sales by the amount of the estimated future credit memoranda to be issued offset by a reduction in cost of product sales for the elimination of the allowance for product replacement 
in march  one of our three largest customers communicated to us that they do not want to continue with the exchange policy but desire a policy of issuing credit memoranda for expired product 
we will be meeting with this customer to attempt to maintain our exchange policy but in the event we are unsuccessful  we may be forced to change to a return for credit memoranda policy 
in estimating medicaid rebates  we match the actual rebates to the actual sales on a product by product basis to arrive at an actual rebate percentage 
this historical percentage is used to estimate a rebate percentage that is applied to current period sales to arrive at the rebate expense allowance for the period 
in particular  we consider allowable prices by medicaid 
in estimating government chargeback allowances  we analyze actual chargeback amounts by product and apply historical chargeback rates to sales to which chargebacks apply  typically sales to the veterans administration and other us government organizations 
we continually assess our experience with medicaid rebates and government chargebacks and adjust the allowances accordingly 
for certain major customers  we grant payment terms of  net days 
allowances for cash discounts are estimated based upon historical experience and the amount of trade accounts receivable subject to the cash discounts 
if actual product returns  government chargebacks  medicaid rebates and cash discounts are greater than our estimates  or if our customers fail to adhere to our exchange policy  additional allowances may be required 
to date  the actual amounts have approximated our estimates 
inventories we maintain inventory reserves primarily for obsolescence due to the expiration of shelf life 
in estimating inventory obsolescence reserves  we analyze on a product by product basis i the expiration date  
table of contents ii our sales forecasts  and iii historical demand 
judgment is required in determining whether the forecasted sales information is sufficiently reliable to enable us to reasonably estimate inventory obsolescence 
if actual future usage and demand for our products are less favorable than those projected by our management  additional inventory write offs may be required 
during fiscal year  we acquired from aventis for  various materials including acthar api which are needed to produce both acthar final product and api 
as of december   there was  of the aventis raw materials remaining in our inventory 
the fda approved our use of aventis api in the production of acthar final product until we have successfully transferred the production of api to a new contract manufacturer 
this approval is conditioned on yearly testing of the api and the results meeting the current api specification 
in the future  if we are successful in transferring the api production to our new contract manufacturer  biovectra  we may write off certain of the remaining raw materials as excess inventory 
intangible assets we have intangible assets related to purchased technology  goodwill and other acquired intangibles 
the determination of related estimated useful lives and whether or not these assets are impaired involves significant judgment 
changes in strategy and or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments and require adjustments to recorded asset balances 
in accordance with sfas  we review intangible assets  as well as other long lived assets  for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable 
in accordance with sfas  we review goodwill and other intangible assets with no definitive lives for impairment on an annual basis  using the two step approach 
to date  no impairment has been determined

without these backorders  product revenues would have been  in the year ended december  as of december   we had orders from customers totaling  that were not shipped until january net product sales will fluctuate quarter to quarter based on wholesale inventory levels  the replacement of expired product and the timing of orders from customers 
acthar for the year ended december   net product sales of acthar decreased from the year ended december  the lower sales of acthar in fiscal year was partially the result of the replacement of expired vials of acthar at no cost under our exchange policy  and the decision in the first quarter of fiscal year to briefly limit shipments of acthar to critical care and emergency care situations due to the relatively short dating of our inventories and inventories at the wholesale level 
during fiscal year  under our exchange policy we replaced vials of acthar with an estimated sales value of million calculated using the unit prices in effect at december  the replacement of expired product displaced sales in fiscal year and is expected to continue to displace sales as product expires and is subsequently replaced 
the decrease of unit sales over the prior year was also partially due to a shipment in early fiscal year of 
table of contents backorders totaling  outstanding as of december  the estimated demand as measured by prescriptions reported from an independent source increased by in as compared to under our exchange policy for expired product  during fiscal year we replaced vials of acthar which expired in november and may the next batches of acthar expire in january and december and replacements for the expired acthar relating to these batches will occur in fiscal year and fiscal year during fiscal year under our exchange policy we shipped replacement units for expired product with an estimated sales value of  calculated using unit sales prices in effect at december  in fiscal year and fiscal year  our acthar vials sold had a one year shelf life and in the first quarter fiscal year we began shipping acthar with a month shelf life 
due to the short shelf life of acthar  significant quantities could expire at the wholesaler or pharmacy level  which would then be returned for replacement product  under our exchange policy 
the shipment of replacement product  at no cost to the customers  displaces future sales 
in fiscal year  due to a continued shift in promotional efforts toward nascobal and the return of supply of a preferred competing product for acthar  we expect prescriptions for acthar to drop below fiscal year levels 
our acthar promotional efforts will be designed to support current prescribers of acthar in neurology 
nascobal nascobal sales commenced in july based on the positive prescription trends of nascobal in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we intend to add promotional resources to this product 
as such  we expect revenue from nascobal to increase in fiscal year and become a larger percentage of our total sales 
we anticipate that as a percentage of total sales  nascobal will increase and acthar will decrease 
ethamolin for the year ended december   net product sales of ethamolin decreased from the year ended december   which was primarily the result of the large purchase of ethamolin by wholesalers in anticipation of the price increase in june and shipment of backorders existing at december  effective june   we increased our list price for ethamolin 
from the date of the notification of the price increase through june   we received  of ethamolin orders  which we believe were in excess of actual prescription needs and negatively impacted sales in the remainder of fiscal year and fiscal year the decrease of sales of ethamolin in fiscal year over the prior year was also partially due to a shipment in early of backorders totaling  outstanding as of december  the demand for all sclerosing agents as measured by total prescriptions decreased in fiscal year by approximately  from fiscal year  and the decrease in demand for ethamolin was approximately 
in fiscal year we did not actively promote ethamolin and we do not expect to promote the product in fiscal year vsl for the year ended december   net product sales of vsl increased by  to  from  for the year ended december  the increase was attributed to a full year of sales since vsl was launched in may glofil for the year ended december   net product sales of glofil increased by  to  from net product sales of  for the year ended december  the increase in net product sales was due in part to the cric study that began in the cric study is to enroll  people who are at risk for compromised renal function  and follow them for more than five years 
the testing using glofil will occur at the enrollment of the trial and at the end of the trial 
in fiscal year  we did not actively promote glofil and do not intend to actively promote it in the future

contract research  grant and royalty revenue contract research  grant and royalty revenue decreased by  or  to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily the result of receiving less reimbursement under our sbir grant  which was terminated on july   due to a decrease in activity with our geri compound research project

the increase is primarily due to write offs of excess inventory and increases in our excess inventory allowance  increases in per unit material costs and increases in costs of performing product stability testing 
the excess inventory write offs and allowances are primarily the result of the decision to discontinue production and sales of inulin and the short shelf life of acthar 
we expect per unit material costs for acthar to increase in the future due to higher contract manufacturing and laboratory costs 
cost of product sales as a percentage of net product sales increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  a change in the mix of products we sold contributed to this change in the percentage of costs of product sales to net product sales 
in april  we decided to outsource certain functions previously performed in our carlsbad  california distribution center  including  but not limited to  warehousing  shipping and quality control studies 
we have entered into agreements with various vendors to distribute acthar  nascobal  ethamolin and glofil  and we distribute vsl from our union city facility 
the decision to outsource these functions and close the carlsbad facility resulted in reduced expense in the second half of 
table of contents gross margins years ended december  gross margins hp acthar gel nascobal ethamolin vsl glofil inulin all products acthar and ethamolin gross margins decreased due to the periodic stability testing required subsequent to manufacturing and the write off and allowances from excessive inventory 
the transfer of the manufacturing of acthar from aventis to new third party manufacturers will likely result in higher unit costs  which would result in a decrease of our gross margin on sales of acthar 
we commenced sales of nascobal in july inulin s gross margins decreased as a result of the write off of inventory upon termination of the product offering 
stability testing is required on each production lot of acthar and ethamolin and is conducted at third party laboratories at periodic intervals subsequent to manufacturing 
stability testing costs are expensed as incurred and are expected to increase as greater quantities of acthar and ethamolin are produced and become subject to testing 
total gross margins have declined based upon the mix of products and the reduction of margins on some individual products 
gross margins do not include any allocation of the amortization of purchased technology for the related project

in the year ended december   a third party contract laboratory performed several tests as part of our acthar manufacturing site transfer 
to date  this laboratory has been unsuccessful in validating the assay in order to 
table of contents complete the transfer 
based in part on the results of these tests  we were not able to complete the transfer of the assay to a new contract laboratory 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we temporarily suspended the testing and instead completed a review of the results achieved to date 
we performed an analysis of the variables involved that may have affected the validation of the assay 
beginning in fiscal year  we will resume the testing necessary to transfer the assay to a new contract laboratory 
if this laboratory is unable to validate this specific assay  we may be forced to find a new contractor to complete this work  which in turn could increase our costs substantially 
the costs related to the acthar site transfer may fluctuate depending on the timing of work performed and the costs related to such activities 
during fiscal year  our carlsbad facility was vacated and the functions performed there were outsourced to third party contractors or transferred to the union city headquarters 
the entire facility was subleased during fiscal year and a liability of  was recorded for the net present value of future rental payments  net of sublease payments and the corresponding expense recorded to research and development 
in fiscal years and  our spending on research and development programs was limited and will continue to be minimal in the future 
as such  we are seeking to out license the development of emitasol intransal metoclopramide  a product that is approved in italy and korea as an anti emetic 
the development of hypnostat for the treatment of sleep disorders and panistat for the treatment of panic disorders will be controlled by fabre kramer 
the future development of emitasol will be dependent in part on our ability to enter into a partnership arrangement 
as we rely on current and future strategic partners to develop and fund our non commercial projects  we are unable to project estimated completion dates 
we have limited control  if any  over these programs due to our reliance on partners for their development 
accordingly our ability to disclose historical and future costs associated with these projects is limited
