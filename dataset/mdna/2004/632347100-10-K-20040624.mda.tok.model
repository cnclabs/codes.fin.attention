item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction as used in this report  the terms we  us  our and nathan s mean nathan s famous  inc and its subsidiaries unless the context indicates a different meaning 
during the fiscal year ended march   we completed two acquisitions that provided us with two highly recognized brands 
on april   we became the franchisor of the kenny rogers roasters restaurant system by acquiring the intellectual property rights  including trademarks  recipes and franchise agreements of roasters corp 
and roasters franchise corp 
on september   we acquired the remaining of the outstanding common stock of miami subs corporation we did not already own 
our revenues are generated primarily from operating company owned restaurants and franchising the nathan s  miami subs and kenny rogers restaurant concepts  selling products under nathan s branded product program and licensing agreements for the sale of nathan s products within supermarkets 
the branded product program enables foodservice operators to offer nathans hot dogs and other proprietary items for sale within their facilities 
in conjunction with this program  foodservice operators are granted a limited use of the nathans trademark with respect to the sale of hot dogs and certain other proprietary food items and paper goods 
in addition to plans for expansion through franchising and our branded product program  nathan s continues to co brand within its existing restaurant system 
currently  the arthur treacher s brand is being sold within nathan s  kenny rogers roasters and miami subs restaurants  the nathan s brand is included on the menu of miami subs and kenny rogers restaurants  while the kenny rogers roasters brand is being sold within miami subs and nathan s restaurants 
at march   nathan s owned company operated restaurants 
during the fiscal year ended march   nathan s abandoned eight company operated restaurants pursuant to early lease terminations which are presented as discontinued operations pursuant to sfas no 
in the accompanying financial statements 
nathan s franchised two company operated restaurants during the fiscal year ended march  during the fiscal year ended march   nathan s has franchised three company operated restaurants and entered into two management agreements with franchisees to operate two company operated restaurants 
these seven restaurants are presented as continuing operations in the accompanying financial statements 
at march   our combined system consisted of franchised or licensed units  seven company owned units and over  nathan s branded product points of sale that feature nathan s world famous all beef hot dogs  located in states  the district of columbia and foreign countries 
at march   our company owned restaurant system included seven nathan s units  as compared to eight nathan s units and four miami subs units at march critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements and the notes to our consolidated financial statements contain information that is pertinent to management s discussion and analysis 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we believe the following critical accounting policies involve additional management judgement due to the sensitivity of the methods  assumptions and estimates necessary in determining the related asset and liability amounts 
impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  sfas no 
requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives will no longer be amortized but will be tested annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise for impairment 
the most significant assumptions which are used in this test are estimates of future cash flows 
we typically use the same assumptions for this test as we use in the development of our business plans 
if these assumptions differ significantly from actual results  additional impairment expenses may be required 
in the first quarter of fiscal  nathan s adopted sfas no 
in connection with the implementation of this new standard in fiscal  goodwill  trademarks  trade names and recipes were deemed to be impaired and their carrying value was written down by  or  net of income tax benefit of impairment of long lived assets statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  sfas no 
requires management judgements regarding the future operating and disposition plans for underperforming assets  and estimates of expected realizable values for assets to be sold 
the application of sfas no 
has affected the amounts and timing of charges to operating results in recent years 
we evaluate possible impairment of each restaurant individually  and record an impairment charge whenever we determine that impairment factors exist 
we consider a history of restaurant operating losses to be the primary indicator of potential impairment of a restaurant s carrying value 
during the fifty two week period ended march   we identified one restaurant that had been impaired and recorded impairment charges of approximately  during the fifty two weeks ended march   we identified seven restaurants that had been impaired and recorded impairment charges of approximately  impairment of notes receivable statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  requires management judgements regarding the future collectibility of notes receivable and the underlying fair market value of collateral 
we consider the following factors when evaluating a note for impairment a indications that the borrower is experiencing business problems  such as operating losses  marginal working capital  inadequate cash flow or business interruptions  b whether the loan is secured by collateral that is not readily marketable  and or c whether the collateral is susceptible to deterioration in realizable value 
when determining possible impairment  we also assess our future intention to extend certain leases beyond the minimum lease term and the debtor s ability to meet its obligation over the projected term 
we have identified certain notes receivable that have been impaired and recorded impairment charges of approximately  relating to two notes and  relating to nine notes during the fifty two weeks ended march  and march   respectively 
revenue recognition sales by company owned restaurants  which are typically paid in cash by the customer  are recognized upon the performance of services 
in connection with its franchising operations  the company receives initial franchise fees  development fees  royalties  contributions to marketing funds  and in certain cases  revenue from sub leasing restaurant properties to franchisees 
franchise and area development fees  which are typically received prior to completion of the revenue recognition process  are recorded as deferred revenue 
initial franchise fees are recognized as income when substantially all services to be performed by nathan s and conditions relating to the sale of the franchise have been performed or satisfied  which generally occurs when the franchised restaurant commences operations 
development fees are nonrefundable and the related agreements require the franchisee to open a specified number of restaurants in the development area within a specified time period or the agreements may be canceled by the company 
revenue from development agreements is deferred and recognized as restaurants in the development area commence operations on a pro rata basis to the minimum number of restaurants required to be open  or at the time the development agreement is effectively canceled 
nathan s recognizes franchise royalties when they are earned and deemed collectible 
franchise fees and royalties that are not deemed to be collectible are not recognized as revenue until paid by the franchisee 
revenue from sub leasing properties to franchisees is recognized as income as the revenue is earned and becomes receivable and deemed collectible 
sub lease rental income is presented net of associated lease costs in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
nathan s recognizes revenue from the branded product program when it is determined by the manufacturer that the products have been delivered via third party common carrier to nathans customers 
an accrual for the cost of the product to the company is recorded simultaneously with the revenue 
in the normal course of business  we extend credit to franchisees for the payment of ongoing royalties and to trade customers of our branded product program 
notes and accounts receivable  net  as shown on our consolidated balance sheets are net of allowances for doubtful accounts 
an allowance for doubtful accounts is determined through analysis of the aging of accounts receivable at the date of the financial statements  assessment of collectibility based upon historical trends and an evaluation of the impact of current and projected economic conditions 
in the event that the collectibility of a receivable is doubtful  the associated revenue is not recorded until the facts and circumstances change in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition 
self insurance liabilities we are self insured for portions of our general liability coverage 
as part of our risk management strategy  our insurance programs include deductibles for each incident and in the aggregate for each policy year 
as such  we accrue estimates of our ultimate self insurance costs throughout the policy year 
these estimates have been developed based upon our historical trends  however  the final cost of many of these claims may not be known for five years or longer 
accordingly  our annual self insurance costs may be subject to adjustment from previous estimates as facts and circumstances change 
during the fifty two weeks ended march   we reversed approximately  of previously recorded insurance accruals for items that have been concluded without further payment 
also  during the fifty two weeks ended march   we completed an evaluation of the outstanding claims and reserves in conjunction with our external risk manager and reversed  of previously recorded self insurance accruals for those claims on which our exposure had been settled

there is no set time limit on the purchases 
nathan s expects to fund these stock repurchases from its operating cash flow 
we expect that we will make additional investments in certain existing restaurants and to support the growth of the branded product program in the future and to fund those investments from our operating cash flow 
we may further incur additional capital expenditures in connection with the replacement of the restaurant whose lease will expire in september in connection with our acquisition of miami subs  we determined that up to underperforming restaurants would be closed pursuant to our divestiture plan

since acquiring miami subs  we have accrued approximately  and made payments of approximately  for lease obligations and termination costs  as part of the acquisition  for units having total future minimum lease obligations of  that had remaining lease terms of one year up to approximately years 
we may incur future cash payments  consisting primarily of future lease payments  including costs and expenses associated with terminating additional leases  that were not part of our divestiture plan

we currently maintain a  uncommitted bank line of credit and have never borrowed any funds under any lines of credit 
seasonality our business is affected by seasonal fluctuations  the effects of weather and economic conditions 
historically  restaurant sales from company owned restaurants  franchised restaurants from which royalties are earned and earnings have been highest during our first two fiscal quarters with the fourth fiscal quarter representing the slowest period 
this seasonality is primarily attributable to weather conditions in our marketplace for our company owned nathan s stores  which is principally the new york metropolitan area 
miami subs restaurant sales have historically been strongest during the period march through august  which approximates our first and second quarters  as a result of a heavy concentration of restaurants being located in florida 
notwithstanding the continued growth of our branded product program and the changing composition of our restaurants  we believe that future revenues and profits will continue to be highest during our first two fiscal quarters with the fourth fiscal quarter representing the slowest period 
inflationary impact during the past three years  our commodity costs for beef have fluctuated significantly while other costs have remained relatively stable 
as such  we believe that general inflation has not materially impacted earnings during that period of time 
however  during the first half of the fiscal period  commodity prices of our primary beef products reached their highest levels in many years 
throughout fiscal  these costs were in line with historical norms 
during fiscal  the price of our beef products has risen dramatically over historical norms and particularly as compared to fiscal we also experienced increased costs for utilities and insurance during the fiscal  and periods 
in various federal and new york state legislators proposed changes to the minimum wage requirements  however  none of the proposals were enacted 
although we only operate seven company owned restaurants  we believe that significant increases in the minimum wage could have a significant financial impact on our financial results 
prolonged increases in labor  food and other operating expenses could adversely affect our operations and those of the restaurant industry and we might have to reconsider our pricing strategy as a means to offset reduced operating margins 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk cash and cash equivalents we have historically invested our cash and cash equivalents in short term  fixed rate  highly rated and highly liquid instruments which are reinvested when they mature throughout the year 
although our existing investments are not considered at risk with respect to changes in interest rates or markets for these instruments  our rate of return on short term investments could be affected at the time of reinvestment as a result of intervening events 
as of march   nathans cash and cash equivalents aggregated  earnings on these cash and cash equivalents would increase or decrease by approximately  per annum for each 
change in interest rates 
marketable investment securities we have invested our marketable investment securities in intermediate term  fixed rate  highly rated and highly liquid instruments 
these investments are subject to fluctuations in interest rates 
as of march   the market value of nathans marketable investment securities aggregated  interest income on these marketable investment securities would increase or decrease by approximately  per annum for each 
change in interest rates 
the following chart presents the hypothetical changes in the fair value of the marketable investment securities held at march  that are sensitive to interest rate fluctuations in thousands valuation of securities valuation of securities given an interest rate given an interest rate decrease of x basis points fair increase of x basis points bps bps bps value bps bps bps municipal notes and bonds        borrowings the interest rate on our borrowings are generally determined based upon the prime rate and may be subject to market fluctuation as the prime rate changes as determined within each specific agreement 
we do not anticipate entering into interest rate swaps or other financial instruments to hedge our borrowings 
at march   total outstanding debt  including capital leases  aggregated  of which  is at risk due to changes in interest rates 
the current interest rate is per annum and will adjust in january and to prime plus 
nathan s also maintains a  credit line which bears interest at the prime rate plus at may  
nathan s has never borrowed any funds under its line of credit 
accordingly  nathan s does not believe that fluctuations in interest rates would have a material impact on its financial results 
commodity costs the cost of commodities are subject to market fluctuation 
we have not attempted to hedge against fluctuations in the prices of the commodities we purchase using future  forward  option or other instruments 
as a result  our future commodities purchases are subject to changes in the prices of such commodities 
generally  we attempt to pass through permanent increases in our commodity prices to our customers  thereby reducing the impact of long term increases on our financial results 
during the fifty two week period ended march   the price of our beef products has risen dramatically over historical norms and particularly as compared to last year 
this increase has been caused by reductions in the supply of beef primarily due to the prohibition since may on importing of canadian beef livestock into the us the decrease in imports of australian beef due to local drought conditions and the export of us beef had increased through december  when the first case of bovine spongiform encephalopathy  otherwise known as bse in the united states was reported 
nathan s has not experienced a softening in the price of beef since december  although the export of beef by the united states was significantly reduced as a result of this finding  nathan s had not realized a reduction in the cost of beef during the fourth quarter of fiscal as a result  nathan s cost of its hot dogs was approximately higher during the fifty two weeks ended march  than the fifty two weeks ended march  nathan s had already increased menu prices in its company operated restaurants by approximately and had increased prices within its branded product program to offset some of the margin pressure 
a short term increase or decrease of in the cost of our food and paper products for the entire fifty two weeks ended march  would have increased or decreased cost of sales by approximately  on december   the united states department of agriculture usda announced that the first case of bovine spongiform encephalopathy  otherwise known as bse  or mad cow disease was discovered in the united states in a single cow in the state of washington 
nathan s has obtained written assurances from its beef processors that nathan s products have not come from the meat processing plants associated with the production of products having to do with this incident 
to date  nathan s demand for its products continues to be strong 
nathan s has not experienced any material financial impact in connection with this incident 
foreign currencies foreign franchisees generally conduct business with us and make payments in united states dollars  reducing the risks inherent with changes in the values of foreign currencies 
as a result  we have not purchased future contracts  options or other instruments to hedge against changes in values of foreign currencies and we do not believe fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies would have a material impact on our financial results 
forward looking statement certain statements contained in this report are forward looking statements 
forward looking statements represent our current judgment regarding future events 
although we would not make forward looking statements unless we believe we have a reasonable basis for doing so  we cannot guarantee their accuracy and actual results may differ materially from those we anticipated due to a number of uncertainties  many of which we are not aware 
these risks and uncertainties  many of which are not within our control  include  but are not limited to the future effects of the first case of bovine spongiform encephalopathy  bse  identified in the united states on december   economic  weather  legislative and business conditions  the collectibility of receivables  the availability of suitable restaurant sites on reasonable rental terms  changes in consumer tastes  the ability to continue to attract franchisees  the ability to purchase our primary food and paper products at reasonable prices  no material increases in the minimum wage  and our ability to attract competent restaurant and managerial personnel
