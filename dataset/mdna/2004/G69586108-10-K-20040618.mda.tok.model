the remaining accrual in excess of amounts paid was reversed during the year ended march  
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation overview we are a leading supplier of precision engineered packaging products for the storage  transportation and automated handling of semiconductor devices and other electronic components 
our products are designed to interface with automated handling equipment used in the production and testing of semiconductor and electronic products 
we produce principally matrix and disk drive trays  carrier tapes  reels  and shipping tubes 
we also produce leadframe boxes and interleaves used in the storage and transportation of leadframes 
in addition  we collect and sell recycled matrix trays using the name semicycle 
we primarily derive our revenue from the sale of these products 
during fiscal  we experienced an increase in demand for products servicing the semiconductor business segment 
unit volumes increased and  while prices declined generally  the rate of decline was less than the two prior years 
disk drive tray sales fell as our major customer in this segment experienced unforeseen delays in the introduction of new products 
late in the year  petroleum prices increased significantly 
as we are largely dependent on raw materials that are extracted from petroleum  we saw a substantial degradation of gross margin as a percent of sales 
we are working on ways to mitigate this increase in raw material costs during fiscal the following information is based on  and should be read with  our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report 
our consolidated net sales increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  and to million in fiscal  reflecting primarily the gradual recovery of the semiconductor industry in fiscal and fiscal our consolidated net loss increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  primarily due to the asset impairment charge of million 
our consolidated net loss decreased to million in fiscal primarily due to increased factory utilization offset by increased raw material costs and reduced expenses due to absence of an asset impairment in fiscal the asset impairment charge in fiscal was million 
critical accounting policies in preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  we must make a variety of estimates that affect the reported amounts and related disclosures 
the following accounting policies are currently considered most critical to the preparation of our financial statements 
if actual results differ significantly from management s estimates and projections  there could be a material effect on our financial statements 
revenue recognition our revenue is recognized when product has been shipped and title to the product has transferred to the customer 
title of the product may transfer to the end customer or distributor when shipped or when received by the customer based on a specific agreement 
we evaluate the provision for estimated returns monthly  based on historical sales and returns 
to date we have not experienced significant returns 
any increase in the level of returns could have a material and adverse effect on our financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts allowance for doubtful accounts is made against accounts receivable to the extent they are considered to be doubtful 
accounts receivable in the balance sheet are stated net of such provision 
we evaluate the collectability of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligation to us  we record a specific reserve for bad debts against amounts due 
a provision is also made based on the aging of the receivables 
if circumstances change  such as 
table of contents the incurrence of higher than expected defaults or an unexpected material adverse change occurs regarding a major customer s ability to meet its financial obligations to us  our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us could be reduced by a material amount 
inventory valuation we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
at each balance sheet date  inventory on hand in excess of one year s demand or usage or those that were produced more than twelve months ago  are written down to zero 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional write downs may be required 
valuation of long lived assets we assess the carrying value of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant under performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the asset  significant negative industry or economic trends  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 
upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we test such assets for a potential impairment 
the carrying value of a long lived asset is considered impaired when the estimated future cash flows  undiscounted  are less than the asset s carrying value 
in that event  a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair market value of the long lived asset 
fair market value is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved 
asset to be disposed of by sale asset to be disposed of by sale represents the factory under construction in shenzhen  the prc  together with the land use right on which the building is built and is stated at fair value less cost to sell as of the balance sheet date in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for the impairment of disposal of long lived assets 
fair value was calculated on the basis of a professional valuation report on the property provided by an independent appraiser 
deferred taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes and tax bases of assets and liabilities in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves us estimating our current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and  to the extent we believe that recovery is more unlikely than likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
any change in the future recoverability of the deferred tax assets could significantly affect the results of our operations or cash flows 

table of contents results of operations cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold primarily consists of costs of raw materials  labor and manufacturing overhead 
operating expenses 
selling and marketing expenses primarily consist of freight and delivery costs  salaries and allowances 
general and administrative expenses primarily consist of salaries and allowances and legal  professional and consulting fees 
research and development expenses primarily consist of raw material costs  salaries and fixed assets depreciation 
the following table sets forth  for the years indicated  certain of our income statement items as a percentage of net sales 
year ended march  net sales cost of goods sold operating expenses selling and marketing general and administrative research and development asset impairment loss from operations other income expense  net interest income  net income loss before income taxes income tax expense net loss fiscal compared to fiscal net sales 
revenues increased by million or to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase resulted from greater demand across all products  except for disk drive trays 
revenue from sales of our ic trays increased by 
volume increased by while average selling price dropped by which decrease was not as dramatic as the drop from fiscal to revenue from sales of our disk drive trays decreased by driven mainly by a drop in volume by while average selling price increased 
the decrease in volume for disk drive trays was primarily due to decreased demand for such trays 
revenue from sales of our carrier tape products increased by compared to last year primarily due to a volume increase of compared to the prior year 
revenue from sales of our tube products increased by reflecting a increase in volume offset by an average selling price decline of as a result of a change in product sales mix 
the reduction in the average selling price of our products was mainly due to product and customer mix changes 
gross profit 
gross profit for fiscal increased to million from million in fiscal  an increase of 
gross margin improved to in fiscal from in fiscal  reflecting more efficient utilization of factory capacity as volumes increased  the benefit of which was partly offset by an aggregate reduction of in the average selling price of our products and an increase of in the cost of raw materials 
loss from operations 
an operating loss of million was recorded for fiscal compared to a loss of million recorded for fiscal  which included an asset impairment charge of million 

table of contents asset impairment 
an asset impairment charge of million was recorded in fiscal due to the decline in the fair value of the unoccupied factory building in shenzhen  the prc  as it was reclassified to an asset to be disposed of by sale 
no such charge was recorded in fiscal a valuation of the building by an independent appraiser on april  showed the value of this asset in fiscal to be the same as that of fiscal we have been actively marketing the building since we decided to sell it 
selling and marketing expenses 
selling and marketing expenses increased by or million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this increase is primarily due to increases in freight  storage  traveling and staff costs associated with the increased shipment of our products  as well as increased office rent 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased by or million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal primarily due to savings in salary  legal and professional expenses and office rent 
other income expenses  net 
other income expenses  net is comprised of foreign currency gains and losses and amounts collected as a result of a judgment in favor of the company against a former officer 
other income expenses  net increased by  or  from an expense of  in fiscal to an income of  in fiscal as a weaker dollar at certain times during the year and  collected in partial payment of a judgment against a former officer of the company 
interest income  net 
interest income  net decreased by  or  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal  primarily due to the reduction in bank deposit balances and reductions in interest rates for such deposits 
net loss 
net loss decreased from million in fiscal to a net loss of million in fiscal  reflecting all the above factors 
fiscal compared to fiscal net sales 
revenues increased by million or to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase resulted from greater demand across all products  but particularly disk drive trays 
revenue from sales of ic trays increased by 
volume increased by while average selling price dropped by 
this drop in average selling price compared favorably to the drop from fiscal to revenue from sales of disk drive trays increased year over year by driven mainly by a doubling of volume while average selling price dropped 
revenue from sales of our carrier tape products increased by compared to fiscal primarily driven by a volume increase of compared to the prior year 
revenue from sales of our tube products increased by reflecting a increase in volume offset by an average selling price decline of 
the reduction in the average selling price of our products was mainly due to product and customer mix changes

gross profit for fiscal increased to million from million in fiscal  a improvement 
gross margin improved to in fiscal from in fiscal  reflecting more efficient utilization of factory capacity as volumes increased  the benefit of which was partly offset by reductions in the average selling price of our products 
loss from operations 
an operating loss of million was recorded for fiscal compared to a loss of million recorded for fiscal  mainly due to an asset impairment charge of million recorded in fiscal and an increase in selling and marketing expenses 
asset impairment 
an asset impairment charge of million was recorded in fiscal due to the decline in the fair value of the unoccupied factory building in shenzhen  the prc  as it was reclassified to an asset to be disposed of by sale 
no such charge was recorded in fiscal 
table of contents selling and marketing expenses 
selling and marketing expenses increased by or million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this increase is primarily due to increases in freight and storage costs associated with the increased shipment of our products and additional staffing of our advanced products group 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased by or million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal due primarily to savings in salary  legal expenses and office rent 
savings in salary and rental expense were achieved as a result of our downsizing efforts in reducing headcount and subleasing of surplus office space 
other expenses  net 
other expenses arise typically from foreign currency gains and losses 
other expenses  net decreased by  or  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal as a result of a stronger dollar at certain times during the year 
interest income  net 
interest income  net decreased by  or  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal  primarily due to the reduction in bank deposit balances and reductions in interest rates for such deposits 
net loss 
net loss of million in fiscal increased to a net loss of million in fiscal  reflecting all the above factors 
liquidity and capital resources we historically met a significant portion of our cash requirements from cash flow from operations and we expect this to continue in fiscal in fiscal  we generated million from the sale of shares of our common stock 
our primary uses of cash have been to fund capital expenditures related to the expansion of our facilities and operations and working capital requirements 
we intend to continue to retain our earnings to finance the development and expansion of our business operations and do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future 
as of march   cash and cash equivalents were million  a decrease of million as compared to cash and cash equivalents of million as of march  our net cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal  compared to a net cash usage of  in fiscal and a net cash provision of million in fiscal the increase in cash provided by operating activities during fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily caused by an operating loss incurred during fiscal the decrease in cash provided by operating activities during fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily caused by the purchase of tax reserve certificates totaling million during fiscal as a condition stipulated by the hong kong tax authorities while we pursue our offshore claim 
our net cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal net cash used in investing activities primarily consisted of capital expenditures of million  million and million for the acquisition of new equipment in our current facility during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the increase in capital expenditure during fiscal reflected capacity expansion due to the increase in economic activity in the semiconductor industry 
as of march   we had commitments for capital expenditures of million 
the actual amounts of capital expenditures may vary substantially from those budgeted or estimated for a variety of reasons  including changes in market conditions  unavailability or changes in scheduled delivery of specific equipment  changes in interest rates and other factors 
in addition  we plan to continue to expand capacity in future periods and plan to fund such expansion through our current cash reserves  future cash flow from operations and new bank borrowings as required 
we lease office and warehouse facilities under various leases that expire through total future minimum commitments under these leases amount to approximately million 

table of contents as of march   we had no outstanding indebtedness 
for more information  see note of notes to our consolidated financial statements 
according to customs rules in the prc  it is possible that we may be subject to classification by the chinese customs authorities in a manner that would require us to supply a substantial bond against customs duties that we would have to pay if we were importing material for ultimate sale in the prc 
if the customs authorities of the prc require us to post a bond in connection with our exemption status from prc duties on imported raw materials for export sales  and exported products  we will experience a substantial drain of our cash resources 
net cash used in financing activities was million in fiscal  compared to a cash provision of  in fiscal and a net usage of million in fiscal net cash used in financing activities was primarily used to repurchase shares of our common stock in fiscal and to repurchase shares of common stock and trends in fiscal in september  our board of directors authorized the repurchase  at management s discretion  of up to million worth of our common stock at prices not to exceed of our net asset value per share 
common stock repurchased was cancelled immediately 
during the years ended march   and  we repurchased   and  shares of common stock  respectively  at an average cost of  and respectively per share 
in addition  pursuant to an offer by us to purchase up to  trends  on may    trends were tendered by their holders to us and were purchased by us at each 
as of march   our principal source of liquidity consisted of million in cash and cash equivalents 
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and anticipated cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs in the ordinary course of business for at least the next months 
if our existing cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operations is insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may seek to sell additional public or private equity securities or obtain debt financing 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available at all  or if available  will be obtained on terms favorable to us 
additional financing may also be dilutive to our existing shareholders 
the company does not use off balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities or related parties  nor does it use other forms of off balance sheet arrangements such as research and development arrangements 
accordingly  the company s liquidity and capital resources are not subject to off balance sheet risks from unconsolidated entities 
from time to time  we may evaluate possible investments or acquisitions and may  if a suitable opportunity arises  make such an investment or acquisition 
we currently have no commitments to make any material investments or acquisitions 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of march   our future fixed commitments are as follows in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years operating leases purchase orders total pvc compound price pvc compound  the principal material used in the manufacture of our tubes  accounted for  and of our total raw material costs in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
while we believe  
table of contents primarily as a result of increased production capacity by suppliers  that a severe shortage in the supply of pvc compound is unlikely to occur in the foreseeable future  there can be no assurance that such shortage will not occur 
any price increases would result in higher costs  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
we currently maintain approximately two to three months stock of pvc compound and other raw materials used in our production processes  and increase such stock when we believe prices are favorable 
we do not  and do not intend to  enter into future contracts or use any financial instruments to hedge our exposure to fluctuations in the price of pvc compound or other raw materials used in our production processes 
hong kong profits tax we  through our subsidiary in hong kong  operate a manufacturing plant in the prc pursuant to a contract processing agreement entered into with a prc party 
according to the tax guidelines issued by the tax authority in situations where a hong kong company manufactures goods partly in hong kong and partly outside hong kong  the inland revenue department of hong kong ird may accept profits that relate to the manufacture of the goods outside hong kong to be offshore in nature and therefore not subject to hong kong profits tax 
the offshore claim would only be allowed by the ird by way of concession and provided that certain criteria are met to their satisfaction 
however  we believe that most of our manufacturing activities were conducted outside hong kong and therefore since fiscal  we have apportioned a substantial amount of our profits to to activities outside hong kong for tax filing purposes 
since fiscal  there has been a dispute with the ird in relation to the apportionment basis of the profit derived from manufacturing activities outside hong kong 
we have raised a number of objections to the tax assessments and are examining factors that the ird uses to ascertain the geographic nature of our activities and sources of the profits 
our tax position has therefore not been finalized since fiscal year although the dispute is on going  we have made provisions for taxation according to the apportionment basis based on practices normally acceptable by the ird in general cases 
interest associated with the tax payable for fiscal years to has also been accrued 
in the event we do not prevail on these issues  we believe that the aggregate amount of our exposure is approximately million plus interest in the amount of million 
we estimated our expenses using the apportionment basis based on practices normally acceptable by the ird in general cases  as well as current ird practices and publications 
the total of the above two amounts has been fully accrued as of march  in connection with the above  the ird has requested that we place tax reserve certificates of million with the tax authority as of march   which could be recovered if we prevail

factors that may affect operating results the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
if an adverse outcome of any of the following risks actually occurs  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
in evaluating our business  shareholders should consider carefully the following factors in addition to the other information presented herein 
our operating results are difficult to predict and are likely to fluctuate significantly based on several factors  which can cause our stock price to decline 
our operating results are affected by a wide variety of factors that could materially affect net sales and profitability or lead to significant fluctuations in our quarterly or annual operating results 
these factors include  among others the price of raw materials  the majority of which are petroleum derivatives  factors relating to conditions in the semiconductor  disk drive and electronic industries including lower demand for products  increased price competition  downturns and deterioration of business conditions  technological changes  and changes in production processes in the semiconductor and electronic industries which could require changes in packaging products  capital requirements and the availability of funding  our expansion plan and possible disruptions caused by the installation of new equipment or the construction of new facilities  the lack of long term purchase or supply agreements with customers  the loss of key personnel or the shortage of available skilled employees  our ability to sell our new plant that is substantially completed  
table of contents international political or economic events or developments  including those relating to hong kong and the prc  production volume fluctuations and the management of our inventories  currency fluctuations  the reoccurrence of sars or other major health issues in asia  the outcome of patent litigation in taiwan  and the imposition of fines  penalties and bonds required by the prc due to violations of its rules and regulations 
unfavorable changes in the above or other factors could substantially harm our results of operations or financial condition 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations will not necessarily be meaningful 
you should not rely on these comparisons as an indication of our future performance 
if our results of operations in one or more periods fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts or investors  the trading price of our common stock may decline  possibly by a significant amount 
we depend on the health of the semiconductor  disk drive and electronics industries which are highly cyclical and the decline in demand for products in these industries could severely affect our net sales and financial results 
our net sales depend on increased demand for our products from manufacturers of semiconductor  disk drive and electronic components 
any deterioration of business conditions in the semiconductor industry  including lower demand for semiconductor products  decreased unit volume of semiconductor products shipped or other factors resulting in decreased demand for packaging products  or increased price competition in the semiconductor industry could result in increased price pressure on suppliers to the semiconductor industry  and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
the industries we serve are characterized by rapid technological change leading to more complex products  evolving industry standards  intense competition and fluctuations in demand 
from time to time  demand for electronic systems  which generally include both semiconductors and electronic components  has suffered significant downturns  which in some cases have been prolonged 
these downturns have been characterized by diminished product demand  product over capacity and accelerated erosion of average selling prices 
any future downturn in the semiconductor or disk drive or electronics industries may substantially harm our results of operations or financial condition 
our customer base is concentrated and the loss of one or more of our key customers would harm our business 
our top customers together accounted for  and of our net sales in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
we are dependent upon a single customer  seagate technology  for substantially all sales of our disk drive trays  with whom we have no long term contract 
in addition  in fiscal  ase accounted for of our net sales 
like seagate technology  we do not have a long term contract with ase 
our ability to maintain close  mutually beneficial relationships with our leading customers is important to the ongoing growth and profitability of our business 
although our sales to specific customers have varied from year to year  our results of operations have been dependent on a number of significant customers and the conditions of their respective industries 
all of our customers operate in the global semiconductor  disk drive and electronic industries which historically have been highly cyclical 
as a result of the concentration of our customer base  the loss or cancellation of business from  or significant changes in scheduled deliveries or decreases in the prices of products or services provided to  any of these customers could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
our sales are made pursuant to purchase orders  and therefore  we generally have no agreements with or commitments from our customers for the purchase of products 
although customers typically provide us with forecasts of their requirements  these forecasts are not binding 
our customers may not maintain or increase their sales volumes or orders for our products and we may be unable to maintain or add to our existing customer base 

table of contents our operations are concentrated in the people s republic of china and we are subject to the risks associated with international operations  which may negatively affect our business 
as of march   substantially all of our fixed assets and inventories were located in shenzhen  the prc 
our main production facilities are located in shenzhen  the prc and are operated by an unaffiliated prc company under a processing agreement  pursuant to which this company provides all of the personnel for the operation of our facilities and renders assistance in dealing with matters relating to the import of raw materials and the export of our products 
our existing production facilities in shenzhen  the prc are located on land leased from the prc government by one of our wholly owned subsidiaries under land use certificates and agreements with a remaining term of approximately years 
our assets and facilities located in the prc and the prc company s operation of these facilities are subject to the laws and regulations of the prc and our results of operations in the prc are subject to the economic and political situation in the prc 
the operations of our production facilities in shenzhen  the prc may be adversely affected by changes in the laws and regulations of the prc or the interpretation thereof  such as those relating to taxation  import and export tariffs  environmental regulations  land use rights  property and other matters 
prior to september  we exported all the products manufactured at our production facilities in shenzhen  the prc 
accordingly  we are not subject to certain prc taxes and are exempt from customs duties on imported raw materials and exported products 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we finished the procedure of setting up a wholly owned subsidiary in the prc and hence a small portion of our products was sold locally in the prc 
this newly established prc subsidiary is subject to prc taxes and customs duties on materials imported for such prc sales 
according to customs rules in the prc  it is possible that we may be subject to classification by the chinese customs authorities in a manner that would require us to supply a substantial bond against customs duties that we would have to pay if we were importing material for ultimate sale in the prc 
we may also be subject to significantly higher administrative importation costs generally 
these measures could harm our ability to manufacture products at a competitive price and our results of operations could suffer 
in addition  if we are required to post a bond in connection with our exemption status from prc duties on imported raw materials for export sales and exported products  we will experience a substantial drain of our liquid resources 
we cannot assure that we will be able to provide the required bond at a commercially feasible cost  or at all 
we may become subject to prc taxes and may be required to pay customs duties in the future even under the contract processing agreement 
if we are required to pay prc taxes or customs duties  our results of operations could suffer 
we believe that our operations in shenzhen  the prc are now in compliance with the applicable prc legal and regulatory requirements 
however  we cannot assure that the central or local governments of the prc will not impose new  stricter regulations or interpretations of existing regulations which would require additional expenditures 
the economy of the prc differs from the economies of other countries in many respects such as structure  government involvement  level of development  growth rate  capital reinvestment  allocation of resources  self sufficiency  rate of inflation and balance of payments position  among others 
in the past  the economy of the prc has been primarily a planned economy subject to state plans 
since the entry of the prc into the world trade organization in  the prc government has been reforming its economic and political systems 
these reforms have resulted in significant economic growth and social change 
we cannot assure  however  that the prc government s policies for economic reforms will be consistent or effective 
our results of operations and financial position may be harmed by changes in the prc s political  economic or social conditions 
we have in the past and may in the future  be party to legal proceedings that could have a negative financial impact on us 
we have had in recent years a number of lawsuits filed against us  including securities class action litigation  as well as other lawsuits related to intellectual property infringement and employee terminations 
while these lawsuits vary greatly in the materiality of potential liability associated with them  the uncertainty 
table of contents associated with substantial unresolved lawsuits could seriously harm our business  financial condition and reputation  whether material individually or in the aggregate 
in particular  this uncertainty could harm our relationships with existing customers  our ability to obtain new customers and our ability to operate certain aspects of our business 
the continued defense of the lawsuits also could result in continued diversion of our management s time and attention away from business operations  which could harm our business 
negative developments with respect to the lawsuits could cause the price of our common stock to decline significantly 
in addition  although we are unable to determine the amount  if any  that we may be required to pay in connection with the resolution of these lawsuits by settlement or otherwise  the size of any such payments  individually or in the aggregate  could seriously harm our financial condition 
many of the complaints associated with these lawsuits do not specify the amount of damages that plaintiffs seek 
as a result  we are unable to estimate the possible range of damages that might be incurred as a result of the lawsuits 
for more information about the specific claims filed against us  please see item entitled legal proceedings 
a significant portion of our business is conducted in the asia pacific region 
this concentration could expose us to risks inherent to doing business in the asia pacific region that could harm our business 
a significant portion of our net sales are derived from sales to customers in hong kong  singapore  taiwan  the philippines and other countries in east and southeast asia  or the asia pacific region 
accordingly  our financial condition and results of operations and the market price of shares of our common stock may be affected by economic and political instability  changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs  customs  duties and other trade barriers  transportation delays  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  currency convertibility and repatriation  taxation of our earnings and the earnings of our personnel  the reoccurrence of sars or other major health issues  and other risks relating to changes  administration or new interpretations of laws  regulations and policies in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business 
none of these factors are within our control 
in fiscal  many countries in the asia pacific region experienced considerable currency volatility and depreciation  high interest rates  stock market volatility and declining asset values which contributed to net foreign capital outflows  an increase in the number of insolvencies  a decline in business and consumer spending and a decrease in economic growth as compared with prior years 
consumer demand for products that use semiconductors  disk drives and electronic components generally rises as the overall level of economic activity increases and falls as such activity decreases 
in addition  currency devaluations in the asia pacific region could result in accelerated price erosion of semiconductor and electronic products as products manufactured in countries whose currencies have devalued significantly against the us dollar become less expensive in us dollar terms 
any adverse effect on the global semiconductor  disk drive and electronic industries as a result of lower demand for products in the asia pacific region or accelerated product price erosion arising from currency devaluations in the asia pacific region could harm our financial condition or results of operations 
we are incorporated under the laws of bermuda and there may be potential difficulties in protecting our shareholders rights 
we are incorporated under the laws of bermuda and our corporate affairs are governed by our memorandum of association and bye laws and by the laws governing corporations incorporated in bermuda 

table of contents the rights of our shareholders and the responsibilities of members of our board of directors under bermuda law are different from those applicable to a corporation incorporated in the united states and  therefore  our shareholders may have more difficulty protecting their interests in connection with actions by our management  members of our board of directors or our principal shareholder than they would as shareholders of a corporation incorporated in the united states 
our stock price has been and will likely continue to be volatile  and you may be unable to resell your shares at or above the price you paid 
our stock price has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile 
our stock price could fluctuate significantly due to a number of factors  including variations in our actual or anticipated operating results  sales of substantial amounts of our stock  announcements about us or about our competitors  including technological innovation or new products or services  litigation and other developments relating to our patents or other proprietary rights or those of our competitors  conditions in the semiconductor  disk drive and electronic industries  governmental regulations and legislation  international political or economic events or developments  including those relating to hong kong and the prc  the reoccurrence of sars or other major health issues  and changes in securities analysts estimates of our performance  or our failure to meet analysts expectations 
many of these factors are beyond our control 
in addition  the stock markets in general  and the nasdaq national market in particular  have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations recently 
these fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies 
these broad market and industry factors may decrease the market price of our common stock  regardless of our actual operating performance 
in the past  companies that have experienced volatility in the market prices of their stock have been the object of securities class action litigation 
if we were the object of other securities class action litigation  it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources  which could affect our financial performance

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk currency exchange rate fluctuations our sales are denominated primarily in us dollars while our cost of goods sold are generally incurred in us dollars  hong kong dollars and renminbi  and our operating expenses are generally denominated in renminbi  hong kong dollars  singapore dollars  new taiwanese dollars and us dollars 
in addition  a substantial portion of our capital expenditures  primarily for the purchase of equipment  has been and is expected to continue to be denominated in us dollars  renminbi and japanese yen 
consequently  a portion of our costs and operating margins may be affected by fluctuations in exchange rates  primarily between the us dollar and other currencies 
our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates or the imposition of new or additional currency controls in the jurisdictions in which we operate 
primarily in response to recent developments in the southeast asian currency markets  we from time to time engage in derivative trading activities  such as entering into forward contracts  to hedge our currency exchange exposure 
we do not utilize market risk sensitive instruments for speculative purposes 
at march  and  we had no outstanding foreign exchange contracts 
many of our competitors are located in countries whose currencies devalued significantly against the us dollar beginning in the second half of as a result of such devaluation  these competitors products have become less expensive in us dollar terms 
this reduction could result in our customers purchasing products from these competitors rather than from us  which would have a material and adverse effect on our net sales and results of operations 
as the hong kong dollar is officially pegged to the us dollar and the renminbi is controlled by the prc government such that it only trades within a limited range against the us dollar  unless there are significant changes in the policies of the hong kong and the prc government  fluctuations in the exchange rates of the hong kong dollar and the renminbi are not expected to have a significant impact on our results of operations
