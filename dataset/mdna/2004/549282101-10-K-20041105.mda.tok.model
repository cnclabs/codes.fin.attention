item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal sales increased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal of the increase  million was due to a increase in same store sales 
see same store sales under trends and uncertainties for the definition of same store sales 
this increase was offset by a decrease in sales of million related to five stores closed prior to the adoption of the business plan  which therefore were not reclassified into discontinued operations 
despite store closures and the effects of increased competition in the marketplace  sales performance has improved 
promotions  new combination meals  and improved product and service execution have all contributed to this overall increase in sales 
cost of food increased  or  principally due to the increase in sales in fiscal compared to fiscal upward pressure on beef pricing due to lower production numbers  reduced cattle weights  and an overall higher demand has negatively impacted food cost 
despite general commodity increases in food pricing  specifically related to the beef and dairy markets  food costs have experienced a slight decline as a percentage of sales  which decreased from to 
management s discipline in the utilization of monthly budgeting and protein tracking tools in combination with various promotional offerings have assisted in reducing food costs 
more specifically  food costs have declined in a higher commodity climate due to improved execution at each location in combination with carefully selected entree offerings for promotions which overall have very attractive cost structures 
payroll and related costs decreased million  or  and as a percentage of sales decreased from to 
the decrease is due to continued improvements made in labor deployment and efficiency as a result of various company initiatives to better manage labor costs  offset by an increase in estimated workers compensation costs 
occupancy and other operating expenses increased million  or  due primarily to increased advertising expense and higher insurance costs 
occupancy and other operating expenses  as a percentage of sales  increased to from 
the launch of the company s new marketing campaign  featuring television advertising  led to an increase in marketing costs 
insurance costs increased as a result of higher cost of insurance coverage and related premiums 
these increases were primarily offset by a reduction in property tax expense due to store closures and related property sales 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased  or  due to fewer depreciable properties resulting from impairments and property sales 
due to the current year accrual of voluntary severance costs in relation to the relocation of the corporate offices from san antonio  texas  to houston  texas  voluntary severance costs increased by  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information 
general and administrative expenses decreased million  or 
as a percentage of sales  general and administrative expenses decreased to compared to 
this decrease is due to fewer regional management positions due to store closures 
it is also a result of lower professional and consulting services fees associated with a fixed asset cost segregation study on tax depreciation and consulting fees related to the debt refinancing  both of which occurred in the prior year 
the provision for asset impairments and restaurant closings decreased by million primarily due to a gain realized on the sale of a property which had been previously impaired  coupled with significant impairment charges incurred in the prior year 
this provision included write downs to currently operating restaurants of million offset by a gain of  related to one property sale 
interest expense increased  or  due to the accelerated amortization of the subordinated debt discount resulting from the amended subordinated note agreements  coupled with an increase in the effective interest rate on outstanding debt prior to the debt refinancing in june subsequent to the debt refinancing  interest expense has declined principally due to lower amortization of the discount on the restructured subordinated debt  coupled with the effect of a lower senior debt balance 
other income decreased million primarily due to gains on sales of assets recognized in the prior year  which reflected the sale of five previously closed stores 
these gains were partially offset by a loan commitment fee expensed in fiscal no provision for income taxes on continuing operations was provided for in fiscal because the company s loss carryforward was sufficient to offset income from continuing operations 
the loss from discontinued operations decreased by million principally due to numerous impairment charges incurred in the prior year on various locations which were closed as a part of the company s business plan offset by ongoing periodic property maintenance costs incurred until the properties are sold 
fiscal compared to fiscal sales decreased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal of the total decline  million was due to the closure of restaurants since august   that were not included in the business plan and therefore were not reclassified into discontinued operations  and million was due to a decrease in same store sales 
these decreases were offset by the positive impact of two additional days of sales of million and the opening of three restaurants since august   that accounted for million in sales 
the cost of food increased million  or  and as a percentage of sales increased from to in fiscal compared to fiscal early in the fiscal year  the increase in food cost was related primarily to efforts to implement value offerings for the company s guests 
those offerings were a planned part of the company s strategy aimed at increasing value while maintaining quality 
also in the beginning of the year  fresh produce pricing was negatively impacted by increased transportation costs due to the higher cost of diesel fuel 
toward the end of the year  upward pressure on beef pricing due to lower availability  reduced cattle weights  and an overall higher demand negatively impacted food cost 
these increases completely offset reductions due to store closures 
even so  the increases were partially mitigated in the later part of the year by targeted cost control programs 
payroll and related costs decreased million  or  and as a percentage of sales decreased from to 
the decrease was due primarily to improved labor deployments and efficiencies resulting from various company initiatives to manage labor costs  lower workers compensation cost estimates resulting from the company s in house training and safety programs  and stores closed prior to the adoption of the business plan 
occupancy and other operating expenses decreased million  or 
as a percentage of sales  occupancy and other operating expenses increased to compared to 
several factors contributed to this fluctuation 
net repairs and maintenance costs decreased primarily due to increased efficiencies from the company s in house repair program as provided by its in house service center 
food to go packaging costs further declined due to less expensive packaging 
these decreases were partially offset by property employee insurance  which increased principally due to premium increases for owned properties coupled with pass through insurance adjustments from landlords of leased properties  as well as premium increases for directors and officers liability 
depreciation and amortization expense was approximately equal to the prior fiscal year  with a slight decrease of  general and administrative expenses increased million  or 
several factors contributed to this increase 
as a percentage of sales  general and administrative expenses increased to  compared to 
professional fees increased principally due to a fixed asset  cost segregation study on tax depreciation 
consulting costs increased principally due to fees paid to outside firms relating to the company s bank group 
excluding those items  the company showed higher year over year general and administrative expenses because of the increased investment in support personnel to improve its focus on operational efficiencies and facilities maintenance 
interest expense was approximately equal to the prior fiscal year  with only a slight decrease of  the payoff of loans on officers life insurance policies  which were surrendered during the prior year  in addition to amortization of the loss on interest rate swaps and principal reductions on the outstanding bank debt  contributed to this decrease 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in the effective interest rate on outstanding debt coupled with an increase in the amortization of the discount on the subordinated notes 
approximately million and million were reclassified from interest expense to discontinued operations in fiscal and  respectively 
these reclassifications related to the launch of the company s business plan whereby the proceeds from certain properties closed and sold are committed to paying down debt 
other income increased million primarily due to gains on the sales of assets  which reflect the sale of nine previously closed stores 
these gains were partially offset by a loan commitment fee expensed in fiscal the income tax benefit decreased by  no benefit was recorded in fiscal because the realization of loss carryforward utilization is uncertain 
the loss from discontinued operations increased by million principally due to approximately million in noncash impairments  with the remainder in carrying costs  allocated bank debt interest  and certain settlement fees incurred on various locations closed as part of the company s business plan 
the impairment charges included reductions in the fourth quarter of from gains on the disposal of properties previously held for sale 
relative to prior closure plans  the company had a reserve for restaurant closings of approximately million and million at august   and august   respectively 
excluding certain lease termination settlements  all material cash outlays required for the store closings originally planned as of august   were made prior to august  see further discussion in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
ebitda the company s operating performance is evaluated using several measures 
one of those measures  ebitda  is derived from the income loss from operations gaap measurement 
ebitda has historically been used by the company s lenders to measure compliance with certain financial debt covenants 
the company s senior debt agreements define ebitda as the consolidated income loss from operations set forth in the company s consolidated statements of operations before depreciation  amortization  other noncash expenses  interest expense  taxes  noncash income and extraordinary gains or losses  and other nonrecurring items of income or expense as approved by the required lenders 
ebitda increased by million from fiscal to compared to a decrease of million from fiscal to these net changes were due to various applicable reasons noted in the results of operations section above 
prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation 
year ended august  august  august  days days days in thousands income loss from operations plus excluded items provision for asset impairments and restaurant closings depreciation and amortization noncash executive compensation expense voluntary severance costs ebitda as noted previously  prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation  including the applicable reclassifications of store activity discontinued in accordance with the implementation of the business plan 
while the company and many in the financial community consider ebitda to be an important measure of operating performance  it should be considered in addition to  but not as a substitute for or superior to  other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  such as operating income and net income 
in addition  the company s definition of ebitda is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents and working capital cash and cash equivalents increased by  from the end of the preceding fiscal year to august   primarily due to improved cash management strategies 
short term investments decreased by million due to payments made to reduce the senior debt 
the company received a comprehensive income tax refund of million in the third quarter of fiscal that resulted from changes in tax legislation that extended carrybacks of net operating losses 
in addition  the refund was higher than the original fiscal estimate primarily due to increases in tax depreciation relative to an updated cost segregation study 
the company had a working capital deficit of million as of august   compared to million as of august  the improvement was primarily attributable to the reclassification of the debt to long term liabilities subsequent to the debt refinancing 
excluding the reclassification of the senior debt and subordinated notes explained in the debt section below  the company s working capital deficit increased million 
that increase in the deficit was primarily attributable to debt paydown and refinancing 
the company s working capital requirements are expected to be met through cash flows from operations and the available line of credit 
capital expenditures for the fiscal year ended august   were million 
consistent with prior fiscal years  the company used most of its capital funds to maintain its investment in existing operating units 
based on the business plan  the company again expects to be able to fund all capital expenditures in fiscal using cash flows from operations and expects to spend approximately million to million 
debt previous senior debt during the mid s  the company entered into a revolving line of credit with a group of four banks 
the line was primarily used for financing long term objectives  including capital acquisitions and a stock repurchase program 
these large demands of cash contributed to the capacity under that credit facility being fully exhausted in fiscal from march until the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company financed capital acquisitions and working capital needs through careful cash management and the provision of an additional million in subordinate financing from the company s ceo and the coo 
the additional subordinate financing was funded toward the end of fiscal although no further borrowings were allowed under the senior credit facility  the bank group subsequently authorized an extension of its maturity date  allowing the company time to seek a replacement to the credit facility that would provide the financing on more favorable terms 
during this period  the company implemented a new business plan that included the closure of certain underperforming stores and the use of proceeds from resulting property sales to pay down the line of credit 
new senior debt the company s failure to arrange replacement financing by the extended maturity date of the credit facility caused a technical default under that facility 
however in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company successfully refinanced the senior credit facility with two new instruments 
the first is a secured  three year line of credit for million 
of the total line  only million was originally drawn in connection with the refinancing 
this instrument was funded by a new group of independent lenders 
in addition to the new line of credit  the company concurrently negotiated another secured  three year term loan for million 
the term loan was funded by a third party financial institution not related to any member of the bank group that funded the new line of credit 
under the term loan agreement  no periodic principal payments are required other than net proceeds from properties currently marked for sale 
any balance remaining at the loan s maturity must be paid in full 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  as a result of the refinancing  the company s new senior debt was in good standing 
pursuant to the terms of the subordination and intercreditor agreement dated june   if the new senior debt were to be in default at some time in the future  chris and harris pappas have a contractual right but no obligation to purchase those loans 
at august   the company s outstanding senior debt balance was million 
from its new revolving line of credit  the company had an outstanding debt balance of million 
this level is down million from its original drawn amount of million  which occurred in june of the million reduction  million was derived from a sale leaseback of one property  and million was from excess cash 
from its term loan  the company had an outstanding debt balance of million 
this level is down million from its original note balance of million  which also occurred in june the reduction was primarily made with proceeds received on the sale of properties 
of the million total commitment under the line of credit  million was available to the company at august  additionally  as of august   the company has approximately million available under letters of credit through a separate arrangement with another bank 
both the new line of credit and the term loan contain financial performance covenants  provisions limiting the use of the company s cash  and descriptions of certain events of default that could be triggered by changes in the company s relationship with its ceo and its coo 
as the focus continues toward further strengthening operational and financial performance  management believes that the two new debt instruments will provide the proper level of financing to improve its liquidity 
additionally  the company expects to be able to maintain compliance with the specific requirements of each agreement 
as of august   million of the company s total book value  or of its total assets  was pledged as collateral 
these pledged assets included the company s owned real estate  improvements  equipment  and fixtures 
subordinated notes as mentioned earlier  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company s ceo  christopher j 
pappas  and harris j 
pappas  the company s coo  formally loaned the company a total of million in exchange for convertible subordinated notes 
while certain terms of the original notes have since been modified  they are still in place as of august   with maturity dates of june  at a stated conversion price of per shares  the notes are convertible into million shares of the company s common stock 
as a result of the amended subordinated note agreements  at the earlier of june   a default under the senior debt  or a change in control as defined in the amended notes  the conversion price will lower to per share for million shares 
because the stated conversion price represented a discount from the market price of the company s common stock on the commitment date  a beneficial conversion feature of million was created 
this was recorded as a discount to debt with an offset to paid in capital 
the discount is being amortized over the term of the notes through noncash charges to interest expense amounting to approximately million per year 
the company has agreed to reserve shares held in treasury for issuance to the holders of the subordinated notes upon conversion of the debt 
the company s treasury shares have also been reserved for two other purposes the issuance of shares to messrs 
pappas upon exercise of the options granted to them on march   and for shares issuable under the company s nonemployee director phantom stock plan 
in accordance with an agreement between messrs 
pappas and the company dated june   chris and harris pappas have agreed to limit their exercise of stock options to a number that will ensure the net treasury shares available are not exceeded 
pursuant to the terms of that agreement  the company indicated that it will use reasonable efforts to list on the new york stock exchange additional shares which would permit full exercise of those options 
net treasury shares available is defined in the debt agreements as the number of shares of common stock then held by the company in treasury  minus the number of shares of common stock issuable or issued after june   under the nonemployee director phantom stock plan  minus the number of shares of common stock issuable or issued upon conversion of the subordinated notes  calculated assuming the lowest conversion price stated in the subordinated notes 
commitments and contingencies officer loans in fiscal  the company guaranteed loans relating to purchases of luby s stock by various officers of the company pursuant to the terms of a shareholder approved plan 
under the officer loan program  shares were purchased and funding was provided by bank loans to the participating officers 
per the original terms of the guaranteed loan agreements  these instruments only required annual interest to be paid by the individual debtors  with the entire principal balances due upon their respective original maturity dates  which occurred during the period from january through march of as of august   the total of the principal balances due under these loans was approximately million 
the purchased company stock has been and can be used by borrowers to satisfy a portion of their loan obligation 
as of august   based on the market price on that day  approximately  or of the note balances  co uld have been covered by stock  while approximately  or  would have remained outstanding 
in connection with the renegotiation of its senior debt  the company arranged for the issuance of a letter of credit  entered into on june   for approximately million 
that amount is intended as an estimate to cover principal and cumulative accrued interest that was due as of september  after that date  jpmorgan chase bank can use the letter of credit to draw on the current line of credit to pay down any portion of the unpaid officer loans  as well as the accrued interest  for any loans that are in default 
as of the date of this report  jpmorgan chase bank has not taken any action to draw upon the letter of credit 
in anticipation of the maturity of its obligation to purchase the loans  the company worked out settlement agreements with several of the debtors pursuant to which the company would contribute up to  under the terms of the settlement agreement 
as of august   the company has recognized a liability of  in accrued expenses and other liabilities 
off balance sheet arrangements the company has no off balance sheet structured financing arrangements  however  under the terms of applicable sec rules  the company s obligation to repurchase the officer loans could be deemed a guarantee contract  which the sec considers an off balance sheet arrangement 
if the company is required to purchase the officer loans  it would have a maximum cash payout exposure of approximately million 
contractual obligations as of august   the company had contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as described below 
payments due by period less than after contractual obligations total year years years years in thousands long term debt obligations a capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term obligations total amount of commitment by expiration period fiscal year fiscal years fiscal years other commercial commitments total thereafter b in thousands letters of credit surety bonds b total a the note holders have the option to convert the subordinated notes to common stock prior to the expiration date 
b surety bonds have been placed as a means of collateral for certain prior year workers compensation policies 
these surety bonds have an effective date of june   and remain in full force and effect until cancelled 
effective september   the bonds were reduced to approximately million  commensurate with a decrease in collateral requirements 
in addition to the commitments represented in the above tables  the company enters into a number of cancelable and noncancelable commitments during the year 
typically  these commitments are for less than a year in duration and are generally focused on food inventory 
the company does not maintain any long term or exclusive commitments or arrangements to purchase products from any single supplier 
substantially all of the company s product purchase commitments are cancelable up to days prior to the vendor s scheduled shipment date 
long term liabilities reflected in the company s consolidated financial statements as of august   included deferred income taxes million  deferred gain on the sale of property  amounts accrued for benefit payments under the company s supplemental executive retirement plan  and deferred compensation agreements  accrued insurance reserves million  and reserve for restaurant closings the company is also contractually obligated to the chief executive officer and the chief operating officer pursuant to employment agreements 
see the related parties section of affiliations and related parties for further information 
affiliations and related parties affiliations the company entered into an affiliate services agreement effective august   with two companies  pappas partners  lp and pappas restaurants  inc  which are restaurant entities owned by christopher j 
pappas and harris j 
pappas 
that agreement  as amended on july   limited the scope of expenditures therein to professional and consulting services 
the company completed this amendment due to a significant decline in the use of professional and consulting services from pappas entities 
additionally  on july   the company entered into a master sales agreement with the same pappas entities 
through this agreement  the company contractually separated the design and fabrication of equipment and furnishings from the affiliate services agreement 
the master sales agreement covers the costs incurred for modifications to existing equipment  as well as custom fabrication  including stainless steel stoves  shelving  rolling carts  and chef tables 
these items are custom designed and built to fit the designated kitchens and are also engineered to give a longer service life than comparably manufactured equipment 
the pricing of equipment  repair  and maintenance is set and evaluated periodically and is considered by management to be primarily at or below market for comparable goods and services 
to assist in periodically monitoring pricing of the transactions associated with the master sales agreement and the affiliate services agreement  the finance and audit committee of the company s board of directors has periodically in the past used independent valuation consultants 
as part of the affiliation with the pappas entities  the company leases a facility  the houston service center  in which luby s has installed a centralized restaurant service center to support field operations 
the building at this location has  square feet of warehouse space and  square feet of office space 
it is leased from the pappas entities by the company at an approximate monthly rate of per square foot 
from this center  luby s repair and service teams are dispatched to the company s restaurants when facility or equipment maintenance and servicing are needed 
the facility is also used for repair and storage of new and used equipment 
the amount paid by the company pursuant to the terms of this lease was approximately   and  for fiscal   and  respectively 
the company previously leased a location from an unrelated third party 
that location is used to house increased equipment inventories due to store closures under the business plan 
the company considered it more prudent to lease this location rather than to pursue purchasing a storage facility  as its strategy is to focus its capital expenditures on its operating restaurants 
in a separate transaction  the third party property owner sold the location to the pappas entities during the fourth quarter of fiscal  with the pappas entities becoming the company s landlord for that location effective august  the storage site complements the houston service center with approximately  square feet of warehouse space at an approximate monthly rate of per square foot 
the amount paid by the company pursuant to the terms of this lease was approximately  for fiscal in another separate contract  pursuant to the terms of a ground lease dated march   the company paid rent to phcg investments for a luby s restaurant the company operated in dallas  texas  until that location was closed early in the third quarter of fiscal christopher j 
pappas and harris j 
pappas are general partners of phcg investments 
preceding the store s closure  the company entered into a lease termination agreement with a third party unaffiliated with the pappas entities 
that agreement severed the company s interest in the phcg property in exchange for a payment of cash to the company 
the company also obtained the right to remove fixtures and equipment from the premises  and it was released from any future obligations under the lease agreement 
the closing of the transaction was completed during the third quarter of fiscal  resulting in a gain of  and the gross proceeds were used to pay down debt 
the amount paid by the company pursuant to the terms of this lease before its termination was approximately  and  in fiscal and  respectively 
no costs were incurred under this lease in fiscal late in the third quarter of fiscal  chris and harris pappas became limited partners in a limited partnership which purchased a retail strip center in houston  texas 
messrs 
pappas own a limited partnership interest 
neither of messrs 
pappas own any interest in the general partner of the limited partnership 
the general partner of the limited partnership controls the operational decisions of the partnership 
one of the company s restaurants has rented approximately of the space in that center since july of no changes were made to the company s lease terms as a result of the transfer of ownership of the center to the new partnership 
the amount paid by the company pursuant to the terms of this lease since the pappas s inclusion as limited partners was  in fiscal management is under instruction that no amendments can be made to this lease without the approval of the finance and audit committee 
affiliated rents paid for the houston service center  the separate storage facility  the dallas property  and the houston property leases combined represented   and of total rents for continuing operations for fiscal   and  respectively 
the following compares current and prior fiscal year to date charges incurred under the master sales agreement  the affiliate services agreement  and affiliated property leases to the company s total capital expenditures  as well as relative general and administrative expenses and occupancy and other operating expenses included in continuing operations year ended august  august  august  days days days in thousands affiliated costs incurred general and administrative expenses professional and other costs capital expenditures custom fabricated and refurbished equipment occupancy and other operating expenses  including property leases less pass through amounts to third parties total relative total company costs general and administrative expenses capital expenditures occupancy and other operating expenses total affiliated costs incurred as a percentage of relative total company costs fiscal year to date inception to date related parties in june  new two year employment contracts were finalized for chris and harris pappas 
as in the past three years  they will both continue to devote their primary time and business efforts to luby s  while maintaining their roles at pappas restaurants  inc trends and uncertainties same store sales the restaurant business is highly competitive with respect to food quality  concept  location  price  and service  all of which may have an effect on same store sales 
the company s same store sales calculation measures the relative performance of a certain group of restaurants 
specifically  to qualify for inclusion in this group  a store must have been in operation for consecutive accounting periods 
although management believes this approach leads to more effective year over year comparisons  neither the time frame nor the exact practice may be similar to those used by other restaurant companies 
the following shows the same store sales change for comparative historical quarters fiscal fiscal fiscal q q q q q q q q q q q q the first quarter of fiscal includes september  in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal  the company was able to maintain its comparative cash flow level with declining sales by lowering operating costs 
even with national economic issues  such as military operations overseas and continued concerns about domestic terrorism  there was less quarterly same store sales variability in fiscal than in the prior fiscal year 
in fiscal  the company chose a strategy based on offering bundled combination meals in lieu of all you can eat promotions offered in the prior year 
the strategic change began to show positive results in the second quarter and continued through the fiscal year end 
additionally  the company s holiday promotions  which included a focus on thanksgiving and christmas in the second quarter and an emphasis on the entire lenten season in the third quarter  were critical in positively improving the company s same store sales performance 
the company is constantly seeking additional opportunities to lower costs and increase sales 
notwithstanding the positive results of the most recent three quarters  consistent future declines in same store sales could cause a reduction in operating cash flow 
considering that the prior defaults on the company s original credit facility were eliminated in the fourth quarter of fiscal with new alternate financing as described previously  significant problems with the new instruments are not currently anticipated 
if  however  severe declines in cash flows were to develop in the future  the new financing agreements could be negatively affected 
as a possible result  the lenders may choose to accelerate the maturity of any outstanding obligation  pursue foreclosure on assets pledged as collateral  and terminate their agreement 
existing programs in addition to those described earlier  the company has initiated a number of programs since march these programs  as listed below  were intended to address the decline in total and same store sales  while prudently managing costs and increasing overall profitability food excellence  service excellence  labor efficiency and cost control  increased emphasis on value  including combination meals  increased emphasis on employee training and development  targeted marketing  especially directed at families  closure of certain underperforming restaurants  increased emphasis on in house safety training  accident prevention  and claims management  and new product development 
impairment statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
requires the company to review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
the company considers a history of operating losses or negative cash flows and unfavorable changes in market conditions to be its main indicators of potential impairment 
assets are generally evaluated for impairment at the restaurant level 
if a restaurant does not meet its financial investment objectives or continues to incur negative cash flows or operating losses  an impairment charge may be recognized in future periods 
insurance and claims workers compensation and employee injury claims expense increased in comparison with the prior fiscal year due to a revision in reserve estimates resulting from the use of more comparable texas nonsubscriber work injury loss history by the company s provider of actuarial estimates 
actual claims settlements and expenses may differ from estimated loss provisions 
the company cannot make any assurances as to the ultimate level of claims under the in house safety program or whether declines in incidence of claims as well as claims costs experienced under the program will continue in future periods 
the company may be the subject of claims or litigation from guests and employees alleging injuries as a result of its operations 
in addition  unfavorable publicity from such allegations could have an adverse impact on financial results  regardless of their validity or ultimate outcome 
minimum wage and labor costs from time to time  the us congress considers an increase in the federal minimum wage 
the restaurant industry is intensely competitive  and in such case  the company may not be able to transfer all of the resulting increases in operating costs to its guests in the form of price increases 
in addition  since the company s business is labor intensive  shortages in the labor pool or other inflationary pressure could increase labor costs 
reserve for restaurant closings the company s reserve for restaurant closings is associated with prior disposal plans 
the reserve declined from million at august   to  at august   primarily due to the payment of and reductions in certain accrued lease settlement costs of approximately million 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies the company has identified the following policies as critical to its business and the understanding of its results of operations 
the company believes it is improbable that materially different amounts would be reported relating to the accounting policies described below if other acceptable approaches were adopted 
however  the application of these accounting policies  as described below  involve the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties  therefore  actual results could differ from estimates generated from their use 
income taxes the company records the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets  as well as operating loss and tax credit carrybacks and carryforwards 
the company periodically reviews the recoverability of tax assets recorded on the balance sheet and provides valuation allowances as management deems necessary 
management makes judgments as to the interpretation of the tax laws that might be challenged upon an audit and cause changes to previous estimates of tax liability 
in addition  the company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions 
in management s opinion  adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all years 
historically  the company has been periodically reviewed by the internal revenue service 
the company is currently under revi ew for the   and fiscal years 
impairment of long lived assets the company periodically evaluates long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable the company estimates future cash flows expected to result from the use and possible disposition of the asset and will recognize an impairment loss when the sum of the undiscounted estimated future cash flows is less than the carrying amounts of such assets 
the estimates of future cash flows  based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections  require management s subjective judgments 
the time periods for estimating future cash flows is often lengthy  which increases the sensitivity to assumptions made 
depending on the assumptions and estimates used  the estimated future cash flows projected in the evaluation of long lived assets can vary within a wide range of outcomes 
the company considers the likelihood of possible outcomes in determining the best estimate of future cash f lows 
the measurement for such an impairment loss is then based on the fair value of the asset as determined by discounted cash flows or appraisals  if available 
property held for sale the company also periodically reviews long lived assets against its plans to retain or ultimately dispose of properties 
if the company decides to dispose of a property  it will be moved to property held for sale and actively marketed 
property held for sale is recorded at amounts not in excess of what management currently expects to receive upon sale  less costs of disposal 
the company routinely monitors the estimated value of property held for sale and records adjustments to these values as required 
the company will periodically measure and analyze its estimates against third party appraisals 
insurance and claims the company periodically reviews its workers compensation  work injury  and general liability reserves to ensure reasonableness 
accrued claims liabilities are recorded for the estimated ultimate costs to settle both reported claims and claims incurred but not reported 
these estimates are based on actuarially determined ultimate cost estimates adjusted for factors and circumstances surrounding all current and prior year claims as periodically reviewed by the company s internal risk management staff 
assumptions and judgments are used in evaluating the effect that the factors and circumstances surrounding reported claims have on estimated claims costs 
unexpected changes in claim estimate related factors and actuarial estimates could result in costs that are materially different than initially reported 
the company s ongoing in house safety and claims program focuses on safety training and rigorous scrutiny of new claims  wh ich has reduced costs significantly in comparison to plans previously administered by third parties 
the possibility exists that future claims related liabilities could increase due to unforeseen circumstances 
stock based compensation the company accounts for its employee stock compensation plans using the intrinsic value method of accounting set forth in accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and the related interpretations 
accordingly  compensation cost for stock options is measured as the excess  if any  of the quoted market price of the company s stock at the date of grant over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock 
new accounting pronouncements sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  an amendment of fasb statement no 
 was issued in december and is effective for fiscal years ending after december  sfas no 
provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  this pronouncement amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require more prominent disclosure in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
the company currently plans to continue to apply the intrinsic value based method to account for stock options and is complying with the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
inflation the company s policy is to maintain stable menu prices without regard to seasonal variations in food costs
