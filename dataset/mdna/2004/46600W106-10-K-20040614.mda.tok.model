item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for an understanding of the significant factors that influenced our performance during the past three years  the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the other information appearing elsewhere in this report 
overview we are a leading company in the design  development  manufacture and marketing of high power  high performance power semiconductors 
our power semiconductors improve system efficiency and reliability by converting electricity at relatively high voltage and current levels into the finely regulated power required by electronic products 
we focus on the market for power semiconductors that are capable of processing greater than watts of power 
we design  manufacture and sell integrated circuits for a variety of applications 
our analog and mixed signal ics are at the interface of telecommunication components in the network and at the gateway to the network 
our mixed signal asics address the medical imaging equipment and display markets 
our power management and control ics are used in conjunction with our power semiconductors 
our rf power products enable circuitry that amplifies or receives radio frequencies in wireless and other microwave communication applications  medical imaging applications and defense and space applications 
in fiscal year  united states sales represented approximately and international sales represented approximately  of our net revenues 
of our international sales  approximately were derived from sales in europe and the middle east  approximately were derived from sales in asia and approximately were derived from sales in the americas other than the united states 
no single end customer accounted for more than of our net revenues in fiscal year in september  we acquired microwave technology  inc  a manufacturer of gallium arsenide rf power semiconductors 
we issued approximately  shares and assumed options exercisable for approximately  shares 
the products of microwave technology substantially increase our offerings and presence in rf power semiconductors 
critical accounting policies and significant management estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making 
table of contents judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
allowance for sales returns 
we maintain allowances for sales returns for estimated product returns by our customers 
we estimate our allowance for sales returns based on our historical return experience  current economic trends  changes in customer demand  known returns we have not received and other assumptions 
if we make different judgments or utilize different estimates  the amount and timing of our revenue could be materially different 
given that our revenues consist of a high volume of relatively similar products  our actual returns and allowances do not fluctuate significantly from period to period  and our returns provisions have historically been reasonably accurate 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we evaluate our allowance for doubtful accounts based on the aging of our accounts receivable  the financial condition of our customers and their payment history  our historical write off experience and other assumptions 
if we were to make different judgments of the financial condition of our customers or the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventories 
inventories are recorded at the lower of standard cost  which approximates actual cost on a first in first out basis  or market value 
we typically plan our production and inventory levels based on internal forecasts of customer demand  which are highly unpredictable and can fluctuate substantially 
the value of our inventory is dependent on our estimate of future demand as it relates to historical sale  and  if our projected demand is over estimated  we may be required to adjust our inventory value 
our inventories include high technology parts and components that are specialized in nature or subject to technological obsolescence 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on our historical sales 
we perform an analysis of inventory and compare the sales for the preceding year s 
to the extent we have inventory in excess of a pre determined number of years  generally not more than years  we recognize a write down for excess and obsolete inventory 
our allowance for excess and obsolete inventories includes an allowance for our on hand finished goods inventory with a date of manufacture of greater than three years old 
actual demand and market conditions may be different from those projected by our management 
this could have a material effect on our operating results and financial position 
if we make different judgments or utilize different estimates  the amount and timing of our inventory write downs may be materially different 
warranty 
our products are generally subject to warranty and we provide for the estimated future costs of repair  replacement or customer accommodation upon shipment of the product in the accompanying statements of operations 
our warranty accrual is estimated based on historical claims compared to historical revenues and assumes that we have to replace products subject to a claim 
for new products  we use our historical percentage for the appropriate class of product 
should actual product failure rates differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
valuation of property  plant  equipment  and intangible assets 
we regularly evaluate the recoverability of our property  plant and equipment and intangible assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 or sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the standard retains the previously existing accounting requirements related to the recognition and measurement of the impairment of long lived assets to be held and used while expanding the measurement requirements of long lived assets to be disposed of by sale to include discontinued operations 
it also expands on the previously existing reporting requirements for discontinued operations to include a component of an entity that either has been disposed of or is classified as held for sale 
actual useful lives and cash flows could be different from those estimated by our management 
this could have a material effect on our operating results and financial position 

table of contents revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue from product sales upon shipment provided that we have received an executed purchase order  the price is fixed  title has transferred  collection of resulting receivables is reasonably assured  there are no customer acceptance requirements  and there are no remaining significant obligations 
reserves for sales returns and allowances are recorded at the time of shipment 
our management must make estimates of potential future product returns and allowance for so called ship and debit transactions related to current period product revenue 
our management analyzes historical returns discounts and ship and debit transactions  current economic trends and changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products when evaluating the adequacy of the sales returns and other allowances 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the sales returns and other allowances in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
for our nonrecurring engineering  or nre  related to engineering work performed by our micronix division to design chip prototypes that will later be used to produce required units  customers enter into arrangements with micronix to perform engineering work for a fixed fee 
micronix records fixed fee payments during the development phase from customers in accordance with emerging issues task force  or eitf  abstracts  accounting for pre production costs related to long term supply arrangements 
micronix records research and development costs as expenses are incurred 
micronix then credits research and development expenses for payments made by the customer 
up front payments made by the customer are initially recorded as customer deposits and are charged to the statement of income as expenses for the project as costs are incurred 
legal contingencies 
we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims  the outcomes of which are subject to significant uncertainty 
sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  requires that an estimated loss from a loss contingency should be accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
disclosure of a contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred 
we evaluate  among other factors  the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss 
changes in these factors could materially impact our financial position or our results of operations 
goodwill 
we regularly evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate a possible impairment of goodwill 
in determining whether there is an impairment of goodwill  we calculate the estimated fair value of our company based on the closing sales price of our common stock and projected discounted cash flows as of the date we perform the impairment tests 
we allocate a portion of the total fair value to different reporting units based on discounted cash flows 
we then compare the resulting fair values of our reporting units to their respective net book values  including goodwill 
if the net book value of our company exceeds its fair value  we measure the amount of the impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of our goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
to the extent that the carrying amount of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  we recognized a goodwill impairment loss 
we perform this impairment test annually and whenever facts and circumstances indicate that there is a possible impairment of goodwill 
we completed the required annual impairment test  which resulted in no impairment for fiscal year we believe the methodology we use in testing impairment of goodwill provides us with a reasonable basis in determining whether an impairment charge should be taken 
to date  our goodwill has not been considered to be impaired based on the results of this first step 
income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
a valuation allowance is required to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in determining the amount of the valuation allowance  we consider estimated future taxable income as well as feasible tax planning strategies in each taxing jurisdiction in which we operate 
if we determine that we will not realize all or a portion of our remaining deferred tax assets  we will increase our valuation allowance with a charge to income tax expense 
conversely  if we determine that we will ultimately be able to utilize all or a portion of the deferred tax assets for which a valuation allowance has been provided  the related portion of the valuation allowance will be released to income as a credit to income tax expense 
significant management 
table of contents judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to establish a valuation allowance which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets and the continuing need for a related valuation allowance are monitored on an ongoing basis 
defined benefit plans 
we maintain pension plans covering certain of our employees 
for financial reporting purposes  net periodic pension costs are calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions  including a discount rate for plan obligations  assumed rate of return on pension plan assets and assumed rate of compensation increase for plan employees 
all of these assumptions are based upon management s judgment  considering all known trends and uncertainties 
actual results that differ from these assumptions would impact the future expense recognition and cash funding requirements of our pension plans 
results of operations the following table sets forth selected consolidated statements of operations data for the fiscal years indicated and the percentage change in such data from year to year

the increase in net revenues from fiscal to fiscal is primarily related to increased sales to traditional markets  the inclusion of revenues from acquired entities and the addition of revenues from new markets  including the plasma display panel market 
the growth in revenues includes an approximate increase in units shipped in fiscal in our traditional markets as compared to fiscal  offset in part by an approximate decrease in average selling prices across our traditional markets 
the increase in net revenues from fiscal to fiscal is primarily due to the inclusion of revenues from acquired entities and includes an approximate increase in units shipped in fiscal in our traditional markets as compared to fiscal and an approximate increase in average selling prices across our traditional markets 
gross profit 
gross profit in terms of dollars increased from fiscal to fiscal primarily as a result of the related increase in revenues 
as a percentage of revenues  margins improved from fiscal to fiscal principally because of the addition of higher margin rf power product lines  partially offset by provisions for excess and obsolete inventory and scrap 
in addition  the gross margin was negatively impacted by changes in the product mix  since much of our sales in new markets had lower gross margins 
gross profit increased from fiscal to fiscal primarily due to the addition of revenue from acquired entities 
the decrease in margin from fiscal to fiscal was primarily due to a million write down of excess inventories and an increase in unabsorbed manufacturing overhead from acquired entities  offset by an approximate increase in average selling prices across our traditional markets 
research  development and engineering 
from fiscal to fiscal  research  development and engineering expenses increased as we funded additional development projects to support our growth in revenues  but declined as a percentage of revenues due to our revenue growth 
although we expect an increase in research  development and engineering expenses as we fund more development projects  we do not expect a material increase in such expenses when 
table of contents expressed as a percentage of revenues 
in fiscal as compared to fiscal  the dollar and percentage increases were due to the addition of the clare and westcode engineering teams 
selling  general and administrative 
in fiscal  our selling  general and administrative expenses increased  principally due to an increase in sales commissions corresponding to our growth in revenues  expenses associated with the implementation of mandated internal controls and writeoffs for vacated offices 
selling  general and administrative expenses declined as a percentage of revenues from fiscal to fiscal principally as a result of our continuing efforts to control costs  combined with the impact of our growth in revenues 
while selling  general and administrative expenses may increase in future periods  we do not expect a material increase in such expenses when expressed as a percentage of revenue 
the dollar and percentage increases in fiscal as compared to fiscal were caused mainly by the acquisition of clare and westcode 
restructuring 
in june  we adopted a corporate restructuring program to reduce expenses and preserve our cash 
the restructuring mainly related to a reduction in the workforce designed to eliminate redundant positions at clare 
the restructuring charge  which consists mainly of involuntary employee separation costs of  was recorded in operating expense during fiscal the separation cost was for employees worldwide in sales and marketing  in research and development  in general and administrative and in operations functions in the united states  and in sales and marketing and in general and administrative outside the united states 
other expense  net 
other expense  net  including loss on foreign currency transactions and interest income expense  in fiscal was million  as compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal other expense  net decreased in fiscal due to a decrease in litigation associated expenses and a decrease in foreign currency transaction losses 
other expense  net increased in fiscal primarily due to the fluctuation in the euro and uk pound sterling against the us dollar 
benefit from provision for income taxes 
in fiscal  the benefit from income taxes reflected an effective tax rate of  as compared to a benefit from income taxes reflecting an effective tax rate of in fiscal the lower tax benefit rate for fiscal  as compared to  was primarily related to an increase in the state and foreign tax provisions 
the lower tax benefit rate for fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was primarily related to income tax allowances related to losses incurred in certain foreign jurisdictions 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents 
as of march   cash and cash equivalents were million  as compared to million at march  and million at march  the increase in cash and cash equivalents during fiscal was primarily due to cash generated by operations 
the increase in cash and cash equivalents during fiscal was primarily due to cash received in the acquisition of clare 
over the past three fiscal years  the cash generated by our operations has provided sufficient liquidity for our needs 
cash flows from operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal was million  as compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal the principal working capital use of cash was to fund accounts receivable 
accounts receivable increased from march  to march  by  primarily due to higher revenues 
no one customer accounted for more than of our revenues during fiscal or of our receivables at march  our inventory at march  was largely unchanged from march   decreasing from year to year 
during fiscal  working capital was principally used to fund increases in receivables and inventory  primarily due to the acquisition of 
table of contents clare and increasing revenues 
in fiscal  working capital was principally used to increase inventory  as receivables declined with reduced revenues 
cash flows from investing activities 
we used million in net cash for investing activities during fiscal  as compared to million provided by investing activities in fiscal and million used for investing activities in fiscal during fiscal  we spent million in capital expenditures  as compared to million in and million in we expect capital expenditures during fiscal to continue at about the same level as it has been for the past three fiscal years 
our fiscal cash flows for investing activities reflected the cash acquired with clare  while our fiscal cash flows for investing activities reflected the cash used to acquire westcode 
cash flows from financing activities 
for  net cash used in financing activities was million  as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of million in fiscal and million in fiscal during the three years  we used cash from financing activities principally to pay capital lease obligations 
in fiscal  sources of cash from financing activities included the exercise of stock options and proceeds from purchases under the employee stock purchase plan 
in fiscal  the principal sources of cash from financing activities were proceeds from capital lease obligations and loans  while in fiscal  the principal source was proceeds from capital lease obligations 
lines of credit 
another potential source of liquidity is borrowings under existing lines of credit 
at march   we had available credit aggregating million 
debt 
at march   our debt  consisting of capital lease obligations  notes payable to bank and loan payable was million  representing of our cash and cash equivalents and of our stockholders equity 
over the past three fiscal years  satisfying our payment obligations for debt has not materially affected our ability to fund our operating needs 
as of march   we had million in cash and cash equivalents 
we believe that these balances  including interest to be earned thereon  and borrowings available under our credit facilities will be sufficient to fund our working and other capital requirements  including potential investments in other companies and other assets to support the strategic growth of our business  over the next twelve months 
in the ordinary course of business  we evaluate opportunities to acquire businesses  products and technologies and we expect to use our cash to fund these types of activities in the future 
in the event additional needs for cash arise  we may raise additional funds from a combination of sources including the potential issuance of debt or equity securities 
additional financing might not be available on terms favorable to us  or at all  particularly in light of the recent decline in the capital markets 
if adequate funds were not available or were not available on acceptable terms  our ability to take advantage of unanticipated opportunities or respond to competitive pressures could be limited 
disclosures about contractual obligations and commercial commitments details of our contractual obligations and commitments as of march  to make future payments under contracts are set forth below payments due by period less than after contractual obligations total year years years years short term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations pension obligations purchase obligations other liabilities total

table of contents risk factors in addition to the other information in this annual report on form k  the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating us and our business 
additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe are not serious may also impair our business and its financial condition 
our operating results fluctuate significantly because of a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
given the nature of the markets in which we participate  we cannot reliably predict future revenues and profitability  and unexpected changes may cause us to adjust our operations 
a large portion of our costs are fixed  due in part to our significant sales  research and development and manufacturing costs 
thus  small declines in revenues could negatively affect our operating results in any given quarter 
our operating results may fluctuate significantly 
some of the factors that may affect our quarterly and annual results are the reduction  rescheduling or cancellation of orders by customers  fluctuations in timing and amount of customer requests for product shipments  changes in the mix of products that our customers purchase  the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry  competitive pressures on selling prices  market acceptance of our products  fluctuations in our manufacturing yields and significant yield losses  difficulties in forecasting demand for our products and the planning and managing of inventory levels  the availability of production capacity  the amount and timing of investments in research and development  changes in our product distribution channels and the timeliness of receipt of distributor resale information  the impact of vacation schedules and holidays  largely during the second and third fiscal quarters of our fiscal year  and the amount and timing of costs associated with product warranties and returns 
as a result of these factors  many of which are difficult to control or predict  as well as the other risk factors discussed in this annual report on form k  we may experience material adverse fluctuations in our future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis 
we have experienced operating losses  and we may experience additional declines in revenues and operating losses in the future 
our historical financial results have been  and our future financial results are anticipated to be subject to substantial fluctuations 
we incurred net losses of million and million in and  respectively 
reduced end user demand  continued price declines  excess inventory  underutilization of our manufacturing capacity and other factors could adversely affect our business in the near term and we may experience declines in revenue and operating losses in the future 
in order to return to profitability  we must successfully implement our business plan  including our cost reduction initiatives 
however  we also currently face an environment of uncertain demand and pricing pressure in the markets our products address 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to return to profitability or that we will be able to sustain our profitability  if achieved 

table of contents the semiconductor industry is cyclical  and an industry downturn could adversely affect our operating results 
business conditions in the semiconductor industry have rapidly changed from periods of strong demand 
the industry is characterized by periods of overcapacity and production shortages  cyclical demand for semiconductors  changes in product mix in response to changes in demand  significant price erosion  variations in manufacturing costs and yields  rapid technological change and the introduction of new products  and significant expenditures for capital equipment and product development 
these factors could harm our business and cause our operating results to suffer 
our gross margin is dependent on a number of factors  including our level of capacity utilization 
semiconductor manufacturing requires significant capital investment  leading to high fixed costs  including depreciation expense 
if we are unable to utilize our manufacturing and testing facilities at a high level  the fixed costs associated with these facilities will not be fully absorbed  resulting in higher average unit costs and lower gross margins 
we have attempted to match production with anticipated customer demand 
as a percentage of revenues  gross margin was for  compared to for  and in increased competition and other factors may lead to price erosion  lower revenues and lower margins for us in the future 
we may not be successful in our acquisitions 
we have in the past made  and may in the future make  acquisitions 
these acquisitions involve numerous risks  including diversion of management s attention during the acquisition process  disruption of our ongoing business  the potential strain on our financial and managerial controls and reporting systems and procedures  unanticipated expenses and potential delays related to integration of an acquired business  failure to successfully integrate the operations of an acquired company with our own  the challenges in achieving strategic objectives  cost savings and other benefits from acquisitions  the risk that our markets do not evolve as anticipated and that the technologies acquired do not prove to be those needed to be successful in those markets  the risks of entering new markets in which we have limited experience  difficulties in expanding our information technology systems to accommodate the acquired businesses  failure to retain key personnel of the acquired business  the challenges inherent in managing an increased number of employees and facilities and the need to implement appropriate policies  benefits and compliance programs  customer dissatisfaction or performance problems with an acquired company  the cost associated with acquisitions and the integration of acquired operations  and assumption of known or unknown liabilities or other unanticipated events or circumstances 

table of contents we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully acquire other businesses or product lines or integrate them into our operations without substantial expense  delay in implementation or other operational or financial problems 
ixys could be harmed by litigation involving patents and other intellectual property rights 
as a general matter  the semiconductor industry is characterized by substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
we have been sued on occasion for purported patent infringement and are currently defending against a number of such claims 
for example  we have been sued by international rectifier for purportedly infringing some of its patents covering power mosfets 
after trial  the us district court awarded damages to international rectifier of million plus attorney fees and issued a permanent injunction against ixys  effectively barring us from selling or distributing the allegedly infringing products 
the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit vacated these rulings and remanded the litigation to the us district court for further action consistent with the opinion of the federal circuit 
the litigation is expected to continue at the us district court and could result in another damages award and injunction 
we continue to contest international rectifier s claims vigorously but the outcome of this litigation remains uncertain 
see item legal proceedings provided elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
additionally  in the future  we could be accused of infringing the intellectual property rights of international rectifier or other third parties 
we also have certain indemnification obligations to customers with respect to the infringement of third party intellectual property rights by our products 
no assurance can be provided that any future infringement claims by third parties or claims for indemnification by customers or end users of our products resulting from infringement claims will not be asserted or that assertions of infringement  if proven to be true  will not harm our business 
in the event of any adverse ruling in any intellectual property litigation  including the pending power mosfet litigation with international rectifier  we could be required to pay substantial damages  cease the manufacturing  use and sale of infringing products  discontinue the use of certain processes or obtain a license from the third party claiming infringement with royalty payment obligations by us 
an adverse decision in the international rectifier power mosfet litigation would  and in any other infringement action could  materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
any litigation relating to the intellectual property rights of third parties  whether or not determined in our favor or settled by us  is costly and may divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel 
we depend on external foundries to manufacture many of our products 
of our revenues in fiscal year  came from wafers manufactured for us by external foundries 
our dependence on external foundries may grow 
we have arrangements with eight wafer foundries  three of which produce the wafers for power semiconductors that we purchase from external foundries 
samsung electronics s facility in kiheung  south korea is our principal external foundry 
our relationships with our external foundries do not guarantee prices  delivery or lead times  or wafer or product quantities sufficient to satisfy current or expected demand 
these foundries manufacture our products on a purchase order basis 
we provide these foundries with rolling forecasts of our production requirements  however  the ability of each foundry to provide wafers to us is limited by the foundry s available capacity 
at any given time  these foundries could choose to prioritize capacity for their own use or other customers or reduce or eliminate deliveries to us on short notice 
accordingly  we cannot be certain that these foundries will allocate sufficient capacity to satisfy our requirements 
in addition  we cannot be certain that we will continue to do business with these or other foundries on terms as favorable as our current terms 
if we are not able to obtain additional foundry capacity as required  our relationships with our customers could be harmed and our revenues would likely be reduced 
moreover  even if we are able to secure additional foundry capacity  we may be required  either contractually or as a practical business matter  to utilize all of that capacity or incur penalties or an adverse effect on the business relationship 
the costs related to maintaining foundry capacity 
table of contents could be expensive and could harm our operating results 
other risks associated with our reliance on external foundries include the lack of control over delivery schedules  the unavailability of  or delays in obtaining access to  key process technologies  limited control over quality assurance  manufacturing yields and production costs  and potential misappropriation of our intellectual property 
our requirements typically represent a small portion of the total production of the external foundries that manufacture our wafers and products 
we cannot be certain these external foundries will continue to devote resources to the production of our wafers and products or continue to advance the process design technologies on which the manufacturing of our products is based 
these circumstances could harm our ability to deliver our products on time or increase our costs 
our success depends on our ability to manufacture our products efficiently 
we manufacture our products in facilities that are owned and operated by us  as well as in external wafer foundries and independent subcontract assembly facilities 
the fabrication of semiconductors is a highly complex and precise process  and a substantial percentage of wafers could be rejected or numerous die on each wafer could be nonfunctional as a result of  among other factors contaminants in the manufacturing environment  defects in the masks used to print circuits on a wafer  manufacturing equipment failure  or wafer breakage 
for these and other reasons  we could experience a decrease in manufacturing yields 
additionally  as we increase our manufacturing output  we may also experience a decrease in manufacturing yields 
as a result  we may not be able to cost effectively expand our production capacity in a timely manner 
we may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights adequately 
our ability to compete is affected by our ability to protect our intellectual property rights 
we rely on a combination of patents  trademarks  copyrights  trade secrets  confidentiality procedures and non disclosure and licensing arrangements to protect our intellectual property rights 
despite these efforts  we cannot be certain that the steps we take to protect our proprietary information will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of our technology  or that our competitors will not independently develop technology that is substantially similar or superior to our technology 
more specifically  we cannot assure you that our pending patent applications or any future applications will be approved  or that any issued patents will provide us with competitive advantages or will not be challenged by third parties 
nor can we assure you that  if challenged  our patents will be found to be valid or enforceable  or that the patents of others will not have an adverse effect on our ability to do business 
furthermore  others may independently develop similar products or processes  duplicate our products or processes or design their products around any patents that may be issued to us 
our international operations expose us to material risks 
during fiscal year  our product sales by region were approximately in north america  approximately in europe and the middle east and approximately in asia 
we expect revenues from foreign markets to continue to represent a significant portion of total revenues 
ixys maintains significant operations in germany and the united kingdom and contracts with suppliers and manufacturers in 
table of contents south korea  japan and elsewhere in europe and asia 
some of the risks inherent in doing business internationally are foreign currency fluctuations  changes in the laws  regulations or policies of the countries in which we manufacture or sell our products  trade restrictions  longer payment cycles  challenges in collecting accounts receivable  cultural and language differences  employment regulations  transportation delays  work stoppages  and economic or political instability 
our sales of products manufactured in our lampertheim  germany facility and our costs at that facility are denominated in euros  and sales of products manufactured in our chippenham  uk facility and our costs at that facility are primarily denominated in british pounds and euros 
fluctuations in the value of the euro and the british pound against the us dollar could have a significant impact on our balance sheet and results of operations  including our net income 
we generally do not enter into foreign currency hedging transactions to control or minimize these risks 
fluctuations in currency exchange rates could cause our products to become more expensive to customers in a particular country  leading to a reduction in sales or profitability in that country 
if we expand our international operations or change our pricing practices to denominate prices in other foreign currencies  we could be exposed to even greater risks of currency fluctuations 
in addition  the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as do us laws regarding the manufacture and sale of our products in the us therefore  the risk of piracy of our technology and products may be greater when we manufacture or sell our products in these foreign countries 
our revenues are dependent upon our products being designed into our customers products 
many of our products are incorporated into customers products or systems at the design stage 
the value of any design win largely depends upon the customer s decision to manufacture the designed product in production quantities  the commercial success of the customer s product and the extent to which the design of the customer s electronic system also accommodates incorporation of components manufactured by our competitors 
in addition  our customers could subsequently redesign their products or systems so that they no longer require our products 
we may not achieve design wins or our design wins may not result in future revenues 
because our products typically have lengthy sales cycles  we may experience substantial delays between incurring expenses related to research and development and the generation of revenues 
the time from initiation of design to volume production of new semiconductors often takes months or longer 
we first work with customers to achieve a design win  which may take nine months or longer 
our customers then complete the design  testing and evaluation process and begin to ramp up production  a period which may last an additional nine months or longer 
as a result  a significant period of time may elapse between our research and development efforts and our realization of revenues  if any  from volume purchasing of our products by our customers 

table of contents our backlog may not result in future revenues 
customer orders typically can be cancelled or rescheduled without penalty to the customer 
as a result  our backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of actual revenues for any succeeding period 
a reduction of backlog during any particular period  or the failure of our backlog to result in future revenues  could harm our results of operations 
the markets in which we participate are intensely competitive 
certain of our target markets are intensely competitive 
our ability to compete successfully in our target markets depends on the following factors product quality  reliability and performance  product features  price  timely delivery of products  breadth of product line  design and introduction of new products  and technical support and service 
in addition  our competitors or customers may offer new products based on new technologies  industry standards or end user or customer requirements  including products that have the potential to replace  or provide lower cost or higher performance alternatives to  our products 
the introduction of new products by our competitors or customers could render our existing and future products obsolete or unmarketable 
our primary power semiconductor competitors include advanced power technology  fairchild semiconductor  fuji  international rectifier  infineon  on semiconductor  powerex  semikron international  stmicroelectronics  siemens and toshiba 
our ic products compete principally with those of agere  legacy  nec and silicon labs 
many of our competitors have greater financial  technical  marketing and management resources than we have 
some of these competitors may be able to sell their products at prices below which it would be profitable for us to sell our products or benefit from established customer relationships that provide them with a competitive advantage 
we rely on our distributors and sales representatives to sell many of our products 
a substantial majority of our products are sold to distributors and through sales representatives 
our distributors and sales representatives could reduce or discontinue sales of our products 
they may not devote the resources necessary to sell our products in the volumes and within the time frames that we expect 
in addition  we depend upon the continued viability and financial resources of these distributors and sales representatives  some of which are small organizations with limited working capital 
these distributors and sales representatives  in turn  depend substantially on general economic conditions and conditions within the semiconductor industry 
we believe that our success will continue to depend upon these distributors and sales representatives 
at march   no distributor accounted for greater than of our outstanding receivables 
if this or any other distributor or sales representative experiences financial difficulties  or otherwise becomes unable or unwilling to promote and sell our products  our business could be harmed 
our future success depends on the continued service of management and key engineering personnel and our ability to identify  hire and retain additional personnel 
our success depends upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical  managerial  marketing and finance personnel  and to a significant extent  upon the efforts and abilities of nathan zommer  phd  our president and chief executive officer  and other members of senior management 
the loss of the services of one 
table of contents or more of our senior management or other key employees could adversely affect our business 
we do not maintain key person life insurance on any of our officers  employees or consultants 
there is intense competition for qualified employees in the semiconductor industry  particularly for highly skilled design  applications and test engineers 
competition is especially intense in the silicon valley  where our principal us design facilities for power semiconductors and rf power semiconductors are located 
we may not be able to continue to attract and retain engineers or other qualified personnel necessary for the development of our business or to replace engineers or other qualified individuals who could leave us at any time in the future 
our anticipated growth is expected to place increased demands on our resources  and will likely require the addition of new management and engineering staff as well as the development of additional expertise by existing management employees 
if we lose the services of or fail to recruit key engineers or other technical and management personnel  our business could be harmed 
our disclosure controls and procedures need improvement and are not adequately effective 
our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that  as of march   our disclosure controls and procedures needed improvement and were not adequately effective 
our auditors  pricewaterhousecoopers llp  advised us of a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting 
see item a 
controls and procedures elsewhere in this form k 
the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting could materially adversely affect us 
periods of rapid growth and expansion could continue to place a significant strain on our resources  including our employee base 
to manage our possible future growth effectively  we will be required to continue to improve our operational  financial and management systems 
in doing so  we will periodically implement new software and other systems that will affect our internal operations regionally or globally 
the conversion process from one system to another is complex and requires  among other things  that data from the existing system be made compatible with the upgraded system 
during any transition  we could experience errors  delays and other inefficiencies  which could adversely affect our business 
future growth will also require us to successfully hire  train  motivate and manage our employees 
in addition  our continued growth and the evolution of our business plan will require significant additional management  technical and administrative resources 
we may not be able to effectively manage the growth and evolution of our current business 
our stock price is volatile 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly to date 
see item market for registrant s common equity and related stockholders matters provided elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the future market price of our common stock may also fluctuate significantly due to variations in our actual or expected quarterly operating results  announcements or introductions of new products  technological innovations by our competitors or development setbacks by us  conditions in the communications and semiconductor markets  the commencement or adverse outcome of litigation  changes in analysts estimates of our performance or changes in analysts forecasts regarding our industry  competitors or customers  announcements of merger or acquisition transactions or a failure to achieve the expected benefits of an acquisition as rapidly or to the extent anticipated by financial analysts  or general economic and market conditions 

table of contents in addition  the stock market in recent years has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices of many high technology companies  including semiconductor companies 
these fluctuations have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies in our industry  and could harm the market price of our common stock 
our dependence on independent subcontractors to assemble and test our products subject us to a number of risks  including an inadequate supply of products and higher materials costs 
we depend on independent subcontractors for the assembly and testing of our products 
during fiscal year  the great majority of our products were assembled by independent subcontractors located outside of the united states 
our reliance on these subcontractors involves the following significant risks reduced control over delivery schedules and quality  the potential lack of adequate capacity during periods of excess demand  difficulties selecting and integrating new subcontractors  limited warranties by subcontractors or other vendors on products supplied to us  potential increases in prices due to capacity shortages and other factors  potential misappropriation of our intellectual property  and economic or political instability in foreign countries 
these risks may lead to delayed product delivery or increased costs  which would harm our profitability and customer relationships 
in addition  we use a limited number of subcontractors to assemble a significant portion of our products 
if one or more of these subcontractors experiences financial  operational  production or quality assurance difficulties  we could experience a reduction or interruption in supply 
although we believe alternative subcontractors are available  our operating results could temporarily suffer until we engage one or more of those alternative subcontractors 
our markets are subject to technological change and our success depends on our ability to develop and introduce new products 
the markets for our products are characterized by changing technologies  changing customer needs  frequent new product introductions and enhancements  increased integration with other functions  and product obsolescence 
to develop new products for our target markets  we must develop  gain access to and use leading technologies in a cost effective and timely manner and continue to expand our technical and design expertise 
failure to do so could cause us to lose our competitive position and seriously impact our future revenues 
our operating expenses are relatively fixed  and we may order materials in advance of anticipated customer demand 
therefore  we have limited ability to reduce expenses quickly in response to any revenue shortfalls 
our operating expenses are relatively fixed  and  therefore  we have limited ability to reduce expenses quickly in response to any revenue shortfalls 
consequently  our operating results will be harmed if our revenues do not meet our revenue projections 

table of contents we also typically plan our production and inventory levels based on our own expectations for customer demand 
actual customer demand  however  can be highly unpredictable and can fluctuate substantially 
from time to time  in response to anticipated long lead times to obtain inventory and materials from our external suppliers and foundries  we may order materials or production in advance of anticipated customer demand 
this advance ordering may result in excess inventory levels or unanticipated inventory write downs if expected orders fail to materialize 
we may not be able to acquire additional production capacity to meet the present and future demand for our products 
the semiconductor industry has been characterized by periodic limitations on production capacity 
although we may be able to obtain the capacity necessary to meet present demand  if we are unable to increase our production capacity to meet possible future demand  some of our customers may seek other sources of supply or our future growth may be limited 
we depend on a limited number of suppliers for our wafers 
we purchase silicon wafers from three vendors with whom we do not have long term supply agreements 
any of these suppliers could eliminate or terminate our supply of wafers at any time 
our reliance on a limited number of suppliers involves several risks  including potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of silicon wafers and reduced control over the price  timely delivery  reliability and quality of the silicon wafers 
we cannot assure that problems will not occur in the future with suppliers 
our ability to access capital markets could be limited 
from time to time we access the capital markets to obtain long term financing 
although we believe that we can continue to access the capital markets on acceptable terms and conditions  our flexibility with regard to long term financing activity could be limited by our existing capital structure  our credit ratings  and the health of the semiconductor industry 
in addition  many of the factors that affect our ability to access the capital markets  such as the liquidity of the overall capital markets and the current state of the economy  are outside of our control 
there can be no assurances that we will continue to have access to the capital markets on favorable terms 
regulations may adversely affect our ability to sell our products 
power semiconductors with operating voltages above volts are subject to regulations intended to address the safety  reliability and quality of the products 
these regulations relate to processes  design  materials and assembly 
for example  in the united states some high voltage products are required to pass underwriters laboratory recognition for voltage isolation and fire hazard tests 
sales of power semiconductors outside of the united states are subject to international regulatory requirements that vary from country to country 
the process of obtaining and maintaining required regulatory clearances can be lengthy  expensive and uncertain 
the time required to obtain approval for sale internationally may be longer than that required for us approval  and the requirements may differ 
in addition  approximately of our revenues in fiscal year were derived from the sale of products included in medical devices that are subject to extensive regulation by numerous governmental authorities in the united states and internationally  including the us food and drug administration  or fda 
the fda and certain foreign regulatory authorities impose numerous requirements for medical device manufacturers to meet  including adherence to good manufacturing practices  or gmp  regulations and similar regulations in other countries  which include testing  control and documentation requirements 
ongoing compliance with gmp and other applicable regulatory requirements is monitored through periodic inspections by federal and state agencies  including the fda  and by comparable agencies in other countries 
our failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could prevent our products from being included in approved medical devices 

table of contents our business could also be harmed by delays in receiving or the failure to receive required approvals or clearances  the loss of previously obtained approvals or clearances or the failure to comply with existing or future regulatory requirements 
business interruptions may damage our facilities or those of our suppliers 
our operations are vulnerable to interruption by fire  earthquake and other natural disasters  as well as power loss  telecommunications failure and other events beyond our control 
we do not have a detailed disaster recovery plan and do not have backup generators 
our corporate headquarters in california is located near major earthquake fault lines and has experienced earthquakes in the past 
california also has been subject to shortages of electrical power and is subject to power outages 
if power outages occur  our ability to conduct our operations could be seriously impaired  which could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we cannot be sure that the insurance we maintain against general business interruptions will be adequate to cover all our losses 
in addition  some of our suppliers are located in california and are subject to the same earthquake and power outage risks 
a fire  major earthquake or other natural disaster near one or more of our facilities or those of our major suppliers could disrupt our operations and those of our suppliers  which could in turn limit the supply of our products and harm our business 
we may be affected by environmental laws and regulations 
we are subject to a variety of laws  rules and regulations in the united states  england and germany related to the use  storage  handling  discharge and disposal of certain chemicals and gases used in our manufacturing process 
any of those regulations could require us to acquire expensive equipment or to incur substantial other expenses to comply with them 
if we incur substantial additional expenses  product costs could significantly increase 
our failure to comply with present or future environmental laws  rules and regulations could result in fines  suspension of production or cessation of operations 
we face the risk of financial exposure to product liability claims alleging that the use of products that incorporate our semiconductors resulted in adverse effects 
approximately of our net revenues in fiscal year were derived from sales of products used in medical devices such as defibrillators 
product liability risks may exist even for those medical devices that have received regulatory approval for commercial sale 
we do not currently carry product liability insurance  and any defects in our products used in these devices  or in any other product  could result in significant recall or product liability costs to us 
nathan zommer  phd owns a significant interest in our common stock 
nathan zommer  phd  our president and chief executive officer  beneficially owns  as of may   approximately of the outstanding shares of our common stock 
as a result  dr 
zommer could exercise significant control over all matters requiring stockholder approval  including the election of the board of directors 
his holdings could result in a delay of  or serve as a deterrent to  possible changes in control of ixys  which may reduce the market price of our common stock 
see item security ownership of certain beneficial owners and management provided elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the anti takeover provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and of the delaware general corporation law may delay  defer or prevent a change of control 
our board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to determine the price  rights  preferences and privileges and restrictions  including voting rights  of those shares without any further vote or action by our stockholders 
the rights of the holders of common stock will be subject to  and may be harmed by  the rights of the holders of any shares of preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
the issuance of preferred stock may delay  defer or prevent a change in control because the terms of any issued preferred stock could potentially prohibit our consummation of any merger  reorganization  
table of contents sale of substantially all of our assets  liquidation or other extraordinary corporate transaction  without the approval of the holders of the outstanding shares of preferred stock 
in addition  the issuance of preferred stock could have a dilutive effect on our stockholders 
our stockholders must give substantial advance notice prior to the relevant meeting to nominate a candidate for director or present a proposal to our stockholders at a meeting 
these notice requirements could inhibit a takeover by delaying stockholder action 
the delaware anti takeover law restricts business combinations with some stockholders once the stockholder acquires or more of our common stock 
the delaware statute makes it more difficult for us to be acquired without the consent of our board of directors and management 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
to mitigate these risks  we have on occasion utilized derivative financial instruments 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
we place our investment portfolio primarily in debt instruments of the united states government and high quality corporate issuers 
investments in both fixed and floating rate securities have some degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted by increases in interest rates 
floating rate securities may product less income than anticipated if interest rates fall 
as a result  changes in interest rates may cause us to incur losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that have declined in market value or may result in lower than anticipated investment income 
our investment portfolio is categorized as available for sale and accordingly is presented at fair value on the balance sheet 
we manage our exposure to interest rate  market and credit risk in the investment portfolio with investment policies and procedures that limit such things as term  credit rating and the amount of credit exposure to any one issue  issuer and type of instrument 
we have not used derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we are also exposed to short term fluctuations in interest rates as our lines of credit have variable interest rates 
an increase in interest rates would have an adverse impact on our interest expense 
however  our cash and marketable securities greatly exceed the balances that we borrow through lines of credit and  if necessary to limit the burden of interest expense  we could reduce our borrowing 
during the year ended march   the effects of changes in interest rates on the fair market value of our marketable investment securities and our earnings were insignificant 
the impact on the fair market value of our securities and our earnings from a hypothetical basis point adverse change in interest rates as of the end each of fiscal and would not have been significant 
international revenues from our foreign subsidiaries were approximately of total revenues in fiscal year these revenues come from our german and uk subsidiaries and are primarily denominated in euros and british pounds  respectively 
our foreign subsidiaries also incur most of their expenses in the local currency 
certain of our foreign subsidiaries use their respective local currencies as their functional currency 
although we have entered into a limited number of foreign exchange forward contracts to help manage foreign currency exchange risk associated with certain of our operations  we do not generally hedge foreign currency exchange rates 
the foreign exchange forward contracts we have entered into generally have original maturities ranging from one to three months 
we do not enter into foreign exchange forward contracts for trading purposes 
we do not expect gains or losses on these contracts to have a material impact on our financial results 
it is possible that our future financial results could be directly affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates  and the prices of our products would become more expensive in a particular foreign market if the value of the us dollar  the euro or the british pound rises in comparison to the local currency  which may make it more difficult to sell our products in that market 
we will continue to face foreign currency exchange risk in the future 
therefore  our financial results could be directly affected by weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
in addition  a strengthening of the us dollar  the euro or the british pound 
table of contents could make our products less competitive in foreign markets 
a hypothetical adverse change in the value of the euro against the us dollar and the british pound against the us dollar would have had the effect of reducing our annual net income as of the end of each of fiscal and by an amount less than million 
because of the operation of the foreign units in their own functional currencies  this sensitivity analysis was undertaken by examining the net income or loss of the foreign units incorporated into our statement of operations and testing the impact of the hypothetical change in exchange rates on such income or loss 
the hypothetically derived net income or loss of the foreign units was then calculated with our statement of operations data to derive the hypothetical impact on our net income
