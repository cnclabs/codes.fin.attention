item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking statements except for historical financial information contained herein  certain matters discussed in the annual report of bwc financial corp 
constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual future results to differ materially 
such risks and uncertainties with respect to bwc financial corp  bank of walnut creek and bwc real estate  include  but are not limited to  those related to the economic environment  particularly in the areas in which the corporation and the bank operate  competitive products and pricing  loan delinquency rates  fiscal and monetary policies of the us government  changes in governmental regulations affecting financial institutions  including regulatory fees and capital requirements  changes in prevailing interest rates  acquisitions and the integration of acquired businesses  credit risk management and asset liability management  the financial and securities markets  and the availability of and costs associated with sources of liquidity 
general this past year has been a stable interest rate environment  although at an historical low prime the entire year 
our corporation has relatively few long term fixed rate assets to support net interest margins in a falling or low interest rate environment 
in last year s report we stated that if interest rates remain at the current historic lows during  and the economy does not respond with material growth  it would prove to be a year of challenge for earnings growth 
although this was the environment throughout  the corporation was able to not only maintain earnings but improve upon them due to asset growth and the expanding activities of our bwc mortgage services subsidiary 
barring any significant setbacks to economic recovery  we are optimistic that will continue to reflect the improving economic and employment picture begun this past year 
during bwc financial corp 
experienced a growth of in total assets from the prior year 
gross loans increased as did deposits  and net income was up approximately from the prior year 
the corporation s mortgage brokerage joint venture  bwc mortgage services  had an outstanding year 
this was in large part due to the low interest rates and also to the correspondingly strong refinance market that existed during most of the year 
they processed approximately one billion dollars of loans during  increasing the corporation s earnings approximately million pre tax 
bwc mortgage services also added mortgage banking services during this division has established lines of credit with third party providers for the purpose of funding sold loans to reduce the time it takes to close mortgages for borrowers 
the loans held for sale are generally on the books for less than a month and carry virtually no credit risk to the corporation 
for this reason these loans are reported as a separate line item below the loans and reserves of the corporation and are evaluated separately in determining the allowance for credit losses 
interest income and fees associated with these loans are included in the loans  including fees section of the corporation s income statement

change in interest and expense due to volume change and rate change the following table provides pertinent information about interest income and expense between the years and  and between the years and the change resulting primarily from growth in each asset or liability category is expressed as a volume change 
the change resulting primarily from changes in rates is expressed as a rate change

interest expense represents interest paid to the bank s depositors  to the fhlb for borrowings under the secured lines the bank has with them  and for temporary borrowing of fed funds on an occasional overnight basis 
it also includes borrowings under lines of credit to bwc mortgage services 
net interest income is the difference between interest income on earning assets  and interest expense on deposits and other borrowed funds 
the volume of loans and deposits and interest rate fluctuations resulting from various economic conditions may significantly affect net interest income 
total interest income in increased  as compared to this was related in total to the growth in earning assets during the current year 
analysis of the influences of growth and rates shows that interest income was increased by approximately million dollars  due to growth  and reduced by approximately million  due to lower rates 
total interest expense in decreased  from this was related in total to the drop in interest rates 
analysis of the influence of growth and rates shows that interest expense was decreased by approximately million  due to decreased rates  and increased by approximately million  due to growth 
based on the above factors affecting interest income and interest expense  net interest income increased  during as compared to had the same average rates been in effect during as were experienced in  the net interest income of the corporation would have increased by approximately million 
total interest income in decreased  as compared to this was related in total to the drop in interest rates 
analysis of the influence rates had on interest income showed that interest income was approximately million less in than would have been earned using the rates in effect during total interest expense in decreased  from this was also related in total to the drop in interest rates 
analysis of the influence rates had on interest expense showed that interest expense was approximately million less in than would have been expensed using the rates in effect during based on the above factors affecting interest income and interest expense  net interest income decreased  during as compared to had the same rates been in effect during as were experienced in  the net interest income of the corporation would have increased by approximately million 
interest rate risk management movement in interest rates can create fluctuations in the corporation s income and economic value due to an imbalance in the re pricing or maturity of assets or liabilities 
the components of interest rate risk which are actively measured and managed include re pricing risk and the risk of non parallel shifts in the yield curve 
interest rate risk exposure is actively managed with the goal of minimizing the impact of interest rate volatility on current earnings and on the market value of equity 
in general  the assets and liabilities generated through ordinary business activities do not naturally create offsetting positions with respect to re pricing or maturity characteristics 
therefore  the corporation uses a variety of measurement tools to monitor and control the overall interest rate risk exposure of the on balance sheet positions 
for each measurement tool  the level of interest rate risk created by the assets and liabilities is a function primarily of their contractual interest rate re pricing dates and contractual maturity including principal amortization dates 
the corporation employs a variety of modeling tools to monitor interest rate risks 
one of the earlier and more basic models is gap reporting 
the net difference between the amount of assets and liabilities within a cumulative calendar period is typically referred to as the rate sensitivity position 
as part of the gap analysis to help manage interest rate risk  the corporation also performs an earnings simulation analysis to identify the interest rate risk exposures resulting from the corporation s asset and liability positions  such as its loans  investment securities and customer deposits 
the corporation s policy is to maintain a risk of a rate shock to net interest income at risk to a level of not more than 
the earnings simulation analysis as of december  estimated that a interest rate shock decrease could lower pretax earnings by  which was of net interest income 
this earnings simulation does not account for the potential impact of loan prepayments  deposit drifts  or other balance sheet movements in response to modeled changes in interest rates  and the resulting effect  if any  on the corporation s simulated earnings analysis 
interest rate sensitivity proper management of the rate sensitivity and maturities of assets and liabilities is required to provide an optimum and stable net interest margin 
interest rate sensitivity spread management is an important tool for achieving this objective and for developing strategies and means to improve profitability 
the schedules shown below reflect the interest rate sensitivity position of the corporation as of december  in a rising interest rate environment  the corporation s net interest margin and net interest income will improve 
a falling interest rate environment will have the opposite effect 
management believes that the sensitivity ratios reflected in these schedules fall within acceptable ranges  and represent no undue interest rate risk to the future earnings prospects of the corporation

provision for credit losses an allowance for credit losses is maintained at a level considered adequate to provide for losses that can be reasonably estimated 
the allowance is increased by provisions charged to expense and reduced by net charge offs 
management continually evaluates the economic climate  the performance of borrowers  and other conditions to determine the adequacy of the allowance 
the ratio of the allowance for credit losses to total loans as of december  was  as compared to for the period ending december  the corporation s ratios for both periods are considered adequate to provide for losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the corporation performs a quarterly analysis of the adequacy of its allowance for credit losses 
as of december  the corporation had  in allocated reserves and  in unallocated reserves 
as of december  the corporation had  in allocated reserves and  in unallocated reserves 
the corporation s management believes that the amount of unallocated reserves is reasonable due to the growth of the bank s loan portfolio and the new credit products that have been introduced 
the bank has a leasing division  a small business administration lending program and a commercial real estate lending program and has a high concentration of credit in single family construction real estate lending 
the uncertainties associated with these products  coupled with the bank s traditionally strong construction concentration are considered in determining the allowance 
the corporation had net charge offs of  during as compared to net charge offs of  during the comparable period in allowance for credit losses allocation of allowance for credit losses is based upon estimates of probable c redit losses and is maintained at a level considered adequate to provide for losses that can be reasonably anticipated

loans past due days or more  still accruing interest nonaccrual loans total allowance for credit losses the allowance for loan and lease loss reserve methodology requires that certain loans be reviewed under the directives of the federal financial institutions examination council s ffiec policy statement dated july  and sfas  to determine whether or not the loan is impaired and necessitates a specific reserve 
by bank policy all loans and leases that are classified substandard risk rating or doubtful risk rating are reviewed to determine if they are impaired 
an impaired loan defined by sfas is one in which  based on current information and events  it is probable that a creditor will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
all amounts due according to the contractual terms means that both the contractual interest payments and contractual principal payments will be collected as scheduled in the loan agreement 
when a loan is determined to be impaired  the extent of impairment is based on the expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate 
however  as a practical expedient  sfas permits a creditor to measure impairment based on the fair value of the collateral 
it is this latter form of measurement that the bank has elected to use  as personal or real property assets collateralize a large percentage of the bank s loans 
in selecting this approach to determining the necessity of specific reserves  the bank documents how the fair value of the collateral was determined  eg current appraisal real property  equipment or inventory  method for valuation of collectable accounts or notes receivable  method for valuation of other assets 
supporting rationale for adjustments to appraisals or loan to value discount applied to determine the collateral value 
the determination of the cost to sell or liquidate the collateral 
the qualifications  expertise and independence of the appraiser 
for purposes of the bank s credit policy regarding this section of the alll methodology  the following practices and definitions apply 
an appraisal will be considered current for the initial assessment of a loan under sfas  if it is less than six months old 
in subsequent annual assessments  the appraisal may not be older than twelve months 
where we are assessing accounts or notes receivable  we should order a receivables audit to assist in the initial assessment and refresh it every six months 
in developing the rationale to support appraisal adjustments or the loan to value discount on personal property  external comps and collateral audits should be used as much as possible 
all costs to sell or liquidate the collateral  except legal expenses  are to be included 
an estimate may be used where definitive amounts are not available 
the calculation of the specific reserve follows gross collateral value less cost to sell less loan to value discount equals net collateral value less current principal outstanding if the calculation produces a collateral excess  it is not appropriate to assign a specific reserve 
if the calculation results in a collateral shortfall  the specific reserve should equal the amount of the shortfall 
the loan to value discount does not have to follow the bank standard if the rationale for an adjustment warrants a greater or lesser amount 
noninterest income vs 
total noninterest income in was  greater than earned in the noninterest income of the corporation includes bwc mortgage services commissions and their other operating income

other operating expenses increased  over the comparable expenses in of which all but  was related to bwc mortgage services 
most categories of operating expenses experienced increases  reflecting the growth and expansion of the corporation and its activities 
the largest segment of increase in the bank was in legal and professional fees which were up approximately  from the prior year

this reflects increases in operating leases and costs of other office space based on terms contained in lease contracts 
furniture and equipment expense decreased  from the previous year  which is partly a reflection of complete amortization of equipment which continues to be in use and a reduction in maintenance and repair expense on equipment 
other operating expenses increased  over the comparable expenses in most categories of operating expenses experienced increases  reflecting the growth and expansion of the corporation and its activities 
the largest segment of increase is in the corporation s technology investment 
this includes the introduction of image statements and checks  the support of internet banking service including bill pay services and on line check images  plus other information technology investments 
capital adequacy the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic has established risk based capital guidelines requiring banks to maintain certain ratios of qualifying capital to risk weighted assets 
under the guidelines  qualifying capital is classified into two tiers  referred to as tier core and tier supplementary capital 
currently  the bank s tier capital consists of shareholders equity  while tier capital consists of the eligible allowance for credit losses 
the bank has no subordinated notes or debentures included in its capital 
risk weighted assets are calculated by applying risk percentages specified by the fdic to categories of both balance sheet assets and off balance sheet assets 
the bank s tier and total which included tier and tier risk based capital ratios surpassed the regulatory minimum of at december  for both and the fdic also has a leverage ratio requirement 
this ratio supplements the risk based capital ratios and is defined as tier capital divided by the quarterly average assets during the reporting period 
the requirement established a minimum leverage ratio of for the highest rated banks 
the bank s leverage ratio surpassed the regulatory minimum of at december  for both and see note of the consolidated financial statements 
liquidity the objective of liquidity management is to ensure the cash flow requirements of depositors and borrowers  as well as the operating cash needs of the corporation  are met  taking into account all on and off balance sheet funding demands 
liquidity management also includes ensuring cash flow needs are met at a reasonable cost 
liquidity risk arises from the possibility the corporation may not be able to satisfy current or future financial commitments  or the corporation may become unduly reliant on alternative funding sources 
the corporation maintains a liquidity risk management policy to address and manage this risk 
the policy identifies the primary sources of liquidity  establishes procedures for monitoring and measuring liquidity  and establishes minimum liquidity requirements which comply with regulatory guidance 
the policy also includes a contingency funding plan to address liquidity needs in the event of an institution specific or a systemic financial market crisis 
the liquidity position is continually monitored and reported on monthly to the management committee and board of directors 
funds are available from a number of sources  including the securities portfolio  the core deposit base  the capital markets  the federal home loan bank  the federal reserve bank  and through the sale and securitization of various types of assets 
funding sources did not change significantly during core deposits  the most significant source of funding  comprised approximately and of funding in and respectively 
cash  investment securities  and other temporary investments represent of total assets at both december  and cash flows from operations contribute significantly to liquidity as well as proceeds from maturities of securities and increasing customer deposits 
as indicated on the corporation s consolidated statement of cash flows  net cash from operating activities for the year ended december  contributed  to liquidity compared to  in the majority of the corporation s funding comes from customer deposits within its operating region 
customer deposits provided  for the year ended december  compared to  for for the year ended december   non interest demand deposits and money market savings accounts provided the majority of the deposit growth 
borrowing activities also provide a source of funding and  in the period ending december   borrowed funds contributed  as compared to  for other important sources of liquidity are investments in federal funds  other short term investments and the corporation s securities portfolio 
the corporation maintains a ladder of securities that provides prepayments and payments at maturity and a portfolio of available for sale securities that could be converted to cash quickly 
proceeds from maturity and sale of securities provided  for the year ended december  compared to  for the corporation s management has an effective asset and liability management program and carefully monitors its liquidity on a continuing basis 
the corporation has available from correspondent banks federal fund lines of credit totaling  in addition  the corporation has approximately  secured borrowing capacity with the federal home loan bank and a  secured borrowing line with the federal reserve bank 
the corporation also has a source of liquidity in its ability to sell sba and commercial real estate loans to other investors 
at the holding company level  the corporation uses cash to repurchase common stock and pay for professional services and miscellaneous expenses 
the main sources of funding for the holding company include dividends and returns on investment from its subsidiaries 
the primary source of funding for the holding company has been the declaration of dividends from its subsidiaries 
the subsidiaries of the corporation declared dividends to the holding company in   and of   and  respectively 
the subsidiaries also provided liquidity to the corporation in the form of returns of capital during   and of   and  respectively 
another source of funding for the holding company has been receipts from stock options exercised 
during   and  stock options exercised generated cash to the corporation of   and  respectively 
based on the current level and term of options outstanding  future cash flows from this source are expected to diminish 
as of january   the amount of dividends the bank subsidiary can pay to the parent company without prior regulatory approval was  versus  at january  as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the subsidiary bank is subject to regulation and  among other things  may be limited in their ability to pay dividends or transfer funds to the holding company 
accordingly  consolidated cash flows as presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows in note may not represent cash immediately available to the holding company 
application of critical accounting policies the corporation s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and follow general practices within the industries in which it operates 
application of these principles requires management to make estimates  assumptions  and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates  assumptions  and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements  accordingly  as this information changes  the financial statements could reflect different estimates  assumptions  and judgments 
certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates  assumptions  and judgments and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported 
estimates  assumptions  and judgments are necessary when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value  when a decline in the value of an asset not carried on the financial statements at fair value warrants an impairment write down or valuation reserve to be established  or when an asset or liability needs to be recorded contingent upon a future event 
carrying assets and liabilities at fair value inherently results in more financial statement volatility 
the fair values and the information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based either on quoted market prices or are provided by other third party sources  when available 
when third party information is not available  valuation adjustments are estimated in good faith by management primarily through the use of internal cash flow modeling techniques 
the most significant accounting policies followed by the corporation are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
these policies  along with the disclosures presented in the other financial statement notes and in this financial review  provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined 
based on the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods  assumptions  and estimates underlying those amounts  management has identified the determination of the allowance for loan losses that require the most subjective or complex judgments  and as such could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available 
the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses is considered a critical accounting estimate because it requires significant judgment and the use of estimates related to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans  estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience  and consideration of current economic trends and conditions  all of which may be susceptible to significant change 
the loan portfolio also represents the largest asset type on the consolidated balance sheet 
note to the consolidated financial statements describes the methodology used to determine the allowance for loan losses  and a discussion of the factors driving changes in the amount of the allowance for loan losses is included in note lease financing receivables may include a residual value component and may contain some risk associated with the valuation of leased asset residuals 
most of the corporation s lease receivables carry a nominal residual of  however  on some  a residual of the original purchase price is applied  which management estimates to represent a conservative amount 
at the end of the lease term  the lessee may have the option to buy the equipment at the residual price  or return it 
the resale value of equipment returned may exceed or be less than the amount of residual taken 
the corporation lease portfolio contains no automobile financings 
as of december  the corporation s lease financing residual value was  against lease receivables of  any material effect on the financial statements related to these critical accounting areas is also discussed in this financial review
