item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview abaxis  inc us or we  incorporated in california in  develops  manufactures and markets portable blood analysis systems for use in any veterinary or human patient care setting to provide clinicians with rapid blood constituent measurements 
our primary product is a system consisting of a compact kilogram pounds analyzer and a series of single use plastic discs  called reagent discs  containing all the chemicals required to perform a panel of up to tests on veterinary patients and tests on human patients 
sales for any future periods are not predictable with a significant degree of certainty 
we generally operate with limited order backlog because our products typically are shipped shortly after orders are received 
as a result  product sales in any quarter are generally dependent on orders booked and shipped in that quarter 
our expense levels  which are to a large extent fixed  are based in part on our expectations of future revenues 
accordingly  we may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall 
as a result  any such shortfall would negatively affect our operating results and financial condition 
our sales may be adversely impacted by pricing pressure from competitors 
our ability to be consistently profitable will depend  in part  on our ability to increase our sales volumes of our vetscan dxs and piccolo products and to compete with other competitors successfully 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful 
results of operations total revenues years ended march  percentage change to to product sales  net    percentage of total revenues development and licensing revenue    percentage of total revenues total revenues    total revenues increased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the growth in revenue was primarily due to an increase in total instrument sales of or  from fiscal to fiscal and an increase of reagent discs and kits of or  from fiscal to fiscal revenues from the medical market increased by  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal revenues from the veterinary market increased by  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal other sales of  in fiscal primarily consisted of  related to sales of our orbos technology 
although we sold a limited number of redesigned canine heartworm tests manufactured by sa scientific in fiscal  we have subsequently terminated our relationship with sa scientifc 
total revenues increased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the growth in revenue was primarily due to an increase in total instrument sales of or  from fiscal to fiscal and an increase of total reagent discs and kits of or  from fiscal to fiscal revenues from the medical market increased by  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal revenues from the veterinary market increased by  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal other sales decreased  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal other sales included a decrease of  in orbos sales and an increase of  in sales from the vetscan canine heartworm test  which we ceased selling in december as a result of an out of court settlement 
the increase in revenues from fiscal to fiscal is attributable to increased worldwide demand in both the medical and veterinary markets and driven by increased unit sales of our reagent discs and kits due to a higher consumption rate of users and to the expanded installed base of our piccolo and vetscan systems 
in september  we completed and released the developments of the renal function  hepatic function and comprehensive metabolic panels  which are key piccolo medical panels which  together with existing panels  completes the full array of the center for medicare and medicaid services reimbursement panels 
in february  we received food and drug administration fda market clearance for our magnesium assay for use in the piccolo blood chemistry analyzers 
in fiscal  and  sales in the united states represented  and  respectively  of our total revenues 
in spite of the increase of total revenues in absolute dollars from prior periods  our growth rate has remained consistent in both the united states and international markets during fiscal  and development and licensing revenue consists of royalty payments from amersham biosciences formerly pharmacia biotech equal to of net sales  as defined in our agreement  of amersham s products that use our technology 
our development and licensing revenue during fiscal  and are based on our customers use of the orbos technology 
the usage by our customer is unpredictable

in the united states  two distributors  vedco inc and dvm resources accounted for and  respectively  of total revenues for fiscal  and  respectively  of total revenues for fiscal  and and  respectively  of total revenues for fiscal in april  we signed a distributor agreement with the veterinary division of henry schein  inc  a distributor of animal healthcare products and services to veterinary practitioners to sell and distribute the vetscan dxs  along with the associated reagent discs and kits 
total revenues in europe increased by or  from fiscal to fiscal and by or  from fiscal to fiscal the increase in europe in fiscal was primarily due to increases of instrument sales of  and reagent disc sales of  the increase in europe in fiscal was primarily due to increases of instrument sales of  and reagent disc sales of  total revenues in asia and latin america decreased by or  from fiscal to fiscal and increased by or  from fiscal to fiscal the slight decrease in asia and latin america in fiscal was primarily due to a decrease in instrument sales of  offset by an increase in reagent disc sales of  the increase in asia and latin america in fiscal was primarily due to increases of instrument sales of  offset by a decrease of reagent disc sales of  our goal for fiscal is to continue the increase in instrument sales by allocating resources to product selling and marketing 
we intend to introduce marketing programs emphasizing instrument sales 
we also plan to increase our sales force and offer incentive programs to retain highly skilled sales professionals 
the increase of or  in reagent disc sales during our fiscal compared to fiscal is consistent with our belief that there will be recurring reagent disc revenue as our product lines mature 
this growth is mostly attributable to the expanded installed base of piccolo and vetscan systems and higher consumption rates of users 
cost of product sales years ended march  percentage change to to cost of product sales    percentage of total revenues cost of product sales includes the costs associated with manufacturing  assembly  package  warranty repairs  test and quality assurance for our instrument analyzers and reagent discs and manufacturing overhead  including costs of personnel and equipment associated with manufacturing support 
the decrease in cost of product sales as a percent of revenue from fiscal to fiscal and from fiscal to fiscal were attributable to continued increases in sales volume of reagent discs and lower unit costs resulting from improved manufacturing processes and absorption of fixed costs of our current facilities 
the increase in cost of product sales in absolute dollars from fiscal to fiscal and from fiscal to fiscal were primarily attributable to an increase in instrument sales of or  from fiscal to fiscal and or  from fiscal to fiscal and an increase of reagent discs of or  from fiscal to fiscal and or  from fiscal to fiscal selling  general and administrative expense years ended march  percentage change to to selling  general and administrative    percentage of total revenues selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits  commissions and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing  advertising  costs associated with promotional and other marketing expenses  customer service and technical service  general corporate functions  including accounting  human resources and legal 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased or  in fiscal from fiscal primarily due to increased expenses of  devoted to sales and marketing resources in the medical market and  devoted to sales and marketing resources in the veterinary market 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased or  in fiscal from fiscal primarily due to increased expenses of  devoted to sales and marketing resources in the medical market and  of costs related to legal action filed by idexx  which resulted in an out of court settlement in december selling  general and administrative activities accounted for  and of total revenues during fiscal  and we anticipate the dollar amount of selling  general and administrative expenses to increase in fiscal from fiscal but remain consistent as a percentage of total revenues due to our plan to increase our sales force and offer incentive programs to retain highly skilled sales professionals 
in addition  we expect an increase in expenses due to accounting services relating to sarbanes oxley compliance and an increase in premiums for our general business insurance 
research and development years ended march  percentage change to to research and development    percentage of total revenues research and development expenses consist of salaries and benefits  related expenses associated with the development of clinical trials of new test methods and the enhancement of existing products 
research and development expenses increased by or  in fiscal from fiscal primarily due to product development in the medical market 
research and development expenses increased by or  in fiscal from fiscal primarily related to the completion of clinical trials and food and drug administration fda clearance on our lipid panel for use in the piccolo diagnostic system and completion of the vetscan comprehensive diagnostic profile rotor for use in the veterinary market 
research and development activities accounted for  and of total revenues during fiscal  and we anticipate the dollar amount of research and development expenses to increase in fiscal from fiscal but remain consistent as a percentage of total revenues  as we complete new products for both the human medical and veterinary markets 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will undertake such research and development activities in future periods or  if we do  that such activities will be successful 
interest and other  net the following table sets forth our interest and other income  net for fiscal  and years ended march  percentage change to to interest income    interest expense and other income expense  net   interest income interest income was   and  for fiscal  and  respectively 
interest and other income primarily consisted of interest earned on cash and cash equivalents 
the decrease of or  in fiscal from fiscal  was primarily due to lower interest rates obtained on our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
the increase of  in fiscal from fiscal was primarily due to higher average invested balances 
interest expense and other income expense  net interest and other expense for fiscal  included a total of  of interest on our capital equipment loan and capital leases and  on our co promotion agreement with abbott laboratories 
in fiscal  we recorded a net loss of  on foreign currency transactions 
interest and other expense for fiscal  included a total of  of interest on our capital equipment loan and line of credit   on our capital leases and  on our co promotion agreement with abbott laboratories 
interest and other expense for fiscal  included  on equipment and working capital loans and  on our building and capital leases  net of capitalized interest of  on the purchase and installation of our semi automated disc production line 
also included in interest and other expense in fiscal  was a cancellation fee of  related to the termination of our previous equipment and working capital loans when we signed our new agreements with comerica bank california in march we incurred other expense of  for currency losses during fiscal these decreases in interest expense were primarily attributable to reduced balances on our equipment loan  capital leases and other outstanding debt 
income tax provision benefit income tax benefit totaled  in fiscal  which included a one time income tax benefit of  related to existing deferred tax assets principally net operating loss carryforwards because we concluded that it is more likely than not that these assets will be realized 
prior to the fourth quarter of fiscal  these deferred tax assets had been fully reserved 
the  income tax benefit is partially offset by a current tax provision of  related to taxes for various state tax jurisdictions and federal alternative minimum tax for fiscal for fiscal and  income tax expense totaled  and  respectively  which primarily related to taxes for various state tax jurisdictions 
we expect our effective tax rate will be approximately for federal and various state tax jurisdictions in the near term 
preferred dividends and accretion in fiscal  preferred dividends totaled  in fiscal  we recorded preferred dividends and accretion related to the beneficial conversion feature of our preferred stock of  and  respectively  compared to  and  respectively  in fiscal in october  under the terms of our respective certificate of determination with respect to both the series d preferred stock and series e preferred stock  the series d preferred and the series e preferred automatically converted into shares of common stock after twenty consecutive trading days where the per share closing price of our common stock as reported on the nasdaq national market exceeded and  respectively 
consequently  we have eliminated our obligation to pay an ongoing annual dividend to the holders of the series d preferred and series e preferred 
liquidity and capital resources as of march   we had  in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments as compared to  at march  cash provided used in fiscal  and was as follows year ended march  cash provided by operating activities   cash used in investing activities    cash provided by used in financing activities   net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents  operating activities net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal was  this was primarily the result of net income of  offset by the effects of non cash expenses including depreciation and amortization of  common stock issued for employee benefits plan of  stock based compensation of  stock option income tax benefits of  and an increase in net deferred tax assets of  additional cash was generated from a decrease of  in prepaid expenses  deposits and other assets  increases of  in accounts payable   in accrued payroll and related expenses   in deferred rent and  in deferred revenue 
uses of cash from operating activities included increases totaling  in trade receivables and in inventories and a decrease of long term commission obligation of  net income in fiscal included a one time income tax benefit of  related to existing deferred tax assets principally net operating loss carryforwards because we concluded that it is more likely than not that these assets will be realized 
prior to the fourth quarter of fiscal  the net deferred tax assets had been fully reserved 
the increase in trade receivable of  is primarily due to sales made in the last month of the quarter 
the increase in inventory of  which mainly consists of finished reagent discs  is primarily due to higher sales forecast 
net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal was  this was primarily the result of net income of  offset by the effects of non cash expenses including depreciation and amortization of  common stock issued for employee benefits plan of  and stock based compensation of  additional cash was generated from a decrease inventories of  and increases totaling  in accounts payable  accrued payroll and related expenses and deferred rent 
the decrease in inventory was due to lower inventory levels as of march  resulting from better inventory management 
the increase in accrued payroll and related expenses is primarily due to an increase in our headcount during fiscal uses of cash from operating activities included increases totaling  in trade receivables  prepaid expenses  deposits and other assets and decreases totaling  in warranty reserve  other accrued liabilities  deferred revenue and long term commission obligation 
we anticipate to incur incremental additional costs to support our future operations  including further commercialization of our products and development of new test methods that will allow us to expand our veterinary market and further penetrate the human diagnostic market  acquisition of capital equipment for our manufacturing facilities  which includes the ongoing costs related to continuing development of our current and future products  additional pre clinical testing and clinical trials for our current and future products  and the design and production of our next generation blood chemistry analyzers 
we anticipate that our existing capital resources  debt financing  and anticipated revenue from the sales of our products will be adequate to satisfy our currently planned operating and financial requirements through the next twelve months 
our future capital requirements will largely depend upon the increased market acceptance of our point of care blood analyzer products 
however  our sales for any future periods are not predictable with a significant degree of certainty 
regardless  we may seek to raise additional funds to leverage our internal expansion into the human medical market or pursue strategic acquisition opportunities 
investing activities net cash used in investing activities for fiscal was  and was primarily related to purchases of short term investments of  and  of property and equipment and  of intellectual property relating to patents 
net cash used in investing activities for fiscal was  and was primarily related to  of purchases in property and equipment 
our short term investments consist of various certificate of deposits with maturities greater than three months at the balance sheet date and less than twelve months 
our short term investment objective is to maximize yields without significantly increased risk 
we anticipate that we will continue to purchase property and equipment necessary in the normal course of our business 
financing activities net cash provided by financing activities of  included  of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and warrants  partially offset by repayments of  on our equipment loan finance and capital leases 
during fiscal  we paid off the outstanding balance of our equipment financing loan of  net cash provided by financing activities of  included  of net proceeds from the issuance of series e preferred stock  net borrowings of  from our line of credit  offset by cash dividends of  and repayments on our line of credit  equipment financing loan and capital leases totaling  preferred stock in october  under the terms of our respective certificate of determination with respect to both the series d preferred stock the series d preferred and series e preferred stock the series e preferred  the series d preferred and the series e preferred automatically converted into shares of common stock after twenty consecutive trading days where the per share closing price of our common stock as reported on the nasdaq national market exceeded and  respectively 
elective conversions  coupled with the automatic conversion of all remaining outstanding series e preferred stock  resulted in the conversion of  shares of series e preferred stock into  shares of common stock during fiscal elective conversions  coupled with the automatic conversion of all remaining outstanding series d preferred stock  resulted in the conversion of  shares of series d preferred stock into  shares of common stock during fiscal consequently  we have eliminated our obligation to pay an ongoing annual dividend that the holders of the series d preferred and series e preferred would have otherwise received in either cash or shares of our common stock 
line of credit and long term debt in september  we terminated our existing line of credit with comerica bank california and entered into a new line of credit with comerica bank california  which provides for borrowings of up to  bears interest at the bank s prime rate minus  which totaled at march   and is payable monthly 
of the  available   was committed to secure a letter of credit for our facilities lease 
the letter of credit will be reduced to  if we meet certain requirements as outlined in the terms of our facilities lease agreement  which among other stipulations  includes a minimum cumulative net income requirement of  for four consecutive quarters 
the new line of credit terminates upon notification by either party and the outstanding balance is payable upon demand 
at march   there was no amount outstanding under our line of credit 
the weighted average interest rate on the line of credit during and was and  respectively 
in september  our foreign line of credit expired 
we also had an equipment financing loan  which bore interest at the prime rate plus  which totaled at march   and is payable in monthly installments of  in principal and interest 
in march  we paid off the remaining outstanding balance of our equipment financing loan 
total repayments in fiscal were  at march   there was no amount outstanding under our equipment financing loan 
at march   the outstanding balance on our equipment financing loan totaled  the weighted average interest rate on equipment financing loans during fiscal and was and  respectively 
the line of credit agreement contain certain financial covenants  which are evaluated on a quarterly basis 
included in these financial covenants  among other stipulations  is a requirement that we have a minimum net income of  before preferred stock dividends and accretion in any three quarters of a fiscal year  provided that any loss before preferred stock dividends and accretion incurred in the remaining quarter is not to exceed  we are also required to be profitable  as defined  on a fiscal year to date basis beginning with the six month period ending september  and to have net income before preferred stock dividends and accretion on preferred stock of  for the fiscal year ending march  in addition  we are required to have a quick ratio  as defined  of not less than to  cash flow coverage  as defined  of not less than to  debt to net worth ratio  as defined  not greater than to and to maintain a tangible effective net worth  as defined  of not less than  at march   we were in compliance with these covenants 
borrowings under the line of credit are collateralized by our net book value of assets of million at march  including our intellectual property 
critical accounting policies we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations are discussed below 
for a more detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see the notes to financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition revenues from product sales  net of estimated sales allowances and rebates  are recognized upon shipment when a purchase order has been received  the sales price is fixed and determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
rights of return are not provided and provisions are made at the time the related revenue is recognized for the estimated future costs to be incurred under initial standard warranty obligations of one year 
revenues received for  or allocated to extended warranty arrangements are recognized ratably over the related warranty period 
instrument revenues under cross distribution agreements where we and another party purchase each other s products for resale are recognized upon sale of the products to the end user 
development and licensing revenue is recognized in accordance with the related contract terms 
we make estimates to adjust revenues for estimated sales allowances and rebates based on historical data and terms of current promotions  including cash rebates and trade in programs in which we issue credit to customers as incentives for purchasing our products 
although we believe these estimates are reliable  it is possible that actual allowance or rebate amounts realized could vary from our estimates and that the amounts of such differences could affect our operating results 
reserves and accruals we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts based on our assessment of the collectibility of amounts owed us by customers which is mostly determined by the customer s payment history and the outstanding period of accounts 
in addition  we provide provisions for the estimated future costs to be incurred under our standard warranty obligations of one year 
actual amounts realized could vary from our estimates and affect our operating results 
income taxes as of march   we had net deferred tax assets of  primarily resulting from net operating loss carryforwards nols  which consist of  of federal nols that expire at various times through  and  of state nols that expire at various times through at march   the company eliminated the valuation allowance previously maintained against deferred tax assets to the extent that it is more likely than not that it will generate sufficient taxable income in the future to realize the deferred tax assets 
we will continue to evaluate our deferred tax assets in the future to determine whether a deferred tax asset valuation allowance is required at some future point 
contractual obligations as of march   we have the following outstanding contractual obligations in september  we entered into a co promotion agreement with abbott laboratories 
the agreement was for an initial term of two years 
as of september   the co promotion agreement with abbott laboratories was terminated in accordance with its terms 
while this agreement was in effect  we incurred commission obligations to abbott laboratories totaling  at march   payable over a four year period 
the present value of such obligations were recorded concurrent with the respective sales using a discount rate of 
at march   there was no outstanding balance on our line of credit  which is payable upon demand 
at march   there was no outstanding balance on our equipment financing loan 
in march  we paid off the remaining outstanding balance of our equipment financing loan 
total repayments on our equipment financing loan during fiscal was  the future minimum payments under our capital and operating leases at march  are as follows capital operating leases leases fiscal year ending march  thereafter total minimum lease payments less amounts representing interest to present value of minimum lease payments less amounts due within one year long term portion in connection with our facility lease agreement  we have established a letter of credit for  which is secured by our line of credit 
the letter of credit will be reduced to  if we meet certain requirements as outlined in the terms of our facilities lease agreement  which among other stipulations  includes a minimum cumulative net income requirement of  for four consecutive quarters 
purchase commitments in november  we entered into an oem agreement with diatron messtechnik gmbh diatron of austria to purchase diatron hematology instruments 
under the terms of the agreement  we are commited to purchase a minimum number of hematology units from diatron once their product was qualified for sale 
qualification occurred in may and accordingly  we have minimum purchase commitments 
the outstanding commitment for fiscal through was     and  respectively 
in november  we arrived at general terms with sa scientific  inc  of san antonio  texas  to purchase canine heartworm antigen tests over a period of four years 
in december  we reached an out of court settlement with one of our competitors  idexx laboratories  inc  which alleged in an action filed with the united states district court for the district court of maine that the canine heartworm antigen test supplied to us by sa scientific infringed on two of idexx s patents 
in light of the terms of this settlement  we do not believe  based on the general terms that we have agreed to with sa scientific  that we will be obligated to purchase any of the canine heartworm antigen tests 
although we subsequently sold a limited number of redesigned canine heartworm tests manufactured by sa scientific  we have subsequently terminated our relationship with sa scientific 
contingencies we are from time to time involved in various litigation matters in the normal course of business 
we believe that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
sfas no 
amends fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  sfas no 
amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements of the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
we adopted the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
on january  we did not change to using the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation as permitted by the voluntary transition provisions of sfas  and therefore  adoption of sfas no 
did not have an impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows in the financial statements 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts collectively referred to as derivatives and for hedging activities under fasb statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement is effective for contracts entered into or modified after june  the adoption of this statement did not have an impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
this statement establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
this statement is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may  and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  the adoption of this statement did not have an impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  in january  and a revised interpretation of fin fin r in december fin requires certain variable interest entities vies to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
the provisions of fin are effective immediately for all arrangements entered into after january  since january   we have not invested in any entities that we believe are variable interest entities for which we are the primary beneficiary 
for all arrangements entered into after january   we are required to continue to apply fin through the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal we are required to adopt the provisions of fin r for those arrangements in the first quarter of fiscal for arrangements entered into prior to february   we are required to adopt the provisions of fin r in the first quarter of fiscal we do not expect the adoption of fin r to have an impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
risk factors that may affect our performance our future performance is subject to a number of risks 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business could be harmed and the trading price of our common stock could decline 
when used in these risk factors  the words anticipates  believes  expects  intends  plans  future  and similar expressions identify forward looking statements 
our actual results could differ materially from those that we project in the forward looking statements as a result of factors that we have set forth throughout this document as well as factors of which we are currently not aware 
we have not been consistently profitable  we must increase sales of our piccolo and vetscan dxs products to maintain consistent profitability we recognized a net loss attributable to common shareholders in four of the last twelve fiscal quarters ended march  there can be no assurance that we will experience profitability in the future 
as of march   we have incurred cumulative net losses of million 
our ability to be consistently profitable will depend  in part  on our ability to increase our sales volumes of our vetscan dxs and piccolo products 
increasing our sales volume of our products will depend upon our ability to continue to develop our products  increase our sales and marketing activities  effectively manage our manufacturing activities  and effectively compete against current and future competitors 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully increase our sales volumes of our products to achieve sustained profitability 
we are not able to predict sales in future quarters and a number of factors affect our periodic results we are not able to accurately predict our sales in future quarters 
in any quarter  we derive almost half of our revenues from two distributors who resell our products to the ultimate user 
while we are better able to predict sales of our reagent discs  as we sell these discs primarily for use with blood chemistry analyzers that we sold in prior periods  we generally are unable to predict with much certainty sales of our analyzers  as we typically sell our analyzers to new users 
accordingly  our sales in any one quarter are not indicative of our sales in any future period 
in addition  we generally operate with limited order backlog  because we ship our products shortly after we receive the orders from our customers 
as a result  our product sales in any quarter are generally dependent on orders that we receive and ship in that quarter 
we base our expense levels  which are to a large extent fixed  in part on our expectations as to future revenues 
we may be unable to reduce our spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall 
as a result  any such shortfall would immediately materially and adversely impact our operating results and financial condition 
in addition  we have historically experienced a decrease in our sales  especially in europe  in our second and third quarters  ending in september and december of each year  which we believe is due to seasonal patterns in the decision making processes to acquire our products 
accordingly  we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful 
our periodic operating results have varied in the past 
in the future  we anticipate our periodic operating results to vary significantly depending on  but not limited to  a number of factors  including  in addition to those factors discussed elsewhere in this section new product announcements made by us or our competitors  changes in our pricing structures or the pricing structures of our competitors  our ability to develop  introduce and market new products on a timely basis  our manufacturing capacities and our ability to increase the scale of these capacities  the mix of product sales between our analyzer and our reagent disc products  the amount we spend on research and development  and changes in our strategy 
we could fail to achieve anticipated revenue if the market does not accept our products our core compact blood chemistry analyzer product differs substantially from current blood chemistry analyzers on the market 
our primary competition is from centralized laboratories that offer a greater number of tests than our products  but do so at greater cost and requiring more time 
we also compete with other point of care analyzers that cost more  require more maintenance and offer a narrower range of tests 
however  these point of care analyzers are generally marketed by larger companies which have greater resources for sales and marketing  in addition to a recognized brand name and established distribution relationships 
historically we have marketed our vetscan analyzer to veterinarians and we have relatively limited experience in large scale sales of our piccolo analyzer into the human medical market 
we continue to develop new animal blood tests that we cannot be assured will be accepted by the veterinary market 
although we believe that our blood analyzers offer consumers many advantages  including according to our analyses substantial cost savings  in terms of the actual product and implementation of it procedurally  these advantages involve changes to current standard practices  such as using large clinical laboratories  that will require changes in both the procedures and mindset of care providers 
the human medical market in particular is highly regulated  structured and often slow to adopt new product offerings 
if we are unable to convince large numbers of medical clinics  hospitals and other point of care environments of the benefits of our products  we will suffer lost sales and could fail to achieve anticipated revenue 
we are dependent upon our profitability  and if we cannot remain profitable we may need additional funding in the future and these funds may not be available to us we believe that our existing capital resources  available line of credit and anticipated revenue from the sales of our products will be adequate to satisfy our currently planned operating and financial requirements through march   although no assurances can be given 
our bank financing documents contain a number of covenants concerning financial tests that we must meet that are more fully detailed in the agreements that we have filed with the sec as exhibits to our periodic reports 
we may need additional funds if we are unable to meet requirements for continuing access to bank financing or if we do not achieve anticipated revenues from the sale of our piccolo and vetscan products 
further  we expect to incur incremental additional costs to support our future operations  including further commercialization of our products and development of new test methods to allow us to further penetrate the human diagnostic market and the veterinary diagnostic market  our need to acquire capital equipment for our manufacturing facilities  which includes the ongoing implementation of our semi automated manufacturing lines to provide capacity for the production of commercial volumes of our products  research and design costs related to the continuing development of our current and future products  and additional pre clinical testing and clinical trials for our current and future products 
to the extent that our existing resources and anticipated revenue from the sale of our products are insufficient to fund our activities or if we are unable to meet the financial tests contained in our bank financing documents  we may have to raise additional funds from the issuance of public or private securities 
in the event that we cannot maintain compliance with the financial covenants of our bank financing agreements  we may also be subject to increased interest rate expenses 
we may not be able to raise additional funding  or if we are able to  we may not be able to raise funding on acceptable terms 
we may also dilute then existing shareholders if we raise additional funds by issuing new equity securities 
alternately  we may have to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies  products and or sales territories if we are required to obtain funds through arrangements with collaborative partners 
if we are unable to raise needed funds  we may be required to curtail our operations significantly 
this would materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
we rely on patents and other proprietary information  the loss of any of which would negatively affect our business as of june  patent applications have been filed on behalf of abaxis with the united states patent and trademark office  of which have been issued 
additionally  we have filed several international patent applications covering the same subject matter as our domestic applications 
the patent position of any medical device manufacturer  including abaxis  is uncertain and may involve complex legal and factual issues 
consequently  we may not be issued any additional patents  either domestically or internationally 
furthermore  our patents may not provide significant proprietary protection because there is a chance that they will be circumvented or invalidated 
we cannot be certain that we were the first creator of the inventions covered by our issued patents or pending patent applications  or that we were the first to file patent applications for these inventions  because the united states patent and trademark office maintains all patent applications that are not filed in any foreign jurisdictions in secrecy until it issues the patents unless a patent application owner files a request for publication and publications of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature tend to lag behind actual discoveries by several months 
we may have to participate in interference proceedings  which are proceedings in front of the us patent and trademark office  to determine who will be issued a patent 
these proceedings could be costly and could be decided against us 
we also rely upon copyrights  trademarks and unpatented trade secrets 
others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques that would undermine our proprietary technologies 
further  others may gain access to our trade secrets or disclose such technology 
although we require our employees  consultants and advisors to execute agreements that require that our corporate information be kept confidential and that any inventions by these individuals are property of abaxis  there can be no assurance that these agreements will provide meaningful protection or adequate remedies for our trade secrets in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of such information 
the unauthorized dissemination of our confidential information would negatively impact our business 
we continue to develop our marketing and distribution experience in the human diagnostic market although we have gained experience marketing our vetscan system products for the past eight years in the veterinary diagnostic market  we have much less experience in marketing the piccolo system in the human diagnostic market 
accordingly  we have limited sales  marketing and distribution experience  especially in the human diagnostic market 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to establish and maintain effective distribution arrangements in the human medical market  any distribution arrangements that we are able to establish will be successful in marketing our products  or the costs associated with marketing and distributing our products will not be excessive 
should we fail to effectively develop our marketing and distribution efforts  our growth will be limited and our results of operations will be adversely affected 
we may inadvertently produce defective products  which may subject us to significant warranty liabilities or product liability claims and we may have insufficient product liability insurance our business exposes us to potential warranty and product liability risks which are inherent in the testing  manufacturing and marketing of human and veterinary medical products 
we strive to apply sophisticated methods to raw materials and produce defect free medical test equipment 
although we have established procedures for quality control on both the raw materials that we receive from suppliers and our manufactured final products  these procedures may prove inadequate to detect a defect that either occurs in limited quantities or that we have not anticipated 
we believe that our piccolo and vetscan systems detect the vast majority of errors that occur on our reagent discs and automatically reject such tests  prompting the medical provider to retest the patient 
however  our piccolo and vetscan systems may be unable to detect errors which could result in the misdiagnosis of human or veterinary patients 
should we inadvertently ship defective products  we may be subject to substantial claims under our warranty policy or product liability law 
in addition  our policy is to credit medical providers for any defective product that we produce  including those reagent discs that are rejected by our piccolo and vetscan systems 
therefore  even if a mass defect within a lot or lots of reagent discs were detected by our piccolo and vetscan systems  our need to replace such reagent discs free of charge would materially harm our financial condition 
further  in the event that a product defect is not detected by our piccolo system  our relatively recent expansion into the human medical market greatly increases the risk that the amount of damages involved with just one product defect would be material to our operations 
we currently maintain limited product liability insurance that we believe is adequate for our needs  taking into account the risks involved and cost of coverage 
however  our product liability insurance and cash may be insufficient to cover potential liabilities 
in addition  in the future the coverage that we require may be unavailable on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
even with our current insurance coverage  a mass product defect  product liability claim or recall would materially adversely affect our business or our financial condition 
many of our sales force have been employed by us for less than one year and we must effectively train and integrate our sales team in order to achieve our anticipated revenue we have thirty three full time sales personnel involved in our sales and marketing activities  many of whom have been employed by us for a limited period of time 
while these individuals work with our distribution partners both domestically and internationally to extend our market reach  the primary selling activities are often done by these individuals 
if we are to increase our sales  we will need to train new salespeople and supervise them closely 
we also will continue hiring additional sales personnel 
if we are unable to retain our existing personnel  or attract and train additional qualified personnel  our growth may be limited due to our lack of capacity to market our products 
we need to successfully manufacture and market additional  recently approved reagent discs for the human diagnostic market if we are to compete in that market we have developed a blood analysis system that consists of a portable blood analyzer and single use reagent discs 
each reagent disc performs a series of standard blood tests 
we believe that it is necessary to develop additional series of reagent discs with various tests for use with the piccolo and vetscan dxs 
historically  we primarily developed reagent discs suitable for the veterinary diagnostic market 
we recently received approval from the us food and drug administration to begin selling additional tests  namely magnesium assay  hdl and triglycerides  for the more lucrative human diagnostic market 
these tests are included in standard tests for which the medical community receives reimbursements from third party payors such as hmos and medicare 
we may not be able to successfully manufacture or market these newly developed reagent discs 
our failure to meet these challenges will materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
we rely on distributors to sell our products  we rely on sole distributor arrangements in a number of countries we distribute our products primarily through distributors 
as a result  we are dependent upon these distributors to sell our products and to assist us in promoting and creating a demand for our products 
we have a number of distributors in the united states who distribute our vetscan products 
two distributors  vedco inc and dvm resources accounted for and  respectively  of total revenues for fiscal  and  respectively  of total revenues for fiscal and and  respectively  of total revenues for fiscal we believe that our future growth depends on the efforts of these distributors 
if one of our distributors  particularly vedco  inc  were to stop selling our products we may not be able to replace such lost revenue 
we operate on a purchase order basis with vedco  inc and dvm resources and each of these distributors is under no contractual obligation to continue carrying our products 
further  many of our distributors may carry our competitors products  and may promote our competitors products over our own products 
finally  we do not have at this time distribution partners in the united states who distribute our products for the human diagnostic market 
internationally  we have one distributor in japan for our products in both the human and veterinary diagnostic markets 
we currently have distribution agreements for our vetscan products in argentina  australia  austria  bahrain  belgium  france  germany  greece  israel  italy  japan  korea  kuwait  mexico  new zealand  nigeria  norway  poland  portugal  south africa  spain  switzerland  united arab emirates  the united kingdom and venezuela 
our distributor in each of these countries is responsible for obtaining the necessary approvals to sell our products 
these distributors may not be successful in obtaining proper approvals for our products in their respective countries  and they may not be successful in marketing our products 
we plan to enter into additional distribution agreements to expand our international distribution base and solidify our international presence 
however  we may not be successful in entering into additional distributor agreements 
our distributors may terminate their relationship with us at any time 
historically  we have experienced a high degree of turnover among our international distributors 
this high degree of turnover makes it difficult for us to establish a steady distribution network overseas 
consequently  we may not be successful in marketing our piccolo system and vetscan products internationally 
we depend on sole suppliers for several key components to our products  many of whom we have not entered into contractual relationships with we use several key components that are currently available from limited or sole sources as discussed below reagent discs two injection molding manufacturers  c 
brewer co 
and nypro oregon  inc  currently make the molded plastic discs which  when loaded with reagents and welded together  form our reagent disc products 
we believe that only a few manufacturers are capable of producing these discs to the narrow tolerances that we require  to date  we have only qualified these two manufacturers  with nypro oregon  inc being qualified at two separate facilities  to manufacture the molded plastic discs 
reagent chemicals we currently depend on the following single source vendors for some of the chemicals that we use to produce the dry reagent chemistry beads that are either inserted in our reagent discs or sold as a stand alone product amano enzyme usa co  ltd  genzyme corporation  kikkoman corporation biochemical division  microgenics corporation  roche molecular biochemicals of roche diagnostics corporatioin  a division of f 
hoffmann la roche  ltd  shinko american inc  and sigma aldrich inc blood analyzer components our analyzer products use several technologically advanced components that we currently purchase from two single source vendors  perkinelmer  inc and electro alliance  inc 
our analyzers use a printer that is only made by seiko north america corporation 
the loss of the supply of any of these components could force us to redesign our analyzers 
hematology instrument and reagents we purchase the hmii instruments from diatron of austria 
to date  we have qualified these two suppliers to produce the reagents for the hematology instruments mallinckrodt baker bv and clinical diagnostic solutions  inc we operate on a purchase order basis with all of the suppliers of our molded plastic reagent discs  reagent chemicals  and blood analyzer components and thus these suppliers are under no contractual obligation to supply us with their products or to do so at specified prices 
although we believe that there are potential alternate suppliers available for these critical components  to date we have not qualified additional vendors beyond those referenced above 
because we are dependent on a limited number of suppliers and manufacturers for critical components to our products  we are particularly susceptible to any interruption in the supply of these products or the viability of our assembly arrangements 
the loss of any one of these suppliers or a disruption in our manufacturing arrangements could materially adversely affect our business and financial condition 
we compete with larger  better established entities such as hospitals and commercial laboratories blood analysis is a well established field in which there are a number of competitors that have substantially greater financial resources and larger  more established marketing  sales and service organizations than we do 
we compete with the following organizations commercial clinical laboratories  hospitals clinical laboratories  and manufacturers of bench top multi test blood analyzers and other testing systems that health care providers can use on site 
we may not be able to compete with these organizations or their products or with future organizations or future products historically  hospitals and commercial laboratories perform the most human diagnostic testing  and commercial laboratories perform the most veterinary diagnostic testing 
we have identified five principal factors that customers typically use to evaluate our products and those of our competitors 
these factors are range of tests offered  the immediacy of results  cost effectiveness  ease of use  and reliability of results 
we believe that we compete effectively on each of these factors except for the range of tests offered 
clinical laboratories are effective at processing large panels of tests using skilled technicians and complex equipment 
while our current offering of reagent discs cannot provide the same broad range of tests  we believe that in certain limited markets our products provide a sufficient breadth of test menus to compete successfully with clinical laboratories given the advantages of our products with respect to the other four factors 
however  we cannot assure you that we will continue to be able to compete effectively on cost effectiveness  ease of use  immediacy of results or reliability of results 
we also cannot assure you that we will ever be able to compete effectively solely on the basis of range of tests offered 
competition in the human and veterinary diagnostic markets is intense 
our principal competitors in the human blood analyzer market are alfa wassermann spa  hemagen diagnostics  inc  i stat corporation which was recently purchased by abbott laboratories  johnson johnson including its subsidiary  ortho clinical diagnostics  inc  novitron international  inc and roche 
our principal competitors in the veterinary blood analyzer market are idexx laboratories  inc and heska corporation 
most of our competitors have significantly greater financial and other resources than we do 
in particular  many of our competitors have large sales forces and well established distribution channels 
consequently  we must develop our distribution channels and improve our direct sales force in order to compete in these markets 
changes in third party payor reimbursement regulations can negatively affect our business by regulating the maximum amount of reimbursement they will provide for blood testing services  third party payors  such as hmos  pay per service insurance plans  medicare and medicaid  can indirectly affect the pricing or the relative attractiveness of our human testing products 
for example  the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms sets the level of reimbursement of fees for blood testing services for medicare beneficiaries 
if third party payors decrease the reimbursement amounts for blood testing services  it may decrease the amount that physicians and hospitals are able to charge patients for such services 
consequently  we will need to charge less for our products 
if the government and third party payors do not provide for adequate coverage and reimbursement levels to allow health care providers to use our products  the demand for our products will decrease 
we are subject to numerous governmental regulations need for fda clearance for our medical device products our piccolo products are regulated under the medical device amendments to the food  drug and cosmetic act  which is administered by the food and drug administration 
the fda has classified our piccolo products as class i and class ii devices 
these classifications require us to submit to the fda a pre market notification form or k 
the fda uses the k to substantiate product claims that are made by medical device manufacturers prior to marketing 
in our k notification  we must  among other things  establish that the product we plan to market is substantially equivalent to a product that was on the market prior to the adoption of the medical device amendment or to a product that the fda has previously cleared under the k process 
the fda review process of a k notification can last anywhere from three to six months  and the fda must issue a written order finding substantial equivalence before a company can market a medical device 
to date  we have received market clearance from the fda for our piccolo system and reagent tests that we have on eleven reagent discs 
we are currently developing additional tests that the fda will have to clear through the k notification procedures 
these new test products are crucial for our success in the human diagnostic market 
if we do not receive k clearance for a particular product  we will not be able to sell that product in the united states 
need to comply with manufacturing regulations the medical device amendment also requires us to manufacture our piccolo products in accordance with good manufacturing practices guidelines 
current good manufacturing practice requirements are set forth in the cfr quality system regulation 
these requirements regulate the methods used in  and the facilities and controls used for  the design  manufacture  packaging  storage  installation and servicing of our medical devices intended for human use 
our manufacturing facility is subject to periodic audits 
in addition  various state regulatory agencies may regulate the manufacture of our products 
for example  we have obtained a license from the state of california to manufacture our products 
in april  the state of california food and drug branch granted our manufacturing facility in compliance status  based on the regulations for good manufacturing practices for medical devices 
in may  the state of california food and drug branch granted licensing for our new union city facility 
the most recent inspection was in march when the us fda conducted a facilities inspection and verified our compliance with the cfr regulation 
we cannot assure you that we will successfully pass a re inspection by the fda or the state of california 
in addition  we cannot assure you that we can comply with all current or future government manufacturing requirements and regulations 
if we are unable to comply with the regulations  or if we do not pass routine inspections  our business and results of operations will be materially adversely affected 
effects of the clinical laboratory improvement amendments on our products our piccolo products are affected by the clinical laboratory improvement amendments of the clinical laboratory improvement amendments are intended to insure the quality and reliability of all medical testing in the united states regardless of where tests are performed 
the current clinical laboratory improvement amendments divide laboratory tests into three categories simple  moderately complex and highly complex 
tests performed using the piccolo system are in the moderately complex category 
this category requires that any location in which testing is performed be certified as a laboratory 
hence  we can only sell our piccolo products to customers who meet the standards of a laboratory 
to receive laboratory certification  a testing facility must be certified by the centers for medicare and medicaid services 
after the testing facility receives a laboratory certification  it must then meet the clinical laboratory improvement amendments regulations 
because we can only sell our piccolo products to testing facilities that are certified laboratories  the market for our products is correspondingly constrained 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we submitted a petition for waived status to the food and drug administration fda after we conducted clinical studies designed to demonstrate the ability of untrained personnel to use the piccolo and obtain reliable results from the piccolo lipid panel reagent disc total cholesterol  hdl  and triglycerides 
waived status would permit untrained personnel to run the piccolo using the lipid panel and  thus  extending the sites doctors offices and other point of care environments that can use the piccolo 
currently  this petition is under evaluation by the fda 
we cannot assure you that we will successfully receive the waived status from the fda 
consequently  the market for our piccolo products may be confined to those testing facilities that are certified as laboratories and our growth will be limited accordingly 
we are subject to various federal  state and local regulations federal and state regulations regarding the manufacture and sale of health care products and diagnostic devices may change 
in addition  as we continue to sell in foreign markets  we may have to obtain additional governmental clearances in those markets 
for example  in december  we received certification from the british standards institute to the iso quality system standard for medical devices 
this quality system certification  along with successful completion of product testing to current european standards and the translation of piccolo product documentation into the required languages  enabled us to meet the compliance requirements of the ce mark and the current european in vitro device directive 
we cannot predict what impact  if any  such current or future regulatory changes would have on our business 
we may not be able to obtain regulatory clearances for our products in the united states or in foreign markets  and the failure to obtain these regulatory clearances will materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 
although we believe that we will be able to comply with all applicable regulations of the food and drug administration and of the state of california  including the quality system regulation  current regulations depend on administrative interpretations 
future interpretations made by the food and drug administration  the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms or other regulatory bodies may adversely affect our business 
we depend on key members of our management and scientific staff  and we must retain and recruit qualified individuals if we are to be competitive we are highly dependent on the principal members of our management and scientific staff 
the loss of any of these key personnel  including in particular clinton h 
severson  our president  chief executive officer and chairman of our board of directors  might impede the achievement of our business objectives 
mr 
severson s amended and restated employment agreement with us was filed with the sec on august  as an exhibit to our quarterly report for the quarter ended june  we are not aware of any member of our executive management team who intends to retire within one year of the date of this filing 
we currently do not maintain key man life insurance on any of our employees 
although historically we have been relatively successful both in retaining our current management and scientific staff and attracting and retaining skilled and experienced marketing  sales and manufacturing personnel  we may not be able to employ such personnel on acceptable terms in the future because numerous medical products and other high technology companies compete for the services of these qualified individuals 
legislative actions  higher insurance cost and potential new accounting pronouncements are likely to cause our general and administrative expenses to increase and impact our future financial position and results of operations in order to comply with the newly adopted sarbanes oxley act of  as well as proposed changes to listing standards by nasdaq  and proposed accounting changes by the securities and exchange commission  we may be required to enhance our internal controls  hire additional personnel and utilize additional outside legal  accounting and advisory services  all of which will cause our general and administrative costs to increase 
insurers are also likely to increase premiums as a result of the high claims rates incurred over the past year  and so our premiums for our various insurance policies  including our directors and officers insurance policies  are likely to increase 
proposed changes in the accounting rules  including legislative and other proposals to account for employee stock options as a compensation expense among others  could materially increase the expenses that we report under generally accepted accounting principles and adversely affect our operating results 
we must comply with strict and potentially costly environmental regulations we are subject to stringent federal  state and local laws  rules  regulations and policies that govern the use  generation  manufacture  storage  air emission  effluent discharge  handling and disposal of certain materials and wastes 
in particular  we are subject to laws  rules and regulations governing the handling and disposal of biohazardous materials used in the development and testing of our products 
we handle and dispose of human and veterinary blood samples for testing whole blood  plasma  serum and we pay approximately  per year to comply with applicable environmental regulations 
although we believe that we have complied with applicable laws and regulations in all material respects and have not been required to take any action to correct any noncompliance  we may have to incur significant costs to comply with environmental regulations if our manufacturing to commercial levels continues to increase 
in addition  if a government agency determines that we have not complied with these laws  rules and regulations  we may have to pay significant fines and or take remedial action that would be expensive and we do not carry environmental related insurance coverage 
system failures or delays may harm our business and our facilities and manufacturing operations are vulnerable to natural disasters and other unexpected losses our success depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our manufacturing operations  which are co located with our corporate headquarters in union city  california 
a failure of manufacturing operations  be it in the development and manufacturing of our piccolo or vetscan analyzers or the reagent discs used in the analyzers could result in our inability to supply customer demand 
we do not have a backup facility to provide redundant manufacturing capacity in the event of a system failure 
accordingly  if our union city location experienced a system failure  or regulatory problem that temporarily shut down our manufacturing facility  our manufacturing ability would become unavailable until we were able to bring an alternative facility online  a process which could take several weeks or even months 
these manufacturing operations are also vulnerable to damage from earthquakes  fire  floods  power loss  telecommunications failures  break ins and similar events 
although we carry property and business interruption insurance  our coverage may not be adequate to compensate us for all losses that may occur 
additionally  our computer servers may be vulnerable to computer viruses  physical or electronic break ins and similar disruptions 
fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and the possible lack of financial stability in foreign countries could prevent overseas sales growth our international sales are overwhelmingly currently us dollar denominated 
as a result  an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products less competitive in international markets 
for the limited amount of our sales denominated in local currencies  we are subject to fluctuations in exchange rates between the us dollar and the particular local currency 
our operating results could also be adversely affected by the seasonality of international sales and the economic conditions of our overseas markets 
our stock price is highly volatile and investing in our stock involves a high degree of risk the market price of our common stock  like the securities of many other medical products companies  fluctuates over a wide range  and will continue to be highly volatile in the future 
during the past two fiscal years  our stock price closed at a high of on january  and a low of on august  the following factors may affect the market price of our common stock fluctuation in our operating results  announcements of technological innovations or new commercial products by us or our competitors  changes in governmental regulation  prospects and proposals for health care reform  governmental or third party payors controls on prices that our customers may pay for our products  developments or disputes concerning patent or our other proprietary rights  public concern as to the safety of our devices or similar devices developed by our competitors  and general market conditions 
because our stock price is so volatile  investing in our common stock is highly risky 
a potential investor must be able to withstand the loss of his entire investment in our common stock 
our shareholders rights plan and our ability to issue preferred stock may delay or prevent a change of control of abaxis our shareholder rights plan  adopted by our board of directors on april  may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire  or discourage a third party from attempting to acquire  control of abaxis 
the shareholder rights plan could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
in addition  our board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to determine the price  rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions  including voting rights  of those shares without any further vote or action by the stockholders  except to the extent required by nasdaq rules 
the issuance of preferred stock  while providing flexibility in connection with possible financings or acquisitions or other corporate purposes  could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks with respect to interest rates on our line of credit and cash equivalent investments 
for our line of credit  which provides for borrowings of up to  the interest rate is equal to the prime rate minus  which totaled at march  consequently  an increase in the prime rate would expose us to higher interest expenses 
there was no outstanding balance on our line of credit at march  for our equipment loan  the interest rate was equal to over the prime rate 
there was no outstanding balance on our equipment loan at march  all of our sales are denominated in us dollars  except for sales under our terminated oem agreement to provide vetscan systems to melet which were denominated in euros 
during fiscal  our sales to melet were of our total revenues 
at march   the net receivable from melet was as a matter of management policy  we do not currently enter into transactions involving derivative financial instruments 
in the event we do enter into such transactions in the future  such items will be accounted for in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  in which case we will formally document all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items  as well as our risk management objective and strategy for undertaking such hedge transactions
