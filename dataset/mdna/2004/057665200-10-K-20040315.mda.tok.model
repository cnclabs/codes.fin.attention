results of operations overview the company develops  manufactures and markets specialty performance ingredients and products for the food  feed and medical sterilization industries 
the company s reportable segments are strategic businesses that offer products and services to different markets 
the company presently has three reportable segments  specialty products  encapsulated nutritional products and bcp ingredients 
specialty products segment the specialty products segment repackages and distributes the following specialty gases ethylene oxide  blends of ethylene oxide  propylene oxide and methyl chloride 
ethylene oxide  at the level  is sold as a chemical sterilant gas  primarily for use in the health care industry and is used to sterilize medical devices 
contract sterilizers  medical device manufacturers  medical gas distributors and hospitals are the company s principal customers for this product 
blends of ethylene oxide are sold as fumigants and are highly effective in killing bacteria  fungi  and insects in spices and other seasoning materials 
in addition  the company also sells single use canisters with ethylene oxide for use in medical device sterilization 
propylene oxide and methyl chloride  are sold principally to customers seeking smaller as opposed to bulk quantities 
management believes that future success in this segment is highly dependent on the company s ability to maintain its strong reputation for excellent quality  safety and customer service 
encapsulated nutritional products the encapsulated nutritional products segment predominantly encapsulates performance ingredients for use throughout the food and animal health industries to enhance nutritional fortification  processing  mixing  packaging applications and shelf life improvement 
major end product applications are baked goods  refrigerated and frozen dough systems  processed meats  seasoning blends and confections 
management believes this segment s key strengths are its proprietary technology and end product application capabilities 
the success of the company s efforts to increase revenue in this segment is highly dependent on the timing of marketing launches of new products in the us and international food market by the company s customers and prospects 
increased competition  economic slowness and less than expected market acceptance of end products in both the domestic and international food markets has during the past year resulted in lower volumes sold and lower average selling prices which have had an impact on profit margins 
to counter this  the company  through its innovative proprietary technology and applications expertise  continues to develop new microencapsulation products designed to solve and respond to customer problems and needs 
sales of our reashure tm product for the animal nutrition and health industry are highly dependent on dairy industry economics as well as the ability of the company to leverage the results of existing successful university research on the animal health benefits of this product 
bcp ingredients bcp ingredients manufactures and supplies choline chloride  an essential nutrient for animal health  to the poultry and swine industries 
in addition  certain derivatives of choline chloride are also marketed into industrial applications 
management believes that success in this commodity oriented marketplace is highly dependent on the company s ability to maintain its strong reputation for excellent quality and customer service 
in addition  the company must continue to increase production efficiencies in order to maintain its low cost position to effectively compete for market share in a highly competitive marketplace 
the company sells products for all segments through its own sales force  independent distributors  and sales agents

management of the company is required to make certain estimates and assumptions during the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
these estimates and assumptions impact the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements 
estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically and the effects of revisions are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period they are determined to be necessary 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the company s significant accounting policies are described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
not all of these significant accounting policies require management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments or estimates 
however  management considers the following policies to be critical within the sec definition 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized upon product shipment  and passage of title and risk of loss 
the company reports amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling as revenue and includes costs incurred for shipping and handling in cost of sales 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost first in  first out or average or market value and have been reduced by an allowance for excess and obsolete inventories 
inventory reserves are generally recorded when the inventory for a product exceeds twelve months of demand for that product and or when individual products have been in inventory for greater than six months 
long lived assets long lived assets  such as property  plant  and equipment  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset  which is generally based on discounted cash flows 
goodwill  which is not subject to amortization  is tested annually for impairment  and more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount of an applicable reporting unit exceeds its fair value 
accounts receivable we market our products to a diverse customer base  principally throughout the united states  europe  mexico and japan 
we grant credit terms in the normal course of business to our customers

we continuously monitor collections and payments from customers and maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
estimated losses are based on historical experience and any specific customer collection issues identified 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances and related bad debt expense may be required 
postemployment benefits the company provides life insurance and health care benefits for eligible retirees and health care benefits for retirees eligible survivors 
the costs and obligations related to these benefits reflect the company s assumptions as to general economic conditions and health care cost trends 
the cost of providing plan benefits also depends on demographic assumptions including retirements  mortality  turnover  and plan participation 
if actual experience differs from these assumptions  the cost of providing these benefits could increase or decrease 
the company has elected to defer accounting for the economic effects of the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of the act 
in accordance with fsp fas  any measures of the accumulated postretirement plan benefit obligation or net periodic postretirement plan benefit cost in the consolidated financial statements or accompanying notes do not reflect the effects of the act on the plan 
specific authoritative guidance on the accounting for the federal subsidy is pending and that guidance  when issued  could require the company to change previously reported information 
intangible assets the useful life of an intangible asset is based on the company s assumptions regarding expected use of the asset  the relationship of the intangible asset to another asset or group of assets  any legal  regulatory or contractual provisions that may limit the useful life of the asset or that enable renewal or extension of the asset s legal or contractual life without substantial cost  the effects of obsolescence  demand  competition and other economic factors  and the level of maintenance expenditures required to obtain the expected future cash flows from the asset and their related impact on the asset s useful life

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of operations  the company is exposed to market risks arising from adverse changes in interest rates
