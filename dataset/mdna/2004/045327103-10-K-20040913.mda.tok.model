item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview since our founding in  we have developed and marketed software and services to companies in the process industries 
in addition to internally generated growth  we have acquired a number of businesses  including hyprotech on may  we acquired hyprotech in a transaction accounted for as a purchase 
our operating results include the operating results of hyprotech only for periods subsequent to the date of acquisition 
we typically license our engineering solutions for terms of three to five years and license our manufacturing supply chain solutions for terms of years 
see item business products software and services 
software license revenues  including license renewals  consists principally of revenues earned under fixed term and perpetual software license agreements and is generally recognized upon shipment of the software if collection of the resulting receivable is probable  the fee is fixed or determinable  and vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  of fair value exists for all undelivered elements 
we determine vsoe based upon the price charged when the same element is sold separately 
maintenance and support vsoe represents a consistent percentage of the license fees charged to customers 
consulting services vsoe represents standard rates  which we charge our customers when we sell our consulting services separately 
for an element not yet being sold separately  vsoe represents the price established by management having the relevant authority when it is probable that the price  once established  will not change before the separate introduction of the element into the marketplace 
revenues under license arrangements  which may include several different software products and services sold together  are allocated to each element based on the residual method in accordance with american institute of certified public accountants  statement of position  or sop   software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and subsequently recognized when earned 
we have established sufficient vsoe for professional services  training and maintenance and support services 
accordingly  software license revenues are recognized under the residual method in arrangements in which software is licensed with professional services  training and maintenance and support services 
we use installment contracts as a standard business practice and have a history of successfully collecting under the original payment terms without making concessions on payments  products or services 
maintenance and support services revenues are recognized ratably over the life of the maintenance and support contract period 
maintenance and support services include telephone support and unspecified rights to product upgrades and enhancements 
these services are typically sold for a one year term and are sold either as part of a multiple element arrangement with software licenses or are sold independently at time of renewal 
we do not provide specified upgrades to our customers in connection with the licensing of our software products 
service revenues from fixed price contracts are recognized using the proportional performance method  measured by the percentage of costs primarily labor incurred to date as compared to the estimated total costs primarily labor for each contract 
when a loss is anticipated on a contract  the full amount thereof is provided currently 
service revenues from time and expense contracts and consulting and training revenues are recognized as the related services are performed 
services that have been performed but for which billings have not been made are recorded as unbilled services  and billings that have been recorded before the services have been performed are recorded as unearned revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
in accordance with the emerging issues task force issue no 
 income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred  reimbursement received for out of pocket expenses is recorded as revenue and not as a reduction of expenses 
we license our software in us dollars and several foreign currencies 
we hedge material foreign currency denominated installments receivable with specific hedge contracts in amounts equal to those installments receivable 
historically  we experience minor foreign currency exchange gains or losses due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations  the impact of which have typically not been material 
we do not expect fluctuations in foreign currencies to have a significant impact on either our revenues or our expenses in the foreseeable future 
significant events year ended june  on august   we issued and sold  shares of series d preferred 
we also delivered cash and  shares of series d preferred in consideration for the surrender of all of our outstanding series b preferred 
each share of series d preferred is currently convertible  at the holder s option  into shares of our common stock and may be converted into additional shares of our common stock upon certain events as a result of antidilution provisions in our charter 
in addition  we issued wd warrants to purchase up to  shares of common stock at a purchase price of per share  and exchanged existing warrants to purchase  shares of common stock for wb warrants to purchase  shares of common stock at a purchase price of per share 
during fiscal  we used proceeds from the series d financing and the sale of installments receivable to repurchase and retire million of our convertible debentures 
in addition  we also paid million to settle our remaining obligation to accenture 
in december  we executed a non recourse receivables purchase agreement with silicon valley bank  pursuant to which we have the ability to sell receivables to the bank through january  under the terms of this agreement  the total outstanding balance of sold receivables may not exceed million at any one time 
we have agreed to act as the bank s agent for collection of the sold receivables 
in june  we executed a plan to reduce our operating costs  primarily involving the closure of certain facilities 
this resulted in a restructuring charge totaling million  included in restructuring charges and ftc legal costs as described below 
summary of restructuring accruals fiscal in june  we initiated a plan to reduce our operating expenses in order to better align our operating cost structure with the current economic environment and to improve our operating margins 
the plan to reduce operating expenses resulted in the consolidation of facilities  headcount reductions  and the termination of operating contracts 
these actions resulted in an aggregate restructuring charge of million  recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal as of june   there was million remaining in accrued expenses relating to the remaining severance obligations and lease payments 
during the year ended june   the following activity was recorded in thousands closure consolidation of facilities and contract exit costs employee severance  benefits  and related costs asset impairments total restructuring charge     fiscal payments   impairment of assets   accrued expenses  june    expected final payment date february december fiscal in october  we initiated a plan to further reduce operating expenses in response to first quarter revenue results that were below expectations and to general economic uncertainties 
in addition  we revised revenue expectations for the remainder of the fiscal year and beyond  primarily related to the manufacturing supply chain product line  which has been affected the most by the current economic conditions 
the plan to reduce operating expenses resulted in headcount reductions  consolidation of facilities  and discontinuation of development and support for certain non critical products 
these actions resulted in an aggregate restructuring charge of million  recorded during the three months ended december  in june we reviewed our estimates to this plan and recorded a million increase to the accrual  primarily due to revisions of the facility sub lease assumptions  as well as increases to severance and other costs 
during fiscal  we recorded a decrease to the accrual related to revised assumptions associated with lease exit costs and severance obligations  and recorded a payment of million associated with the buyout of a remaining lease obligation 
as of june   there was million remaining in accrued expenses relating to the remaining severance obligations and lease payments 
during the year ended june   the following activity was recorded in thousands closure consolidation of facilities employee severance  benefits  and related costs impairment of assets and disposition costs total accrued expenses  june      fiscal payments    adjustment facility lease buyout   adjustment revised assumptions accrued expenses  june    expected final payment date december april april fiscal in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we initiated a plan to reduce operating expenses and to restructure operations around our two primary product lines  engineering software and manufacturing supply chain software 
we reduced worldwide headcount by approximately  or employees  closed and consolidated facilities  and disposed of certain assets  resulting in an aggregate restructuring charge of million 
during fiscal  we recorded a decrease to the accrual related to revised assumptions associated with lease exit costs and severance obligations  and recorded a payment of million associated with the buyout of a remaining lease obligation 
as of june   there was million remaining in accrued expenses relating to the remaining severance obligations and lease payments

at that time  we also reduced our revenue expectations for the fourth quarter of fiscal year and for the fiscal year based on the reduced revenue expectations  management evaluated the business plan and made significant changes  resulting in a restructuring plan for our operations 
this restructuring plan included a reduction in headcount  a substantial decrease in discretionary spending and a sharpening of our e business focus to emphasize our marketplace solutions 
the restructuring plan resulted in a pre tax charge totaling million 
during june  the remaining balance of the accrual was paid  as we executed a buy out of our remaining lease obligation 
during the year ended june   the following activity was recorded in thousands closure consolidation of facilities accrued expenses  june  fiscal payments adjustment facility lease buyout accrued expenses  june  fiscal in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we undertook certain actions to restructure our business 
the restructuring resulted from a lower than expected level of license revenues which adversely affected fiscal year operating results 
the license revenue shortfall resulted primarily from delayed decision making driven by economic difficulties among customers in certain of our core vertical markets 
the restructuring plan resulted in a pre tax restructuring charge totaling million 
as of june   there was million remaining in the accrued expenses relating to the restructuring 
during the year ended june   the following activity was recorded in thousands closure consolidation of facilities accrued expenses  june  fiscal payments net of sublease receipts lease payments accrued expenses  june  expected final payment date december critical accounting estimates and judgments our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the significant accounting policies that we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following revenue recognition for both software licenses and fixed fee consulting services  impairment of long lived assets  goodwill and intangible assets  accrual of legal fees associated with outstanding litigation  accounting for income taxes  and allowance for doubtful accounts 
revenue recognition software licenses we recognize software license revenue in accordance with sop no 
 software revenue recognition  as amended by sop no 
and sop no 
 as well as the various interpretations and clarifications of those statements 
these statements require that four basic criteria must be satisfied before software license revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement between ourselves and a third party exists  delivery of our product has occurred  the sales price for the product is fixed or determinable  and collection of the sales price is probable 
our management uses its judgment concerning the satisfaction of these criteria  particularly the criteria relating to the determination of whether the fee is fixed and determinable and the criteria relating to the collectibility of the receivables  particularly the installments receivable  relating to such sales 
should changes and conditions cause management to determine that these criteria are not met for certain future transactions  all or substantially all of the software license revenue recognized for such transactions could be deferred 
revenue recognition consulting services we recognize revenue associated with fixed fee service contracts in accordance with the proportional performance method  measured by the percentage of costs primarily labor incurred to date as compared to the estimated total costs primarily labor for each contract 
when a loss is anticipated on a contract  the full amount of the anticipated loss is provided currently 
our management uses its judgment concerning the estimation of the total costs to complete the contract  considering a number of factors including the experience of the personnel that are performing the services and the overall complexity of the project 
we have a significant amount of experience in the estimation of the total costs to complete a contract and have not typically recorded material losses related to these estimates 
we do not expect the accuracy of our estimates to change significantly in the future 
should changes and conditions cause actual results to differ significantly from management s estimates  revenue recognized in future periods could be adversely affected 
impairment of long lived assets  goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we review the carrying value of long lived assets when circumstances dictate that they should be reevaluated  based upon the expected future operating cash flows of our business 
these future cash flow estimates are based on historical results  adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future markets and operating conditions  and are continuously reviewed based on actual operating trends 
historically  actual results have occasionally differed from our estimated future cash flow estimates 
in the future  actual results may differ materially from these estimates  and accordingly cause a full impairment of our long lived assets 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we conduct at least an annual assessment on january st of the carrying value of our goodwill assets 
we obtain a third party valuation of the reporting units associated with the goodwill assets  which is based on either estimates of future income from the reporting units or estimates of the market value of the units  based on comparable recent transactions 
these estimates of future income are based upon historical results  adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future markets and operating conditions  and are continuously reviewed based on actual operating trends 
historically  actual results have occasionally differed from our estimated future cash flow estimates 
in the future  actual results may differ materially from these estimates 
in addition  the relevancy of recent transactions used to establish market value for our reporting units is based on management s judgment 
during the year ended june   we recorded million in charges related to the impairment of certain long lived assets and technology related intangible and computer software development assets 
the timing and size of future impairment charges involves the application of management s judgment and estimates and could result in the impairment of all or substantially all of our long lived assets  intangible assets and goodwill  which totaled million as of june  accrual of legal fees associated with outstanding litigation we accrue estimated future legal fees associated with outstanding litigation for which management has determined that it is probable that a loss contingency exists 
this requires management to estimate the amount of legal fees that will be incurred in the defense of the litigation 
these estimates are based heavily on our expectations of the scope  length to complete and complexity of the claims 
historically  as these factors have changed after our original estimates  we have adjusted our estimates accordingly 
in the future  additional adjustments may be recorded as the scope  length or complexity of outstanding litigation changes 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax liabilities together with the assessment of temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
tax assets also result from net operating losses  research and development tax credits and foreign tax credits 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase or decrease this allowance in a period  the impact will be included in the tax provision in our statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against these amounts 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance which could result in a tax provision equal to the carrying value of our deferred tax assets 
during the year ended june   we recorded a million valuation allowance against our us domiciled net deferred tax assets 
this charge  however  had no impact on our cash flows 
allowance for doubtful accounts we make judgments as to our ability to collect outstanding receivables and provide allowances for the portion of receivables for which collection is doubtful 
provisions are made based upon a specific review of all significant outstanding invoices 
in determining these provisions  we analyze our historical collection experience and current economic trends 
if the historical data we use to calculate the allowance provided for doubtful accounts do not reflect the future ability to collect outstanding receivables  additional provisions for doubtful accounts may be required for all or substantially all of certain receivable balances

revenues are derived from software licenses  consulting services and maintenance and training 
total revenues for fiscal increased to million from million in fiscal total revenues from customers outside the united states were million or of total revenues and million or of total revenues for fiscal and  respectively 
the geographical mix of revenues can vary from period to period 
software license revenues represented and of total revenues for fiscal and  respectively 
revenues from software licenses in fiscal increased to million from million in fiscal software license revenues are attributable to software license renewals covering existing users  the expansion of existing customer relationships through licenses covering additional users  licenses of additional software products  and  to a lesser extent  to the addition of new customers 
this increase is primarily due to a modest increase in demand for products from our manufacturing supply chain product line  as well as a modest increase in revenues from our customers in the chemical manufacturing industry 
for fiscal  approximately and of our license revenue was derived from products in the engineering product line and manufacturing supply chain product line  respectively  as compared to approximately and  respectively  in fiscal revenues from service and other consist of consulting services  post contract support on software licenses  training and sales of documentation 
revenues from service and other for fiscal decreased to million from million for fiscal this decrease is attributable primarily to the consulting services business 
consulting services decreased due to a year over year million decline in reimbursable expenses  and due to the general low level of licenses of our manufacturing supply chain products during the two most recent fiscal years 
our consulting services are more heavily linked to the implementation of our manufacturing supply chain products than they are to our engineering products 
cost of software licenses 
cost of software licenses consists of royalties  amortization of previously capitalized software costs  costs related to delivery of software  including disk duplication and third party software costs  printing of manuals and packaging 
cost of software licenses for fiscal increased to million from million in fiscal cost of software licenses as a percentage of revenues from software licenses increased to for fiscal from for fiscal the cost increase is primarily due to an increase in royalty costs of million and amortization of computer software development costs of million 
the increase in royalties is attributable to higher license revenues and the increase in the amortization of computer software development costs is due to two significant product releases  aes and ams  during the first part of this fiscal year 
cost of service and other 
cost of service and other consists of the cost of execution of application consulting services  technical support expenses and the cost of training services 
cost of service and other for fiscal decreased to million from million for fiscal cost of service and other  as a percentage of revenues from service and other  decreased to for fiscal from for fiscal the decrease in cost is primarily due to decreased payroll costs of million related to reductions in headcount  as well as a decrease in reimbursable expenses of million 
the costs of service and other as a percentage of service and other revenues are generally consistent from period to period  showing a modest decrease as our utilization rates have increased 
amortization of technology related intangible assets 
amortization of technology related intangible assets consists of the amortization from intangible assets obtained in acquisitions 
these assets are generally being amortized over a period of three to five years 
amortization expense for fiscal decreased to million from million for fiscal the decrease is primarily due to the discontinued amortization of million of intangible assets for which an impairment was recorded in the three months ended december  impairment of technology related intangible and computer software development assets 
impairment of technology related intangible and computer software development assets consists of impairment charges related to assets that are directly involved in the production of revenue 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded an impairment charge of million related to management s decision to discontinue development of certain next generation manufacturing supply chain products 
management s decision was based on concerns about the future revenue projections for these products  and the assessment of costs remaining to bring these products to market 
in fiscal  we recorded an impairment charge of million related to computer software development costs and intangible assets that were related to products that management had decided would not be sold or determined that their carrying values were in excess of their fair values 
the assets that will no longer be used were identified by management s decisions to either discontinue future development efforts associated with certain products 
the carrying values of the remaining assets were compared to the fair values of those assets resulting in an impairment 
the fair values were determined by forecasting the future net cash flows associated with the products 
selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses for fiscal decreased to million from million for fiscal  while decreasing as a percentage of total revenues to from 
the decrease is primarily due to a decrease in advertising costs of million related to aspenworld  which took place in fiscal  and a decrease in payroll and benefit costs of million attributable to the headcount reductions effected in the october restructuring plan 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist of personnel and outside consultancy costs required to conduct our product development efforts 
research and development expenses for fiscal decreased to million from million for fiscal  and decreased as a percentage of total revenues to from 
the decrease is primarily attributable to a million decrease in depreciation and amortization related to assets written off in december  a million decrease in salary and benefit costs associated with the reductions in headcount from the october restructuring plan  a million decrease in consulting costs  and a million decrease in travel costs 
we capitalized software development costs that amounted to of our total research and development costs during fiscal  as compared to in fiscal these percentages will vary from quarter to quarter  depending upon the stage of development for the various projects in a given period 
this decrease is primarily due to the completion of product development activity related to two significant product releases during the first part of fiscal general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries of administrative  executive  financial and legal personnel  outside professional fees and amortization of identifiable intangibles 
general and administrative expenses for fiscal increased to million from million for fiscal  and increased as a percentage of total revenues to from 
this increase is due to a million increase in legal costs associated with legal defense and loss contingencies associated with the kbc litigation and with the settlement of other litigation 
this is offset by a million decrease in salary and benefit costs associated with the reductions in headcount from the october restructuring plan 
long lived asset impairment charges 
in fiscal  this amount consisted of million in impairment charges based on our decisions to discontinue certain internal capital projects that had previously been put on hold 
in addition  certain fixed assets that supported research and development efforts were considered impaired as a result of the product consolidation decisions made in the april product review 
in october  we determined that the goodwill should be tested for impairment as a result of lowered revenue expectations and the overall decline in our market value 
this amounted to a million aggregate impairment charge  recorded in the fiscal accompanying consolidated statement of operations 
concurrent with the goodwill impairment review  we determined that several other assets were also impaired 
this resulted in an additional million in impairment charges in fiscal  related to the intellectual property purchased from accenture in february  internal capital projects and fixed assets 
restructuring charges and ftc legal costs 
during fiscal  we recorded million in restructuring charges and ftc legal costs 
of this amount  million is associated with a june restructuring plan  which is offset by million in adjustments to prior restructuring accruals and deferred rent balances  and million is ftc legal costs  related to the ftc challenge of our acquisition of hyprotech 
in june  we initiated a plan to reduce our operating expenses in order to better align our expense structure with the current economic environment and to improve our operating margins 
this plan coincided with a reduction in our revenue projections for fiscal the plan to reduce operating expenses resulted in the consolidation of facilities  headcount reductions  and the termination of operating contracts 
these actions resulted in an aggregate restructuring charge of million 
this is offset by million in adjustments to the prior restructuring accruals and deferred rent balances  primarily related to the buy out of the remaining obligation for our houston facility  of which portions had previously been vacated and included in previous restructuring plans 
the components of the restructuring plan are as follows closure consolidation of facilities approximately million of the restructuring charge relates to the termination of facility leases and other lease related costs 
the facility leases had remaining terms ranging from several months to eight years 
the amount accrued is an estimate of the remaining obligation under the lease or actual costs to buy out leases  reduced by expected income from the sublease of the underlying properties 
employee severance  benefits and related costs approximately million of the restructuring charge relates to the reduction in headcount 
approximately employees  or of the workforce  were eliminated under the restructuring plan 
a majority of the employees were located in north america  although europe was affected  as well 
all business units were affected  including services  sales and marketing  research and development  and general and administrative 
impairment of assets approximately million of the restructuring charge relates to charges associated with the impairment of fixed assets associated with the closed consolidated facilities 
these assets were reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 and were considered to be impaired because their carrying values were in excess of their fair values 
the fair values were determined based on a quoted market price from a third party 
interest income 
interest income is generated from investment of excess cash in short term investments and from the license of software pursuant to installment contracts 
under these installment contracts  we offer a customer the option to make annual payments for its term licenses instead of a single license fee payment at the beginning of the license term 
historically  a substantial majority of the asset optimization customers have elected to license these products through installment contracts 
included in the annual payments is an implicit interest rate established by us at the time of the license 
as we sell more perpetual licenses for value chain solutions  these sales are being paid for in forms that are generally not installment contracts 
if the mix of sales moves away from installment contracts  interest income in future periods will be reduced 
we sell a portion of the installment contracts to unrelated financial institutions 
the interest earned by us on the installment contract portfolio in any one year is the result of the implicit interest rate established by us on installment contracts and the size of the contract portfolio 
interest income was million for fiscal as compared to million in fiscal this decrease primarily is due to the aggressive collection of receivables and the increased sale of receivables  resulting in the decrease of installments receivable balance 
interest expense 
interest expense was incurred under our convertible debentures  amounts owed to accenture  and capital lease obligations 
interest expense in fiscal decreased to million from million in fiscal this decrease in interest expense results from the elimination of interest bearing debt  such as the payment of the obligation to accenture in august and the repurchase and retirement of a portion of the convertible debentures in september  january  march and may foreign currency exchange gain loss 
foreign currency exchange gains and losses are primarily incurred through the revaluation of receivables denominated in foreign currencies 
in fiscal we recorded a foreign currency exchange gain of million  compared to a million loss in fiscal this increase was due to favorable exchange rate fluctuations and effective hedging of foreign receivable balances 
income loss on equity in joint ventures and realized gain loss on sales of assets 
income loss on equity in joint ventures and realized gain loss on sales of assets was a million gain in fiscal as compared to million loss in fiscal this increase is due primarily to a million gain on the sale of receivables and a million gain on the sale of land in houston  texas 
provision for benefit from income taxes 
we recorded a provision for income taxes of million for fiscal the provision for fiscal includes a million valuation allowance against us domiciled net deferred tax assets and a million provision primarily related to foreign taxes 
we provided a full valuation allowance against the net operating losses generated during fiscal and under sfas no 
 a deferred tax asset related to the future benefit of a tax loss carryforward should be recorded unless we make a determination that it is more likely than not that such deferred tax asset would not be realized 
accordingly  a valuation allowance would be provided against the deferred tax asset to the extent that we cannot demonstrate that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized 
in determining the amount of valuation allowance required  we consider numerous factors  including historical profitability  estimated future taxable income  the volatility of the historical earnings  and the volatility of earnings of the industry in which we operate 
we periodically review our deferred tax asset to determine if such asset is realizable 
in fiscal  we concluded  in accordance with sfas no 
 that we should record a valuation allowance on a significant portion of our deferred tax asset under the more likely than not test and therefore increased the amount of the valuation allowance 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
comparison of fiscal to fiscal revenues 
total revenues for fiscal increased to million from million in fiscal total revenues from customers outside the united states were million or of total revenues and million or of total revenues for fiscal and  respectively 
the geographical mix of revenues can vary from period to period 
software license revenues represented and of total revenues for fiscal and  respectively 
revenues from software licenses in fiscal increased to million from million in fiscal greater software license revenues in fiscal were driven by the inclusion of software license revenue associated with hyprotech  offset by an overall decline in demand for our manufacturing supply chain products 
revenues and expenses associated with hyprotech are included in our results from operations from the may  date of acquisition  for fiscal this includes the month of june and for fiscal this includes the full fiscal year 
revenues from service and other for fiscal decreased to million from million for fiscal this decline in revenue is reflective of a decrease in consulting revenue  partially offset by the inclusion of maintenance revenue associated with hyprotech 
the decline in consulting revenue primarily is related to the decline in demand for our manufacturing supply chain software products  along with which we typically sell consulting projects 
cost of software licenses 
cost of software licenses for fiscal increased to million from million in fiscal cost of software licenses as a percentage of revenues from software licenses increased to for fiscal from for fiscal these increases are primarily the result of a million increase in royalties  primarily related to a royalty arrangement with accenture  which was effective as of the beginning of fiscal  under which we pay royalties on the licensing of certain manufacturing supply chain products 
cost of service and other 
cost of service and other for fiscal decreased to million from million for fiscal cost of service and other  as a percentage of revenues from service and other  decreased to for fiscal from for fiscal this decrease in absolute dollars is due to a decrease in consulting costs of million and a decrease in salary and related costs of million related to the reductions in headcount reflected in the restructuring charges of may and october the decrease as a percentage of service and other revenues was due to the headcount reductions  as well as the increase of revenues from software maintenance as a percentage of service and other revenue  a service that provides higher margins than consulting services 
amortization of technology related intangible assets 
amortization expense for fiscal increased to million from million for fiscal the increase is primarily due to the intangible assets acquired as part of the hyprotech acquisition in may impairment of technology related intangible and computer software development assets 
in fiscal  we recorded an impairment charge of million related to computer software development costs and intangible assets that were related to products that management had decided would not be sold or determined that their carrying values were in excess of their fair values 
the assets that will no longer be used were identified by management s decisions to either discontinue future development efforts associated with certain products 
the carrying values of the remaining assets were compared to the fair values of those assets resulting in an impairment 
the fair values were determined by forecasting the future net cash flows associated with the products 
in fiscal  we recorded an impairment charge of million related to prepaid royalty fees associated with a discontinued product 
selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses for fiscal decreased to million from million for fiscal  while decreasing as a percentage of total revenues to from 
the decreases are attributable to salary and related costs of million associated with the headcount reductions reflected in the restructuring charges of may and october  and million associated with travel and entertainment costs  partially offset by million in costs associated with our october aspenworld conference  which occurs bi annually  the inclusion of costs associated with hyprotech  increases in certain foreign based sales expenses where currencies strengthened as compared to the us dollar  and an increase in sales commissions related to significantly higher license revenues in the three months ended september  as compared to the three months ended september  research and development 
research and development expenses for fiscal decreased to million from million for fiscal  and decreased as a percentage of total revenues to from 
these decreases are attributable to a million decrease in salary and related costs related to the effect of reductions in headcount reflected in the restructuring charges of may and october  partially offset by the inclusion of costs associated with hyprotech and increases in certain foreign based research and development expenses where currencies strengthened as compared to the us dollar 
we capitalized software development costs that amounted to of our total research and development costs during fiscal  as compared to in fiscal this increase is due to product development activity related to the accenture co development alliance  as well as a smaller level of overall research and development spending 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses for fiscal decreased to million from million for fiscal  and decreased as a percentage of total revenues to from 
these decreases are due to a million decrease in salary and related costs related to the reductions in headcount reflected in the restructuring charges of may and october  offset by increases to our bad debt reserve and the inclusion of general and administrative costs associated with hyprotech 
long lived asset impairment charges 
in october  we determined that the goodwill should be tested for impairment as a result of lowered revenue expectations and the overall decline in our market value 
this amounted to a million aggregate impairment charge  recorded in the fiscal accompanying consolidated statement of operations 
concurrent with the goodwill impairment review  we determined that several other assets were also impaired 
this resulted in an additional million in impairment charges in fiscal  related to the intellectual property purchased from accenture in february  internal capital projects and fixed assets 
restructuring charges and ftc legal costs 
during fiscal  we recorded million in restructuring charges and ftc legal costs 
of this amount  million is associated with an october restructuring plan  and million is ftc legal costs 
in october  we initiated a plan to further reduce operating expenses in response to first quarter revenue results that were below expectations and to general economic uncertainties 
in addition  we revised revenue expectations for the remainder of the fiscal year and beyond  primarily related to the manufacturing supply chain product line  which had been affected the most by the current economic conditions 
the plan to reduce operating expenses resulted in headcount reductions  consolidation of facilities  and discontinuation of development and support for certain non critical products 
these actions resulted in an aggregate restructuring charge of million  recorded during the three months ended december  in june we reviewed our estimates to this plan and recorded a million increase to the accrual  primarily due to revisions of the facility sub lease assumptions  as well as increases to severance and other costs 
interest income 
interest income was million for fiscal as compared to million in fiscal this increase primarily is due to the increase of installment contracts associated with hyprotech 
interest expense 
interest expense in fiscal increased to million from million in fiscal this increase primarily is due to interest on the amounts owed to accenture 
foreign currency exchange loss 
foreign currency exchange loss in fiscal decreased to million from million in fiscal this decrease was due to the implementation of a more effective hedging policy for hyprotech s receivables

income loss on equity in joint ventures and realized gain on sales of investments 
income loss on equity in joint ventures and realized gain on sales of investments was a million loss in fiscal as compared to million in income in fiscal the loss in fiscal is related to losses in the joint ventures  caused by the general economic slowdown during the year 
provision for benefit from income taxes 
we provided a full valuation against the foreign and domestic benefit generated during fiscal and recorded a provision for income taxes of million for fiscal the provision for fiscal represents income taxes on income generated in certain foreign jurisdictions where we did not have operating loss carryforwards 
we generated significant us tax loss carryforwards during both fiscal and the provision for fiscal was comprised of an income tax provision related to foreign subsidiaries  a benefit from income taxes and an offsetting increase in the tax valuation 
quarterly results our operating results and cash flow have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate significantly in the future as a result of a variety of factors  including purchasing patterns  timing of introductions of new solutions and enhancements by us and our competitors  and fluctuating economic conditions 
because license fees for our software products are substantial and the implementation of our solutions often requires the services of our engineers over an extended period of time  the sales process for our solutions is lengthy and can exceed one year 
accordingly  software revenues are difficult to predict  and the delay of any order could cause our quarterly revenues to fall substantially below expectations 
moreover  to the extent that we succeed in shifting customer purchases away from point solutions and toward integrated solutions  the likelihood of delays in ordering may increase and the effect of any delay may become more pronounced 
we ship software products within a short period after receipt of an order and usually do not have a material backlog of unfilled orders of software products 
consequently  revenues from software licenses  including license renewals  in any quarter are substantially dependent on orders booked and shipped in that quarter 
historically  a majority of each quarter s revenues from software licenses has been derived from license agreements that have been consummated in the final weeks of the quarter 
therefore  even a short delay in the consummation of an agreement may cause revenues to fall below expectations for that quarter 
since our expense levels are based in part on anticipated revenues  we may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any revenue shortfall and any revenue shortfall would likely have a disproportionately adverse effect on net income 
we expect that these factors will continue to affect our operating results for the foreseeable future

in fiscal and  operating activities used million and provided million of cash  respectively 
in fiscal  investing activities used million of cash primarily as a result of the capitalization of computer software development costs and the ordinary purchases of property and equipment  partially offset by the proceeds from the sale of land in december in fiscal and  investing activities used million and provided million of cash  respectively 
in fiscal  financing activities provided million of cash primarily due to the proceeds from the series d financing  partially offset by pay off of amounts owed to accenture and repurchase and retirement of million of the convertible debentures 
in fiscal and  financing activities provided million and used million of cash  respectively 
historically  we have financed our operations principally through cash generated from public offerings of our convertible debentures and common stock  private offerings of our preferred stock and common stock  operating activities  and the sale of installment contracts to third parties 
in august  we issued and sold  shares of series d preferred  along with wd warrants to purchase up to  shares of common stock  for an aggregate purchase price of million 
concurrently  we paid million and issued  shares of series d preferred  along with wb and wd warrants to purchase up to  shares of common stock  to repurchase all of the outstanding series b preferred 
the series d preferred earns cumulative dividends at an annual rate of  that are payable when and if declared by the board  in cash or  subject to certain conditions  common stock 
each share of series d preferred currently is convertible into shares of common stock  subject to anti dilution and other adjustments 
as a result  the shares of series d preferred currently are convertible into an aggregate of  shares of common stock 
the series d preferred is subject to redemption at the option of the holders as follows on or after august  and on or after august  an aggregate of million of working capital may be used to repay a portion of our convertible debentures at or prior to maturity 
during the year ended june   we repurchased and retired a face value of million of these convertible debentures 
historically  we have had arrangements to sell long term installments receivable to two financial institutions  general electric capital corporation and fleet business credit corporation 
these contracts represent amounts due over the life of existing term licenses 
during fiscal  and  we sold million  million and million of installments receivable  respectively 
as of june   there was approximately million in additional availability under the arrangements 
we expect to continue to have the ability to sell installments receivable  as the collection of the sold receivables will reduce the outstanding balance  and the availability under the arrangements can be increased 
at june   we had a partial recourse obligation that was within the range of million to million 
in december  we executed a non recourse receivables purchase agreement with silicon valley bank  pursuant to which we have the ability to sell receivables to the bank through january  under the terms of this agreement the total outstanding balance of sold receivables may not exceed million at any one time 
we will act as the bank s agent for collection of the sold receivables 
during the year ended june   we sold receivables for aggregate proceeds of million under this agreement and as of june  there was million in remaining availability 
we may in the future establish new arrangements to sell additional installment contracts to other financial institutions and increase our cash position 
in january  we executed a loan arrangement with silicon valley bank 
this arrangement provides a line of credit of up to the lesser of i million or ii of eligible domestic receivables  and a line of credit of up to the lesser of i million or ii of eligible foreign receivables 
the lines of credit bear interest at the bank s prime rate at june  
we are required to maintain a million compensating cash balance with the bank  or be subject to an unused line fee and collateral handling fees 
the lines of credit will initially be collateralized by nearly all of our assets  and upon achieving certain net income targets  the collateral will be reduced to a lien on our accounts receivable 
we are required to meet certain financial covenants  including minimum tangible net worth  minimum cash balances and an adjusted quick ratio 
as of june   there were million in letters of credit outstanding under the line of credit  and there was million available for future borrowing 
on september   we executed an amendment to the loan arrangement that adjusted the terms of certain financial covenants  and cured a default of the tangible net worth covenant as of june  the loan arrangement expires in january  and we are currently in negotiations with the bank to amend and extend the agreement 
as of june   we had cash and cash equivalents totaling million 
our commitments as of june  consisted primarily of the maturity of the convertible debentures on june   royalty commitments owed to accenture  capital lease obligations  and leases on our headquarters and other facilities 
other than these  there were no other commitments for capital or other expenditures 
our obligations related to these items at june  are as follows in thousands thereafter total operating leases      capital leases and debt obligations  accenture royalty commitment  maturity of convertible debentures  total commitments      we believe our current cash balances  availability of sales of our installment contracts  availability under the silicon valley bank line of credit and cash flows from our operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next months 
however  we may need to obtain additional financing thereafter or earlier  if our current plans and projections prove to be inaccurate or our expected cash flows prove to be insufficient to fund our operations because of lower than expected revenues  unanticipated expenses or other unforeseen difficulties  due to normal operations or ftc related costs 
in addition  we may seek to take advantage of favorable market conditions by raising additional funds from time to time through public or private security offerings  debt financings  strategic alliances or other financing sources 
our ability to obtain additional financing will depend on a number of factors  including market conditions  our operating performance and investor interest 
these factors may make the timing  amount  terms and conditions of any financing unattractive 
they may also result in our incurring additional indebtedness or accepting stockholder dilution 
if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms  we may have to forego strategic acquisitions or investments  reduce or defer our development activities  or delay our introduction of new products and services 
any of these actions may seriously harm our business and operating results 
inflation inflation has not had a significant impact on our operating results to date and we do not expect inflation to have a significant impact during fiscal new accounting pronouncements in april  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued sfas no

the translation of our foreign entities assets and liabilities did not have a material impact on our consolidated operating results 
foreign exchange forward contracts are only purchased to hedge certain customer installments receivable amounts denominated in a foreign currency 
foreign exchange hedging we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce our exposure to currency fluctuations on customer installments receivable denominated in foreign currencies 
the objective of these contracts is to limit the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movement on our operating results 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
we had million of foreign exchange forward contracts denominated in japanese  british  swiss  singapore and euro currencies which represented underlying customer installments receivable transactions at the end of fiscal at each balance sheet date  the foreign exchange forward contracts and the related installments receivable denominated in foreign currencies are revalued based on the current market exchange rates 
resulting gains and losses are included in earnings or deferred as a component of other comprehensive income 
these deferred gains and losses are recognized in income in the period in which the underlying anticipated transaction occurs 
gains and losses related to these instruments for fiscal were not material to our financial position 
we do not anticipate any material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  operating results or cash flows resulting from the use of these instruments 
there can be no assurance  however  that these strategies will be effective or that transaction losses can be limited or forecasted accurately

all of these contracts relate to customer accounts and installments receivable

the two loans  denominated in british pounds and canadian dollars  were intended to be a natural hedge against foreign currency risk associated with installment receivable contracts acquired with hyprotech that were denominated in a currency other than their functional currency 
the loan denominated in british pounds was repaid in december and the loan denominated in canadian dollars was repaid in january
