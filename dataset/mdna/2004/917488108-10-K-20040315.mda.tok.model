item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following comments should be read in conjunction with accompanying financial statements 
dollar amounts are in thousands except per share amounts and where noted 
in management s opinion  the extraordinarily favorable event in q of recognizing the tyco patent infringement damages award has an impact on the financial statements that does not allow a meaningful comparison of financial ratios and other financial measures with prior periods

a assets 
year end total assets adjusted per above were  compared to  in because total assets increased while sales were slightly lower relative to  utmd s total asset turns decreased from to ending current assets of  were higher than ending current assets of  primarily because the elimination of the line of credit balance in q allowed a cash and investments build up in q of about  compared to the end of  while other current asset categories netted out to remain about the same 
ending receivables were about higher and ending inventory was about lower 
net property and equipment pp e increased because of the net increase in dollar valued ireland pp e compared to the end of of about  representing about a change in the us dollar usd euro conversion rate 
total pp e depreciation of exceeded new purchases of net intangible assets increased because amortization was offset by in new intellectual property investment 
after the adoption of fasb rule no 
 utmd suspended amortizing goodwill from previous acquisitions 
year ending net intangible assets were of total assets  compared to at year end in  asset turns will decrease because of continued cash build up  unless utmd makes a substantial acquisition  repurchases stock or takes some other action that consumes cash 
depreciation of fixed assets should continue to exceed new purchases 
net intangible assets may change as the result of an acquisition or a determination that current goodwill is impaired  although the latter seems unlikely at this time 
total asset turns will depend primarily upon what management can achieve in utilizing excess cash balances 
except for the oregon facility involved as part of the cmi acquisition and a portion of utmd s midvale parking lot  the company owns its pp e assets 
pp e assets are comprised of utah and ireland manufacturing facilities  molds  production tooling and equipment  test equipment  computer communications equipment and software 
net pp e in the us decreased due to depreciation in excess of purchases 
in ireland  pp e increased  despite no significant new asset purchases and depreciation expense of because of the weaker usd 
with slightly lower consolidated sales and higher pp e in usd terms  pp e turns decreased to from the current book value of consolidated pp e is of acquisition cost 
management believes that pp e is in good working order and capable of supporting increased sales activity 
going forward  financial performance should be enhanced by lower rates of depreciation and continuing higher pp e turns 
the goodwill on utmd s balance sheet is the result of two acquisitions in and which were made in cash at conservative valuations 
as of december   the goodwill on the balance sheet has been reduced by from the acquisition price as a result of utmd using previous gaap through for the purchase method of acquisition accounting 
utmd s future income statement performance could be affected in the case of impairment of the existing goodwill 
the acquired gesco neonatal products and cmi products continue to be viable parts of utmd s overall business activities  representing of total sales in net goodwill on the december  balance sheet is of sales 
utmd does not expect its goodwill intangible assets to become impaired in the foreseeable future 
average inventory turns decreased in to from because average inventory balances remained about the same as while sales declined slightly 
the ending inventory balance was about below the year s average 
management continues to target average inventory turns as its objective  and believes inventory turns will improve in year ending accounts receivable a r balances increased 
calculated average days in a r were on december  based on q shipment activity 
this is well within management s objective of days 
a r over days from invoice date were about of total a r at year end  compared to at year end the company believes these older a r are collectible or within its reserve balances for uncollectible accounts 
working capital at year end was  compared to  at year end because in addition to the increase in cash and investment balances of about  current liabilities at the end of the year were about  lower 
as a result  utmd s current ratio improved to from working capital balances and current ratio will depend primarily upon the timing and extent of management s expected utilization of excess cash 
b liabilities 
in the years  utmd s total liabilities and total debt ratio have been driven by the timing of debt incurred for financing share repurchases  not in providing cash to operate its business 
at the end of  utmd s total debt ratio decreased to from at the end of primarily because the line of credit balance was paid off 
in q  utmd retired the debt associated with its november tender offer under which it repurchased thousand shares at a cost of million 
total shares repurchased in including the tender offer were thousand at a cost of million 
in  in addition to eliminating the debt balance from financing the share repurchases  utmd repurchased thousand shares in the open market at a cost of million 
utmd s total debt ratio in will depend on any financing required to continue to repurchase shares or make acquisitions 
without requirement for any of those financing activities  the total debt ratio due to normal current liabilities should be in the range of 
results of operations 
a revenues 
global consolidated sales decreased about in compared to foreign international sales increased and us domestic sales declined 
utmd divides its domestic sales into two primary distribution channels direct sales which are sales to end user customers by utmd s direct sales force  independent commissioned sales reps  specialty distributors and national hospital distribution companies  and oem sales which are sales to other companies where products are packaged and resold as part another company s product offerings 
as a percentage of total domestic sales  direct sales represented compared to in and in the remaining of domestic sales in were oem sales 
domestic direct sales represented of global consolidated sales in compared to in both and international sales in were of global consolidated sales compared to and in years and respectively 
in the first half of the year  international sales had increased primarily helped by a weaker us dollar 
in the second half  a decision by the fda to withhold export certificates from utmd probably contributed to an international sales decline of 
of the foreign sales  were made in europe  the same as in both and ireland operations shipped of international sales in usd terms in compared to in and in shipments  including intercompany from utmd ltd 
ireland were down in euro terms  and up in usd terms  compared to the prior year 
utmd groups its sales into four product line categories obstetrics  comprised of labor and delivery management tools for monitoring fetal and maternal well being  for reducing risk in performing difficult delivery procedures and for improving clinician safety  gynecology electrosurgery urology  comprised of tools for gynecological procedures associated primarily with cervical uterine disease  including letz  endometrial sampling  diagnostic laparoscopy  and other mis procedures  specialty excision and incision tools  conservative urinary incontinence therapy devices  and urology tools  neonatal care  comprised of devices that provide developmentally friendly care to the most critically ill babies  including providing vascular access  administering vital fluids  maintaining a neutral thermal environment  providing protection and assisting in specialized applications  and blood pressure monitoring accessories other  comprised of specialized components for invasively monitoring blood pressure on a continuous basis with pressure transducer systems  and subcontract molded parts along with other components and products sold on an oem basis to other companies 
in these four categories  utmd s primary revenue contributors often enjoy a dominant market share and typically have differentiated product features protected by patents 
revenues by product category worldwide obstetrics product sales were  in compared to  in and  in of the decline in total obstetrics sales  was from lower sales of vacuum assisted delivery systems vads  a decline  and from lower intran plus sales  a decline 
the lower vads sales resulted primarily from a change in obstetrics practice that favors abdominal operative deliveries over vaginal operative deliveries because of medical malpractice litigation risk 
lower obstetrics sales in general resulted from increased competition including product bundling agreements with us hospital administrators 
despite the decline in utilization  utmd agrees with acog the american college of obstetricians gynecologists that using vads remains the trained physician s best choice in many operative deliveries  and will continue its educational programs regarding appropriate indications and proper use of the procedure 
cheaper priced  less clinically effective products represent significant competition where hospital administrators are constrained by gpo contracts or may not take the total cost of care into consideration  including increased risk of complications and utilization rates 
international obstetrics sales increased to in from in consolidated global gynecology electrosurgery urology product sales were  in compared to  in and  in international sales in this category increased 
a number of utmd products in this fragmented category are patented  so sales should continue to grow as physicians learn more about their advantages 
consolidated global neonatal product sales were  in compared to  in and  in international neonatal product sales decreased 
worldwide blood pressure monitoring and accessories bpm sales were  in compared to  in and  in domestic oem sales in this category  which includes plastic molded components used in other industries affected by the weak us economy  increased 
looking forward to  utmd expects to maintain or modestly increase sales for its established products even though markets for its products will remain intensely competitive  despite the fact that administrative barriers in the us that prevent smaller companies from fairly competing for hospital sales have not been significantly diminished  and despite disappointment in us fda administrators who we believe have inappropriately withheld export certificates to foreign governments since b gross profit 
utmd s average gross profit margin gpm  the surplus after costs of manufacturing  inspecting  packaging  sterilizing  and shipping products cogs are subtracted from net revenues  was a company record compared to in and in utmd continued to experience a favorable shift from lower margin products to higher margin products as a percentage of sales  lower depreciation expense on fixed assets and improved efficiencies in overhead costs 
with respect to gross profits in utmd s sales channels  oem sales are sales of utmd products that are marketed by other companies in conjunction with their product offerings  and are not sold under utmd s label 
utmd utilizes oem sales as a means to help maximize utilization of its capabilities established to satisfy its direct sales business 
as a general rule  prices for oem product sales expressed as a multiple of direct variable manufacturing expenses are lower than for direct sales because in the oem and international channels  utmd s business partners incur significant expenses of sales and marketing 
because of utmd s small size and period to period fluctuations in oem business activity  allocations of fixed manufacturing overheads cannot be meaningfully allocated between direct and oem sales 
therefore  utmd does not report gpm by sales channels 
utmd targets an average gpm greater than or equal to  which it believes is necessary to successfully support the significant operating expenses required in a highly complex and competitive medical device marketplace 
management expects to achieve its gpm target again in expected favorable influences include growth in sales volume without a similar increase in manufacturing overhead expenses  a larger percentage of total sales from higher margin products and a continued emphasis on reengineering products and processes to reduce costs 
expected unfavorable influences are continued competitive pressure on pricing and higher wage rates 
c operating profit 
operating profit  or income from operations  is the surplus after operating expenses are subtracted from gross profits 
operating expenses include sales and marketing s m expenses  research and development r d expenses and general and administrative g a expenses 
operating profit increased to  compared to  in  and  in utmd s operating profit margin operating profits divided by total sales was also a company record in the operating profit margin of compared to in and in operating expenses as a percentage of sales were in and  compared to in a major portion of the decrease in from was due to utmd s required gaap adoption of sfas statement no 
 under which the company recognized no goodwill amortization expense gwa in or gwa was in for comparison  represents of and sales 
looking forward to  utmd expects to continue an outstanding operating margin similar to  primarily as a result of an increase in sales coupled with holding operating expenses about the same 
in order to hold operating expenses the same  utmd expects to be able to offset an increase in s m expenses with a decrease in litigation expenses g a expenses 
i s m expenses s m expenses are the costs of communicating utmd s differences and product advantages  providing training and other customer service in support of the use of utmd s solutions  processing orders and funding gpo fees 
because utmd sells internationally through third party distributors  its s m expenses are predominantly needed for us business activity where it sells directly to clinical users 
the largest component of s m expenses is the cost of directly employing representatives that provide coverage across the us year s m expenses decreased to  from  in and  in  as utmd continued to improve the productivity of its direct sales force 
as a percent of total sales  s m operating expenses were in  in and in looking forward  utmd plans higher s m expenses during due to group purchasing organization fees  increased advertising expenses and new marketing initiatives  but intends to manage s m expenses to remain less than of total sales 
ii r d expenses r d expenses include the costs of investigating clinical needs  developing innovative concepts  testing concepts for viability  validating methods of manufacture  completing regulatory documentation and other activities required for design control  responding to customer requests for product enhancements  and assisting manufacturing engineering on an ongoing basis in developing new processes or improving existing processes 
internal r d expenses were in  in and in as a percent of sales  and r d expenses were compared to in in  the efforts of r d aided utmd s continued gpm improvements 
in addition to new products still being developed  a number of existing products were enhanced or updated 
in  utmd will opportunistically employ r d resources to invest where management anticipates it can get a significant return with future new product sales 
r d expenses are again likely to be in the range of of sales 
iii g a expenses g a expenses include the front office functional costs of executive management  finance and accounting  corporate information systems  human resources  shareholder relations  legal  risk management and protection of intellectual property 
in addition to employing the personnel required to coordinate or manage the preceding functions  g a expenses include outside director costs  outside legal counsel  independent accounting audit fees  k administration  nasdaq exchange fees  write offs of uncollectible receivables  business insurance costs and corporate contributions to charitable organizations 
prior to  g a expenses also included gwa 
g a expenses were  in   in and  in as a percent of sales  g a expenses were in  in and in all three years included considerable litigation expenses relating to the patent infringement lawsuit with tyco kendallo ltp 
in addition  and include increased g a expenses to comply with required governance activities mandated by the sarbanes oxley act of d non operating income  non operating expense and ebt 
non operating income includes royalties from licensing utmd s technology to other companies  rent from leasing unutilized property to others  interest earned from investing the company s excess cash  and gains or losses from the sale of assets  offset by non operating expenses which includes interest expenses and bank fees 
non operating income was in  in and in royalties received were in all three years 
future royalties may vary depending on the success of other companies in selling products licensed by utmd  and the remaining life of the applicable patents 
interest expense associated with the line of credit which reduced non operating income was in  in and in interest costs in and were lower compared to because of significantly lower average loc debt balances  and because interest rates were lower after utmd expects non operating income in to be higher than because of interest income on excess cash balances  but this will depend on the timing of utilization of the excess cash as well as prevailing interest rates 
earnings before income taxes ebt result from adding utmd s non operating income to its operating profits 
ebt were  in   in and  in ebt in were higher than in although sales were lower because of record gross profit margins 
given the projections noted above  management is targeting ebt about the same as ebt excluding the extraordinary non operating income and operating expenses associated with the tyco patent infringement lawsuit 
e net income  eps and roe 
net income is ebt minus income taxes 
net income increased to  in from  in net income was  the growth rate in net income was slightly higher than ebt because utmd s effective tax rate was lower than in the adjusted effective income tax rate in was compared to in and in tax on the extraordinary item was  resulting in a combined rate of 
year to year fluctuations in the tax rate have resulted from the use of a foreign sales corporation  differences in distribution of state income taxes  differences in profits of the ireland subsidiary which is taxed at a rate on exported manufactured products  increases in marginal tax rates for ebt above million  and other factors such as r d tax credits and the timing of actual versus accrued litigation expenses 
the company eliminated its foreign sales corporation in management expects that utmd s consolidated income tax rate may be higher in compared to  but this is difficult to predict 
utmd s normal net income expressed as a percentage of sales ranks in the top performance tier of all us publicly traded companies at  and for years  and  respectively 
this profitability performance factor is the primary driver for utmd s return on shareholders equity roe 
earnings per share eps is net income divided by the number of shares of stock outstanding diluted to take into consideration stock option awards which are in the money have exercise prices below the current period s weighted average market value 
diluted eps were  up from in in  eps were with sales about the same as the combination of higher profitability and fewer outstanding shares accounted for the substantial increase in eps 
utmd management believes shareholder value is improved by consistently increasing eps 
in the last six year period since  utmd has increased eps at an annually compounded rate of per year 
the end of weighted average number of diluted common shares the number used to calculate diluted eps were  in thousands compared to  shares in and  shares in dilution for in the money unexercised options for the year was in thousands shares compared to in  and in the total number of unexercised options outstanding declined about in  following a decline in the prior year 
dilution has increased despite much fewer outstanding option shares due to utmd s higher share price in the stock market 
actual outstanding common shares as of december  were return on shareholders equity roe is the portion of net income retained by utmd to internally finance its growth  divided by the average accumulated shareholders equity during the applicable period 
roe in was compared to in and in this ratio determines how fast the company can afford to grow without adding external financing that would dilute shareholder interests 
for example  a roe will financially support growth in revenues without issuing more stock 
record profitability was primarily responsible for continued outstanding roe result in in utmd s opinion  achieving growth in revenues and eps without diluting shareholder interests maximizes shareholders value 
management s goal is to consistently achieve roe in excess of 
utmd s roe has averaged per year over the last years 
although the accumulation of cash in the absence of share repurchases or acquisitions could reduce total asset turns  and the elimination of long term debt would reduce financial leverage that enhances roe  management expects to be able to achieve its roe objective again in primarily by accomplishing another record year in profitability  assuming utmd effectively deploys its excess cash resulting from the extraordinary event 
liquidity and capital resources 
cash flows 
cash and investment balances were  at the end of  compared to at the end of net cash provided by operating activities  including adjustments for depreciation and other non cash operating expenses  along with changes in working capital  totaled  in compared to  in and  in cash provided by operating activities demonstrates the company s continued control of operating performance aided by a  tax benefit attributable to exercise of employee options in  compared to the same benefit in of and in of the increase in the company s use of cash for investing activities was from purchases of short term investments  in an effort to make prudent use of excess cash 
the company realized in gains from the sale of investments 
in  utmd received and issued  shares of stock upon the exercise of employee and director stock options 
employees and directors exercised a total of  option shares in  with  shares immediately being retired as a result of the individuals trading the shares in payment of the exercise price of the options and related tax withholding requirements 
utmd paid to meet those tax withholding requirements 
utmd repurchased  shares of stock in the open market at a cost of  during option exercises in were at an average price of per share 
share repurchases in the open market were at an average cost of per share  including commissions and fees 
in  the company received a net  from issuing  shares of stock on the exercise of employee stock options  including  shares retired upon an employee trading those shares in payment of the stock option exercise price 
during  utmd made repayments of  on its note payable  which was the remaining balance at the end of  while receiving in proceeds from the note line of credit 
in  utmd made loan repayments of  and received  in proceeds from the note to finance the november tender offer 
the loan proceeds were used to pay for utmd share repurchases as the result of a tender offer 
management believes that future income from operations and effective management of working capital will provide the liquidity needed to finance growth plans 
planned capital expenditures are expected to be approximately to keep facilities  equipment and tooling in good working order 
in addition to capital expenditures  utmd plans to use cash in for selective infusions of technological  marketing or product manufacturing rights to broaden the company s product offerings  for continued share repurchases if the price of the stock remains undervalued  and if available for a reasonable price  acquisitions that may strategically fit utmd s business and are accretive to performance 
the revolving credit line will continue to be available for liquidity when the timing of acquisitions or repurchases of stock require a large amount of cash in a short period of time in excess of existing cash and investment balances 
management plans to use the cash from the tyco damages in one or a combination of the following to make investments in new technology  to acquire a product line that will help spur revenue growth and better utilize utmds infrastructure  and or to buy back utmd shares in the open marketplace

contractual obligations and contingent liabilities and commitments the following is a summary of utmd s significant contractual obligations and commitments as of december  in thousands contractual obligations and less more commitments than than total year years years years long term debt obligations operating lease obligations  purchase obligations   total   the majority of utmd s purchase obligations constitute raw materials for use in its manufacturing operations 
utmd has the right to make changes in  among other things  purchase quantities  delivery schedules and order acceptance 
off balance sheet arrangements utmd s only off balance sheet arrangements are operating leases on its oregon manufacturing facility and on a portion of the parking lot adjacent to its utah facilities 
details on those arrangements are provided above and in note on page f other financial measures ebitda ebt  plus depreciation and amortization expenses  plus interest expense is a term used for measuring a company s ability to generate cash from its operations without regard for changes in working capital  cash consumed for fixed asset purchases  its cost of borrowing or income tax burden 
utmd s ebitda from normal operations in was million  or as a ratio of sales 
utmd s ebitda has averaged of sales over the last five years 
the extraordinarily strong cash generation performance resulted from a combination of outstanding operating profit performance and royalty income from others use of utmd s technology 
with sales and other performance factors approximately the same as in  management projects ebitda about the same in please note that ebitda is not defined or described by generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
as such  it is not prepared in accordance with gaap  is not a measure of liquidity  and is not a measure of operating results 
however  the components of ebitda are prepared in accordance with gaap  and utmd believes that ebitda is an important measure of the company s operating performance and financial well being 
management s outlook 
in summary  in utmd plans to clear up its apparently unresolved qsr status with the us fda that has hindered international sales  slowed new product development  stymied business development and consumed an inordinate amount of human capital since  continue outstanding operating performance  actively look for new acquisitions to facilitate sales growth  and utilize current excess cash balances in shareholders best long term interest 
the following factors provide optimism that will demonstrate better top line growth the continued scrutiny by government agencies into the anti competition  anti innovation and anti good healthcare effects of bundling agreements and exclusive agreements for physician preference products by hospital administrators 
recent supply agreements with five of the top seven hospital gpos 
continued improvements in a maturing us direct sales force 
improvement in general economic conditions that have negatively affected us oem activity 
elimination of unfavorable regulatory interference affecting export sales 
utmd will continue to focus on differentiating itself  especially from commodity oriented competitors 
utmd is small  but its employees are experienced and diligent in their work 
our passion is in providing innovative clinical solutions that will help reduce health risks for women and their babies 
the company has a defined focus  and does not seek to become big as a primary motivation 
we just want to do an excellent job in meeting our customers needs  and provide our shareholders with excellent returns 
the reliability and performance of utmd s products is high and represents significant clinical benefits as well as minimal total cost of care 
physicians do care about the well being of their patients  but their time is limited to evaluate choices  and they have hospital administrators to deal with who often look at the initial price of a product  without understanding the total picture including complications and other less obvious costs 
in the us  utmd will continue to leverage its reputation as an innovator which will responsively take on challenges to work with physicians who use its products in specialty hospital areas  or outside the hospital in their office practices 
internationally  where utmd must depend on the knowledge  focus  relationships and energy of independent distributors  management will continue to closely monitor performance and recruit needed new business partners 
in  utmd again demonstrated a high positive cash flow reflected by achieving record ebitda performance of of sales  managing working capital effectively and keeping new capital expenditures below its rate of depreciation of existing assets 
utmd s balance sheet is strong enough to finance an acquisition in without issuing stock 
in considering acquisitions  utmd looks to acquire successful companies that will enhance its specialist focus 
when utmd acquires a company  it probably will be for cash  and with the idea that it will be able to retain key resources that helped make the acquired entity previously successful 
over the last six years  utmd has made some significant accomplishments compounded eps growth of per year not including receipt of patent infringement damages  two accretive acquisitions which now represent about of the company s business activity  repurchase of of the ownership of the company including dilution of options for million million net shares at an average cost of per share including commissions  other repurchase costs and the difference between option exercise price and market price for option shares exercised  and a successful effort defending the patent rights of utmd s flagship product technology and core franchise of utmd s market identity  resulting in a million damages award 
looking back  utmd s eps were up in  and the ending share price was up relative to the end of the nasdaq composite  s p index and djia were up   and respectively in with eps of excluding tyco damages award  utmd s year end price to trailing earnings ratio per was  suggesting that a combination of per expansion closer to the medical device industry average and continued increases in eps performance could again provide excellent shareholder returns in accounting policy changes
