significant business activities during and the first quarter of  the following developments were of significance we experienced a significant increase in volume and revenues from our global conferencing platform due to increasing usage from our outsourcing relationship with at t 
we estimate this channel could continue to grow in revenues will depend upon customer usage 
we took significant action to cut costs and overhead in this included a major network reconfiguration as part of a project to rationalize and reduce our worldwide telecommunications costs 
we believe this project could yield annual savings going forward of between and million 
we also downsized our workforce by and reorganized the video services division to reduce overhead 
with the retirement of gerald van eeckhout as our chairman and ceo  we named gene warren as president and ceo and mack traynor as our non executive chairman of the board 
in addition  following the resignation of gavin thomson in march  gene warren was named interim principal accounting officer 

table of contents the following table summarizes our most important revenue trends in thousands revenues audioconferencing other revenues concert channel audioconferencing global services channel audioconferencing audioconferencing subtotal videoconferencing total revenues revenue growth percentage principally at t and other global customers 
excluding concert and global services concert downsizing concert was a major customer in when revenues reached their peak at an annualized revenue run rate of approximately million 
during  concert was closed and merged into at t 
throughout this period  we continued to maintain our worldwide infrastructure  telecommunications network and dedicated employee base that we had originally installed to provide services through our relationship with concert 
in  our estimated costs including depreciation were approximately million 
the reason for continuing to incur this significant infrastructure cost was due to the anticipation of additional conferencing volumes from all other sources  which were ultimately achieved as a result of the signing of an outsourced agreement with at t in august at t outsourcing contract among many other telecommunications services  at t provides high quality teleconferencing services to large corporate customers in the us with over four million corporate customers  many of these use teleconferencing services domestically but also have international requirements as at t was previously a percent shareholder in concert and due to the existence of act s established and extensive global service platform built for concert  it was decided that act s worldwide teleconferencing network with established and dedicated local facilities would be an effective way to provide conferencing services to those subsidiaries of american multinationals who are already at t customers in the us but who require conferencing services overseas 
we started implementing this outsource contract in august  and have seen rapid revenue growth since then 
current monthly revenues are at an estimated annualized run rate of approximately million as of january with significant additional potential growth opportunities expected in and the outsource contract requires act to provide detailed levels of quality  sales and service positioning  customer provisioning and comprehensive pricing for a number of different conferencing products  services and applications 
the relationship between both contracting parties is excellent  and in the absence of any presently unknown adverse factors  we expect this contract  which expired on march   to be extended through the end of we also expect this revenue stream to continue to grow 
audioconferencing revenues automated voice conferencing volumes continued to grow at a rapid rate for and pricing remained competitive 
most of our us and canadian customers have already made the transition to automated services  and we now expect strong growth in automated services in the european and asian pacific markets over the next few years 
we expect that the growth of automated services at reduced prices will continue unabated  but the emergence of this product line nevertheless has highlighted some fundamental applications whereby operator attended services will continue to be required by our customers 
our strategy remains to provide a broad range of services to our customers which fit their different communications needs 
we expect our automated services to complement our fully attended offering  and vice versa 
attended voice conferencing services remains one of our core business and still accounts for approximately percent of total revenues 
we are focused on developing new markets and applications for customers in the attended voice conferencing services especially in areas such as training  education and large participant calls 
while we do 
table of contents expect this overall market will grow at a much lower rate over the next few years we also believe that we may be able to achieve a higher growth rate in attended services than the overall market because we are one of the specialized  niche players and have the capacity for faster growth internationally 
videoconferencing revenues videoconferencing revenues have become a more important component of our business  now comprising of total revenue  due to our acquisition of picturetel s c videoconferencing division in october and renamed act videoconferencing  and our acquisition of proximity in january total videoconferencing revenues grew by in as with audioconferencing  we expect to see continued growth in the videoconferencing areas especially as companies continue to reduce travel costs and executives prefer to avoid non essential travel 
in today s uncertain climate with the threat of terrorism and warfare  videoconferencing remains an attractive proposition for high level executives unwilling to travel 
we believe we have identified good opportunities for further cost reduction and network rationalization in our videoconferencing business especially in the telecommunications costs area 
we have also identified opportunities to cross sell our services from audioconferencing to videoconferencing  and vice versa 
we expect that our videoconferencing business will see a strong stimulus for usage as large volume users transition their telecom usage over to the internet thus significantly lowering telecom costs 
internet transmission not only lowers telecom costs for videoconferencing users but also provides higher quality transmission and lower network failure rates 
as transmission costs are fixed  these users are able to utilize videoconferencing services for as long as they need to without incurring the significant additional long distance telephony costs which  up to now  have been a major impediment to the development of videoconferencing 
the much awaited high growth rates in videoconferencing  nevertheless  may be tempered by the emergence of web conferencing applications 
many applications which were previously more suited to a videoconference can now be handled by combining voice and web conferencing at a less expensive price 
we believe therefore that videoconferencing will continue to only be used in situations where it is specifically required by business executives for a specific reason 
web and audioconferencing will be used in most other conferencing situations 
results of operations fiscal year ended december   compared to fiscal year ended december net revenues 
net revenues increased percent to million for the year ended december   compared to million for concert audioconferencing revenues ceased in this loss of revenue was offset by a million increase in global service channel audioconferencing 
audioconferencing accounted for   and percent of revenue in   and respectively 
videoconferencing and other revenue grew by million  or in it accounted for the balance of our revenue

gross profit increased percent to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the prior year 
gross profit percentage increased to percent of net revenues for the year ended december   compared to percent of net revenues for this gross profit increase reflects reduced network costs  and increased usage of our worldwide infrastructure as a result of the at t contract  and the further stabilization of our operating costs 
we anticipate continuing reductions in our video and audio network costs  so that our gross margins will eventually improve back towards our target of percent of net revenues 
selling  general and administrative expense 
selling  general and administrative expense for the year ended december  was million or percent of revenue  compared to million or percent of revenue for a large part of the percent increase in such expense was incurred as legal settlement and staff severance costs 
we expect  with continued strong control of our operating expenses and the benefit of programs implemented in the forth quarter of  that our selling  general and administrative costs will decrease as a percentage of revenues during operating loss 
operating loss declined by million to a loss of a non recurring goodwill impairment charge of million in negatively impacted that year s results 
other operating costs were comparable with interest expense 
net interest expense grew by percent to million from million 
this is due primarily to an increase in debt during the year of approximately at interest rates substantially higher than prior debt  and recognition as a finance cost of the earned performance provision in connection with subordinated debt issues in june 
table of contents provision for income taxes 
provision for income taxes increased to approximately  from  for the year ended december   compared to  as a result of increased taxable income earned by our united kingdom and canada subsidiaries 
we paid no other income taxes due to available domestic and international tax loss carry forwards of approximately million

net loss increased by million for the reasons discussed under operating loss  above  plus the effects of a loss on foreign currency transactions of million 
fiscal year ended december   compared to fiscal year ended december net revenues 
net revenues increased percent to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the percent revenue growth resulted from an increase in video conferencing revenues due to two acquisitions  but was offset by the decline in concert audio conferencing revenues 
concert revenues declined by million or in this was somewhat offset by a million increase in global service channel audioconferencing

gross profit 
gross profit declined percent to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the prior year 
gross profit percentage decreased to percent of net revenues for the year ended december   compared to percent of net revenues for this gross profit decrease reflects the increased volume of higher cost videoconferencing volumes due to the higher network costs associated with videoconferencing 
the decline in gross profit also highlights the loss of concert business which had high margins  and the residual high fixed costs as a result of keeping our telecom network  and our capital and operating infrastructure intact worldwide as discussed above pending implementation of the at t contract 
selling  general and administrative expense 
selling  general and administrative expense for the year ended december  was million or percent of revenue  compared to million or percent of revenue for the percent increase in such expense was incurred mainly as a result of the increase in selling  general and administrative staff arising as a result of our two videoconferencing acquisitions namely  the c division of picturetel and proximity  inc operating income loss 
operating income loss declined by million to a loss of million and reflected the following an overall million reduction in operating income due to the reduction of concert revenues of million  for net savings of million against our operating costs as a result of strict cost control and the cancellation of various discretionary development projects 
a million non cash charge recorded for goodwill impairment offset by the significant savings in operating costs 
interest expense 
net interest expense grew by percent from million to million 
this is due primarily to an increase in debt during the year as well as the addition of debt for acquisitions during provision for income taxes 
provision for income taxes decreased to approximately  from  for the year ended december   compared to  due to reduced taxable income earned by our united kingdom and canada subsidiaries 
we paid no other income taxes due to available domestic and international tax loss carry forwards of approximately million

net loss increased by million for the same reasons discussed under operating income loss  above 

table of contents liquidity  capital resources and cashflow sources and uses of funds for the year ended december  we generated and used cash proceeds as follows we used million for operating activities 
we purchased million of capital assets 
net cash provided by financing activities was million 
we repaid debt of million and received proceeds from the issuance of new debt and attached warrants of million 
the company also issued million of common stock and repaid million of preferred stock dividends and principal 
at december  we had approximately million in current assets  in relation to million in current liabilities excluding the deferred income of million which is not a cash liability 
subsequent to year end  we raised million of equity financing in the first quarter of we have assessed our cashflow needs for as follows we believe we can generate operating cash flow of approximately to million during based upon our current operating plan 
to supplement working cashflow needs  we raised million in equity financing in the first quarter of we intend to obtain additional debt and equity financings to consolidate and accelerate the pay down of certain debt items 
capital expenditures for are anticipated to be in line with levels 
many of our debt instruments are interconnected  and if there is default on any one of them  they must all be repaid 
in addition  our revolving line of credit of million which was due on march  has been extended to may  this is currently being re negotiated  but failure to obtain a further renewal might cause the company to need to seek additional funds 
with the expected growth in our business and existing debt repayment requirements  we may need to seek additional sources of financing which may include additional public or private debt  equity financing by us and or our subsidiaries  or other financing arrangements 
however  there is no assurance that the financing will be available to us and or on acceptable terms should we decide to seek it 
the facilities based teleconferencing service business is a capital intensive business 
our operations have required and will continue to require capital investment for i the purchase and installation of conferencing bridges and other equipment in existing bridging networks and in additional bridging networks to be constructed in new service areas  ii the acquisition and expansion of conferencing platforms currently owned and operated by other companies  and iii the evolution of the platform to support new products  services and technologies 
our expected capital expenditures for general corporate and working capital purposes include i expenditures with respect to our management information system and corporate service support infrastructure and ii operating and administrative expenses with respect to new bridging platforms  networks and debt service 
we plan to make substantial capital investments in connection with plans to construct and develop new bridging networks  as well as for technology upgrades 
expansion of our bridging networks will include the geographic expansion of our existing operations  and we will consider the development of new markets 
in addition  we may desire to acquire existing conferencing companies and their bridging platforms and networks in the future 
occasionally we evaluate potential acquisitions of conferencing assets currently owned and operated by other companies  and expect to continue to do so 
in the event we enter into a definitive agreement with respect to any acquisition  it may require additional financing 
in the event that our plans or assumptions change or prove to be inaccurate  or the foregoing sources of funds prove to be insufficient to fund our growth and operations  or if we complete acquisitions or joint ventures  we will be required to seek additional capital sooner than currently anticipated 
our revenue and costs are dependent upon factors that are not within our control  such as regulatory changes  changes in technology  customer mergers and acquisitions and increased competition 
due to the uncertainty of these and other factors  actual revenue and costs may vary from expected amounts  possibly to a material degree  and such variations are likely to affect the level of our future capital expenditures and expansion plans 
the financial statements do not include any adjustments that could be required if the company were unable to continue as a going concern 
the company has recorded net losses of million in and million in these losses and deficit cash flows have required the company to seek additional financing and has significantly affected its continued ability to obtain financing at desirable terms 
management believes that it will be able to return the company to a position of profitability and positive cash flow in based on actions that have been taken and the following considerations 
the impact of the loss of a major audioconference teleconferencing outsource contract in has now been totally absorbed 
a new major audio outsource contract commenced in the latter part of  and although the revenue build was small in its initial stages  the revenue stream is growing and is expected to continue to grow very rapidly 
the rapid growth of automated voice conferencing with very competitive pricing has severely impacted operations in the past two years 
the volumes continue to grow rapidly and pricing pressures are moderating 
management is taking actions to implement long term contracts with its largest customers and to leverage its growing customer base with less price sensitive services 
a major network reconfiguration as part of a project to rationalize and reduce worldwide telecommunications costs which was commenced in the fourth quarter of is now generating significant telephony expense reductions 
the benefits of a general reduction in staffing and payroll and other operating costs  also taking effect in the fourth quarter  are now being realized 
the company has raised million of equity financing in the first quarter of with this financing and recent improved operations  the company lenders have waived loan covenant violations and more attractive financing alternatives are becoming available

fin is effective at the time of investment for interests obtained in a variable economic entity after january  beginning in fiscal  fin  as amended  will be applied to interests in variable interest entities vies acquired prior to february  we currently have no contractual relationship or other business relationship with a variable interest entity and therefore the adoption of fin no

risk factors an investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk 
investors evaluating us and our business should carefully consider the factors described below and all other information contained in this annual report on form k before purchasing our common stock 
any of the following factors could materially harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
additional factors and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial could also harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
investors could lose all or part of their investment as a result of these factors 
as defined in the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of  except for the historical information contained herein  some of the matters discussed in this annual report on form k contain forward looking statements regarding future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
the following factors  among others  could cause actual results to differ materially from those described by such statements 
we may fail to meet market expectations because of large fluctuations in our quarterly operating results 
as a result of increased competition  changes in the mix of automated versus attended audio conferences  competitive price pressure  and the other risks described in this section  our quarterly operating results have varied significantly from period to period in the past and are likely to continue to vary significantly in future periods 
the primary factors that may cause fluctuations in our quarterly operating results include increased competition  continued pricing pressure  and ongoing market demand for conferencing services 
additionally  we expect our results to fluctuate based on seasonal sales patterns 
the usage of our services declines during the northern hemisphere summer especially in europe in august and around the thanksgiving and december holidays 
our revenue during these seasons historically does not maintain the same pace as other periods of the year because of less use of our services by business customers 
quarterly variations in our operating results may make it difficult to project our future performance and could result in increased volatility in our stock price 

table of contents we may be adversely affected by downward price pressure in the teleconferencing industry 
the prices for our services are subject to rapid and frequent changes 
in many cases  competitors provide their services at significantly reduced rates  or even free of charge  or on a trial basis in order to win customers 
in addition  major telecommunications providers enjoy lower telephony costs as a result of their ownership of the underlying telecommunications network 
as a result  these carriers can offer services similar to ours with certain volume discounts or substantially reduced prices 
price competition in the long distance market has had a negative impact on our ability to mark up our wholesale prices on long distance transport 
in response to these factors  we have reduced our pricing in certain circumstances and may be required to reduce prices further 
reductions in the prices we are able to charge may not be offset by increases in the volumes we handle  and accordingly may decrease our operating margins 
increased use of automated teleconferencing services may result in a decrease in the average prices we charge our customers 
the trend toward increased use of teleconferencing has been accompanied by more demand for low priced automated conferencing 
as the volumes of all types of teleconferences have grown  the percentage of conferences that are higher priced  operator attended conferences has declined  and we expect this trend to continue at least for the near term 
migration to automated services has the effect of decreasing our price per minute and may reduce our margins 
our plans to operate and grow may be limited if we are unable to obtain sufficient financing 
our growth into automated conferencing  web conferencing services  video  and as an outsource provider for international calls has strained our financial resources 
nonetheless  we may need to be prepared to expand our business through further strategic acquisitions and new markets when we identify desirable opportunities 
we may need additional equity and debt financing  collaborative arrangements with channel partners  or funds from other sources for these purposes 
we may not be able to obtain such financing on acceptable terms  or at all 
recent debt financing has added interest expense that has further burdened our cost structure 
failure to obtain additional financing could weaken our operations or prevent us from achieving our expansion goals 
equity financings  as well as debt financing with accompanying warrants  can be dilutive to our shareholders and may make it difficult to sell additional equity at depressed prices  and certain debt financings may impose restrictive covenants on the way we operate our business 
we may not be able to fully comply with all applicable loan covenants 
we have relied on bank financing  preferred stock issuances  and debt transactions to provide needed capital while the equity markets have been depressed 
these financings require compliance with certain covenants 
if we are out of compliance to a material degree with any of these covenants  we may not be able to obtain waivers of non compliance from our lenders or holders of our preferred stock 
this could result in penalties ranging from the issuance of shares or warrants to these lenders or a default on our loans  which would allow certain lenders to accelerate the due date of our indebtedness to them 
we may not have sufficient capital to repay any amounts of accelerated indebtedness 
our senior subordinated lenders have agreed to waive breaches of covenants of which we and they are aware  as of march  we cannot guarantee that any of our lenders will waive any future failures to comply with applicable covenants 
we face operational and financial risks relating to our international operations 
international sales comprise a significant portion of our revenues  and we anticipate that this will continue 
as a result of their distance from the united states  different time zones  culture  management and language differences  international operations pose greater risk than our domestic operations 
for example these factors make it more challenging to manage and administer a globally dispersed business 
since certain international calls are billed in the currency of the country of origin  and in country operating expenses are paid in local currency  currency fluctuations can affect our operating results 
changes in taxes  duties  labor costs  and labor regulations could adversely affect our competitive pricing in some countries 
economic or political instability in one or more of our international markets could adversely affect our operations in those markets 
our major competitors in the telecommunications industry have greater capital resources and brand name recognition than we have  which makes it difficult for us to compete with them 
the telecommunications industry is highly competitive  and most of our competitors and potential competitors have substantially greater capital resources and name recognition than we have 
accordingly  we cannot compete with them in terms of 
table of contents advertising  marketing  sales  and deployment of capital 
certain of our competitors that have emphasized automated conferencing services have achieved operating efficiencies through volumes that we do not yet have 
to compete successfully against other telecommunications and teleconferencing providers  we must maintain competitive pricing while at the same time offering significantly higher quality services 
pricing pressures may result in a reduction in our operating margins 
alternatively  if our service quality does not meet customer expectations  our customers may move away from us in favor of more established competitors 
either of these could hinder our ability to grow our revenues and to achieve our operating goals 
third party vendor dependency 
we rely on third party telecommunications providers for transmission of our conferencing calls 
the failure of any of these providers could have an adverse effect on our ability to seamlessly service our customers 
our revenues may fluctuate because we draw significant revenues from major clients  who may transfer their business away from us 
as disclosed in item under sales and marketing our two largest customers accounted for percent of our revenues  and we expect revenues from our largest customer to grow rapidly over the near term 
due to concentration of our revenues  the loss of any one of our largest customers or one of our principal outsource channel partners would have a significant adverse effect on our conference volumes 
the loss of several of our larger customers would also have an adverse effect on our volumes and this risk will increase if our largest customers increase their volumes of business with us faster than we increase volumes from other sources 
any such reduction in our volumes would have a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations 
our agreements with customers generally do not contain minimum purchase commitments  and customers can easily switch to a competing provider or allocate their business among several vendors 
our customers may discontinue business with us in the future if our products and services become obsolete or technological advances allow our customers to satisfy their own teleconferencing needs 
mergers  consolidations  or other changes in ownership or alliances that impact any of our customers may also cause our customers to curtail or cease doing business with us 
to the extent we lose customers due to any of these factors  our revenues will be adversely affected 
we have made only a limited entry into the web conferencing market 
we have recently entered the web or internet based conferencing market 
the annual market for internet based conferencing services is growing rapidly 
although still small in relation to the audio conferencing market that we serve  our customers are increasingly demanding a full range of conferencing services and our web based conferencing services are beginning to grow 
however  if we do not fully develop this market  especially in web conferencing and internet telephony  we may experience a slowdown in our overall conferencing revenue growth and our competitors may grow faster than we are able to grow 
the expansion of our business into internet based service offerings  simultaneously with other growth needs  will place a strain on our current financial and staff resources 
if we are not able to deploy the assets and personnel needed to fully support web based services  we expect to miss out on significant growth opportunities 
if our internet telephony conferencing services do not gain market acceptance or we are unable to finance this opportunity  our potential for growth in this market sector will be limited 
we estimate that over the next years we will convert certain of our existing high volume multinational customers to an internet telephony based conferencing service with the ability to handle higher volumes at lower prices 
we cannot be certain that internet telephony services will continue to gain worldwide corporate acceptance or prove to be a viable alternative to traditional telephone service 
if the internet telephony market fails to develop or develops slower than we expect  our future revenues from teleconferencing over the internet will be limited 
this could adversely affect the revenue growth rate that we currently expect to achieve 
our prospective internet telephony solutions also will be affected by the availability of capital 
other technological innovations could render our current services obsolete 
we expect technical innovations to stimulate new developments in teleconferencing services 
such technical innovations include the development of more sophisticated computers  telephone sets  private branch exchanges  customer owned bridges  centralized office switching equipment  and internet telephony services 
other technology based competitive developments within the telecommunications industry  such as low priced long distance services and new uses for the internet  may lead the major telecommunications companies to offer low cost teleconferencing services as a strategy to obtain greater market share in other product areas 
these innovations and developments could render our current service offerings obsolete or uneconomic  which could cause us to lose customers and revenues 

table of contents we occasionally experience technical malfunctions and other hazards which adversely affect our operations and create costs 
we depend upon our software systems  communications hardware  and enhanced services platform to conduct our conferencing business on a worldwide basis 
our systems  communications hardware  vendors services  and platform are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters 
power loss 
telecommunication failures 
loss of internet access 
physical and electronic break ins 
hardware defects 
computer viruses 
intentional acts of vandalism  terrorism  or similar events 
in previous years our business has been affected by occasional network failures with consequent poor service and loss of customer goodwill 
we estimate that we usually have to major failures every year as a result of the factors listed above 
any increase in outages or failures due to these types of hazards would result in additional costs resulting from business interruption  and we could lose customers affected by these outages 
there are few regulatory barriers to entry into our current markets  and new competitors may enter at any time 
there are few regulatory barriers to competition in our markets 
recent federal legislation in the united states allows local exchange carriers to offer teleconferencing services 
this legislation may result in additional competition if some or all of the local exchange carriers  including any of the regional bell operating companies  choose to enter or expand their activities in the teleconferencing market in the united states 
moreover  there are no significant regulatory barriers to enter the foreign markets we serve in australia  canada  france  germany  hong kong  the netherlands  singapore  or the united kingdom  and competitors may enter at any time 
to the extent that our customers or potential customers choose to do business with these competitors  their entry into our markets would adversely affect our ability to grow our conferencing volumes and generate revenue 
our common stock price has been highly volatile  and we expect this volatility to continue 
the market price of our common stock is highly volatile and may decline further 
for example  from january  through december  our stock price ranged from a high of to a low of  and closed on december  at 
on april  our common stock closed at 
we anticipate that the volatility of our common stock price may continue due to factors such as actual or anticipated fluctuations in results of our operations 
changes in or failure to meet securities analysts expectations 
changes in market valuations of other teleconferencing companies 
announcements by us or our competitors of significant technological innovations  contracts  acquisitions  strategic partnerships  joint ventures  or capital commitments 
introduction of new services by us or our competitors 
conditions and trends in the teleconferencing industry and related technology industries 
future sales of our common stock by warrant and option holders  including sales by the selling shareholders listed in this prospectus 
these factors are in addition to significant price and volume fluctuations in the securities markets that may be unrelated to our operating performance 
provisions of our articles of incorporation and agreements we have entered could delay or prevent a change in control of act 
certain provisions of our articles of incorporation  and certain agreements we have entered  may discourage  delay  or prevent a merger or acquisition that a shareholder may consider favorable 
these provisions include 
table of contents authority of the board of directors to issue preferred stock 
prohibition on cumulative voting in the election of directors 
election of directors by class for terms of three years 
limitations on the ability of third parties to acquire us by their offer of a premium price to selected shareholders 
agreements with key executives which provide special termination payments in the event of a change in control 
a share rights plan that enables shareholders to dilute an acquiring person s investment through the shareholders purchase of a large number of shares 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our interest expense is sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates 
in this regard  changes in interest rates can affect the interest paid on our long term debt 
to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in interest rates  we generally enter into fixed rate financing arrangements
