item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition the information in the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
all amounts and percentages are rounded 
net earnings for the year ended december  increased to million  or per diluted share  from million  or 
per diluted share for the same period of the company s net earnings are detailed as follows in thousands year ended year ended december  d ecember  insurance operations  real estate operations  other  including realized gains and losses  earnings before impairment of note  receivable impairment of note receivable  net earnings  the increase in net earnings from insurance operations was due to strong underwriting profits in the company s core environmental  excess and surplus and program business lines 
the increase in net earnings from real estate operations was due to increased closings of condominium units and boat slips at harbour village 
the impairment of the note receivable was established in connection with the preparation of our year end financial statements as a result of the review of the financial performance of the golf course property which secures the loan  coupled with a general economic decline in the value of golf course properties 
total revenues for the year ended december  increased to million as compared to the same period of as a result of increased net premiums earned  investment income and realized gains from the sale of investments 
net premiums earned for the year ended december  increased to million from the same period of due to increases in net premiums earned in the company s core lines of business 
net cash flow from operations increased to million for the year ended december  from million in the same period of the following table breaks out the significant components of our consolidated revenues year ended decembe r  to to dollars in thousands net premiums earned environmental    excess and surplus    programs    other    total net premiums earned    net investment income    net realized gains  real estate income    other income  total revenues    the following table sets forth the components of our gaap combined ratio for the period indicated year ended december  insurance operations loss loss adjustment expense ratio expense ratio combined ratio net premiums earned environmental 
after two years of stable premium production  was a strong year for our environmental line 
we saw revenue generation from our strategic decision to start prostar online prostar  an electronic submission  rating and quoting system for our small account business 
new business submissions through prostar increased over the prior year to million 
total prostar production increased over the prior year to million 
this system has allowed us to significantly increase our policy counts while minimizing additional overhead costs necessary to produce such increased volume 
we are also now seeing the benefits of our strategic decision to open a second sales office in cherry hill  new jersey  allowing us to capitalize on the favorable market conditions associated with non prostar accounts  the larger accounts in the market we serve 
overall non prostar written premium increased to million in excess and surplus 
our excess and surplus lines continue to capitalize on current market conditions  specifically  the lack of insurance capacity for certain construction risks 
as our growth allows for increased capacity in this unit  we strive to diversify our risk portfolio both geographically and by class of business 
we continue to work with a small core group of producers to identify selected risks for our portfolio 
renewal premium rate increase of or more was not uncommon 
our calendar year policy count rose from in to in to in we have maintained our underwriting discipline while growing our book of business 
programs 
our program business is seeing growth in net premiums earned through modifications to our underlying program model 
historically  we have not retained significant portions of risk in this line  however  as we see opportunities to generate underwriting profits on existing programs  we are poised to take advantage of those opportunities 
hence  effective in  we took significant risk on a pest control operators program and in and ave expanded our risk position in other programs 
based on the opportunities available in the marketplace  we will continue to look for specialty niche program opportunities where we can take more significant risk positions 
these increased retentions have driven the substantial increases in earned premiums 
other 
the decrease in other premium earnings is attributable to our exiting specific lines of business that no longer fit in our business model 
during the first quarter of  we made the decision to only offer renewal policies for workers compensation business  that line will be in full run off mode starting in the second quarter of in and  we exited the employee leasing and staffing workers compensation line  exited habitational manufacturing commercial lines  and substantially reduced surety writings due to adverse loss experience and the lack of affordable reinsurance 
net investment income the increase in net investment income from to is attributable to an increase in our invested assets offset by a decrease in our investment yield 
average invested assets increased from million to million for  our pre tax investment yield decreased from to  to this decrease is consistent with overall market interest rate declines in the last few years 
the increase in net investment income from to is similarly attributable to increases in our invested assets offset by a decrease in our investment yield 
average invested assets increased from million for to million for  our pre tax investment yield decreased from to from to this decrease is consistent with overall market interest rate declines in the last few years 
net realized gains as a result of the historically low interest rate environment of early  we chose in the second quarter to realize certain interest sensitive gains in our bond portfolio 
this sale of bonds contributed million of our total net realized gains for the year 
real estate income real estate income was million in  million in  and million in this revenue is generated from closings of condominium units and boat slips at our real estate project known as harbour village 
we do not recognize revenue until a closing occurs and title passes to the buyer 
the following chart shows the number of condominium units and boat slips that were closed each year condominium units boat slips total the closings of units began in september when the first building received its certificate of occupancy 
this is the reason the closings are lower in as compared to and during  we expect to close the remaining units at harbour village  and we do not expect to engage in any further real estate activities in the future 
the earnings and funds generated from harbour village will be redeployed into our insurance operations as the project is completed 
loss and loss adjustment expense ratio our ratio increased points from to due to a combination of factors 
negative reserve development contributed an additional percentage points to the loss ratio 
that development was primarily associated with adverse loss experience on our workers compensation lines currently in run off 
see discussion under the loss and loss adjustment expense reserve heading in item of this report for further information 
an offsetting factor to such reserve development was the continuing implementation of our growth strategies in our core business lines 
those business lines continue to project overall loss and loss adjustment expense ratios from the mid to high range depending on the line of business 
our ratio decreased points from to due to the following combination of factors 
positively impacting the ratio were the decisions to exit certain workers compensation classes of business  exit the commercial lines business and to significantly reduce our surety line production 
those lines had overall loss and loss adjustment expense ratio projections of and above and contributed approximately and of the total loss experience during and  respectively 
primarily offsetting those reductions was the continued implementation of our excess and surplus lines growth strategy  which has overall loss and loss adjustment expense ratio projections in the low s and contributed approximately and of the total loss experience during and  respectively 
acquisition expenses acquisition expenses are amounts that are paid to agents and brokers for the production of premium for the company offset in part by the ceding commissions we retain from our reinsurers 
for our program business  fees are typically earned through ceding commissions and have the effect of lowering our acquisition expenses 
acquisition expenses also include amounts paid for premium taxes to the states where we do business on an admitted basis 
acquisition expenses were million in  million in  and million in acquisition expenses as a function of net earned premiums were in both and  and in the decrease in and over is a result of lowering commissions that we pay our brokers to from during on our excess and surplus lines business  which accounts for of total gross written premiums in  and in real estate expenses real estate expenses were million in  million in  and million in the majority of real estate expenses variable costs are recognized at the same time as revenue is recognized 
general and administrative expenses fixed costs are expensed as incurred once the project begins closing units 
the following chart shows the components of costs in millions variable fixed total these variable costs  when applied to real estate revenue  produced gross margins of in  in  and in the gross margin is higher in and due to more closings of boat slips  which produce a higher margin 
the fixed costs are lower in because we began closing units in september prior to that date  most of the fixed costs were capitalized  and after that date all general and administrative costs were expensed as incurred 
liquidity and capital resources we meet our cash requirements and finance our growth principally through cash flows generated from operations 
since we have operated in a hardening market with increased insurance premium rates for general liability coverages and increased fees for program business opportunities 
our primary sources of short term cash flow are premium writings  investment income and income from real estate development sales 
our short term cash requirements relate to claims payments  reinsurance premiums  commissions  salaries  employee benefits  real estate development expenses  and other operating expenses 
due to the uncertainty regarding the timing and amount of settlements of unpaid claims  our future liquidity requirements may vary  therefore  we have structured our investment portfolio maturities to allow for variations in those factors 
we believe our current cash flows are sufficient for the short term needs of our insurance business and our invested assets are sufficient for the long term needs of our insurance business 
consistent with the discussion above  net cash provided from operations was million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  during  we received million from berkley insurance company  which represented payment in settlement of disputes in historical reinsurance treaties 
in june  our board of directors decided to suspend paying dividends on the common shares so that we could expand our capital base 
our ability to pay future dividends to shareholders will depend  to a significant degree  on the ability of our subsidiaries to generate earnings from which to pay dividends to us 
the jurisdictions in which we and our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries are domiciled place limitations on the amount of dividends or other distributions payable by insurance companies in order to protect the solvency of insurers 
given our company s growth and the capital requirements associated with that growth  we do not anticipate paying dividends on the common shares in the near future 
to further provide for the capital requirements associated with our current growth strategy  during  we entered into the following arrangements 
in may  in conjunction with american safety capital trust  a non consolidated owned subsidiary  we issued a year trust preferred obligation in the amount of million 
this obligation bears interest at london interbank offer rate libor plus and is payable on a quarterly basis  and can be called solely at our option in five years 
we also entered into an interest rate swap which sets the interest rate at for the first five years 
in september  in conjunction with american safety capital trust ii  a non consolidated owned subsidiary  we issued a year trust preferred obligation in the amount of million 
this obligation bears interest at libor plus  is payable on a quarterly basis  and may be called at our option in five years 
we also entered into an interest rate swap which sets the interest rate at for the first five years 
in november  we completed a secondary offering of over million common shares whereby we received approximately million of additional capital 
harbour village is being developed in three phases with projected completion in at december   we had outstanding borrowings of million  down from an initial million development and construction loan facility 
the estimated completion cost for the remainder of harbour village is approximately million 
management believes that the bank credit facility  together with anticipated cash flows from marketing and sales operations  will meet the liquidity needs for the construction and development of harbour village 
there can be no assurance  however  that the amounts available from our sources of liquidity  exclusive of the bank credit facility for the project  will be sufficient or available to meet our future capital needs for the project 
see exhibit for further information regarding harbour village 
our contractual obligations at the end of were in thousands less than more than total year ye ars years years long term debt   operating leases  total contractual obligations   contractual obligations for these purposes we have excluded routine purchase of services  including insurance  that are expected to be used in the ordinary course of our business 
more information about our contractual obligations is in note to our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting estimates the accounting estimates described below are those we consider critical in preparing our financial statements 
these policies include significant estimates made by management using information available at the time the estimates are made 
however  as described below  these estimates could change materially if different information or assumptions were used 
investments 
we routinely review our investments that have experienced declines in fair value to determine if the decline is other than temporary 
these reviews are performed with consideration of the facts and circumstances of an issuer in accordance with the securities and exchange commission sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 accounting for non current marketable equity securities  statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  and related guidance 
the identification of distressed investments  and the assessment of whether a decline is other than temporary involve significant management judgment and require evaluation of factors including but not limited to o percentage decline in value and the length of time during which the decline has occurred  o recoverability of principal and interest  o market conditions  o ability to hold the investment to maturity  o a pattern of continuing operating losses of the issuer  o rating agency actions that affect the issuer s credit status  o adverse changes in the issuer s availability of production resources  revenue sources  technological conditions  and adverse changes in the issuer s economic  regulatory or political environment 
reserves 
certain of our insurance policies and reinsurance assumed  including general and pollution liability policies covering environmental remediation  excess and surplus  and workers compensation risks  may be subject to claims brought years after an incident has occurred or the policy period has ended 
we are required to maintain reserves to cover the unpaid portion of our ultimate liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses with respect to i reported claims and ii incurred but not reported claims 
a full actuarial analysis is performed to provide this estimate of all unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense obligations of the company under the terms of its contracts and agreements 
in evaluating whether the reserves make a reasonable provision for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense  it is necessary to project future loss and loss adjustment expense payments 
it is certain that the actual future losses and loss adjustment expenses will not develop exactly as projected and may  in fact  vary significantly from the projections 
with respect to reported claims  reserves are established on a case by case basis 
the reserve amounts on each reported claim are determined by taking into account the circumstances surrounding each claim and policy provisions relating to the type of loss 
loss reserves are reviewed on a regular basis  and as new information becomes available  appropriate adjustments are made to reserves 
in establishing reserves  several methods are employed in determining ultimate losses the expected loss ratio method  the bornhuetter ferguson method based on expected loss ratios  paid losses and reported losses  and the loss development method based on paid and reported losses 
the first method uses industry expected losses adjusted for our experience while the last method relies on industry payment and reporting patterns to develop our actual losses 
the bornhuetter ferguson method is a combination of the other two methods  using expected loss ratios to produce expected losses  then applying loss payment and reporting patterns to the expected losses to produce the expected ibnr 
we review the ultimate projections from all three methods and  based on the merits of each method  determine our estimated ultimate losses 
however  the establishment of appropriate loss reserves is an inherently uncertain process  and there can be no assurance that such ultimate payments will not materially exceed our reserves 
deferred income taxes 
we are required to establish a valuation allowance for the portion of any deferred tax asset  that we believe will not be realized 
the majority of our deferred tax assets associated with the harbour village project should be realized within the next two years  given current estimates of completion for the project 
the majority of our deferred tax assets associated with our premium writings should be realized within a month period  the standard policy term of our writings 
given the historical loss position of american safety rrg  it has established a valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets 
except for the deferred tax assets associated with american safety rrg described above  we believe it is more likely than not that we will realize the full benefit of our deferred tax assets described herein  therefore no additional valuation allowance has been established 
construction accounting 
we recognize revenue on harbour village when title to each condominium unit and boat slip transfers to the purchaser 
when title transfers  we recognize revenue using a percentage of completion method based on actual costs to total estimated costs including allocated common costs 
the estimated future common costs of amenities at december  were million  of which  related to condominium units that were closed in as the percentage of completion method is based upon future estimated costs and actual costs may vary greatly from those total cost estimates  adjustments could be recorded in future periods 
impairment of notes receivable 
impairment is measured based upon analysis of the present value of expected future payments and or the fair value of the underlying collateral 
for our notes receivable  the determination of the present value of expected future payments is currently dependent on the underlying collateral s value 
the determination of the fair value of the underlying collateral is a highly subjective process based on the availability of such things as comparable sales in the market  reliable data on cash flow generated by the collateral and the sufficiency of other information needed for the applicable valuation techniques being applied 
all these factors can change significantly based on the economy and other market conditions 
as a result  there can be no assurance that impairment recognized in any period will be sufficient or excessive in relation to the ultimate realizable value of the notes receivable 
income taxes we are incorporated under the laws of bermuda and  under current bermuda law  are not obligated to pay any taxes in bermuda based upon income or capital gains 
we have received an undertaking from the minister of finance in bermuda pursuant to the provisions of the exempted undertakings tax protection act  which exempts us and our shareholders  other than shareholders ordinarily resident in bermuda  from any bermuda taxes computed on profits  income or any capital asset  gain or appreciation  or any tax in the nature of estate  duty or inheritance until march  exclusive of our us subsidiaries  we do not consider ourselves to be engaged in a trade or business in the us and accordingly do not expect to be subject to direct united states income taxation 
our us subsidiaries are subject to taxation in the us impact of inflation property and casualty insurance premiums are established before the amounts of losses and loss adjustment expenses are known and therefore before the extent by which inflation may affect such expenses is known 
consequently  we attempt  in establishing our premiums  to anticipate the potential impact of inflation 
however  for competitive and regulatory reasons  we may be limited in raising premiums consistent with anticipated inflation  in which event we  rather than our insureds  would absorb inflation costs 
inflation also affects the rate of investment return on our investment portfolio with a corresponding effect on our investment income 
combined ratio the combined ratio of an insurance company measures only the underwriting results of insurance operations and not the profitability of the overall company 
our reported combined ratio for our insurance operations may not provide an accurate indication of our overall profitability 
for instance  depending on our mix of business  the combined ratio may fluctuate from time to time and may not reflect the overall profitability of our insurance operations

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of economic losses due to adverse changes in the estimated fair value of a financial instrument as the result of changes in equity prices  interest rates  foreign exchange rates and commodity prices 
our consolidated balance sheets include assets whose estimated fair values are subject to market risk 
the primary market risks to us are interest rate and credit risk associated with our investments in fixed maturity securities 
we have no direct commodity or foreign exchange risk as of december  the estimated fair value of our investment portfolio at december  was million  of which was invested in fixed maturities and short term investments  was invested in real estate and in equities 
interest rate risk 
our fixed maturity holdings are invested predominantly in high quality corporate  government and municipal bonds with relatively short durations 
the fixed maturity portfolio is exposed to interest rate fluctuations  as interest rates rise  their fair values decline and as interest rates fall  their fair values rise 
the changes in the fair market value of the fixed maturity portfolio are presented as a component of shareholders equity in accumulated other comprehensive income  net of taxes 
we work to manage the impact of interest rate fluctuations on our fixed maturity portfolio 
the effective duration of the fixed maturity portfolio is managed with consideration given to the estimated payout timing of our liabilities 
we have investment policies which limit the maximum duration and maturity of individual securities within the portfolio and set target levels for average duration and maturity of the entire portfolio 
the table below summarizes our interest rate risk and shows the effect of hypothetical changes in interest rates as of december  the selected hypothetical changes do not indicate what would be the potential best or worst case scenarios dollars in thousands esti mated fair estimated fair hypothetical va lue after hypothetical value at change in interest hyp othetical percentage increase december  rate change in interest decrease in bp basis points rate shareholders equity total fixed maturity  bp decrease investments including bp decrease short term investments bp increase bp increase interest rate risk related to our loans payable to american safety capital trust and american safety capital trust ii  our non consolidated wholly owned subsidiaries  is managed through the use of interest rate swaps 
we have utilized these derivative instruments to effectively hedge our exposure to interest rate fluctuations for the first five years of the debt obligations 
credit risk 
we invest primarily in the debt securities markets  which exposes us to credit risk 
credit risk is a consequence of extending credit and or carrying investment positions 
we require that all securities be rated investment grade at the time of purchase 
we use specific criteria to judge the credit quality and liquidity of our investments and use a variety of credit rating services to monitor these criteria
