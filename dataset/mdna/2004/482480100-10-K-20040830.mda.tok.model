industry general background the semiconductor fabrication process begins with a bare silicon wafer a round disk that is six  eight or twelve inches in diameter  about as thick as a credit card and gray in color 
the process of manufacturing wafers is in itself highly sophisticated  involving the creation of large ingots of silicon by pulling them out of a vat of molten silicon 
the ingots are then sliced into wafers and polished to a mirror finish on the side where the circuits are made 
the manufacturing cycle of integrated circuits is grouped into three phases design  fabrication and testing 
ic design involves the architectural layout of the circuit  as well as design verification and photomask or reticle generation 
the fabrication of an ic  or chip  is accomplished by depositing a series of film layers that act as conductors  semiconductors or insulators 
the deposition of these film layers is interspersed with numerous other process steps that create circuit patterns  remove portions of the film layers  and perform other functions such as heat treatment  measurement and inspection 
most advanced chip designs require over individual steps  many of which are performed multiple times 
most chips consist of two main structures the lower structure  typically consisting of transistors or capacitors  which perform the smart functions of the chip  and the upper structure  typically consisting of interconnect circuitry  which connects the components in the lower structure 
when all of the layers on the wafer have been completed  each die on the wafer is then tested for functionality 
the wafer is placed on a prober that is used to attach the input output pins of the device to a tester 
when chips are tested on the wafer  it is called sort test 
sort test determines which chips are good 
the wafer is then cut up and the good die are bonded to lead frames that contain pins used to attach the chip to the outside printed circuit board 
wires are bonded from the input output pads of the ic to the pins of the lead frame 
then the lead frame is encapsulated in packages typically made of plastic or ceramic materials 
the packaged part are put through a final test and then shipped to customers 
this entire packaging and testing process is called the back end 
current trends companies that anticipate future market demands by developing and refining new technologies and manufacturing processes  as well as production  are better positioned to lead in the semiconductor market 
during past industry cycles  semiconductor manufacturers generally contended with one key new technology or market trend  such as a specific design rule shrink 
in today s market  the leading semiconductor manufacturers are investing in bringing a multitude of new technologies into production at the same time  including copper interconnects  new materials  sub micron design rules and mm wafers the next larger wafer size  from which more than twice as many ics can be produced as from mm wafers 
while many of these technologies have been adopted at the development and pilot production stages  significant challenges and risks associated with each technology have slowed their adoption into full volume production 
for example  as design rules decrease  yields become more sensitive to the size and density of defects  while device performance characteristics namely speed or capacity become more sensitive to such parameters as linewidth and film thickness variation 
copper introduces new physical defects  which are harder to find within the interconnect structure  as well as electrical defects  which cannot be detected using conventional optical inspection systems 
new process materials like low k dielectrics  silicon on insulator soi and nm photoresists require extensive characterization before they can be made manufacturable 
larger mm wafers are more susceptible to damage than mm wafers  since they can bend or bow twice as much  creating stress on the wafer that can result in yield loss 
film uniformity is also more difficult to maintain on these larger wafers 
moving several of these advanced technologies into production at once only adds to the risks that chipmakers face  since technical challenges in bringing any one of these into production could also slow the adoption of the other technologies 
our key activities during fiscal year involved the development of new process control and yield management tools that enable chipmakers to accelerate the adoption of these new technologies into full volume production  while minimizing their associated risks 
with our portfolio of application focused technologies and our dedicated yield technology expertise  we are in a position to be the single source for comprehensive yield management solutions that enable our customers to achieve first to market success for their next generation products 
the continuing evolution of semiconductor devices to smaller linewidth geometries and more complex multi level circuitry has significantly increased the cost and performance requirements of the capital equipment used to manufacture these devices 
construction of an advanced wafer fabrication facility today can cost over billion  a substantial increase over the cost of previous generation facilities 
as a result  chipmakers are demanding increased productivity and higher returns from their manufacturing equipment 
our process control and yield management equipment enables our customers to better leverage these increasingly expensive facilities and significantly improve their return on investment roi helping them to become low cost producers 
our process control and yield acceleration solutions accelerating the yield ramp and maximizing the production yields of high performance devices are key goals of modern semiconductor manufacturing 
achieving higher yields faster  along with higher performance characteristics  increases the revenue a manufacturer can obtain from each semiconductor wafer 
our systems are used to analyze product and process quality at critical points in the wafer  photomask and ic manufacturing process  and provide feedback to our customers so that fabrication problems can be identified  addressed and eliminated 
this ability to locate the source of defects and other process issues  as well as contain them  enables our customers to improve control over their manufacturing processes  as well as increase their yields and device value thus maximizing their roi and lowering their manufacturing costs 
the following are some of the methods used to accelerate yields and optimize device performance  all of which require the capture and analysis of data gathered through many measurements engineering analysis this method of analysis is performed offline from the manufacturing process to identify  analyze and locate the source of defects or other manufacturing process issues 
engineering analysis equipment operates with very high sensitivity to enable comprehensive analysis of wafers 
because this method operates off the manufacturing line  high operational speeds are not required 
inline monitoring this method of analysis is used to review the status of ics during production 
information generated is used to determine whether the fabrication process steps are within required tolerances 
it is also used to make any necessary real time process adjustments before wafer lots move to subsequent process stations 
because information related to defects is needed quickly  inline monitoring requires both high throughput and high sensitivity 
pass fail tests this method of analysis may be used at several different points in the manufacturing process to evaluate whether products meet performance specifications 
the most significant opportunities for yield and device performance improvement generally occur either when production is started at new factories or technology shifts in existing factories 
equipment that helps a manufacturer quickly increase new product yields and optimize device performance enables the manufacturer to offer these new products in high volumes early in the product lifecycle the time when they are likely to generate the greatest profits 
products we operate in one operating segment for the design  manufacture and marketing of process control and yield management systems for the semiconductor and related microelectronics industry 
we market and sell our hardware consisting of patterned and unpatterned wafer inspection  optical overlay metrology  e beam review  reticle and photomask inspection  spectroscopic and e beam based cd metrology  and film and surface measurement tools as well as our advanced yield analysis and defect classification software to provide fab wide yield management solutions that are optimized for the manufacturing process cells used in ic production  including lithography  etch  deposition and chemical mechanical planarization cmp 
our offerings can be broadly categorized into four groups defect inspection  metrology  customer service and support  yield management software solutions and data storage 
in addition we provide to our customers manufacturing with older technologies  refurbished kla tencor certified tools along with warranty and support 
defect inspection our defect inspection tools are used to detect  count  classify and characterize particles  pattern defects  surface anomalies and electrical failures both inline at various manufacturing process stages and offline during engineering analysis 
our portfolio includes the tools necessary for our customers to detect  correlate and analyze physical and electrical defects  as well as determine and correct their cause 
high resolution imaging inspection our xxx wafer inspection series  first introduced in  set the standard for high sensitivity patterned wafer inspection through a unique combination of high speed image processing  an ultra broadband brightfield illumination source and our segmented auto threshold technology 
earlier this year  we introduced our latest generation high resolution imaging inspection system  the  which incorporates multiple bandwidth brightfield illumination and other enhancements to extend the performance of the xxx series to the nm node and below 
high speed laser scattering inspection our advanced inspection technology ait wafer inspection family is designed to provide fast and accurate feedback on process tool performance  as well as advanced line monitoring for films  cmp  and non critical etch and photo modules 
the ait series uses double darkfield technology  which is a low angle illumination technique particularly effective for detecting defects on planar surfaces such as post cmp wafers 
first introduced in  the ait platform has been continually enhanced over the years with increasing levels of sensitivity and throughput to address the inspection needs for sub nm design rules 
earlier this fiscal year  we unveiled the aitfusion xuv  our latest generation double darkfield ultraviolet uv optical inspection tool designed to meet the stringent demands associated with nm device geometries and their associated materials 
the tool is especially effective in inspecting cmp layers  copper low k interconnects  and multi layer film stacks 
electrical line monitoring for advanced ic manufacturing  e beam inspection is essential not only during ic development  where the highest levels of sensitivity are needed to root out electrical defects  but also in production  where dedicated high speed e beam inspection systems are required at key process steps 
our loop microloop methodology  introduced in  provides a fab wide framework of solutions that accelerates yield learning for new semiconductor processes in development and production 
edo  the first product in the loop family  combines non contact electrical test with inline physical defect inspection to produce a fast root cause analysis 
in  we introduced the latest addition to our esxx series of e beam inspection systems  called es the successor to our widely adopted esxp tool  the es delivers better throughput  sensitivity and image resolution capability than its predecessor  while allowing users to classify defects in real time and trend by defect type 
the es provides the sensitivity needed for advanced process development down to the nm node 
e beam defect review in  we introduced the ev defect review system an advanced  automated scanning electron microscope sem designed to gather and analyze defect excursion information  as well as report the results with the improved sensitivity required at nm and smaller design rules 
the ev provides topographical information to enable accurate defect classification 
wafer surface inspection the wafer substrate is the foundation of an ic 
having a defect free wafer substrate is essential  since defects on the surface of the wafer can adversely affect subsequent semiconductor processes and ultimately impact ic performance 
in the ic fab  wafer surface inspection is often used to qualify new process tools quickly in order to begin making product wafers as soon as possible 
wafer surface inspection is also critical for monitoring the defect performance of fab equipment during production to ensure they remain within specification 
in  we introduced the surfscan sp series  which is today considered the de facto standard for bare wafer qualification  process monitoring and equipment monitoring applications 
the latest member of the surfscan sp family  the surfscan sp dls  was the first mm tool to provide brightfield  darkfield and surface roughness information in a single scan 
it has the sensitivity to capture a wide variety of defects as small as nm at high throughput speeds 
this past fiscal year  we also unveiled our next generation surfscan platform  the surfscan sp  incorporates a proprietary new uv illumination technology  which significantly enhances inspection sensitivity and speed 
the system is capable of detecting defects as small as nm  and is able to provide defect detection on engineered substrates  such as soi  strained silicon  and strained soi 
wafer backside defects can have a significant impact on wafer and process uniformity  both of which are critical issues in advanced mm processing 
in  we unveiled a new backside inspection module bsim option for the surfscan sp series that provides an automated  non destructive inspection solution for the backsides of patterned production wafers 
macro after develop inspection macro defects  which can ruin the entire wafer  are costly to chipmakers in mm production  since more than twice the number of die are at risk with these larger wafers compared to mm wafers 
with the introduction of the macro defect inspection system in we enabled our customers to automate after develop inspection adi for macro defects 
designed to replace inefficient manual macro adi  the is an automated inspection system able to detect and classify front end macro lithographic defects  which are microns and larger in size 
in  we introduced the macro adi series  which brought the benefits of the to mm production 
photo cell monitoring the introduction of thinner photoresists  new resist chemistries  tighter process windows and smaller design rules have all given rise to new and smaller defect types within the lithography cell a large area of investment within the fab 
defect management in the lithography cell is thus critical for qualifying new lithography processes and establishing a benchmark for controlling defects and minimizing yield losses during production 
in  we introduced our pcm micro photo cell monitor solution to provide fabs with a methodology for identifying and eliminating lithography related micro defects before product lots are placed at risk 
combining our most advanced defect management hardware and software tools  a new proprietary reticle design  optimized test wafers and industry leading expertise  pcm provides the high sensitivity and capture rate required for reducing lithography related micro defects 
it monitors the health of the lithography cell and enables chipmakers to make rapid and accurate go no go decisions about their product reticles  track systems and exposure tools 
reticle inspection error free reticles are the first step in ensuring high yields in the manufacturing process  since defects in reticles can be replicated on wafers 
reticles are high precision quartz plates that contain microscopic images of electronic circuits 
placed into steppers or scanners  these reticles are used to transfer circuit patterns onto wafers to fabricate ics 
the extension of optical lithography below the nm node has resulted in the mask error enhancement factor  where reticle defects once too small to print on the wafer become enhanced in the lithography process to create yield killing wafer defects 
in  we unveiled our terastar reticle inspection system for high resolution reticle inspection down to the nm node 
with its ability to inspect up to a terapixel one million by one million pixels per reticle  terastar provides significant improvements in throughput compared to previous generation systems 
tera algorithms enable the inspection of smaller linewidth geometries and complex resolution enhancement techniques  such as optical proximity correction opc assist features and phase shift masks psms 
its high throughput and sensitivity make terastar ideal for pre and post pelliclization inspection in photomask manufacturing operations  as well as incoming quality control and reticle re qualification in wafer fabs 
reticle cd errors are a major cause of yield loss in ic manufacturing at the nm node and below 
in  we introduced a new option on terastar  called teraflux  which detects minute but relevant cd errors on contact and via layer reticles prior to their first use in the wafer fab 
teraflux measures the energy that passes through the contact hole and compares it to another reference either die or database to look for unexpected energy variations 
this enables the terastar system to capture reticle cd defects  such as incorrectly sized contacts or semi transparencies both of which will adversely affect the amount of light passing through the contact holes during the lithography process 
by capturing these critical defects during reticle inspection and qualification  teraflux enables chipmakers to ramp their deep sub wavelength lithography processes into production  while minimizing the costs associated with scrapped wafers 
in  we introduced terascan  the successor to terastar 
a duv reticle inspection tool developed for sub nm ic production  terascan offers high sensitivity to detect classical defects intrusions  extrusions and point defects as small as nm  and cd defects as small as nm 
terascan has the ability to inspect nearly any type of photomask used in ic production  regardless of reticle wavelength and resolution enhancement technology  for sub nm design rules 
metrology our metrology or process window optimization products provide virtually all of the critical measurements fabs require to manage their advanced manufacturing processes 
with our unique combination of overlay  critical dimension  film thickness and reflectivity measurements  ic manufacturers have the capabilities to maintain tight control of their lithography  etch  deposition and cmp processes 
optical overlay decreasing linewidths  larger die sizes and increasing numbers of layers in semiconductor devices all affect the tolerances for layer to layer matching  or overlay  and can result in overlay misregistration errors a crucial cause of yield loss 
metrology systems are needed to measure the alignment between different layers of the semiconductor device to ensure overlay parameters are kept within specification 
in  we unveiled archer  which enables overlay measurements to within nm for sub nm and mm production 
to augment the performance of the archer  we introduced a new software tool in called archer analyzer that conducts fully automated  real time  on tool overlay metrology analysis 
seamlessly integrated with the archer  archer analyzer provides information  such as wafer lot dispositioning and stepper correction data  which helps chipmakers eliminate unnecessary wafer rework and quickly address variations in the performance of their lithography tools to minimize yield loss 
in fiscal year  we introduced archer aim  which leverages a grating style target technology to capture design rule overlay errors and improve the accuracy of stepper corrections 
archer targets are denser than traditional box in box targets  resulting in the collection of more process information for improved correlation to in device overlay performance 
focus exposure control in lithography is a key challenge for cd control at the nm node and below 
unseen lithography focus exposure excursions can result in cd process variations that lead to lower yields  cause unnecessary and costly rework  and reduce scanner productivity 
monitoring focus and exposure variations inline is thus critical to maintaining tight cd control at these advanced design rules 
a new option on our archer overlay metrology platform  called mpx  enables lithographers to detect and control stepper defocus and exposure variations on product wafers non destructively 
leveraging dual tone design targets and analysis software  mpx can simultaneously provide separate exposure and focus measurements on product wafers with a high degree of sensitivity and precision 
this enables mpx to provide fast and accurate feedback on the key parameters needed to maintain tight cd control without requiring periodic offline monitoring of the exposure tool 
e beam cd metrology every nanometer in cd variation in the ic manufacturing process affects device performance  which consequently impacts yield and bottom line profitability 
the ecd  which we introduced in fiscal year  offers the precision and resolution needed to meet the cd metrology performance requirements for the nm node and beyond 
the ecd is based on a new platform  and all of its design aspects have been precision suited for nm node metrology requirements  with extendibility to the nm node 
ecd is well suited for applications involving nm lithography and very high aspect ratio structures 
our pqc pattern quality confirmation software enables the ecd to provide inline  real time monitoring of feature shape integrity during the patterning process enabling the detection of subtle variations in feature shape that can occur at and below the nm node and go undetected by traditional cd sem measurements 
our r reticle cd control system provides precise and high throughput measurements on advanced reticles used in the production of sub nm devices 
spectroscopic cd metrology traditional cd linewidth measurements are no longer sufficient by themselves for providing all the information that chipmakers need to accurately predict yield and transistor performance 
today  complete feature profile information is needed  including cd  sidewall angle  height and depth 
contact hole profile measurements are also critical  since contact hole sizes that are significantly reduced or closed at the bottom of the structure can result in significant yield loss 
this fiscal year  we unveiled spectracd our next generation inline optical cd metrology system for advanced patterning process control at the nm and nm nodes 
spectracd utilizes a new hardware platform and advanced d modeling capabilities to conduct complete profile measurements of yield critical structures with a two fold improvement in precision and tool to tool matching over our previous generation spectracd system 
these capabilities  coupled with spectracd s production throughput and ability to non destructively measure features down to nm  provide chipmakers with an effective inline process control and product dispositioning tool for their most critical patterning steps 
film measurement our film measurement products measure a variety of optical and electrical properties of thin films 
these products are used to control a wide range of wafer fabrication steps  where both within wafer and wafer to wafer process uniformity are of paramount importance to semiconductor manufacturers enabling them to achieve high device performance characteristics at low cost 
in  we unveiled spectrafx  our latest generation thin film metrology system  which delivers the precision  matching and stability required for advanced film measurement applications for nm device production  including nm lithography processes 
designed to fully support next generation and operator free mm fabs with automation and tool to tool matching capabilities  spectrafx enables foundries and other multi product high volume chip manufacturers to reduce the process development time for advanced materials and accelerate their adoption into volume production 
these materials include nm photoresists  complex copper dual damascene film stacks  and low k and high k dielectrics 
accufilm  an advanced option on the spectrafx  eliminates the effects of airborne molecular contamination amc on ultra thin film measurements 
a key roadblock to achieving control of advanced gate processes below the nm node  amc grows rapidly on film surfaces and degrades the accuracy and repeatability of gate dielectric metrology 
accufilm enables spectrafx to remove these contaminants from product wafers in a matter of seconds before taking film measurements at each measurement site without placing product at risk 
this past fiscal year  we introduced metrix  an inline  non contact metal films metrology system to provide independent measurements of both film composition and thickness on product wafers 
metrix can be used for a wide range of applications ranging from process development and characterization of ultra thin atomic layer deposition ald barrier films to routine production monitoring of copper barrier seed and other yield limiting critical layers such as silicon oxynitride sion gate dielectrics 
contamination monitoring gate dielectric quality is critical to the speed and reliability of an ic 
below the nm node  dielectrics become so thin less than angstroms  or the equivalent of nm that electrical performance characteristics of the dielectric films become just as critical as physical characteristics in determining overall transistor performance 
our quantox product line provides non contact  inline electrical performance measurements of key parameters that determine the quality of advanced gate dielectric films  including contamination and oxide thickness  as well as electrical capacitance and leakage 
our latest addition to this product family  called quantox xp  provides information on both the physical and electrical properties of advanced gate dielectric materials 
these materials include sion and high k dielectrics  which are required for sub nm ic production 
quantox xp data provides high correlation to device electrical test data  enabling chipmakers to predict transistor performance inline  rather than having to wait until end of line electrical test a process that normally can take days or weeks to complete 
surface metrology our stylus profilers measure the surface topography of films and etched surfaces  and are used in basic research and development as well as semiconductor production and quality control 
the latest generation of our hrp high resolution profilers  the hrp etch  combines the dishing and erosion measurement capabilities of our long scan profilers with high aspect ratio etched feature measurement capability  which has historically been limited to atomic force microscopes afm 
this allows customers to monitor their critical etch processes  such as shallow trench isolation sti and dual damascene via trench 
we also provide stress measurement systems and capabilities  such as our new wafer bow and wafer stress option for our aset fx and spectrafx thin film metrology tools  which detects reliability related problems such as film cracking  voiding and lifting 
afm has become a necessary technology for measuring trench depths and cmp processes  especially at the nm node and below 
until now  however  traditional afms have lacked the throughput and reliability needed to monitor these processes effectively on the production floor 
our new af lm system  introduced in fiscal year  is the first true line monitoring solution for trench depth and surface planarity process control at the nm and nm nodes yield management software solutions our productivity and analysis software systems translate raw inspection and metrology data into patterns that reveal process problems and help semiconductor manufacturers develop long term yield improvement strategies 
yield data analysis and management in  we acquired taiwan based acme systems  inc  a provider of yield correlation software 
combining the newly acquired technology from acme with our own yield management expertise led to the development of our klarity ace yield analysis software  which helps our customers quickly identify the source of defects and process problems  as well as correct them 
with our acquisition of finle technologies in  we developed our klarity prodata lithography data analysis software  which  along with our prolith lithography and etch simulation software  helps manufacturers reduce their advanced lithography development time and cost 
our impact xp automated defect classification adc software provides consistent and accurate classification of yield limiting defects to help our customers accelerate their ramp to higher process yields 
impact xp incorporates our smartgallery tool  which reduces the setup time associated with adc implementation in fabs 
this is a critical requirement  particularly for foundries and application specific integrated circuit asic manufacturers  who specialize in short runs of multiple products 
our real time classification rtc and inline adc iadc technologies  which provide classification and binning of defect types in real time during inspection  are critical features on all of our latest generation e beam and optical inspection tools 
our recipe management service  called irecipe  allows factory engineers to quickly and easily access existing recipes and associated information that reside on a central database from any personal computer that is connected to the fab intranet 
by integrating irecipe into their fab network  chipmakers can reduce their inspection and metrology tool coo  as well as improve their overall fab efficiency
