item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
as you read the following review of our financial condition and results of operations  you should also read our financial statements and related notes beginning on page executive summary we are one of the world s leading manufacturers of automotive emission control and ride control products and systems 
we completed the separation of our packaging business in a series of transactions during  culminating in the spin off to our shareholders of the common stock of pactiv corporation formerly known as tenneco packaging inc on november  we serve both original equipment vehicle manufacturers and the repair and replacement markets  or aftermarket  globally through leading brands  including monroe r  rancho r  clevite r elastomers and fric rot tm ride control products and walker r  fonos tm  and gillet tm emission control products 
worldwide we serve more than different original equipment manufacturers  and our products or systems are included on six of the top passenger car models produced in north american and western europe and all of the top light truck models produced in north america for during  our aftermarket customers were comprised of full line and specialty warehouse distributors  retailers  jobbers  installer chains and car dealers 
we operate more than manufacturing facilities worldwide and employ more than  people to service our customer s demands 
factors that are critical to our success include managing our overall global manufacturing footprint to ensure proper placement and workforce levels in line with business needs  maintaining competitive wages and benefits  maximizing efficiencies in manufacturing processes  fixing or eliminating unprofitable businesses and reducing overall costs 
in addition  our ability to adapt to key industry trends  such as the consolidation of oe customers  changing aftermarket distribution channels  increasing environmental standards and extended product life of automotive parts  also plays a critical role in our success 
we have a substantial amount of indebtedness  with total debt  net of cash balances  of billion as of december  as such  our ability to generate cash both to fund operations and service our debt is also a significant area of focus for our company 
see liquidity and capital resources below for further discussion of cash flows 
total revenues for were more than billion  a nine percent increase over higher oe volumes in certain areas of our operations and strengthening currencies drove this increase 
gross margin for was percent of revenues compared to percent of revenues for the decline was driven by a lower percentage of revenues generated by the higher margin aftermarket business 
we reported selling  general  administrative and engineering expenses for of percent of revenues  as compared to percent of revenues for higher revenues and improved cost management via tighter discretionary spending and expanding our shared services strategies drove the reduction 
ebit was million for up from the million reported in the increase was driven by stronger operational performances in north america and the rest of the world  which includes south america  australia and asia 
see below for a more detailed discussion of operating performances for the last three years 
years and net sales and operating revenues the following tables reflect our revenues for the years of and we present these reconciliations of revenues in order to reflect the trend in our sales in various product lines and geographic regions separately from the effects of doing business in currencies other than the us dollar 
additionally  pass through catalytic converter sales include precious metals pricing  which may be volatile 
these pass through catalytic converter sales occur when  at the direction of our oe customers  we purchase catalytic converters or components from suppliers  use them in our manufacturing process  and sell them as part of the completed system 
while our original equipment customers assume the risk of this volatility  it impacts our reported revenue 
excluding pass through catalytic converter sales removes this impact 
we have not reflected any currency impact in the table since this is the base period for measuring the effects of currency during on our operations 
we use this information to analyze the trend in our revenues before these factors 
we believe investors find this information useful in understanding period to period comparisons in our revenues

total north american oe revenues were up million at  million in as higher ride control volumes were partially offset by lower emission control volumes 
oe emission control revenues were down million to million from million in the prior year 
adjusted for pass through sales  which declined five percent  and currency  oe emission control sales were down four percent from the prior year 
oe ride control revenues for increased eight percent from the prior year 
total oe revenues  excluding pass through sales and currency  increased one percent in  while north american light vehicle production decreased approximately three percent from one year ago 
we experienced this improvement despite the build rate decline primarily due to our strong position on top selling platforms with general motors  ford  honda and nissan 
aftermarket revenues for north america were million in  representing a decrease of five percent compared to the same period in the prior year 
aftermarket ride control revenues decreased million or three percent in  as a result of a weak economy and lower initial orders related to new customer additions in compared to the prior year 
aftermarket emission control revenues declined nine percent in compared to reflecting the continued overall market decline in the emission control business and the longer lives of exhaust components due to the oe s use of stainless steel  which reduces aftermarket replacement rates 
our european segment s revenues increased million or percent in compared to last year 
total oe revenues were  million  up percent from last year 
oe emission control revenues increased percent to million from million in the prior year 
excluding a million decrease in pass through sales and a million increase due to strengthening currency  oe emission control revenues decreased four percent over this was greater than the change in european production levels  which decreased approximately one percent from one year ago 
our decrease was greater than the market decline as a result of several older psa  volkswagen and peugeot models where lower volumes are not yet being offset by the launch or ramp up of the replacement models 
oe ride control revenues increased to million in or up percent from million a year ago 
excluding a million benefit from currency appreciation  oe ride control revenues increased percent 
we experienced this revenue increase despite the decline in the european build rate due to stronger sales on new platforms with volkswagen and ford 
european aftermarket sales were million in compared to million last year 
excluding million attributable to currency appreciation  european aftermarket revenues declined eight percent in compared to last year 
ride control aftermarket revenues  excluding the impact of currency  were down one percent compared to the prior year  reflecting the continued overall weakness in the european aftermarket  partially offset by the continued positive impact of the monroe reflex r introduction in the second quarter of last year 
additionally  aftermarket emission control revenues were lower as a result of the now standard use of longer lasting stainless steel by oe manufacturers 
excluding the impact of currency  european aftermarket emission control revenues declined percent from the prior year 
revenues from our other operations  which include south america  australia and asia  increased million to million in as compared to million in the prior year 
higher volumes and increased pass through sales drove increased revenues of million at our asian operations 
in australia  stronger oe volumes and strengthening currency increased revenues by percent 
excluding the impact of currency  australian revenues increased eight percent

earnings before interest expense  income taxes  and minority interest ebit years ended december  change millions north america europe other the ebit results shown in the preceding table include the following items  discussed below under restructuring and other charges and liquidity and capital resources capitalization  which have an effect on the comparability of ebit results between periods years ended december  millions north america restructuring related expenses restructuring charges reversals amendment of senior credit facility europe restructuring related expenses restructuring charges reversals amendment of senior credit facility gain on sale of york  uk uk other restructuring charges reversals ebit for north american operations increased to million in from million one year ago 
higher volumes in our oe ride control segment increased ebit by million  and oe manufacturing efficiencies added million to ebit in compared to the prior year 
the north american aftermarket volume decreases in both product lines and related manufacturing inefficiencies reduced ebit by million  but were partially offset by million in lower selling  general and administrative costs including lower year over year changeover expenses 
north american ebit was also reduced by million as a result of our inventory reduction programs 
this ebit decrease was the result of inventory absorption costs fixed manufacturing costs that the company continued to incur in spite of the lower production levels necessary to drive inventory down 
because of the lower production levels  a greater portion of fixed manufacturing costs were recognized in the income statement rather than allocated to inventory balances 
included in north america s ebit was million in restructuring and restructuring related expenses 
included in s ebit were million in restructuring related expenses and million related to amending the senior credit facility 
our european segment s ebit was million for  down million from million in however  included in s ebit was an million gain on the sale of our york  uk facility and million related to amending the senior credit facility 
included in s ebit were million of restructuring related expenses 
higher oe volumes primarily in ride control contributed million to ebit 
also contributing to ebit were manufacturing efficiencies of million primarily in oe emission control and currency appreciation of million 
additionally  benefits we are realizing from project genesis  which is described further in restructuring and other charges in this management s discussion and analysis  added to ebit 
these increases were partially offset by lower aftermarket volumes that reduced ebit by million 
in addition  as a result of our inventory reduction programs  ebit was reduced by million due to higher absorption costs 
also reducing ebit were higher selling general and administrative costs 
ebit for our other operations increased million to million in compared to million one year ago 
higher oe revenues in all regions drove this improvement 
additionally  favorable currency exchange rates in australia increased ebit by million 
included in s ebit was a favorable adjustment in the reserve for our costs to complete project genesis  which increased ebit by million 
ebit as a percentage of revenue years ended december  north america europe other total tenneco automotive in north america  ebit as a percentage of revenue for remained flat to the prior year 
higher oe ride control volumes and manufacturing efficiencies were offset by lower aftermarket volumes and related manufacturing inefficiencies 
in europe  ebit margins for also remained flat compared to the prior year 
oe volume increases  manufacturing efficiencies  restructuring savings and currency appreciation were offset by the impact of a gain on a facility sale in the prior year  lower aftermarket volumes  and higher absorption costs 
ebit as a percentage of revenue for our other operations increased one percent from the prior year 
higher oe volumes in all regions and currency appreciation in australia drove the increase 
restructuring and other charges over the past several years we have adopted plans to restructure portions of our operations 
these plans were approved by the board of directors and were designed to reduce operational and administrative overhead costs throughout the business 
prior to the change in accounting required for exit or disposal activities described under changes in accounting principles below  we recorded charges to income related to these plans for costs that do not benefit future activities in the period in which the plans were finalized and approved  while actions necessary to affect these restructuring plans occurred over future periods in accordance with established plans 
in the fourth quarter of  our board of directors approved a restructuring plan  a project known as project genesis  designed to lower our fixed costs  improve efficiency and utilization  and better optimize our global footprint 
project genesis involved closing eight facilities  improving the process flow and efficiency through value mapping and plant arrangement at facilities  relocating production among facilities  and centralizing some functional areas 
the closed facilities include an emission control aftermarket plant and an aftermarket distribution operation in europe  a ride control plant in europe  an engineering center in europe  one building at an emission control plant complex in north america  a technology facility in north america  an exhaust manufacturing facility in north america  and our london based treasury office 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded pre tax charges related to project genesis of million 
within the statement of income loss  million of the pre tax charge was reflected in cost of sales  while million was included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
these charges were comprised of million in severance and million for equipment lease cancellation  asset impairment and other restructuring costs to close the eight facilities 
we wrote down the assets at locations to be closed to their estimated fair value  less costs to sell 
we estimated the market value of buildings using external real estate appraisals 
as a result of the single purpose nature of the machinery and equipment to be disposed of  fair value was estimated to be scrap value less costs to dispose in most cases 
we also recorded a pre tax charge of million in cost of sales related to a strategic decision to adjust some product offerings and our customer supply strategy in the european aftermarket 
the aftermarket parts were written down to their estimated scrap value  less costs to sell 
finally  we also incurred million in other restructuring related costs during the fourth quarter for the value mapping and rearrangement of one of our emission control plants in north america 
since these costs relate to ongoing operations  they could not be accrued as part of the restructuring charge 
the total of all these restructuring and other costs recorded in the fourth quarter of was million before tax  million after tax  or per diluted common share 
as of december   we have eliminated positions in connection with project genesis 
additionally  we are executing this plan more efficiently than originally anticipated and as a result in the fourth quarter of reduced our reserves related to this restructuring activity by million which was recorded in cost of sales 
in the fourth quarter of we reclassified million of severance reserve to the asset impairment reserve 
this reclassification became necessary as actual asset impairments along with the sale of our closed facilities were different than the original estimates 
we expect to complete all remaining restructuring activities related to project genesis in the second quarter of we incurred other costs in of million for moving and rearrangement activities related to our restructuring actions initiated in prior periods that could not be accrued as part of the restructuring charges for those actions 
including the costs incurred in of million  we have incurred a total of million for moving and rearrangement activities related to our restructuring actions initiated in prior periods that could not be accrued as part of the restructuring charges for these actions 
in the first quarter of  we incurred severance costs of million associated with eliminating salaried positions through selective layoffs and an early retirement program 
additionally  hourly positions were eliminated through selective layoffs in the quarter 
these reductions were done to reduce ongoing labor costs in north america 
this charge was primarily recorded in cost of sales 
to date we have generated about million of savings from project genesis 
about million of savings was related to closing the eight facilities  about million of savings was related to value mapping and plant arrangement and about million of savings was related to relocating production among facilities and centralizing some functional areas 
to date  there have been no significant deviations from planned savings 
when complete  we expect that the series of restructuring actions initiated in the fourth quarter of will generate annualized savings of million 
about million of the expected savings should be generated by closing the eight facilities  about million of the expected savings should be generated by improving process flow and efficiency through value mapping and plant arrangement and about million of the expected savings will be generated by relocating production among facilities and centralizing some functional areas 
amounts related to the reserves we have established regarding activities that are part of our restructuring plans are as follows december  charged to impact of december  restructuring restructuring cash asset exchange restructuring reserve charge payments accounts rates adjustments reserve millions severance asset impairment other under the terms of our amended and restated senior credit agreement that took effect on december   we are allowed to exclude up to million of cash charges and expenses  before taxes  related to potential future cost reduction initiatives over the period from the calculation of the financial covenant ratios we are required to maintain under our senior credit agreement 
as of december   we have excluded million of the million available under the terms of the senior credit facility 
in addition to the announced actions  we continue to evaluate additional opportunities to initiate actions that will reduce our costs through implementing the most appropriate and efficient logistics  distribution and manufacturing footprint for the future 
there can be no assurances  however  that we will undertake additional restructuring actions 
actions that we take  if any  will require the approval of our board of directors  or its authorized committee  and if the costs of the plans exceed the amount previously approved by our senior lenders  could require approval by our senior lenders 
we plan to conduct any workforce reductions that result in compliance with all legal and contractual requirements including obligations to consult with workers councils  union representatives and others 
in october of we announced the closure of an emission control manufacturing facility in birmingham  uk approximately employees will be eligible for severance benefits in accordance with union contracts and uk legal requirements 
charges related to this closing are not expected to exceed million and will be recorded in the first half of this action is in addition to the plant closures announced in project genesis in the fourth quarter of interest expense  net of interest capitalized we reported interest expense of million in compared to million in the current year s interest expense includes million for the write off of senior debt issuance costs that were deferred on the senior debt that we partially paid with the proceeds of our million bond offering in june of and fully refinanced in december of additionally  we incurred approximately million in higher interest costs related to the bond offering and senior debt refinancing 
offsetting this increase was lower interest rates on our variable rate debt and the termination of our three year floating to fixed interest rate swap agreement that expired on february  see more detailed explanations on our debt structure  including the million bond offering in june  the million bond offering in december and the senior debt refinancing in december and their anticipated impact on our interest expense  in liquidity and capital resources capitalization later in this management s discussion and analysis 
income taxes income taxes were a benefit of million in  compared to a benefit of million in included in were benefits of million  including book to return adjustments  settlements of prior year tax issues on a more favorable basis than originally anticipated and a foreign tax adjustment 
the effective tax rate for including the million benefit was a negative percent

in total  these items improved earnings per diluted common share by 
you should also read note to the consolidated financial statements included in item for more detailed information on earnings per share 
critical accounting policies we prepare our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
preparing our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the following paragraphs include a discussion of some critical areas where estimates are required 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue for sales to our oe and aftermarket customers under the terms of our arrangements with those customers  generally at the time of shipment from our plants or distribution centers 
for our aftermarket customers  we provide for promotional incentives and returns at the time of sale 
estimates are based upon the terms of the incentives and historical experience with returns 
where we have offered product warranty  we also provide for warranty costs 
those estimates are based upon historical experience and upon specific warranty issues as they arise 
while we have not experienced any material differences between these estimates and our actual costs  it is reasonably possible that future warranty issues could arise that could have a significant impact on our financial statements 
long term receivables we expense pre production design and development costs incurred for our original equipment customers unless we have a contractual guarantee for reimbursement of those costs from the customer 
at december   we had million recorded as a long term receivable from oe customers for guaranteed pre production design and development arrangements 
while we believe that the vehicle programs behind these arrangements will enter production  these arrangements allow us to recover our pre production design and development costs in the event that the programs are cancelled or do not reach expected production levels 
we have not experienced any material losses on arrangements where we have a contractual guarantee of reimbursement from our customers 
income taxes we have a us federal tax nol carryforward at december   of million  which will expire in varying amounts from to the federal tax effect of that nol is million  and is recorded as an asset on our balance sheet at december  we estimate  based on available evidence  that it is more likely than not that we will utilize the nol within the prescribed carryforward period 
that estimate is based upon our expectations regarding future taxable income of our us operations and upon strategies available to accelerate usage of the nol 
circumstances that could change that estimate include future us earnings at lower than expected levels or a majority ownership change as defined in the rules of the us tax law 
if that estimate changed  we would be required to cease recognizing an income tax benefit for any new nol and could be required to record a reserve for some or all of the asset currently recorded on our balance sheet 
as of december   we believe that there has been a significant change in our ownership  but not a majority change  in the last three years 
stock based compensation we utilize the intrinsic value method to account for our stock based compensation plans in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
if our compensation costs for our stock based compensation plans were determined using the fair value method of accounting as provided in sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  we estimate that our pro forma net income and earnings per share for the full year would be lower by million or per diluted share 
goodwill and other intangible assets we utilize an impairment only approach to value our purchased goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
each year in the fourth quarter  we perform an impairment analysis on the balance of goodwill 
inherent in this calculation is the use of estimates as the fair value of our designated reporting units is based upon the present value of our expected future cash flows 
in addition  our calculation includes our best estimate of our weighted average cost of capital and growth rate 
if the calculation results in a fair value of goodwill which is less than the book value of goodwill  an impairment charge would be recorded in the operating results of the impaired reporting unit 
pension and other postretirement benefits we have various defined benefit pension plans that cover substantially all of our employees 
we also have postretirement health care and life insurance plans that cover a majority of our domestic employees 
our pension and postretirement health care and life insurance expenses and valuations are dependent on management s assumptions used by our actuaries in calculating such amounts 
these assumptions include discount rates  health care cost trend rates  long term return on plan assets  retirement rates  mortality rates and other factors 
health care cost trend rate assumptions are developed based on historical cost data and an assessment of likely long term trends 
retirement and mortality rates are based primarily on actual plan experience 
our approach to establishing the discount rate assumption starts with the moody s aa corporate bond index adjusted for an incremental yield based on actual historical performance 
this incremental yield adjustment is the result of selecting securities whose yields are higher than the normal bonds that comprise the index 
based on this approach  at september  we lowered the discount rate for pension plans to percent from percent at september  the discount rate for postretirement benefits was lowered from percent at september  to percent at september  our approach to determining expected return on plan asset assumptions evaluates both historical returns as well as estimates of future returns  and is adjusted for any expected changes in the long term outlook for the equity and fixed income markets 
as a result  we revised our estimate of the long term rate of return on plan assets for our pension plans to percent for and  and percent for see note to the financial statements for more information regarding costs and assumptions for employee retirement benefits 
changes in accounting principles in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june  sfas no 
changed the accounting for purchased goodwill from an amortization method to an impairment only approach 
therefore amortization of all purchased goodwill  including amortization of goodwill recorded in past business combinations  ceased upon adoption of sfas no 
in january under the provisions of sfas no 
 we were required to perform an impairment analysis on the balance of goodwill at january  the fair value of our reporting units used in determining the goodwill impairment was computed using the present value of expected future cash flows 
as a result of this analysis  we determined that goodwill associated with our north american original equipment ride control and european aftermarket operations was impaired 
as a result  a charge of million  net of taxes of million  was recorded in the first quarter of as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
the balance of unamortized goodwill was million at december  we are required to test this balance for impairment on an annual basis 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
the associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset 
sfas no 
was effective for fiscal years beginning after june  the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
changed the definition of the date at which a liability exists for exit or disposal activities also referred to as restructuring activities 
previously  we recognized a liability for restructuring activities when we committed to a plan of restructuring and announced this plan to the employees 
we are required to apply the new standard prospectively to new exit or disposal activities initiated after december  sfas no 
generally requires that these costs be recognized at a later date and over time  rather than in a single charge 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin  which expanded previously issued accounting guidance and disclosure requirements for certain guarantees 
fin provides that issuing a guarantee imposes a non contingent obligation to stand ready to perform in the event that the conditions specified in the guarantee occur  and that a liability representing the fair value of such a guarantee must be recognized when the guarantee is issued 
we are required to apply these initial recognition and measurement provisions to guarantees issued or modified after december  the adoption of fin has not had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
you should also read note to the financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  an amendment of fasb statement no 
 which provided alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and amended the disclosure requirements to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
see note to our financial statements for this information 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin  which was revised in december fin requires that the assets  liabilities and results of the activity of variable interest entities be consolidated into the financial statements of the entity that has the controlling financial interest 
fin also provides the framework for determining whether a variable interest entity should be consolidated based on voting interest or significant financial support provided to it 
this interpretation as revised is effective january  we do not believe the adoption of fin will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
amended and clarified financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities under sfas no 
sfas no 
is effective for contracts entered into or modified after june  the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas no 
established standards for classification of certain financial instruments that have characteristics of both liabilities and equity but have been presented entirely as equity or between the liabilities and equity section of the statement of financial position 
sfas no 
is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may  the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on our financial position 
in december  the fasb revised sfas no 
 employer s disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits 
the revised sfas no 
changes employers disclosures about pension plans and other postretirement benefits and requires additional disclosures about assets  obligations  cash flows and net periodic benefit cost 
the revised statement is effective for annual and interim periods ended after december  we adopted the revised sfas no 
as of december   resulting in additional disclosures in our consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp no 
 accounting disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug  improvement  and modernization act of fsp no 
permits a sponsor to make a one time election to defer accounting for the effects of the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of the act 
the act  signed into law in december  establishes a prescription drug benefit under medicare medicare part d and a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to medicare part d 
fsp no 
does not provide specific guidance as to whether a sponsor should recognize the effects of the act in its financial statements 
the act introduces two new features to medicare that must be considered when measuring accumulated postretirement benefit costs 
the new features include a subsidy to the plan sponsors that is based on percent of an individual beneficiary s annual prescription drug costs between and  and an opportunity for a retiree to obtain a prescription drug benefit under medicare 
we have elected to defer the adoption of fsp no 
due to lack of specific guidance 
therefore  the net postretirement benefit costs disclosed in the consolidated financial statements do not reflect the impact of the act on the plans 
our deferral will continue until specific authoritative accounting guidance for the federal subsidy is issued 
authoritative guidance on the accounting for the federal subsidy is pending and  when issued  could require information previously reported in our consolidated financial statements to change 
we are currently investigating the impacts of fsp no 
s initial recognition  measurement and disclosure provisions on our consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources capitalization year ended december  change millions short term debt and current maturities long term debt   total debt   total minority interest common shareholders equity total capitalization   general 
the year to date increase in shareholders equity primarily results from a million increase in the fair market value of our interest rate swaps  which expired in february  and million related to the translation of foreign balances into us dollars 
in addition  net income  premium on common stock issued pursuant to benefit plans and other transactions contributed million to the increase in shareholders equity 
the increase in shareholders equity was partially offset by an adjustment to additional minimum pension liability of million as a result of a decrease in the fair market value of the plan assets 
although our book equity balance was small at december   it should not affect our business operations 
we have no debt covenants that are based upon our book equity  and there are no other agreements that are adversely impacted by our relatively low book equity 
short term debt  which includes the current portion of long term obligations and borrowings by foreign subsidiaries  as well as our revolving credit facility  decreased by million during the decrease is the result of an million decrease in the current portion of long term obligations primarily resulting from the june repayment of some of our long term obligations offset by a million increase in short term debt on foreign subsidiaries 
in addition  we decreased our borrowings by approximately million during under our revolving credit facility 
there were no borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility as of december  borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility were million as of december  the overall increase in long term debt resulted from the issuance of new long term debt as described below  partially offset by payments made on outstanding long term debt 
senior credit facility 
our financing arrangements are primarily provided by a committed senior secured financing arrangement with a syndicate of banks and other financial institutions  which was million at december  the arrangement is secured by substantially all our domestic assets and pledges of percent of the stock of certain first tier foreign subsidiaries  as well as guarantees by our material domestic subsidiaries 
we originally entered into this facility in and since that time have periodically requested and received amendments to the facility for various purposes 
in  we engaged in a series of transactions that resulted in the full refinancing of the facility  through an amendment and restatement  in december 
the following describes our activities with respect to the senior credit facility over the last several years 
we entered into an agreement to amend this facility on october  to i relax the financial covenant ratios beginning in the fourth quarter of  ii exclude up to million of cash charges and expenses related to cost reduction initiatives from the calculation of consolidated earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda used in our financial covenant ratios through and iii make certain other technical changes 
in exchange for these amendments  we agreed to certain interest rate increases  lowered our capital expenditure limits and paid an aggregate fee of about million 
as a result of significant reductions in north american vehicle production levels announced in by our oe customers  as well as an accelerated weakening of the global aftermarket  we entered into a second amendment of our senior credit facility on march  the second amendment revised the financial covenant ratios we were required to maintain as of the end of each of the quarters ending in the second amendment also reduced the limitation on capital expenditures from million to million  and required that net cash proceeds from all significant  non ordinary course asset sales be used to prepay the senior term loans 
in exchange for these amendments  we agreed to a basis point increase in interest rates on the senior term loans and borrowings under our revolving credit facility and paid an aggregate fee of million to consenting lenders 
we incurred legal  advisory and other costs related to the amendment process of million 
at the time of the second amendment  we expected that we would meet with the senior lenders during the first quarter of to negotiate further amendments to the senior credit facility 
consequently  we amended the senior credit facility for a third time on march  the third amendment revised the financial covenant ratios we are required to maintain as of the end of each of the quarters ending in  and it also extended the limitation on annual capital expenditures of million through this three year period 
the amendment further provided us with the option to enter into sale and leaseback arrangements on up to million of our assets 
the proceeds from these arrangements would have to be used to prepay the term loans under the senior credit agreement 
the amendment also allows us to exclude up to million of cash charges and expenses  before taxes  related to any cost reduction initiatives over the period from the calculation of the financial covenant ratios we are required to maintain under our senior credit agreement 
it also permits us to execute exchanges of our senior subordinated bonds for shares of common stock 
we do not have any current plans to enter into any debt for stock exchanges 
any significant debt for stock exchange would require approval of our stockholders 
in exchange for these amendments  we agreed to a million reduction in our revolving credit facility  a basis point increase in interest rates on the senior term loans and borrowings under our revolving credit facility  and paid an aggregate fee of million to consenting lenders 
we also incurred legal  advisory and other costs related to the amendment process of million 
in june  we issued million of percent senior secured notes in a private placement 
the notes have a final maturity date of july  the notes accrue interest from june  with a first interest payment date of january  in october  we completed an offer to exchange all of the notes issued in the june private placement for a like amount of the percent senior secured notes  with substantially identical terms  which had been registered under the securities act of these notes are described in more detail below under senior and subordinated notes 
we received net proceeds in the second quarter from the offering of the notes  after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and our expenses  of million 
we used the net proceeds of the offering to repay outstanding amounts under our senior credit facility as follows i first  to prepay million on the term loan a due november   ii second  to prepay million on the term loans b and c due november  and may   respectively  and iii third  to prepay outstanding borrowings of million under the revolving credit portion of our senior credit facility 
in connection with issuing million of percent senior secured notes due july   we amended the senior credit facility for the fourth time effective may  the fourth amendment allowed us to incur debt secured by a second lien on our us assets and to have that debt guaranteed by our major us subsidiaries 
the amendment also allowed us to use a portion of the proceeds from the new senior secured notes to repay outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility  without having to reduce the million size of the revolving credit facility  and to prepay the term loans under the senior credit facility on a non pro rata basis with the remaining net proceeds from the notes 
in exchange for these amendments  we agreed to pay an aggregate sum of million to consenting lenders 
we also incurred legal  advisory and other costs related to the amendment process of million 
these costs were included in the capitalized debt issuance costs 
in december  we amended and restated our senior credit facility and in connection therewith  we issued an additional million of percent senior secured notes in a private placement 
we received million of net proceeds from the offering of the additional million of percent senior secured notes  after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other expenses and including a percent price premium over par 
we also received million in net proceeds from the new term loan b borrowings under the amended and restated senior credit facility  after deducting fees and other expenses 
we used the combined net proceeds of million to prepay the million outstanding under term loans a  b and c under the senior credit facility immediately prior to the completion of the transaction 
the remaining million of net proceeds were used for general corporate purposes 
in addition  we received million of accrued interest on the new notes for the period from june through december  that investors paid us and that we subsequently used to pay  on january   accrued interest on the notes from june  we incurred million in fees associated with the issuance of the aggregate million of percent senior secured notes and the amendment and restatement of our senior credit facility which will be amortized over the term of the senior secured notes and the amended and restated senior credit facility 
after giving effect to the use of the net proceeds from both the june and december transactions  we expect our annual interest expense will increase by approximately million 
in addition  we expensed approximately million of existing deferred debt issuance costs as a result of retiring the term loans under the senior credit facility 
our amended and restated senior credit facility consists of a seven year  million term loan b facility maturing in december  a five year  million revolving credit facility maturing in december  and a seven year  million tranche b letter of credit revolving loan facility maturing in december although the term loan facility and the tranche b letter of credit revolving loan facility mature in  the two facilities are subject to mandatory prepayment in full  and any letters of credit issued under the term loan b revolving loan facility are subject to full cash collateralization  a on april   if by that date our senior subordinated notes are not refinanced or extended with a maturity not earlier than april   and b on the date which is six months prior to the date to which the senior subordinated notes have been refinanced or had their maturity extended  if our senior subordinated notes have been refinanced or had their maturity extended to a date prior to april  quarterly principal repayment installments of million on the term loan b facility will begin on march  and continue until december   then rise to million each on march  june  and september of  with the remaining million final principal repayment due on december  as of december   borrowings under the term loan b facility and the revolving credit facility bear interest at an annual rate equal to  at our option  either i the london interbank offering rate plus a margin of basis points  or ii a rate consisting of the greater of the jp morgan chase prime rate or the federal funds rate plus basis points  plus a margin of basis points 
we also pay a commitment fee of basis points on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility 
under the provisions of the senior credit facility agreement  the interest margins for borrowings under the revolving credit facility and fees paid on letters of credit issued under our revolving credit facility are subject to adjustment based on the consolidated leverage ratio consolidated indebtedness divided by consolidated ebitda as defined in the senior credit facility agreement measured at the end of each quarter beginning with the fourth quarter of the interest margins for borrowings under the term loan b facility will reduce by basis points following the end of each fiscal quarter for which the consolidated leverage ratio is less than our senior secured credit facility does not contain any terms that could accelerate the payment of the facility as a result of a credit rating agency downgrade 
the new million tranche b letter of credit revolving loan facility is available for borrowings of revolving loans and to support letters of credit issued from time to time under the senior credit facility 
on december   the tranche b letter of credit revolving loan facility lenders deposited million with the administrative agent  who will invest that amount in time deposits 
revolving loans can be drawn  repaid and reborrowed thereunder 
such revolving loans will be funded from such deposits and such repayments will be redeposited with the administrative agent 
if a letter of credit is paid under this facility and not reimbursed in full by us  each participating lender s ratable share of the deposit will be applied automatically in satisfaction of the reimbursement obligation 
we will not have an interest in any such funds on deposit  and we will not account for such funds as our indebtedness when deposited with the administrative agent until drawn by us as described below 
revolving loans borrowed under such facility will be funded with the funds on deposit in such accounts and accrue interest at a rate per annum equal to libor plus basis points 
letters of credit issued thereunder will accrue a letter of credit fee at a per annum rate of basis points for the pro rata account of the lenders under such facility and a fronting fee for the ratable account of the issuers thereof at a per annum rate in an amount to be agreed upon payable monthly in arrears 
the administrative agent will pay on a monthly basis to the lenders under the facility a return on their funds actually on deposit in such accounts in an amount equal to a per annum rate of monthly libor reset every business day during such monthly period minus basis points 
we will be obligated to pay such lenders on a monthly basis a fee equal to the excess of x a per annum rate equal to monthly libor reset at the start of the applicable month plus basis points on the size of such facility ie  million initially over y the sum of the amount of such return for such month  the amount of interest accrued on such loans under such facility for such month and the letter of credit fees but not the fronting fees accrued on such letters of credit under such facility for such month  provided  that except in certain circumstances  the aggregate amount of such interest and fees shall not exceed the amount determined pursuant to clause x above minus such return 
the interest margins paid on revolving loans and the fees paid on letters of credit issued under the tranche b letter of credit revolving loan facility will reduce by basis points following the end of each fiscal quarter for which the consolidated leverage ratio is less than the tranche b letter of credit revolving loan facility will be reflected as debt on our balance sheet only if we have outstanding thereunder revolving loans or payments by the facility in respect of letters of credit 
we will not be liable for any losses to or misappropriation of any i return due to the administrative agent s failure to achieve the return described above or to pay all or any portion of such return to any lender under such facility or ii funds on deposit in such account by such lender other than the obligation to repay funds released from such accounts and provided to us as revolving loans under such facility 
the amended and restated senior credit facility requires that we maintain financial ratios equal to or better than the following consolidated leverage ratios consolidated indebtedness divided by consolidated ebitda  consolidated interest coverage ratios consolidated ebitda divided by consolidated cash interest paid  and fixed charge coverage ratios consolidated ebitda less consolidated capital expenditures  divided by consolidated cash interest paid at the end of each period indicated 
the financial ratios required under the amended senior credit facility and  in the case of the year ended december   the actual ratios we achieved are shown in the following tables quarter ended march  june  september  december  req

the senior credit facility agreement also contains restrictions on our operations that are customary for similar facilities  including limitations on i incurring additional liens  ii sale and leaseback transactions except for the permitted transactions described above  iii liquidations and dissolutions  iv incurring additional indebtedness or guarantees  v capital expenditures  vi dividends  vii mergers and consolidations  and viii prepayments and modifications of subordinated and other debt instruments 
compliance with these requirements and restrictions is a condition for any incremental borrowings under the senior credit facility agreement and failure to meet these requirements enables the lenders to require repayment of any outstanding loans 
as of december   we were in compliance with both the financial covenants as indicated above and operational restrictions of the facility 
senior and subordinated notes 
our outstanding debt also includes million of percent senior subordinated notes due october  in addition to the million of percent senior secured notes due july  described above 
we can redeem some or all of the notes at any time after july   in the case of the senior secured notes  and october   in the case of the senior subordinated notes 
if we sell certain of our assets or experience specified kinds of changes in control  we must offer to repurchase the notes 
we are permitted to redeem up to percent of the senior secured notes with the proceeds of certain equity offerings completed before july  from time to time  we evaluate opportunities to refinance our senior and subordinated notes 
for example  the percent senior subordinated notes are callable beginning in october we could refinance the senior subordinated notes with the cash proceeds of sales of new debt  debt securities or preferred stock convertible into common equity  or common stock  or through any combination thereof 
the existing terms of our financing arrangements contemplate these types of refinancings and  accordingly  we could effect appropriate transactions without any further consent of our lenders 
any decision to refinance our current debt will be based upon the current economic conditions and the benefits to our company 
the senior subordinated debt and senior secured debt indentures both require that we  as a condition to incurring certain types of indebtedness not otherwise permitted  maintain an interest coverage ratio of not less than 
we have not incurred any of the types of indebtedness not otherwise permitted by the indentures 
the indentures also contain restrictions on our operations  including limitations on i incurring additional indebtedness or liens  ii dividends  iii distributions and stock repurchases  iv investments  and v mergers and consolidations 
subject to limited exceptions  all of our existing and future material domestic wholly owned subsidiaries fully and unconditionally guarantee these notes on a joint and several basis 
in addition  the senior secured notes and related guarantees are secured by second priority liens  subject to specified exceptions  on all of our and our subsidiary guarantors assets that secure obligations under our senior credit facility  except that only a portion of the capital stock of our and our subsidiary guarantor s domestic subsidiaries is provided as collateral and no assets or capital stock of our direct or indirect foreign subsidiaries secure the notes or guarantees 
there are no significant restrictions on the ability of the subsidiaries that have guaranteed these notes to make distributions to us 
as of december   we were in compliance with the covenants and restrictions of these indentures 
accounts receivable securitization 
in addition to our senior credit facility  senior secured notes and senior subordinated notes  we also sell some of our accounts receivable 
in north america  we have an accounts receivable securitization program with a commercial bank 
we sell original equipment and aftermarket receivables on a daily basis under this program 
we had sold accounts receivable under this program of million and million at december  and  respectively 
this program is subject to cancellation prior to its maturity date if we were to i fail to pay interest or principal payments on an amount of indebtedness exceeding million  ii default on the financial covenant ratios under the senior credit facility  or iii fail to maintain certain financial ratios in connection with the accounts receivable securitization program 
in january  this program was amended to extend its term to january  and reduce the size of the program to million 
the program has since been amended to increase its size to million with its termination date unchanged at january  we also sell some receivables in our european operations to regional banks in europe 
at december  we had sold million of accounts receivable in europe up from million at december  the arrangements to sell receivables in europe are not committed and can be cancelled at any time 
if we were not able to sell receivables under either the north american or european securitization programs  our borrowings under our revolving credit agreements would increase 
these accounts receivable securitization programs provide us with access to cash at costs that are generally favorable to alternative sources of financing  and allow us to reduce borrowings under our revolving credit agreements 
capital requirements 
we believe that cash flows from operations  combined with available borrowing capacity described above  assuming that we maintain compliance with the financial covenants and other requirements of our loan agreement  will be sufficient to meet our future capital requirements for the following year  including scheduled debt principal amortization payments 
our ability to meet the financial covenants depends upon a number of operational and economic factors  many of which are beyond our control 
factors that could impact our ability to comply with the financial covenants include the rate at which consumers continue to buy new vehicles and the rate at which they continue to repair vehicles already in service  as well as our ability to successfully implement our restructuring plans 
lower north american vehicle production levels  weakening in the global aftermarket  or a reduction in vehicle production levels in europe  beyond our expectations  could impact our ability to meet our financial covenant ratios 
in the event that we are unable to meet these financial covenants  we would consider several options to meet our cash flow needs 
these options could include further renegotiations with our senior credit lenders  additional cost reduction or restructuring initiatives  sales of assets or common stock  or other alternatives to enhance our financial and operating position 
should we be required to implement any of these actions to meet our cash flow needs  we believe we can do so in a reasonable time frame 
contractual obligations our remaining required debt principal amortization and payment obligations under lease and certain other financial commitments are shown in the following table payments due in beyond total millions obligations revolver borrowings senior long term debt long term notes capital leases subordinated long term debt other subsidiary debt short term debt debt and capital lease obligations   operating leases interest payments capital commitments total payments   we principally use our revolving credit facilities to finance our short term capital requirements 
as a result  we classify the outstanding balances of the revolving credit facilities within our short term debt even though the revolving credit facility has a termination date of december  and the tranche b letter of credit facility revolving loan facility has a termination date of december  the revolving credit facilities balances included in short term debt are zero and million at december  and  respectively 
if we do not maintain compliance with the terms of our senior credit facility  senior secured notes indenture and senior subordinated debt indenture described above  all amounts under those arrangements could  automatically or at the option of the lenders or other debt holders  become due 
additionally  each of those facilities contains provisions that certain events of default under one facility will constitute a default under the other facility  allowing the acceleration of all amounts due 
we currently expect to maintain compliance with terms of all of our various credit agreements for the foreseeable future 
included in our contractual obligations is the amount of interest to be paid on our long term debt 
as our debt structure contains both fixed and variable rate interest debt  we have made assumptions in calculating the amount of the future interest payments 
interest on our senior secured notes and senior subordinated notes is calculated using the fixed rates of percent and percent  respectively 
interest on our variable rate debt is calculated as basis point plus libor of percent which is the current rate at december  we have assumed that libor will remain unchanged for the outlying years 
we have not included purchase obligations as part of our contractual obligations as we generally do not enter into long term agreements with our suppliers 
in addition  the agreements we currently have do not specify the volumes we are required to purchase 
if any commitment is provided  in many cases the agreements state only the minimum percentage of our purchase requirements we must buy from the supplier 
as a result  these purchase obligations fluctuate from year to year and we are not able to quantify the amount of our future obligation 
we have also not included material cash requirements for taxes and funding requirements for pension and postretirement benefits 
we have not included cash requirements for taxes as we are a taxpayer in certain foreign jurisdictions but not in domestic locations 
additionally  it is difficult to estimate taxes to be paid as shifts in where we generate income can have a significant impact on future tax payments 
we have not included cash requirements for funding pension and postretirement costs  as based upon current estimates we believe we will be required to make contributions between million to million to those plans in pension and postretirement contributions beyond will be required but those amounts will vary based upon many factors  including the performance of our pension fund investments during we occasionally provide guarantees that could require us to make future payments in the event that the third party primary obligor does not make its required payments 
we have not recorded a liability for any of these guarantees 
the only third party guarantee we have made is the performance of lease obligations by a former affiliate 
our maximum liability under this guarantee was approximately million at both december  and  respectively 
we have no recourse in the event of default by the former affiliate 
however  we have not been required to make any payments under this guarantee 
additionally  we have from time to time issued guarantees for the performance of obligations by some of our subsidiaries  and some of our subsidiaries have guaranteed our debt 
all of our then existing and future material domestic wholly owned subsidiaries fully and unconditionally guarantee the million senior secured credit facility  the million senior secured notes and the million senior subordinated notes on a joint and several basis 
the arrangement for the senior secured credit facility is also secured by substantially all our domestic assets and pledges of percent of the stock of certain first tier foreign subsidiaries 
the arrangement for the million senior secured notes is secured by second priority liens  subject to specified exceptions  on all of our domestic assets that secure obligations under our senior credit facility  except that only a portion of the capital stock of our domestic subsidiaries is provided as collateral 
no assets or capital stock of our direct or indirect foreign subsidiaries secure these notes 
you should also read note where we present the supplemental guarantor condensed consolidating financial statements 
we have issued guarantees through letters of credit in connection with some obligations of our affiliates 
we have guaranteed through letters of credit support for local credit facilities  travel and procurement card programs  and cash management requirements for some of our subsidiaries totaling million 
we have also issued million in letters of credit to support some of our subsidiaries insurance arrangements 
in addition  we have issued million in guarantees through letters of credit to guarantee other obligations of subsidiaries primarily related to environmental remediation activities 
dividends on common stock on january   we announced that our board of directors eliminated the quarterly dividend on our common stock 
the board took the action in response to industry conditions  primarily greater than anticipated production volume reductions by original equipment manufacturers and continued softness in the global light vehicle aftermarket 
there are no current plans to reinstate a dividend on our common stock 
cash flows year ended december  millions cash provided used by operating activities investing activities financing activities operating activities for the year ended december   cash flows provided from operating activities was million as compared to million in the prior year 
for cash flow provided from working capital was million as compared to million for the primary driver was the inventory reduction program  which generated million in cash flow during this was partially offset by higher cash tax payments and the timing of accruals versus payments in the current year as compared to the prior year 
also included in operating cash flows were million in positive cash flows from the write off of debt issuance costs as a result of the bond issuances in june and december of and the refinancing of the senior debt in december of additionally  we generated positive operating cash flows due to higher minority interest income and non cash restructuring adjustments taken against the reserve in in june  we entered into arrangements with two major oe customers in north america under which  in exchange for a discount  payments for product sales are made earlier than otherwise required under existing payment terms 
these arrangements reduced accounts receivable by million and million as of december  and  respectively 
in june  we entered into a similar arrangement with a third major oe customer in north america 
this arrangement further reduced accounts receivable by million at december  these arrangements can be cancelled at any time 
investing activities cash used for investing activities was million higher in compared to the same period a year ago 
in  we received million in cash from the sale of our york  uk facility and also recorded million from a settlement with an oe customer for reimbursement of expenses related to a cancelled platform 
capital expenditures were million in  down million from the million in the prior year 
financing activities cash flow from financing activities was a million outflow in compared to an outflow of million in the same period of the primary reason for the change is attributable to the million bond offering in june  the million bond offering in december and the senior debt refinancing in december of outlook north america light vehicle production continued at a relatively strong pace in manufacturer incentives kept consumer purchases higher than estimates at the beginning of the year 
consequently  the north america light vehicle build rate was an estimated million units 
production rates for weakened slightly to an annualized rate of million units or a three percent decline from the prior year 
additionally  north american heavy duty truck production was down three percent from the previous year 
we expect north american oe light vehicle production to increase to approximately million units in  however we remain cautious regarding volumes due to continuing uncertain economic conditions in the us and uncertainty about the willingness of the original equipment manufacturers to continue to support consumer automobile sales through incentives 
we expect that the heavy duty truck market could increase between to percent in in europe  new vehicle yearly production rates appear to be down one percent from last year 
expectations for european vehicle production are an increase of approximately two percent as compared to we plan to build on the oe ride control business launched in and the ramp up of oe exhaust replacement programs in along with new oe exhaust business expected to launch in in the global aftermarket  issues that have impacted volumes over the last twelve months will continue to challenge us for customer consolidation  longer product replacement cycles  a weaker economy and competition from short liners in the exhaust business will continue to impact our volumes 
we saw some signs of improvement in the north american aftermarket in the fourth quarter of and are optimistic that these improvements will continue in based on anticipated vehicle production levels our global original equipment customer book of business is currently  million and  million for and respectively 
adjusted for pass through sales our global original equipment customer book of business is  million and  million for and respectively 
when we refer to our book of business  we mean revenues for original equipment manufacturer programs that have been formally awarded to us as well as programs which we are highly confident will result in revenues based on either informal customer indications consistent with past practices and or our status as supplier for the existing program and relationship with the customer 
this book of business is subject to increase or decrease due to changes in customer requirements  customer and consumer preferences  and the number of vehicles actually produced by our customers 
we do not intend  however  to update the amounts shown above due to these changes 
in addition  our book of business is based on our anticipated pricing for each applicable program over its life 
however  we are under continuing pricing pressures from our oe customers 
we do not intend to update the amounts shown above for any price changes 
finally  for our foreign operations the book of business assumes a fixed foreign currency value 
this value is used to translate foreign business to the us dollar 
currency in our foreign operations is subject to fluctuation based on the economic conditions in each of our foreign operations 
we do not intend to update the amounts shown above due to these fluctuations 
see cautionary statement for purposes of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of environmental and other matters we are subject to a variety of environmental and pollution control laws and regulations in all jurisdictions in which we operate 
we expense or capitalize  as appropriate  expenditures for ongoing compliance with environmental regulations that relate to current operations 
we expense expenditures that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations and that do not contribute to current or future revenue generation 
we record liabilities when environmental assessments indicate that remedial efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated 
estimates of the liability are based upon currently available facts  existing technology  and presently enacted laws and regulations taking into consideration the likely effects of inflation and other societal and economic factors 
we consider all available evidence including prior experience in remediation of contaminated sites  other companies cleanup experiences and data released by the united states environmental protection agency or other organizations 
these estimated liabilities are subject to revision in future periods based on actual costs or new information 
where future cash flows are fixed or reliably determinable  we have discounted the liabilities 
all other environmental liabilities are recorded at their undiscounted amounts 
we evaluate recoveries separately from the liability and  when they are assured  recoveries are recorded and reported separately from the associated liability in our financial statements 
as of december   we are designated as a potentially responsible party in three superfund sites 
we have estimated our share of the remediation costs for these sites to be less than million in the aggregate 
in addition to the superfund sites  we may have the obligation to remediate current or former facilities  and we estimate our share of remediation costs at these facilities to be approximately million 
for each of the superfund sites and the current and former facilities  we have established reserves that we believe are adequate for these costs 
although we believe our estimates of remediation costs are reasonable and are based on the latest available information  the cleanup costs are estimates and are subject to revision as more information becomes available about the extent of remediation required 
at some sites  we expect that other parties will contribute to the remediation costs 
in addition  at the superfund sites  the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act provides that our liability could be joint and several  meaning that we could be required to pay in excess of our share of remediation costs 
our understanding of the financial strength of other potentially responsible parties at the superfund sites  and of other liable parties at our current and former facilities  has been considered  where appropriate  in our determination of our estimated liability 
we undertook a third party evaluation of estimated environmental remediation costs at one of our facilities beginning in the evaluation was initiated as a result of testing that indicated the potential underground migration of some contaminants beyond our facility property 
we completed and analyzed the results of our evaluation of contamination and migration from that facility 
we initially increased the reserve by million in the fourth quarter of related to on site remediation activities and million in the first quarter of following evaluation of needed off site remediation activities 
however  after further investigation of alternative remediation technologies  we were able to identify a more efficient technology and therefore reduced the reserve by million in the fourth quarter of we believe that any potential costs associated with our current status as a potentially responsible party in the superfund sites  or as a liable party at our current or former facilities  will not be material to our results of operations or consolidated financial position 
from time to time we are subject to product warranty claims whereby we are required to bear costs of repair or replacement of certain of our products 
warranty claims may range from individual customer claims to full recalls of all products in the field 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included under item for information regarding our warranty reserves 
we also from time to time are involved in legal proceedings or claims that are incidental to the conduct of our business 
some of these proceedings allege damages against us relating to environmental liabilities including toxic tort  property damage and remediation  intellectual property matters including patent  trademark and copyright infringement  and licensing disputes  personal injury claims including injuries due to product failure  design or warnings issues  and other product liability related matters  employment matters  and commercial or contractual disputes  sometimes related to acquisitions or divestitures 
for example  we are involved in litigation with the minority owner of one of our indian joint ventures over various operational issues 
this dispute involves a court mandated bidding process  which could result in a non cash charge to earnings if we are required to sell our interest in the joint venture on unfavorable terms 
as another example  we recently identified our failure to file certain reports under an automotive industry regulation and  although we have now made the required filings  this failure could subject us to a response  including fines or penalties  from the appropriate agency 
we will continue to vigorously defend ourselves against all of these claims 
although the ultimate outcome of any legal matter cannot be predicted with certainty  based on present information  including our assessment of the merits of the particular claim  we do not expect that these legal proceedings or claims will have any material adverse impact on our future consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in addition  we are subject to a number of lawsuits initiated by a significant number of claimants alleging health problems as a result of exposure to asbestos 
many of these cases involve significant numbers of individual claimants 
however  only a small percentage of these claimants allege that they were automobile mechanics who were allegedly exposed to our former muffler products and a significant number appear to involve workers in other industries or otherwise do not include sufficient information to determine whether there is any basis for a claim against us 
we believe  based on scientific and other evidence  it is unlikely that mechanics were exposed to asbestos by our former muffler products and that  in any event  they would not be at increased risk of asbestos related disease based on their work with these products 
further  many of these cases involve numerous defendants  with the number of each in some cases exceeding defendants from a variety of industries 
additionally  the plaintiffs either do not specify any  or specify the jurisdictional minimum  dollar amount for damages 
on the other hand  we are experiencing an increasing number of these claims  likely due to bankruptcies of major asbestos manufacturers 
we vigorously defend ourselves against these claims as part of our ordinary course of business 
to date  with respect to claims that have proceeded sufficiently through the judicial process  we have regularly achieved favorable resolution in the form of a dismissal of the claim or a judgment in our favor 
accordingly  we presently believe that these asbestos related claims will not have a material adverse impact on our future financial condition or results of operations 
during the second quarter of  we reached an agreement with an oe customer to recover our investment in development costs and related equipment  as well as amounts owed to some of our suppliers  for a platform cancelled by the customer 
we collected million  net of the amounts we owed to suppliers  during the second quarter pursuant to this agreement 
the agreement had no effect on our results of operations 
employee stock ownership plans we have established employee stock ownership plans for the benefit of our employees 
under the plans  participants may elect to defer up to percent of their salary through contributions to the plan  which are invested in selected mutual funds or used to buy our common stock 
we currently match in cash percent of each employee s contribution up to percent of the employee s salary 
we recorded expense for these matching contributions of approximately million and million for the years ended december  and all contributions vest immediately 
derivative financial instruments foreign currency exchange rate risk we use derivative financial instruments  principally foreign currency forward purchase and sale contracts with terms of less than one year  to hedge our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
our primary exposure to changes in foreign currency rates results from intercompany loans made between affiliates to minimize the need for borrowings from third parties 
additionally  we enter into foreign currency forward purchase and sale contracts to mitigate our exposure to changes in exchange rates on certain intercompany and third party trade receivables and payables 
we manage counter party credit risk by entering into derivative financial instruments with major financial institutions that can be expected to fully perform under the terms of such agreements 
we have from time to time also entered into forward contracts to hedge our net investment in foreign subsidiaries 
we do not currently enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
in managing our foreign currency exposures  we identify and aggregate existing offsetting positions and then hedge residual exposures through third party derivative contracts 
the following table summarizes by major currency the notional amounts  weighted average settlement rates  and fair value for foreign currency forward purchase and sale contracts as of december  all contracts in the following table mature in december  notional amount weighted average fair value in foreign currency settlement rates in us dollars millions except settlement rates australian dollars purchase

sell interest rate risk our financial instruments that are sensitive to market risk for changes in interest rates are our debt securities 
we primarily use our revolving credit facilities to finance our short term capital requirements 
we pay a current market rate of interest on these borrowings 
we have financed our long term capital requirements with long term debt with original maturity dates ranging from six to ten years 
under the terms of our senior credit facility agreement  we were required to hedge our exposure to floating interest rates by april so that at least percent of our long term debt was fixed for a period of at least three years 
in february  we hedged million of our floating rate long term debt with three year  floating to fixed interest rate swaps 
in april  we hedged an additional million of our floating rate long term debt with three year  floating to fixed interest rate swaps 
the hedges that we executed fully satisfied the interest rate hedging requirement of the senior credit facility agreement 
the swaps expired in february and we are not required to renew them 
on december   we had million in long term debt obligations that have fixed interest rates 
of that amount  million is fixed through october and million through july  while the remainder is fixed over periods of through there is also million in long term debt obligations that have variable interest rates based on a current market rate of interest 
we estimate that the fair value of our long term debt at december  was about percent of its book value 
a one percentage point increase or decrease in interest rates would increase or decrease the annual interest expense we recognize in the income statement and the cash we pay for interest expense by about million after tax

higher sales from the oe business were partially offset by aftermarket volume softness in both product lines  primarily in the fourth quarter 
total north american oe revenues increased percent to  million in due to higher volumes and increased catalytic converter sales that are passed through to our customers 
oe exhaust revenues were up percent in primarily due to increased volumes and higher pass through sales 
these pass through catalytic converter sales occur when  at the direction of our oe customers  we purchase catalytic converters or components from suppliers  use them in our manufacturing process  and sell them as part of the completed system 
oe ride control revenues for increased percent  driven by increased volumes in both the light vehicle and heavy duty market 
total oe revenues  excluding million of pass through sales  increased percent in  while north american light vehicle production increased approximately percent over our revenue increase was greater than the build rate increase as a result of the introduction of new platforms  on which we are a supplier  ramping up and outpacing the overall build rate 
aftermarket revenues for north america were million for  representing a decrease of percent compared to the prior year 
aftermarket ride control revenues increased one percent in  as a result of new customer additions in the second half of and the first quarter of offsetting overall softness in the ride control aftermarket  particularly in the second half of aftermarket exhaust revenues declined percent in reflecting an overall market decline in the exhaust business

total oe revenues were million for oe exhaust revenues declined percent to million from million the prior year 
excluding a million decrease in pass through sales and a million net increase due to strengthening currency  oe exhaust revenues declined percent 
oe ride control revenues increased to million or percent  from million for excluding a million net benefit from currency appreciation  oe ride control revenues declined one percent 
light vehicle production by european oe manufacturers was down about percent in versus our oe exhaust decline was greater than the decline in the european light vehicle build rate primarily due to timing issues experienced in the second and third quarters of between retiring platforms and the launch of new platforms on which we are the supplier 
nearly all of the platforms planned for launch during this period have commenced production and most are now at or near expected volumes 
our oe ride control revenue decline was less than the decline in the european light vehicle build rate as a result of stronger sales on our existing platforms 
european aftermarket sales were million in compared to million in the prior year 
excluding million attributable to currency appreciation  aftermarket revenues declined percent due primarily to the continued decline in exhaust replacement rates as a result of the increasing use of stainless steel new vehicles 
this decline was partially offset by the launch of monroe reflex r shocks and struts  our premium ride control product  in the second quarter of revenues from our other operations increased million to million in as compared to million in the prior year 
higher volumes and increased pass through sales drove increased revenues of million at our asian operations 
stronger volumes and strengthening currency also increased australian revenues by million 
these increases were partially offset by the effects of the weakened south american economy  where revenues declined by million

stronger volumes and volume related manufacturing efficiencies contributed million to oe profitability 
the elimination of goodwill amortization  discussed in this management s discussion and analysis under the section changes in accounting principles  contributed million to the ebit increase 
partially offsetting these increases were increased selling  general and administrative costs  million in restructuring related expenses that could not be accrued related to our project genesis restructuring efforts net of a million favorable adjustment to the reserve for the costs to complete the first phase of project genesis and million in costs associated with amending our senior credit facility 
in the north american aftermarket  price increases instituted in and a shift toward premium products increased ebit by million and lower changeover costs and manufacturing efficiencies and distribution increased ebit by million 
partially offsetting these increases were lower volumes in the aftermarket emission control product line which reduced ebit by million 
included in north america s prior year results were charges related to our restructuring efforts and the establishment of an environmental reserve that reduced ebit by million in the aggregate 
our european segment s ebit declined to million in from million the prior year 
volume decreases and related operating inefficiencies in both the oe and aftermarket operations negatively impacted ebit by million 
in  we also incurred approximately million in restructuring related expenses that could not be accrued related to our project genesis restructuring efforts and million in costs associated with amending our senior credit facility 
european ebit in was also reduced by million due to an increase in reserves for warranty issues 
see environmental and other matters in this management s discussion and analysis for a more detailed discussion of these warranty issues 
partially offsetting these decreases was the gain on the sale of our york  uk facility  which increased ebit by million

ebit as a percentage of revenue year ended december  north america europe other total tenneco automotive in north america  ebit as a percentage of revenue increased by percent for stronger oe volumes drove the increase 
additionally  volume related manufacturing efficiencies and the elimination of goodwill amortization contributed to the increase 
north american ebit margins in  on the other hand  were significantly impacted by our restructuring activities 
in europe  ebit margins declined in due to significant decreases in both oe and aftermarket volumes 
also contributing to the decline were volume related manufacturing inefficiencies 
partially offsetting these decreases was the gain on the sale of our york  uk facility 
ebit as a percentage of revenue for our other operations remained flat year over year as improved operating performance was offset by manufacturing inefficiencies and a weakened south american economy 
interest expense  net of interest capitalized we reported interest expense of million in  compared to million in the prior year 
the decrease in total interest expense is due to lower interest rates on our variable rate debt and overall lower debt balances 
capitalized interest was million in and million in see liquidity and capital resources capitalization in this management s discussion and analysis for a more detailed description of our borrowings 
included in our interest expense is the financial impact of the three year floating to fixed rate swaps we put in place in early on million of our senior term loans  as required by our senior credit agreement

dividends on common stock on january   we announced that our board of directors eliminated the quarterly dividend on our common stock 
the board took the action in response to current industry conditions  primarily greater than anticipated production volume reductions by original equipment manufacturers and continued softness in the global light vehicle aftermarket 
there are no current plans to reinstate a dividend on our common stock 
cash flows year ended december  millions cash provided used by operating activities investing activities financing activities operating activities for the year ended december   cash flows provided by operating activities were million compared to million in the prior year 
higher earnings in the year were a key driver to the increased cash provided 
in addition  we generated million in cash flow from working capital during  compared to million in the prior year 
in  we generated million in cash flow through better management of our payables 
at the end of  we reduced payable balances by taking advantage of early payment discounts in europe 
during we returned to our customary payment schedule  which increased payables balances and improved working capital 
additionally  in june of  we received a payment from an oe customer for the reimbursement of expenses related to a cancelled platform 
of the total cash payment  million was recorded in operating activities and the remaining balance was recorded in investing activities 
primarily offsetting these increases were increases in receivables as a result of lowered factoring levels and increases in inventories in anticipation of platform launches in see capitalization above for a description of our accounts receivable factoring program 
in june  we entered into arrangements with two major oe customers in north america under which  in exchange for a discount that is less than our marginal borrowing cost  payments for product sales are made earlier than otherwise required under existing payment terms 
these arrangements reduced accounts receivable by million and million as of december  and  respectively 
these arrangements can be cancelled at any time

investing activities cash used for investing activities was million lower in compared to the prior year  due primarily to million in net proceeds from the sale of our york  uk facility and a million settlement from an oe customer for reimbursement of expenses related to a cancelled platform 
capital expenditures were million in  up million from million in the prior year 
the increase is partially attributable to capital spending for project genesis  which was million in financing activities cash used for financing activities was million in  compared to cash provided of million in the prior year 
we made senior debt principal payments of million on our senior credit facility in included in these payments was a pre payment on the senior term loans of million in september using the net cash proceeds we received in the second quarter from the sale of our york  uk facility
