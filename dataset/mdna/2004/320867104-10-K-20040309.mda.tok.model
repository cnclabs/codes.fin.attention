the company wishes to caution that the foregoing list of important factors may not be all inclusive and specifically declines to undertake any obligation to publicly revise any forward looking statements that have been made to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statements or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events 
with respect to forward looking statements set forth in the notes to consolidated financial statements  including those relating to contingent liabilities and legal proceedings  some of the factors that could affect the ultimate disposition of those contingencies are changes in applicable laws  the development of facts in individual cases  settlement opportunities  and the actions of plaintiffs  judges  and juries 
critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and are consistent with predominant practices in the financial services industry 
application of critical accounting policies  those policies that management believes are the most important to the company s financial position and results of operations  requires management to make estimates  assumptions  and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes and are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements 
future changes in information may affect these estimates  assumptions  and judgments  which  in turn  may affect amounts reported in the financial statements 
the company has numerous accounting policies  of which the most significant are presented in note of notes to consolidated financial statements commencing on page of this form k 
these policies  along with the disclosures presented in the other financial statement notes and in this discussion  provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined 
based on the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods  assumptions  and estimates underlying those amounts  management has determined that its accounting policies with respect to the reserve for loan losses and income taxes are the accounting areas requiring subjective or complex judgments that are most important to the company s financial position and results of operations  and  as such  are considered to be critical accounting policies as discussed below 
reserve for loan losses arriving at an appropriate level of reserve for loan losses involves a high degree of judgment 
the company s reserve for loan losses provides for probable losses based upon evaluations of known  and inherent risks in the loan portfolio 
management uses historical information to assess the adequacy of the reserve for loan losses as well as its assessment of the prevailing business environment  as it is affected by changing economic conditions and various external factors  which may impact the portfolio in ways currently unforeseen 
the reserve is increased by provisions for loan losses and by recoveries of loans previously charged off and reduced by loans charged off 
for a full discussion of the company s methodology of 
table of contents assessing the adequacy of the reserve for loan losses  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements commencing on page of this form k 
income taxes the company accounts for income tax expense by applying an estimated effective tax rate to its pre tax income 
the effective tax rate is based on management s judgments and estimates regarding permanent differences in the treatment of specific items of income and expense for financial statement and income tax purposes 
in addition  the company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities  recorded in the consolidated statements of condition  based on management s judgments and estimates regarding temporary differences in the recognition of income and expenses for financial statement and income tax purposes 
the company must also assess the likelihood that any deferred tax assets will be realized through the reduction or refund of taxes in future periods and establish a valuation allowance for those assets for which recovery is unlikely 
in making this assessment  management must make judgments and estimates regarding the ability to realize the asset through carryback to taxable income in prior years  the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences  future taxable income  and the possible application of future tax planning strategies 
although the company has determined a valuation allowance is not required for any deferred tax assets  there is no guarantee that these assets are recognizable

performance overview general overview the company generated record earnings in while maintaining sound credit quality and repositioning its balance sheet in response to the historically low interest rate environment and in anticipation of increased interest rates in the company repositioned its balance sheet to stabilize its net income in the event of anticipated interest rate increases 
in  these repositioning activities primarily involved the securities portfolio  borrowings from the federal home loan bank fhlb  and deposit pricing strategies 
if interest rates increase during  the company s financial performance would benefit in a number of ways  such as through increased net margins 
if interest rates remain stable or decrease during  the company s expected earnings could be negatively impacted 
under those circumstances  the company anticipates its level of unrealized security gains to increase  providing the company with the flexibility to substitute securities gains for potentially narrower net interest margins 
as a result of improved economic conditions  the company expects continued expansion in the markets it serves  which is expected to generate a greater demand for the company s products and services 
the competition for bank products and services continues to intensify in the chicago metropolitan area  as banks both within and outside of chicago have announced aggressive expansion plans 
the company continues to believe it can compete successfully because of its high quality products and services  its unique relationship based approach to banking  and its knowledge of and connections to its communities 
in  the company acquired covest bancshares  inc  a bank holding company  in northwestern suburban cook county the covest acquisition and the o hare office of the northern trust company 
the covest acquisition closed on december   and therefore had little impact on the company s performance 
the company expects the acquisitions will enable it to expand its market presence in the northwest chicago suburbs 
in particular  the company expects that the acquisition of covest will be accretive to earnings by approximately 
per dilutive share  and the company continues to seek  through cost savings and other means  to increase the positive impact of the transaction in in connection with the covest acquisition  in november  the company  through a wholly owned trust subsidiary  issued  of trust preferred securities at due on december  the year will be the first full year that the company will record interest for that trust preferred issuance in its consolidated statements of income 
the interest recorded should amount to million 
as a part of its growth strategy  the company regularly evaluates potential acquisition candidates  searching for opportunities that both enhance earnings performance and leverage the effectiveness of its existing franchise 

table of contents net income and performance ratios net income totaled million  or per share in  as compared to million  or per share in the return on average stockholders equity was in as compared to s  and the return on average assets for was as compared to for in  the year over year decline in net interest income and higher operating expenses were more than offset by lower provisions for loan losses  higher levels of noninterest income and a decline in the effective tax rate 
net interest income and balance sheet restructuring in  the company recorded million in net interest income as compared to million in tax equivalent net interest margin in was  down from in net interest income performance and strategies for largely reflected the challenging economic environment 
for most of  the continued  historically low level of interest rates created pressure on net interest margins as earning assets and cash flows repriced more quickly than interest bearing liabilities 
during  the company s decisions to reinvest cash flows and extend liabilities were directly influenced by its concerns as to the pace and timing of potential increases in interest rates 
over the last three quarters of  the company sold securities totaling million for a net realized gain of million  retired million in borrowings with the federal home loan bank at a cost of million  reinvested million of security cash flows in shorter term investments  and attracted million in interest bearing transactional deposits through promotional pricing 
although these activities served to decrease margin performance in  the company believes that these restructuring activities stabilized net interest margin and placed the company in a relatively improved position for performing in a higher interest rate environment 
in fourth quarter of  net interest margin was  up from in third quarter  reversing the downward trend of the previous six quarters 
improved fourth quarter performance resulted from higher yields on mortgage backed securities and the benefits realized from retiring and redeploying federal home loan bank borrowings at lower interest rates 
as of december   the company s after tax unrealized security gains total million as compared to million at year end similar to its position at the start of  management remains concerned about the impact of reinvesting cash flows into longer term assets  which would improve short term net interest income  but increasing its negative  longer term exposure to rising interest rates 
the current amount of unrealized gains existent in the company s securities portfolio enables the company to mitigate this concern by realizing security gains to offset the negative short term performance risk of investing cash flows in lower yielding  shorter term assets in strategic expansion in  the company continued to expand its strategic footprint in the highly attractive suburban chicago market 
on december   the company acquired approximately million in loans and million in deposits as a result of the covest acquisition 
in the second quarter of  the company opened its o hare financial center  a northwest cook county branch  representing million in deposits and million of loans acquired for cash from the northern trust company 
cash consideration was paid for both transactions  which under purchase accounting  created million of intangible assets 
as a result of these transactions  the company s deposit presence in the highly valued  northwest cook county market increased by million  thus affording greater opportunities for revenue improvement through sales penetration 
also during the fourth quarter of  the company sold two branches in streator  illinois  in rural lasalle county  representing million in deposits and million in loans and resulting in a pre tax gain on sale of million 
capital and dividends the company continued to maintain a strong capital structure at december   with tier and total risk based asset ratios of and  respectively  exceeding the minimum well capitalized levels for regulatory purposes of and  respectively 
these ratios improved from s comparable ratios of and  respectively 
in fourth quarter  the company s wholly owned trust subsidiary  first midwest capital trust i  issued million in trust preferred securities 
the issuance  which is treated as tier capital for regulatory purposes  matures in with semiannual interest payments due based upon a fixed coupon rate of 
the proceeds were primarily used to fund the covest acquisition 

table of contents the ratio of tangible equity to tangible assets  which excludes both intangible assets and the trust preferred issuance in its calculation  fell to at december  from at december  this decline was caused by cash acquisitions of both covest bancshares and the o hare financial center and the resulting million in intangible assets 
in fourth quarter  the company increased its quarterly cash dividend to 
per share  bringing the total dividends paid to 
per share 
due  in part  to the covest acquisition  the company slowed the pace of its share repurchase program in to thousand shares from million shares in with million shares remaining under its current repurchase authorization  the company expects to continue to repurchase shares in the pace and timing of future share repurchases will be influenced by the expected rate of return on alternative capital investment opportunities 
credit quality the company s loan loss provision for totaled million  down million from net charge offs totaled million as compared to million in all loan categories except family real estate reflected improved levels 
the ratio of the reserve for loan losses to total loans was as of december   representing of nonperforming assets and down as compared to a historical high of as of december  loan growth and deposit funding excluding the impact of the covest acquisition  total loans increased in by over corporate lending continued to improve as commercial and industrial lending increased in and real estate construction lending increased 
at the same time  real estate commercial loans increased only over  influenced by the soft office market and a higher level of prepayments 
the prospects for new corporate lending are positive as the company enters direct consumer lending increased  due to continued strong growth in home equity line lending 
indirect consumer lending  primarily automobile financings acquired from dealerships in the company s primary markets  fell in as compared to  due to the company s emphasis on underwriting quality and pricing competition with auto manufacturers 
with the expectation of higher rates and stable credit quality  consumer lending trends should improve in noninterest income and expense the company s efficiency ratio for was as compared to for and for the lower is better efficiency ratio indicates the percentage of operating costs that is used to generate each dollar of net revenue 
for example  during  cents were spent to generate each of net revenue 
net revenue is defined as net interest income  on a tax equivalent basis  plus other income less securities gains and costs of extinguishing debt 
noninterest income increased over  excluding security gains  costs of extinguishing debt and the gain from the sale of the streator branches 
continued growth in service charge income  improving trust and investment product revenues and higher mortgage related fee income helped offset declining  market sensitive earnings from corporate owned life insurance 
noninterest expense increased million or 
over higher compensation expense was offset by lower technology and related costs  intangible asset amortization  and remediation costs attributed to foreclosed real estate 
earnings performance net interest income the primary source of the company s traditional banking revenue is net interest income  which represents the difference between interest income and fees earned on loans  securities  and other earning assets and interest expense paid for the funding sources used to finance these assets 
changes in net interest income generally occur due to fluctuations in the volume of earning assets and paying liabilities and the rates earned and paid  respectively  on these assets and liabilities 
net interest margin represents net interest income as a percentage of total interest earning assets 
for purposes of this discussion  both net interest income and margin have been adjusted to a fully tax equivalent basis to more appropriately compare the returns on certain tax exempt loans and securities to those on taxable earning assets 
the accounting policies underlying the recognition of interest income on loans  securities  and other earning assets are presented in notes   and of notes to consolidated financial statements commencing on pages   and  respectively  of this form k

table effect of tax equivalent adjustment dollar amounts in thousands change net interest income tax equivalent adjustment tax equivalent net interest income net interest income on a tax equivalent basis decreased by in following a increase in over tax equivalent net interest margin was in as compared to in and in the decrease in net interest income is attributable to the reduction in tax equivalent interest earned on interest earning assets of million  exceeding the reduction in interest paid on interest bearing liabilities of million 
margin contraction resulted primarily from the repricing of earning assets in the low interest rate environment and the acceleration of cash flows due to refinance related repayments on mortgage backed securities

noninterest income noninterest income  exclusive of security gains  losses on the early extinguishment of debt  and gains realized from branch divestitures  increased by in from  following a decrease of in all major categories increased in  except for corporate owned life insurance income 
in  the lower interest rate environment  as well as weakened debt and equity markets  negatively impacted market sensitive revenue streams  such as trust revenue  corporate owned life insurance  and investment product fees derived from third party mutual funds and annuities 
these declines were partly offset by greater revenues derived from increased service charges on deposit accounts

service charges on deposit accounts represent the largest component of noninterest income and consists of fees on both interest bearing and noninterest bearing deposit accounts and fees related to checks drawn upon retail customer accounts with insufficient funds nsf fees 
service charges on deposit accounts include both hard dollar charges and charges assessed through account analysis  which are reduced by earnings credits indexed to a short term us treasury yield and applicable to business deposit accounts only 
service charges on deposit accounts increased million  or  as compared to the million increase in is primarily attributable to million in higher revenue resulting from an increase in items drawn on customer accounts with insufficient funds 
further contributing to the increase are higher service charges on business checking accounts due to greater transaction volumes combined with lower earnings credit paid thereon 
the increase of million in over was attributable to an increase in nsf fees as well as increases in service charges on business checking accounts 
the company provides trust and investment management services to its customers  acting as executor  administrator  trustee  agent  and in various other fiduciary capacities for client accounts 
by merging its stand alone trust company into the bank in  the bank is able to generate a more seamless integrated delivery of trust  investment management  and fiduciary services to its more extensive commercial and personal client base 
the amount of trust and investment management fees generally correlates to the amount of total assets under management  as well as conditions in the equity and debt markets  as fees on certain accounts are based on market value 
improved equity markets and strong sales efforts in helped increase the amount of assets under management 
assets under management and in nondiscretionary custody accounts totaled billion at december   up as compared to billion at december  in  the decline in fees was principally a result of a decline in the equity markets 
increases in other service charges  commissions  and fees in were driven primarily by increases in commissions on mortgage loan sales and sales of annuity  insurance  and investment products 
in  declines resulted from decreases in market sensitive official check commissions  insurance premiums earned  and alternative investment revenues  partly offset by an increase in commissions on mortgage loan originations 
the design of the insurance product offering in resulted in fewer insurance premiums earned as compared to that in card based fees consist of debit and credit card interchange fees charged for processing signature based transactions as well as various fees charged on both customer and non customer automated teller machine atm and point of sale transactions processed through the atm networks 
card based fees increased thousand in following a similar increase of thousand in from the increase in both and is attributable to higher volumes in debit card and point of sale transactions and reflects accelerated growth in debit card acceptance as the payment of choice over checks and cash 
as a result of the settlement in of the antitrust litigation brought against visa usa  inc  by various retail merchants  effective january  merchants may refuse to accept signature based debit card transactions  which may result in a reduction in interchange income for at this time  it is not possible to accurately predict the magnitude of this reduction since it will be driven by the individual practices and policies of the point of sale merchant 
management does not expect the impact of this reduction to be material

the increase in csv is primarily attributable to earnings credited to the policies  based on investments made by the insurers 
under applicable tax law  this increase in csv is not subject to federal taxation 
the tax equivalent yield on the coli was   and at december    and respectively 
the decline in yield since reflects a reduction in the earnings on investments made by the insurer and credited to the policies  which resulted primarily from shortening the maturity of those investments

the changes in effective income tax rate reflected in the table above are primarily attributable to changes in tax exempt income 
the reduction in the effective tax rate was principally driven by greater tax exempt income in as compared to and is a result of state and municipal securities purchases made during the year

table of contents portfolio composition the company s historical strategy has been to distribute its loan portfolio approximately evenly among the categories of commercial and industrial including agricultural  consumer including real estate family and real estate both commercial and construction 
the company also looks to maintain a diversified portfolio of corporate loans commercial and industrial  agricultural  commercial real estate and real estate construction that minimizes exposure to any particular industry segment 
this type of diversification spreads the risk and reduces the exposure to economic downturns that may occur in different segments of the economy or in different industries 
it is the company s policy to concentrate its lending activities in the geographic areas it serves  generally lending to consumers and small to mid sized businesses from whom deposits are gathered in the same market areas  with the primary concentration being the chicago suburban banking market 
although the company s legal lending limit approximates million  the largest loan outstanding to one borrower at year end was approximately million  with only borrowers having aggregate loans in excess of million 
in terms of both loans made and commitments to extend credit  the company s largest exposure to a single borrower is million and to a group of related companies comprising a single relationship is million 
the company had credits in the portfolio where total commitments to extend credit to a single borrower relationship exceed million

excluding family real estate loans  total loans at year end grew by commercial and industrial loans are diversified among industries and include loans to manufacturers  wholesalers  retailers  and service businesses 
consistent with the company s emphasis on relationship banking  most of these credits represent core  multi relationship customers of the company who usually also maintain deposit relationships and use other company banking services  such as cash management 
table on page of this form k provides a breakout of the company s corporate loan portfolio  including commercial and industrial loans  by industry segment and illustrates the diversity and granularity of the portfolio 
table on page of this form k summarizes the portfolio s maturities and interest rate sensitivity 
commercial and industrial loans totaled  million at december   as compared to million at december  for an increase of million  or 
although the covest acquisition contributed million  or  of the current year increase in commercial loans  the increase is principally due to a combination of loans made to new customers as well as increased outstandings to existing customers drawing on established lines of credit 
as illustrated in table  above  commercial and industrial loans have increased every year since this favorable trend reflects the company s interdisciplinary approach to commercial lending  as well as the company s tenure in its markets and in depth client knowledge 
as a result of improving economic conditions  the company has experienced  and anticipates continuing  expansion in the markets it serves  particularly in the north and southeast chicago suburban markets 
current commercial 
table of contents pipelines are positive  and the company expects that a continued expansion would generate a demand for additional loan growth 
real estate commercial loans  which increased by  or million  in  represent income producing commercial property loans  multi unit residential mortgages  and commercial real estate mortgages 
of the million increase  million represents loans acquired from covest 
of the commercial real estate loans acquired from covest  represent multi family loans made to real estate companies and individual investors to finance or refinance apartment buildings 
covest had developed a strong niche in this type of lending emphasizing adjustable rate yields and strong credit characteristics 
these loans are concentrated in the metropolitan and north suburban chicago area and typically represent apartment buildings ranging in size from five units up to twenty four units  although larger projects may range up to units or more 
the company feels that this type of lending helps diversify its existent  strong commercial and multifamily development real estate platform and affords a continuing opportunity for growth 
further analysis of the consumer nature of this portfolio may see it reclassified to the retail category for policy purposes 
excluding the amount of covest loans  real estate commercial loans increased by in  as compared to  reflecting the impact of higher prepayments and the s softer commercial real estate market 
growth in this category slowed following larger increases in this category during and  which  at that time  were reflective of the continuing significant demand for commercial properties in the suburban chicago market 
real estate construction loans grew by million  or  in these are primarily single family and multi family residential and non residential projects located in the company s primary markets 
real estate construction loans are a profitable line of lending for the company due to the higher level of interest rates and fees earned on such loans as compared to other loan categories and the favorable loss experience on these loans 
approximately of the increase was due to the acquisition of covest 
in addition  the loan growth experienced in and primarily resulted from continued strong demand for single family and family residential construction in the chicago banking market 
the strength of the suburban chicago real estate market over the past several years enabled real estate commercial and construction lending to grow to over one third of the company s total loans 
real estate commercial and construction lending has been an area of specialty for the company since its formation in the combination of seasoned  long time borrowers  experienced senior lending officers  management s focus on market fundamentals  and a stringent underwriting process has given the company a competitive market advantage 
these factors and a balanced exposure to any particular industry segment have reduced the company s exposure to loss through periods of economic downturn 
the company s loan loss experience for these two categories of lending is detailed in table on page of this form k 
consumer loans decreased million  or  in these loans consist of loans made directly to individuals for various personal purposes  as well as indirect installment loans represented mainly by automobile financings acquired from dealerships in the company s primary markets 
the decline in indirect lending has been significantly influenced by lower lending volumes  accelerated prepayments  and pricing competition resulting from zero percent financing promotions offered by automobile manufacturers 
this category also includes direct home equity loans and other direct installment loans 
the mix of credits within this lending category has shifted 
since the start of  promotional sales have increased home equity line balances by approximately million  or  in and million  or  in and effectively offset declines in indirect consumer loans 
real estate family loans are comprised predominately of owner occupied residential properties 
the company offers mortgage products through its branch network  but all administrative activities  including servicing  are outsourced to a third party vendor 
the company earns commissions from the origination of mortgage loans  which are then either retained for portfolio or sold in the secondary market by the outsourcing vendor 
real estate family loans totaled million as of december  and increased by over following a decrease of in from  due primarily to the acquisition of million in loans from covest 
excluding these loans  real estate family decreased by compared to due to the accelerated level of refinancing 
since  the company has elected not to retain a majority of its mortgage loan origination production in its portfolio  thereby accounting for the approximate decrease in and the decrease in distribution of corporate loans by industry table summarizes the company s ten largest industry segments for the corporate loan portfolio as of december  and portfolio analysis by industry segment provides useful insight as to credit exposure to any particular industry or market segment 
the effectiveness of such analysis  however  is limited to the extent that classification by segment requires that allocation of a customer s aggregate loans outstanding be based upon the nature of the borrower s ongoing business activity as opposed to the purpose of the collateral underlying an individual loan 
to the extent that a borrower s underlying 
table of contents business activity changes  classification differences will arise 
as a result  the company periodically reassesses and adjusts industry classifications

the company believes its loan portfolio is diversified across industries and market segments

this segment increased by million  or  from these segments are diversified among industries and by the tenants who are both owner occupiers of the real estate or third party lessees

table of contents credit quality management and reserve for loan losses the company s loan portfolios are subject to varying degrees of credit risk 
credit risk is mitigated through portfolio diversification  which limits exposure to any single industry or customer 
similarly  credit risk is also addressed through the establishment of a thorough system of internal controls  including standard lending and credit policies  underwriting criteria and collateral safeguards 
the company monitors and implements its formal credit policies and procedures and continues to evaluate the quality  trends  collectibility  and collateral protection within the loan portfolio 
the company s policy and procedures are reviewed and modified on an ongoing basis in order manage risk as conditions change and new credit products are offered 
the company s credit administration policies include a comprehensive loan rating system 
the internal loan review staff annually reviews at least of all corporate loans and commitments and all new loans and commitments in excess of million 
account officers are vested with the responsibility of monitoring their customer relationships and act as the first line of defense in determining changes in the loan ratings on credits for which they are responsible 
the company believes that any significant change in the overall quality of the loan portfolio will be reflected by these loan ratings within this monitoring system 
the company s senior managers actively review those loans that require some form of remediation 
those loans are reviewed at regular quarterly meetings between the credit administration staff and the account officers  and action plans are developed to either remedy any emerging problem loans or develop a specific plan for removing such loans from the portfolio 
such periodic reviews are then escalated for review by senior executive officers  including the chief executive officer 
during times of economic duress  the company has increased the frequency of these meetings 
the company maintains a reserve for loan losses to absorb probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the reserve for loan losses consists of three components i specific reserves established for any impaired commercial  real estate commercial  and real estate construction loan for which the recorded investment in the loan exceeds the measured value of the loan  ii reserves based on historical loan loss experience  and iii general reserves maintained to cover uncertainties that affect management s estimate of probable losses 
management evaluates the sufficiency of the reserve for loan losses based upon the combined total of the specific  historical loss and general components 
the accounting policies underlying the establishment and maintenance of the reserve for loan losses through provisions charged to operating expense are discussed in notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements commencing on pages and  respectively  of this form k 
table shows the allocation of the reserve for loan losses by loan category  as well as charge off and recovery information for the last years 
table offers expanded detail reflecting the allocation of the reserve for loan losses and as a percentage of total loans by category 
during  the company expanded its reserve assessment to fully allocate its general reserve component to specific pools or groups of loans  thereby better linking its assessment of the underlying risks attributed to each loan category 
to facilitate comparison  s allocation by category has been restated to reflect this change in methodology 
data presented for periods prior to was not restated due to the absence of sufficient  comparable data 
as of december   the reserve for loan losses totaled million as compared to million and million at the end of and  respectively 
the ratio of reserve for loan losses to total loans at year end was  down from at year end and at the end of the increase in overall reserve is due to the purchase of million of loan loss reserves and million in loans from covest on december  as detailed in table  the acquired loan loss reserves represented of the loans purchased 
as a part of its due diligence process  the company undertook a thorough review and assessment of covest s written underwriting practices  loan origination procedures  delinquent and problem loan classification  and remediation process 
in addition  covest s methodology  risk assessment practices  and the underlying components used in establishing the sufficiency of its reserve for loan losses were reviewed  and covest s outsourced loan review function and the most recent regulatory examination findings were assessed 
based upon the results of this review  the company believes the level of the acquired reserves to be adequately valued 
the provision for loan losses decreased in to million compared to million in and million in the provision for loan losses exceeded the year s net charge offs by million 
total loans charged off  net of recoveries  were million  or of average loans  in and million  or of average loans  in gross charge offs declined in to million from million in and million in the lower level of charge offs in primarily benefited from a tightening of the underwriting standards for the indirect lending portfolio in 
table of contents as the economy weakened 
in addition  the level of corporate charge offs in and were elevated as the company recognized the weakening economy and adopted an aggressive problem loan identification and charge off strategy 
in  allocation of the company s reserve to the commercial and industrial  real estate commercial  and real estate construction categories increased as compared to  due in large part to comparatively higher exposures to single borrowers and portfolio growth amid concerns relative to the continuing level of economic weakness 
the growth in the commercial reserve allocation was also caused by an increase in specific reserves relating to the higher level of impaired loans 
further  the increased reserve allocation to the real estate commercial and construction categories reflected the higher incremental reserve allocation for the loan portfolio acquired from covest 
these category increases were partly offset by improved delinquency and charge off trends in all corporate lending areas 
reserve allocations to the consumer loan portfolio decreased in relation to due to improved delinquency and charge off trends

nonperforming assets nonperforming assets includes loans for which the accrual of interest has been discontinued  loans for which the terms have been renegotiated to provide for a reduction or deferral of interest and principal due to a weakening of the borrower s financial condition  and real estate that has been acquired primarily through foreclosure and is awaiting disposition 
for a detailed discussion on the company s policy on accrual of interest on loans see note of notes to consolidated financial statements commencing on page of this form k

these loans are expected to return to performing status by the end of the first quarter of as a result of sustained borrower performance under the restructured terms 
at december   the company did not have any commitments to lend additional funds to borrowers with restructured loans 
nonaccrual loans at december  totaled million  compared with million and million at year end and  respectively 
the million increase in total nonperforming loans in reflected an increase of million in nonperforming commercial and industrial and real estate construction loans partially offset by a decrease of million in real estate commercial 
the increase in nonperforming commercial and industrial and real estate construction loans was principally due to million of nonaccruing loans acquired from covest 
the loans acquired were comprehensively reviewed by the company and deemed to be appropriately valued 
the ratio of the reserve for loan losses to nonperforming loans at year end was  down from s historical high of 
in addition to the loans summarized in table  on december   the company had millions of loans that are now performing  but where the company had some concern with the ability of the borrower to comply with present loan repayment terms 
this increased from million at year end these loans continue to perform under existing

the classification of these loans  however  does not imply that management expects losses on these loans but rather that a higher level of scrutiny is prudent under the circumstances 
such classifications relate to concerns specific to a given borrower and do not relate to any concentrated risk elements common to all loans in this category 
the increase in s classification stems in large part from the acquisition of the covest portfolio on december   as well as management s concerns about the stability of the economy 
funding and liquidity management liquidity management is the ability to provide funding sources at a minimum cost to meet fluctuating deposit  withdrawal  and loan demand needs 
the company s liquidity policy establishes parameters as to how liquidity should be managed to maintain flexibility in responding to changes in liquidity needs over a month forward period  including the requirement to formulate a quarterly liquidity compliance plan for review by the bank s board of directors 
the compliance plan includes a recorded analysis that measures projected needs to purchase and sell funds 
inherent in the analysis is a set of projected balance sheet assumptions that are updated quarterly throughout the year 
based on such assumptions  the company determines its total cash liquidity on hand and adds to that position excess collateral capacity from pledging  unused federal funds purchased lines  and other unused borrowing capacity such as federal home loan bank advances  resulting in a calculation of the company s total liquidity capacity 
the company s total policy directed liquidity requirement is of total sources demand deposits  interest bearing transactions deposits  retail time deposits  other borrowings  and other liabilities and equity less pledged deposits 
based upon the company s projections as of december   the company expects to have net excess liquidity capacity  based upon policy guidelines  for the forward twelve month period

as shown in table  average deposits for totaled billion  representing an increase of million  or  in and followed an increase of in over average transactional deposits increased by million  or  over while average time deposits declined by million  or 
the shift in deposit mix was driven by a combination of pricing and promotional strategies employed throughout and on december   the company acquired million in deposits from covest  of which are transactional deposits 
given the year end acquisition date of the transaction  these balances did not influence average balances 

table of contents the pricing strategies in  the overall low level of interest rates in and  and instability in the equity markets have combined to create an incentive for customers seeking liquidity to shift balances to transactional accounts as opposed to shorter and longer term time deposits 
as equity markets stabilize or interest rates increase  management expects that customer liquidity preferences will change and some portion of transactional balances will revert to time deposits as influenced by then existent pricing and competition

in a separate transaction  this funding was replaced with federal home loan bank advances having a weighted maturity of months and a weighted cost of the company s net interest income totaled million for the fourth quarter of  in line with the prior year s fourth quarter of million 
net interest margin for the fourth quarter of was  down from a year ago  but up from in the third quarter of as expected  the company s margin improved from the prior quarter primarily due to improved yields on mortgage backed securities and benefits realized from retiring and redeploying federal home loan bank advances at lower interest rates 
the company also incurred million in interest expense stemming from the million trust preferred issuance 
total loans at december  were higher than at december   primarily due to loans acquired as part of the covest acquisition 
excluding the million in loans the company acquired from covest  total loans increased approximately over as loans in all categories experienced growth  except family real estate and indirect consumer lending 
total loans  excluding covest  increased on a linked quarter basis and represented on an annualized basis 
excluding covest  commercial loan growth on a linked quarter basis was and year over year for average deposits for the fourth quarter increased from the prior year s fourth quarter by  primarily due to growth in transactional accounts demand  savings  now  and money market accounts 
compared to the fourth quarter of  transactional deposits increased  largely due to targeted pricing and promotional efforts 
noninterest income for the fourth quarter of totaled million  including the million gain realized from the sale of the streator branches and million in losses created by the early retirement of federal home loan bank advances 
excluding these transactions  noninterest income for fourth quarter was million  a slight increase from the million earned in the prior year s fourth quarter 
service charges on deposit accounts  commissions earned from the sale of third party investment products and trust income all increased in fourth quarter when compared to the prior year s fourth quarter 
this increase was partly offset by lower income from corporate owned life insurance  mortgage related sales commissions and debit card revenues 
noninterest income was relatively stable on a linked quarter basis after excluding debt retirement and securities gains and losses from both periods 
total noninterest expense for the fourth quarter of increased from the prior year s fourth quarter and increased for full year from on a linked quarter basis  noninterest expense was essentially unchanged 
nonperforming loans at december  totaled million  representing of total outstanding loans 
this ratio is up from the september  level of and a historically low level of as of december  as anticipated in pre acquisition due diligence  nonperforming loans include million of nonaccruing loans acquired from covest 
nonperforming loans also include million of loans restructured by the company that are expected to return to performing status by the end of the first quarter of as the result of sustained borrower performance under the restructured terms 
nonperforming assets totaled million at december  loans past due days decreased by to million on a linked quarter basis 
net charge offs for the fourth quarter and full year of were and of average loans  respectively  down from and for the fourth quarter and full year of  respectively 
provisions for loan losses for the fourth quarter of fully covered net charge offs  resulting in the company maintaining its ratio of the reserve for loan losses to total loans at the close of the fourth quarter of at 
loan loss reserves acquired as a part of the covest acquisition totaled million and represented of the loans acquired 
the reserve for loan losses at december  represented of nonperforming loans as compared to the historically high level of at year end

qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments due to changes in interest rates  exchange rates  and equity prices 
interest rate risk is the company s primary market risk and is the result of repricing  basis  and option risk 
repricing risk represents timing mismatches in the company s ability to alter contractual rates earned on financial assets or paid on liabilities in response to market interest rates 
basis risk refers to the potential for changes in the underlying relationship between market rates or indices  which subsequently result in a narrowing of the spread earned on a loan or investment relative to its cost of funds 
option risk arises from the embedded options present in many financial instruments such as loan prepayment options or deposit early withdrawal options 
these provide customers opportunities to take advantage of directional changes in rates and could have an adverse impact on the company s margin performance 
the company seeks to achieve consistent growth in net interest income and net income while managing volatility that arises from shifts in interest rates 
the company s asset and liability management committee alco oversees financial risk management by developing programs to measure and manage interest rate risks within authorized limits set by the company s board of directors 
alco also approves the company s asset liability management policies  oversees the formulation and implementation of strategies to improve balance sheet positioning and earnings  and reviews the company s interest rate sensitivity position 
management uses net interest income and economic value of equity simulation modeling tools to analyze and capture near term and longer term interest rate exposures 
net interest income represents the company s primary tool for measuring interest rate sensitivity 
net interest income simulation analysis measures the sensitivity of net interest income to various interest rate movements and balance sheet structures 
the simulation is based on actual cash flows and repricing characteristics for on and off balance sheet instruments and incorporates market based assumptions regarding the effect of changing interest rates on the prepayment rates of certain assets and liabilities 
the simulation includes management projections for activity levels in each of the product lines offered by the company 
assumptions based upon the historical behavior of deposit rates and balances in relation to interest rates are also incorporated into the simulation 
these assumptions are inherently uncertain 
as a result  the simulation cannot precisely measure net interest income or precisely predict the impact of the fluctuation in interest rates on net interest income 
actual results will differ from simulated results due to timing  magnitude  and frequency of interest rate changes  as well as changes in market conditions and management strategies 
the company monitors and manages interest rate risk within approved policy limits 
the simulation model assesses the magnitude of changes in net interest income resulting from changes in interest rates over both a month horizon and uses multiple rate scenarios 
these scenarios include  but are not limited to  a flat or unchanged rate environment  a most likely forecast which the company believes to be the most probable outlook  a graduated increase and decrease of basis points that occurs in equal steps over a six month time horizon  and immediate increases and decreases of and basis points 
the company s current interest rate risk policy limits are determined by measuring the change in net interest income over a month horizon assuming a significant basis point graduated increase in all interest rate limits 
current policy limits this exposure to plus or minus of the anticipated level of net interest income over the corresponding month horizon assuming no change in current interest rates 
the company s month net interest income sensitivity profile as of year end and is as follows 
analysis of net interest income sensitivity dollar amounts in thousands gradual change in rates immediate change in rates december  dollar change percent change december  dollar change percent change reflects an assumed uniform change in interest rates that occurs in equal steps over a six month horizon 
due to the low level of interest rates as of year end and  management s judgment was used to set reasonable levels of change in the yield curve and establish  where appropriate  interest rate floors for select interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 

table of contents as of december   the company s interest rate sensitivity profile  assuming a gradual change in rates  was more positive in rising interest rate scenarios and more negative in falling rate scenarios than the profile that existed as of december  the change in profile results from a combination of the federal reserve s basis point reduction in the federal fund target rate in june  continuing low interest rates  faster prepayments than in prior years  and changing management strategies as to cash flow reinvestment 
the lower level of interest rates further limits the company s ability to reprice its interest bearing deposit accounts in falling interest rate scenarios and increases sensitivity to falling rates on a comparative basis 
since alco has deemed the risk to a basis point decline in rates to be unlikely  the bank s board has authorized operation beyond policy in this area 
in addition  balance sheet strategies as of december  have been modified from december  to reflect both actual and planned efforts to reduce exposure to rising rates through liability extensions and security reinvestment into shorter duration instruments 
in addition to the simulation analysis  management uses an economic value of equity sensitivity technique to capture the risk in both short and long term positions and to study the impact of long term cash flows on earnings and capital 
economic value of equity involves discounting present values of expected cash flows on all assets  liabilities  and off balance sheet contracts under different interest rate scenarios 
the discounted present value of all cash flows represents the company s economic value of equity 
economic value of equity does not represent the true fair value of asset  liability  or derivative positions because factors such as credit risk  liquidity risk  and the impact of future changes to the balance sheet are not considered 
the company s policy guidelines call for preventative measures to be taken in the event that an immediate increase or decrease in interest rates of basis points is estimated to reduce the economic value of equity by more than 
analysis of economic value of equity dollar amounts in thousands immediate change in rates december  dollar change percent change december  dollar change percent change the sensitivity of the company s economic value of equity to changing interest rates has changed significantly in comparison to as a result of accelerated mortgage backed security cash flows and the balance sheet restructuring and positioning strategies executed during to mitigate the company s exposure to higher interest rates 
while the reinvestment of mortgage backed security cash flows increased the company s sensitivity to rising rates  this impact was offset by the execution of certain liability lengthening strategies as well as changes made to the assumed maturity characteristics of demand and now accounts to better reflect historical trends 
strategies designed to lengthen liabilities executed during included longer term time deposit pricing and promotion  the purchase of longer dated brokered certificates of deposit  the retirement and re extension of fhlb borrowings  and the issuance of long term debt from trust preferred securities 
in the combination  these activities reduced the sensitivity of the economic value of equity to rising rates from but reversed its sensitivity to falling rates from a positive impact in to a negative impact in the company s current net interest income sensitivity  as measured over a month horizon  is more positively impacted in a rising rate environment as compared to december  and its longer term risk position  as measured by the economic value of equity  is less negatively impacted by rising rates 
while the company s balance sheet and net interest income remains vulnerable to an immediate decrease in interest rates  alco has deemed the risk of an immediate and extended decline in interest rates to be low given the current rate environment 
rather  given the negative impact of rising interest rates on the economic value of equity and anticipating the longer term trend in rates to be upward  alco continues to believe it prudent to evaluate and consider balance sheet strategies designed to reduce longer term exposure to rising rates 
overall  the company believes that its current balance sheet structure and net interest income performance is less vulnerable to increasing interest rates as compared to the condition that existed at year end conversely  the company s balance sheet and net interest income is more vulnerable to an immediate decrease in interest rates than it was at the year end due to the low level of interest rates 
as part of its approach to controlling the interest rate risk within its balance sheet  the company has utilized derivative instruments specifically interest rate swaps with third parties in order to limit volatility in net interest income 
the advantages of using such interest rate derivatives include minimization of balance sheet leverage resulting in lower capital requirements as compared to cash instruments  the ability to maintain or increase liquidity  and the opportunity to customize 
table of contents the interest rate swap to meet desired risk parameters 
the accounting policies underlying the treatment of derivative financial instruments in the consolidated statements of condition and income of the company are described in notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements commencing on pages and  respectively  of this form k 
interest rate swap transactions involve exchanges of fixed and floating rate interest payments without the exchange of the underlying notional ie  principal amount on which the interest payments are calculated 
when the interest rate swap has been appropriately designated as a hedge  the net cash flow paid or received by the company on these transactions is treated as an adjustment to interest income and expense on the underlying earning asset or funding source to which the swap relates 
a risk associated with interest rate swap transactions is credit risk  defined as the ability of the swap counterparty to perform its interest payment obligation under the terms of the agreement 
credit risk on interest rate swap transactions consists of the aggregate net interest payable to the company by the counterparty in addition to the aggregate unrealized gain on the swap position 
the company controls this credit risk by reviewing each counterparty for creditworthiness prior to entering into transactions and maintaining a policy limiting credit exposure to any one counterparty to not more than of consolidated stockholders equity 
in addition  the company s interest rate swap transactions require the establishment of a mutual mark to market arrangement whereby cash collateral is required to be on deposit with the company and or the counterparty  depending upon the existing net settlement position 
the company does not act as an intermediary in arranging interest rate swaps for customers 
as of december  and  the company had total interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of million and million in place  respectively  hedging various balance sheet categories 
the specific terms of the interest rate swaps outstanding as of december  and are discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements commencing on page of this form k
