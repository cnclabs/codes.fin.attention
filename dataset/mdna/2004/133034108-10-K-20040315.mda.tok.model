this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements  notes to consolidated financial statements and selected consolidated financial data 
executive summary the company  as a diversified financial services provider  pursues a strategy of achieving long term sustainable growth without sacrificing profitability 
the primary business of the company and its subsidiaries is to attract deposits from consumer  institutional  non profit and commercial customers and to extend loans to consumer  institutional  non profit and commercial customers 
the company s earnings are supplemented by investment income while the company s source of funds are supplemented by external borrowings from the brokered cd market and the federal home loan bank system 
the company also offers investment management services to its customers through acadia trust  na  a wholly owned non depository trust company  and acadia financial consultants  which provide brokerage services as a division of the two banking subsidiaries 
the primary businesses of the company have many inherent risks which are outlined within this form k  and include risks due to losses on loans not being repaid or credit risks  interest rate risks arising from the possibility of the company s interest bearing assets and liabilities being misaligned  as well as other exposure to national and local economic conditions 
management has created numerous processes to monitor and mitigate these risks based on various assumptions and actions  which if were changed or altered  could result in different earnings for the company 
the company reported earnings of million for  compared to million in as a result of several events  of which the most significant include the historic low interest rate environment  improved asset quality of the company in general  but more specifically within its unitedkingfield bank subsidiary  and  as part of the company s effort to continually assess the profitability of its products and services  the exiting of two major product offerings 
during  the company continued to look for ways to enhance its customer value proposition and at the same time improve efficiencies 
providing customers with more cost effective products and services is essential in growing the company s assets and increasing non interest income 
as a result  the company s bank subsidiaries sold their consumer credit card portfolios  and acadia trust  na outsourced the administration processing of its employee benefit services 
the company also continued to pursue methods of enhancing products and services in an effort to grow deposits and expand non interest income using new technologies 
net interest income represents the company s major revenue source  therefore  to protect the company s major income stream  the growth of earning assets is extremely important 
low interest rates fueled record residential mortgage refinance activity and significant increases in home equity lending  which combined with the expansion of the company s commercial line of business  resulted in loan growth of from december  to december  while the historic low interest rate environment resulted in higher loan volumes  the rates on those loans were significantly lower than existing loans 
furthermore  many of the company s investments that matured  paid down  or were called during  and were replaced with investments at much lower rates 
conversely  the low interest rate environment allowed the company to reduce the rates of interest paid on its deposits as well as its borrowings 
however  the reduction in interest expense was less than as the reduction in the company s interest income  which resulted in a compression of its net interest margin 
the increase in the company s total earning asset base helped to offset the decrease in the company s net interest margin 
the company continues to evaluate the possibilities of expansion into new markets through both de novo expansion and acquisitions 
in the interim  the company is focused on maximizing the potential for growth in existing markets  especially in markets where the company has less of a presence 
the financial services industry continues to experience consolidations through mergers that could create opportunities for the company to promote its value 

table of contents the company will continue to be faced with uncertainties in the future  and management believes that the discussion and financial information that follows more fully describes management s initiatives taken during and supports its objective of creating sustainable long term growth for the company

review of financial statements the discussion and analysis which follows focuses on the factors affecting the company s consolidated results of operations for the years ended december   and and financial condition at december  and the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements in item should be read in conjunction with this review 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition are based on the consolidated financial statements  which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of such financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates  including those related to the allowance for loan and lease losses alll and accounting for acquisitions and the related review of goodwill and intangible assets for impairment 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis in making judgments about the carrying values of assets that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from the amount derived from management s estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
allowance for loan and lease losses 
in preparing the consolidated financial statements  the alll requires the most significant amount of management estimates and assumptions 
management regularly evaluates the alll for adequacy by taking into consideration factors such as prior loan loss experience  the character and size of 
table of contents the loan portfolio  business and economic conditions and management s estimation of probable losses 
the use of different estimates or assumptions could produce different provisions for loan and lease losses which would effect the earnings of the company 
a smaller provision for loan and lease losses results in higher net income and when a greater amount of provisions for loan and lease losses is necessary the result is lower net income 
monthly  the corporate risk management group reviews the alll with the board of directors for each bank subsidiary 
on a quarterly basis  a more in depth review of the alll  including the methodology for calculating and allocating the alll  is reviewed with the company s board of directors  as well as the board of directors for each subsidiary bank 
please see allowance for loan and lease losses provisions for loan losses and certain factors affecting future operating results our allowance for loan and lease losses may not be adequate to cover actual loan losses for more information 
periodically the company acquires property in connection with foreclosures or in satisfaction of debt previously contracted 
the valuation of this property is accounted for individually at the lower of the book value of the loan satisfied or its net realizable value on the date of acquisition 
at the time of acquisition  if the net realizable value of the property is less than the book value of the loan  a change  or reduction in the alll  is recorded 
if the value of the property becomes permanently impaired  as determined by an appraisal or an evaluation in accordance with the company s appraisal policy  the company will record the decline by showing a charge against current earnings 
upon acquisition of a property valued at  or more  a current appraisal or a broker s opinion must substantiate market value for the property 
mortgage servicing rights 
servicing assets are recognized as separate assets when servicing rights are acquired through sale of residential mortgage assets 
capitalized servicing rights are reported in other assets and are amortized into non interest income in proportion to  and over the period of  the estimated future net servicing income of the underlying financial residential mortgage assets 
servicing assets are evaluated for impairment based upon the fair value of the rights as compared to amortized costs 
fair value is determined based upon discounted cash flows using market based assumptions 
in periods of falling market interest rates  accelerated loan prepayment speeds can adversely impact the fair value of these mortgage servicing rights relative to their book value 
in the event that the fair value of these assets were to increase in the future  the company can recognize the increased fair value to the extent of the impairment allowance but cannot recognize an asset in excess of its amortized book value 
when the book value exceeds the fair value  an impairment of these servicing assets  as a result of changes in observable market data relating to market interest rates  loan prepayment speeds  and other factors  could impact the company s financial condition and results of operations either positively or adversely 
management has engaged  on a quarterly basis  a recognized third party to evaluate the valuation of the company s mortgage servicing rights asset 
valuation of acquired assets and liabilities 
management utilizes numerous techniques to estimate the value of various assets held by the company 
as previously discussed  management utilized various methods to determine the appropriate carrying value of goodwill as required under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
in addition  goodwill from a purchase acquisition is subject to ongoing periodic impairment tests 
goodwill is evaluated for impairment using several standard valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analyses  as well as an estimation of the impact of business conditions 
different estimates or assumptions are also utilized to determine the appropriate carrying value of other assets including  but not limited to  property  plant and equipment  overall collectibility of loans and receivables 
the use of different estimates or assumptions could produce different estimates of carrying value 
management prepares the valuation analyses  which are then reviewed by the board of directors of the company 
interest income recognition 
interest on loans is included in income as earned based upon interest rates applied to unpaid principal 
interest is not accrued on loans days or more past due unless they are adequately secured and in the process of collection or on other loans when management believes collection is doubtful 
all loans considered impaired are non accruing 
interest on non accruing loans is recognized as income when the ultimate collectibility of interest is no longer considered doubtful 
when a loan is placed on non accrual status  all interest previously accrued  but not collected  is reversed against current period interest income  therefore  an increase in loans on non accrual status reduces interest income 
if a loan is removed from non accrual status  all previously unrecognized interest is collected and recorded as interest income 

table of contents results of operations comparison of to overview the company reported net income of million  or per diluted share  for compared to million and per diluted share in return on average assets was in compared to in and return on average shareholders equity was in compared to in the improved results were primarily a function of improved asset quality at unitedkingfield  which resulted in a provision benefit of  in compared to provision expense of million in the company also recorded a gain of  as a result of the sale of its consumer credit card business to elan financial services in  compared to a million gain the company recorded in as a result of the sales of its merchant credit card business 
net interest income net interest income accounted for of total revenues for the company  and is the company s largest source of revenue 
net interest income reflects revenues generated through income from earning assets plus loan fees  less interest paid on interest bearing deposits and borrowings 
net interest income was million on a fully taxable equivalent basis in compared to million in  an increase of 
the company s level of net interest income fluctuates over time for three primary reasons 
first  interest earned from earning assets and expenses from interest bearing deposits and borrowings fluctuate due to changes in interest rates 
this is referred to as the yield or rate component of net interest income 
second  net interest income changes due to the amount of earning assets the company maintains as well as the amount of non interest bearing deposits  interest bearing deposits  and borrowings the company holds 
this is referred to as the volume component of net interest income 
finally  net interest income fluctuates as a result of the change over time in the components of earning assets  non interest bearing deposits  interest bearing deposits and borrowings 
this is referred to as the mix component of net interest income 
it is the company s goal to maximize net interest income by providing competitive products to its customers that  within various risk parameters  maximize interest income while minimizing interest expense 
management uses several analytical models  including those illustrated by tables below  to assess and monitor those factors that affect net interest income and to assess the company s performance in meeting its goals and to determine future strategies 
during  overall interest rates in the united states were at year lows  as highlighted by a federal funds discount rate of at december  this affected the company s net interest income in several ways 
first and foremost  the company s interest bearing assets  which are contractually allowed to reprice based on various benchmarks such as prime rate and the london inter bank offer rate libor  resulted in a reduction in gross revenues these products are also referred to as variable or floating rate instruments as these benchmarks declined in second  as a result of the historically low interest rate environment and  the company operating in a highly competitive marketplace  interest rates on new loans were also lower than previously experienced 
the company was able to partially compensate for the reduction in revenues due to these factors by lowering the interest rate it paid on various deposit products 
third  while amortization and pay off of existing loans and investments were experienced during the year  those funds were either used to fund additional loans or reinvested in securities  each of which earned lower rates of interest than in previous years due to the historic low interest rate environment 
fourth  the company also experienced historically high levels of residential mortgage activity during as a result of the level of interest rates 
this activity resulted in higher than normal levels of interest income  loan fees  gains and losses from the sales of those mortgages 
management does not expect residential mortgage activity in to reach levels 
finally  numerous customers refinanced to a lower interest rate various debt obligations they had with company  which in turn lowered the interest income the company earned 
many fixed rate products the company offers contain pre payment penalties  but other products  such as residential mortgages  do not 
during  residential mortgages increased million  or  commercial loans increased million  
table of contents or  and consumer loans including home equities increased million  or  during the company also benefited from revenues from interest rate swap agreements  which were entered into in early as a hedge against falling interest rates 
as rates fell  revenues from the interest rate swap increased to  in from  in investments in us government securities  us government agency securities and highly rated corporate bonds are used by the company to diversify its revenues as well as provide interest rate risk and credit risk diversification 
the company periodically uses interest rate swaps  floors and caps  which are common derivative financial instruments  to hedge interest rate risk associated with its loan and investment portfolios as well as its deposit and borrowing strategies 
note  financial instruments  of the notes to consolidated financial statements  included in item  and the market risk section  included in item  should be reviewed for further discussion of the company s derivative and market risk strategies 
during  interest income on the company s investment portfolio decreased million primarily due to the decrease in yields and a decrease in the size of the portfolio 
during and  the company was a party to interest rate swap agreements that were a component of the company s strategy to protect a portion of its interest income revenue stream against a decreasing interest rate environment 
these instruments contributed  to interest income in and  in the increase in can be attributed to the decline in the prime rate  which resulted in an increase in the company s net interest income from the interest rate swap agreements 
interest rate swap agreements involve risks associated with counterparties to the agreements and their abilities to meet the contractual terms of the agreements  as well as risks associated with a changing interest rate environment 
notional principal amounts are used to reflect the volume of these transactions  but credit risks associated with these agreements are limited to the forecasted payment stream expected from counterparties 
the company s counterparties to these agreements had an investment grade rating by moody s and standard and poor s rating agencies 
these instruments involve only the exchange of fixed and variable rate interest payments based upon a notional principal amount and maturity date 
the company s notional value of derivative financial instruments was million on december  and note  financial instruments  of the notes to consolidated financial statements  included in item  should be reviewed for further discussion of derivative instruments

non performing loans are examined on an individual basis to determine the estimated probable loss on these loans 
in addition  the ongoing evaluation process includes a formal analysis of the alll each quarter  which considers  
table of contents among other factors  the current loan mix and loan volumes  loan growth  management s ongoing review of individual loans  trends in the level of criticized or classified assets  an evaluation of results of examinations by regulatory authorities  analyses of historical trends in charge off and delinquencies  and business and economic conditions affecting each loan category 
the use of different estimates or assumptions could produce different provisions for loan and lease losses 
although management uses available information to establish the appropriate level of the alll  no assurance can be given  that adverse economic conditions or other circumstances will not result in increased losses in the portfolio 
the company continues to monitor and modify its alll as conditions dictate see item  note  allowance for loan losses  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the methodology for calculating the alll involves significant judgment 
first and foremost  it involves the early identification of credits that are deteriorating 
second  it involves management judgment to derive loss factors 
the company uses a risk rating system to determine the credit quality of its loans 
loans are reviewed for information affecting the obligor s ability to fulfill its obligations 
in assessing the risk rating of a particular loan  management makes certain assumptions  including the obligor s debt capacity and financial flexibility  the level of the obligor s earnings  the amount and sources of repayment  the level and nature of contingencies  and with commercial loans consideration has to be given to management strength  and the industry and geography in which the obligor operates 
these factors are based on an evaluation of historical information  as well as subjective assessment and interpretation 
emphasizing one factor over another or considering additional factors that may be relevant in determining the risk rating of a particular loan  but which are not currently an explicit part of the company s methodology  could impact the risk rating assigned by the company to that loan 
wherever possible  the company uses independent  verifiable data or the company s own historical loss experience in its models for estimating these loss factors 
many factors can affect management s estimates of specific loss and expected loss  including volatility of default probabilities  rating migrations and loss severity 
there are judgments as to which external data should be used  and when it should be used 
choosing data that is not reflective of the company s specific loan portfolio characteristics could affect loss estimates 
during  the company reversed  of expense to the allowance for loan and lease losses compared to recognizing expense of million and million in and  respectively 
provisions are made to the alll in order to maintain the alll at a level which management believes is reasonable and reflective of the overall risk of loss inherent in the loan portfolio 
during  non performing assets decreased from million or of total loans at december  to million or of total loans at december  in addition  the company s ratio of alll to non performing assets improved to in from in even with significant loan growth 
the alll quarterly analysis is done at the bank subsidiaries and during the fourth quarter of several large credits that had specific reserves were resolved and resulted a lower required alll 
the  recovery of provision is reflective of the changes in specific reserves and various improvements made in the quality of the loan portfolios at both banks during most notably  there was substantial improvement made to the overall quality of the loan portfolio during as the company s corporate risk management group actively addressed asset quality issues at unitedkingfield that resulted in a higher quality loan portfolio at december  the determination of an appropriate level of alll  and subsequent provision for loan and lease losses  which would affect earnings  is based on management s judgment of the adequacy of the reserve based on analysis of various economic factors and review of the company s loan portfolio  which may change due to numerous factors including loan growth  payoffs of lower quality loans  recoveries on previously charge off loans  improvement in the financial condition of the borrowers  risk rating downgrades upgrades and charge offs 
management believes that the alll at december  of million  or  of total loans outstanding was appropriate given the current economic conditions in the company s service area and the improved condition of the loan portfolio as a result of efforts made during to address issues and improve the company s collateral position in credits identified as problems
