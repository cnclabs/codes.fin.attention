item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations organization of information management s discussion and analysis provides a narrative on the company s financial performance and condition that should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
it includes the following sections overview consolidated results vs 
vs 
business segment results liquidity and capital resources contractual obligations  commitments and off balance sheet arrangements critical accounting policies and estimates forward looking statements overview lesco is the largest provider of products to the professional turf care segment of the green industry 
the professional users of our products include lawn care and landscape firms and the employees of a variety of commercial  governmental  institutional and industrial establishments  including golf courses  sod farms  airports  cemeteries  professional sports organizations  universities  schools  commercial properties and numerous other organizations that use in house employees to maintain lawns and gardens 
we track our customers through two customer sectors lawn care and golf 
gross sales for these sectors were as follows for the past three years dollars in millions lawn care golf the separation of our customers into these two sectors is important as distribution to the sectors is markedly different and their growth prospects vary significantly 
our lawn care sector includes all non golf related customers and is dominated by lawn care and landscape firms 
historically  distribution of products into this sector has been fragmented and inefficient 
we believe that our model of service centers and direct sales provides efficiency to the sector s distribution channels through easily accessible  strategically positioned real estate where we provide agronomic expertise 
table of contents through our service centers and direct sales associates with products specifically targeted to the lawn care sector 
we believe we proved our model s effectiveness by generating million of sales through our new service centers opened in we estimate the market for our lawn care products at billion  and independent research indicates that organic growth in the sector is expected to exceed annually for the next several years due to the aging of the baby boomers and their increasing desire to contract lawn care professionals  the higher number of two income families and continued time constraints on consumers 
the golf industry is a smaller market estimated at billion and is not expected to grow significantly during the near future  nor do we believe our opportunities are as great in this sector as those in the lawn care sector 
additionally  the industry has experienced a decline in annual rounds of golf being played  which has decreased the budgets of golf course superintendents 
the ability to capture incremental market share is limited as distribution of our products to the golf industry is dominated by a few national and regional distributors 
we anticipate that we will be able to expand our presence in under serviced markets  but we are not planning any major expansion of stores on wheels or direct golf sales in the near future 
our historical financial performance and returns on invested capital through were unacceptable 
based upon the opportunities that were available in our customer sectors and opportunities for improvement in our financial performance  beginning in early we embarked on a strategy to reposition lesco in order to effectively capitalize on our opportunities 
the following is a summary of the changes we made  along with their financial impacts  if any executive changes beginning in late through mid  lesco hired a new executive officer team 
our new team has set a revised strategy for the company based upon high growth  high return opportunities 
the financial metrics used to evaluate opportunities are sales growth and return on invested capital roic 
during  we recorded a million pre tax severance charge for executive  senior and middle management terminations 
asset rationalization during  we performed an analysis of our manufacturing facilities  utilizing a methodology balancing sales growth opportunities and roic  and decided to rationalize certain under performing assets 
the plan included ceasing operations at  and deciding to sell  two manufacturing facilities a methylene urea facility in disputanta  virginia and a blending facility in stockton  california and the sale of certain other properties 
in conjunction with the announcement of the asset rationalization plan  we recorded a million pre tax charge to provide for the planned disposition of the properties 
the disputanta facility was sold in october the other rationalized facilities remain as assets held for sale as of december  inventory product life cycle program lesco historically did not have an effective means of disposing of discontinued inventory 
as such  we implemented a product life cycle program which requires all stock keeping units skus to be identified into one of five categories active  watch  phase out  discontinued and liquidated 
under the program  the selling price of skus identified as discontinued are progressively marked down to zero and liquidated 
for financial reporting purposes  the products are marked down to estimated net realizable value when identified as discontinued 
in june  in preparation for conversion to the program  we identified  skus for liquidation and recorded a million pre tax markdown charge 
during the second half of  we liquidated the markdown product and permanently purged the skus from our system 
properly executed  the product life cycle program should assure that  in the future  we mitigate the accumulation of discontinued skus 
launch of sales growth programs during the second half of  we launched three programs designed to increase sales a 
selling locations  management structure and reporting in  we reorganized the selling locations through the creation of five geographic zones northeast  mid central  transition  southeast and west and a national accounts zone 
the geographic zones are comprised of regional geographic areas 
additionally  we developed separate operating statements four wall p ls for each selling location see further discussion business segment results and note to consolidated financial statements 
the restructured management structure and four wall p ls provide the requisite 
table of contents management oversight and reporting to effectively identify and address geographic operational opportunities 
b 
new service center program lesco had not opened new service centers since our analysis of service center four wall p ls and four wall roic indicated that with a total capital and working capital investment of  to  an average service center at maturity generates approximately million of sales and a roic of approximately 
we  thereafter  performed a statistical analysis utilizing historical service center operating performance  published industry data and government data relative to the us metropolitan statistical areas 
the statistical results indicated ample opportunity to expand the number of service centers in the continental united states by over locations 
we began a service center opening program resulting in new service center openings in we plan to open to service centers in c 
expanded direct sales force additionally  in late  we expanded our direct sales force to professionals 
during the first half of  we evaluated the program s performance and determined that the program was not performing to our expectations  reducing the program by professionals 
during  we incurred approximately million of costs related to the program 
through the workforce reduction in june  million of these costs were eliminated on a go forward basis 
capital restructuring during and  we restructured our debt and equity capital structure 
the following summarizes these initiatives a 
refinancing in january of  we refinanced our private placement notes  revolving credit agreement and accounts receivable securitization with a million senior secured credit facility 
the new facility included an amortizing term loan of million and a million revolving credit facility 
the term loan was secured by real property and the revolver was secured by inventory and accounts receivable  both bore interest at the london interbank offered rate libor plus to 
in conjunction with the refinancing  the private placement note holders received million of preferred stock  with an annual payment in kind dividend of 
concurrently with the refinancing  we entered into a three year million interest rate swap agreement with a fixed interest rate of plus to 
the refinancing resulted in an early retirement of debt charge of million and the recording of deferred financing fees of million 
b 
refinancing the refinancing was composed of the following two initiatives i 
agreements with ge business credit services on december   the company sold a majority of its trade accounts receivable portfolio to ge capital financial inc  dba ge business credit services gebcs  for cash proceeds of approximately million 
the transaction resulted in a pre tax charge of million 
concurrently with the sale  the company and gebcs entered into a private label business credit program agreement credit agreement 
under the credit agreement  gebcs will extend commercial credit to qualified customers of lesco and fund the program sales  less program fees and discounts  within three business days 
the credit agreement also provides the company the option of extending deferred payment terms to customers through the payment of incremental promotional discounts 
the in transit funds are recognized by the company as cash equivalents 
the program fees and discounts and promotional discounts are recognized as merchant discounts in the consolidated statement of operations 
gebcs is the exclusive owner of the program accounts and  except for the recourse account portfolio retained by the company  bears all credit losses 
the credit agreement has a five year term with automatic three year renewals unless either party terminates at least six months prior to the end of the expiration of a term 
ii 
debt refinancing also december   the company entered into a million revolving credit facility the facility which replaced the prior credit facility 
borrowings under the facility were used to retire the prior credit facility  including the term loan  buy out the interest rate swap agreement for million and buy back the outstanding preferred stock  including 
table of contents accrued dividends  for million 
a charge of million was recorded to expense the unamortized portion of the deferred financing costs of the prior credit facility 
the facility matures december  and is secured by inventory  owned receivables  equipment  investment interests  real property interests  and general intangibles including intellectual property 
the facility bears interest at libor plus to  based on the level of borrowings  and requires the payment of a facility fee ranging from to on the unused portion of availability 
availability under the facility is determined by a borrowing base formula calculated on eligible inventory 
as of december   there was million available  with unused capacity of million 
letters of credit  up to a maximum of million  are also available under the facility and are considered outstanding borrowings when calculating the unused portion of availability 
letter of credit fees range from to with an issuance fee ranging from to 
the interest rate  facility fee  letter of credit fee and letter of credit issuance fee are determined based on the company s fixed charge coverage ratio 
the weighted average interest rate on the company s outstanding borrowing under the facility as of december  was 
the facility requires the maintenance of certain covenants  with the only financial covenant being the fixed charge coverage ratio 
the company was in compliance with the facility covenants as of december  the amount of deferred financing charges associated with the facility included in other non current assets was  which will be amortized to expense over the three year term of the facility 
other a 
divestiture of joint venture in the fourth quarter of  the company sold its investment in commercial turf products ltd

b 
adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas goodwill and other intangible assets in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas provides that goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are no longer amortized but are reviewed annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise for impairment 
separable intangible assets that are not deemed to have an indefinite life will continue to be amortized over their useful lives but with no maximum life 
the company adopted sfas no 
effective january  upon adoption  the company determined that goodwill impairment existed 
the impairment loss was measured by evaluating the fair value of the goodwill using discounted cash flow 
table of contents appraisal models 
these models indicated that the goodwill of million was fully impaired 
upon the adoption of sfas  the company wrote off all its goodwill recording a million charge  which is the write off of the million of goodwill net of a tax benefit of million  as a cumulative effect of accounting change as of january  c 
deferred tax asset valuation reserves in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  the company considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the temporary differences become deductible 
in making this assessment  the company considers historical earnings  the scheduled reversal of deferred tax assets and liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies 
the recent cumulative losses create uncertainty about the realization of the tax benefits in future years which cannot be overcome by other available evidence 
as a result  a valuation allowance of million has been recorded as of december  to fully reserve for the company s net deferred tax assets 
as of december   the company was uncertain about the realization of its state net operating loss carryforwards 
therefore  as of december   the company recorded an  valuation allowance to reserve for the deferred tax asset associated with state net operating loss carryforwards 
d 
sale of former corporate headquarters in  we moved to our current leased corporate headquarters in strongsville  ohio  from our owned corporate headquarters in rocky river  ohio 
in  we sold the former corporate headquarters and recorded a million gain on the sale 

table of contents consolidated results we believe that the most effective analysis of our consolidated results is accomplished through the removal of the financial impacts of certain of the previously discussed strategic initiatives excluding the growth initiatives and their positive and negative effects 
a summary of our financial results excluding the operational impact of these initiatives is as follows consolidated statements of operations twelve months results twelve months results ended excluding ended excluding december  charges a charges december  charges b charges dollars in thousands  except per share data net sales cost of product cost of inventory markdown distribution cost gross profit on sales selling expense general administrative expense merchant discounts and provision for doubtful accounts early retirement of debt agreement loss on sale of accounts receivable asset rationalization other income other expense income loss before interest and taxes interest expense income loss before taxes income tax provision benefit net income loss before cumulative effect of accounting change cumulative effect of accounting change for goodwill charge  net of taxes of net loss income loss earnings per share of common stock diluted basic a charges included million for early retirement of debt  million for loss on sale of accounts receivable and million for valuation allowance of deferred tax assets

table of contents vs 
sales the following table provides supplemental detail of sales by customer sector and transacting selling locations change other other other service selling service selling service selling centers locations total centers locations total centers locations total dollars in millions lawn care golf gross sales freight revenue customer discounts and rebates net sales service centers service center gross sales reflect sales transacted through our service centers in operation as of december   including new service centers opened during  and one service center closed during gross sales in and of million and million  respectively 
the total increase of reflects a same store excluding new and closed units increase of and an increase of from new service center sales of million 
we plan to open an additional to service centers in other selling locations all other gross sales reflect sales transacted through our direct sales programs and our stores on wheels 
the decrease of is attributable to the decline in consumption of our products by the golf industry through these sales channels 
this decline was due to the challenges within the industry  discussed in the preceding overview  and the industry experiencing inclement weather during  particularly in the northeast during the important spring selling season 
additionally  we continue to evaluate the returns relative to contract accounts and have instituted disciplines to assure contracts meet acceptable return thresholds 
this program has  on occasion  resulted in lost contract sales 
freight revenue and customer discounts and rebates freight revenue  which represents fees charged to customers in sales transactions for shipping and handling  remained relatively flat as a percentage of sales 
customer discounts and rebates grew from of gross sales to due to a new contract account which included a rebate program 
gross profit on sales dollars of net sales dollars of net sales dollar in millions product margin inventory markdown distribution cost gross profit our largest single purchased product or raw material is urea  the nitrogen source for blended fertilizers and combination products 
urea can represent from approximately to of our cost of sales 
urea is a second derivative of natural gas and its cost has increased with the increased cost of natural gas 
average urea costs increased approximately over costs  which unabated would have resulted in an estimated deterioration in product margin percentage 
however  through price increases of approximately and other cost of sales reductions  particularly the cost to blend fertilizer products and inventory shrinkage  we 
table of contents were successful in limiting the deterioration of product margin percentage to 
for  we have entered a contract with our urea supplier to fix the cost of a majority of our urea needs at a price reflecting the prevailing market in late the inventory markdown in relates to the implementation of the inventory product life cycle program discussed in overview 
in late  we decided to expand our distribution network to support our expected growth in service center units and comparable sales increases  which added fixed costs to our operations 
as such  we opened distribution hubs in chicago  atlanta  and plano  texas  adding a cumulative  square feet of warehousing capacity to our distribution network at an average lease cost of per square foot 
the opening of these incremental hubs resulted in million of incremental start up costs in additionally  the incremental fixed costs were not effectively leveraged by the increase in net sales 
the combination of start up costs and incremental fixed costs resulted in the deterioration in distribution expense leverage 
operating expenses change of net of net of net basis dollars sales dollars sales dollars sales points dollars in millions selling expense bps merchant discounts provision for doubtful accounts bps selling expense selling expense includes all operating expenses of service centers and stores on wheels  direct sales  sales management  customer service and marketing expense 
the increase of million predominantly relates to new service center operating costs of million  incremental direct sales programs of million  of which million of these costs were eliminated on a go forward basis through our workforce reduction in june see further discussion in overview  and incremental costs of our new point of sale system of million 
merchant discounts and provision for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net sales  these expenses remained relatively flat year over year 
as discussed in the overview  on december   we sold our trade accounts receivable portfolio to gebcs for million and entered a private label business credit program agreement with gebcs 
in  this arrangement will result in increased merchant discounts as we will pay program fees and discounts to gebcs of approximately of sales  however  interest expense  provision for doubtful accounts  the general and administrative costs to service the in house program and customer finance revenue will be significantly reduced 
general and administrative expense change dollars in millions general and administrative expenses we continue to analyze all general and administrative expenses and have experienced increases related to sarbanes oxley requirements  insurance costs and sales and use taxes 
these increases have been offset by continued reductions in personnel and the elimination of the payment of executive bonuses for the executive bonus plan is paid based upon the company achieving specified sales growth  earnings per share and return on invested capital targets  which were not achieved in 
table of contents other expense income change dollars in millions early retirement of debt loss on sale of accounts receivable asset rationalization other expense other income the early retirement of debt charges  loss on sale of accounts receivable and asset rationalization charge are discussed in the overview 
the decline in other expense is due to a million decrease in severance expense million vs 
million 
see the overview for discussion of the severance expense 
the increase in other income predominantly relates to our former joint venture 
interest expense change dollars in millions interest expense the effective interest rate of borrowings in was versus in although libor has declined approximately year over year  we were unable to take full advantage of the rate declines due to our interest rate swap agreement which fixed our interest rate at approximately on million of our borrowings 
the interest rate swap was terminated in conjunction with the refinancing discussed in the overview 
both the effective interest rate and outstanding average borrowings will decline significantly in as a result of the refinancing see overview for further discussion 
income taxes a reconciliation of our income tax provision benefit is as follows as a of as a of dollars pre tax loss dollars pre tax loss dollars in millions provision benefit before valuation provision valuation provision total provision benefit see the overview for further discussion of the income tax valuation provisions 
the decrease in effective benefit results from the effect of permanent  non deductible items and their relationship to pre tax loss 
net income net loss  before the cumulative effect of accounting change  on a gaap basis was million  or per diluted share  in and million  or per diluted share  in excluding charges  net income in was million  or per diluted share  versus million  or per diluted share in the decrease in net income  excluding charges of million  is directly attributable to the increases in operating expenses as discussed above

sales for the year ended december  increased approximately to million compared with million in sales rose by approximately million due to improved unit volume of

partially offsetting these increases were lower average selling prices leading to a reduction of million in gross profit for the year ended december  as a percent of sales  gross profit  excluding inventory markdown  was for the year ended december  compared with for for the year ended december   selling expenses increased by million  a increase  to million compared to million in selling expense was of sales for year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the increase in selling expense reflects the increase in the direct sales force to professionals 
for the year ended december   general and administrative expense increased by million to million compared to million in the increase was due to payroll related expenses  including performance incentives of million  an increase in deferred financing fees of  related to the debt facility and higher insurance expenses of  these increases were partially offset by cost reductions in consulting and outside labor of  goodwill amortization of  travel costs of  and other expenses of  interest expense for the year ended december  was million  which was a reduction of million from due primarily to lower average borrowing levels 
for the year ended december   average borrowing levels were down million compared to effective interest rates were for the year ended december  compared to in the prior period 
the company s effective tax rate in in accordance with gaap was compared to in the effective tax rate after adjustment for the inventory markdown  asset rationalization charges  severance and gain was 
the change in effective tax rate from year to year is due primarily to a charge of  for a valuation allowance against state net operating loss deferred assets

the company s net income  excluding the inventory markdown  asset rationalization charges  severance charges  early retirement of debt and cumulative effect in accounting change  was million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december  compared with a loss of million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december  business segment results we manage lesco s business utilizing two business segments selling and support 
selling segment we maintain four wall p ls for each of our selling locations service centers  stores on wheels  direct sales representatives and all other direct selling efforts 
these four wall p ls include the sales  cost of sales and operating expenses including payroll  benefits  rent  utilities  freight in bound to selling locations and out bound to customers necessary to operate the individual selling locations 
the selling segment operating results reflect the aggregate four wall p ls of selling locations adjusted for costs of zone and regional management  sales commission expense and the portion of merchant discounts and provision for doubtful accounts not previously charged to the four wall p ls 

table of contents prior to  four wall p ls were not maintained using the current format 
to provide comparable segment results  certain allocations  particularly related to distribution expense  were estimated and reflected for and based upon results 
we allocate resources  including working  fixed and leased capital  to existing and potential selling locations based upon projected sales and return on invested capital roic 
we define roic as the percentage calculated by dividing net operating profit after tax nopat by invested capital 
for the selling segment we calculate roic as follows roic nopat invested capital nopat selling segment operating results effective tax rate invested capital accounts receivable excluding rebate receivable  see note to consolidated financial statements  plus inventory excluding capitalized distribution and procurement costs  markdown and shrink reserves and credit for inventory held on consignment see note to consolidated financial statements  plus fixed capital see note to consolidated financial statements our measures of roic may not be similar to other similarly titled captions used by other companies 
for example  we do not capitalize operating leases or utilize average invested capital over given periods 
selling segment operating results for the year ended december  dollars in millions net sales cost of product distribution cost gross profit on sales selling expense merchant discounts and provision for doubtful accounts ebit nopat invested capital accounts receivable proforma adjustments for the proceeds from the sale of accounts receivable to gebcs in and the asset securitization in inventory property  plant and equipment  net roic 
table of contents the selling segment s invested capital for has been adjusted for the proceeds from the sale of accounts receivable to gebcs as nopat does not reflect the cost of incremental merchant discounts from the gebcs private label business credit programs 
in future periods  the selling segment will be charged for these incremental merchant discounts see note to consolidated financial statements 
future selling segment merchant discounts and provision for doubtful accounts is estimated to be of gross sales 
a proforma selling segment roic for reflecting this estimated charge  as if the sale of accounts receivable to gebcs had occurred on january   is calculated as follows ebit  as determined above adjusted for incremental merchant discounts adjusted ebit adjusted nopat invested capital  as determined above less proceeds from the sale of accounts receivable to gebcs adjusted invested capital adjusted roic this adjusted roic supports our strategy of service center expansion and our decision to enter the private label business credit program with gebcs 
support segment the support segment includes the operating results and invested capital of all non selling locations including manufacturing blending facilities and seed processing plant  distribution hubs including in bound freight costs to the distribution hubs  and corporate costs including corporate management of sales  marketing  customer service  accounting and finance  human resources  information systems  etc we believe that these costs are essential to managing the selling locations and to managing a public company  but are not costs that directly translate into incremental sales or positive roic 
therefore  resources are only allocated to the support segment if the result is a net reduction in expenses or the allocation is necessary for the maintenance of facilities  the support of the expansion of selling locations  the maintaining of the corporate structure or is mandated by law or governmental order

liquidity and capital resources a summary of the change in cash and cash equivalents see statement of cash flows included in the attached consolidated financial statements is as follows for the year ended december  dollars in millions cash used provided by operations cash used by investing activities cash provided used by financing activities increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents due to the number of charges as discussed in overview  we believe that a reconciliation of our earnings before interest and taxes ebit  excluding charges  and ebit before depreciation and amortization ebitda  excluding charges  to the change in cash and cash equivalents  provides the users of our financial information additional information relative to our cash generation and requirements for the year ended december  dollars in millions ebit  excluding charges depreciation amortization ebitda  excluding charges working capital uses sources of cash inventory accounts payable including change in overdraft balance and excluding gebcs accounts receivable excluding gebcs transaction other  net

ebitda ebit declined for as compared to by million due to the operational items discussed in the vs 
comparisons 
the decline in depreciation expense is directly attributable to the decrease of capital spending during and  which is further discussed below 
future ebitda performance will be dependent on the company s operating results and depreciation expense 
working capital during and  we experienced net increases in working capital of and million  respectively 
with the sale of the accounts receivable portfolio to gebcs  we do not expect significant unfavorable changes in our accounts receivable portfolio in the coming periods 
in the future  the working capital items that could result in significant uses of cash are increases in inventory and reductions in accounts payable 
as we open additional service centers  we will stock new locations with  to  of inventory 
however  as of december   we believe that our investment in non selling location inventory was high and will be declining through as such  we anticipate that inventory levels will increase with the opening of new service centers  but continued improvements in supply chain efficiencies could reduce the impact of these increases 

table of contents accounts payable leverage is summarized as follows december  dollars in millions accounts payable less payable to gebcs adjusted accounts payable inventory accounts payable leverage payable to gebcs represents the portion of the receivable portfolio sold to gebcs that remains secured by the company 
the accounts payable leverage at the end of was high due to certain year end inventory purchases 
we believe that an accounts payable leverage ranging from to is sustainable 
interest payments as discussed in overview  the refinancing significantly changed our debt capital structure  which will dramatically reduce our interest expense in future periods 
we believe that market interest rates will increase during  and we will experience effective rates in ranging from to 
we anticipate average revolving credit borrowings of approximately million  resulting in total interest expense of approximately million 
income taxes for internal modeling purposes  we utilize a effective income tax rate 
in accordance with gaap requirements  we recorded a full valuation reserve of our deferred tax assets at december  certain of these unrecognized deferred tax assets  including million of federal net operating loss carryforwards  will be available to offset future income tax liability 
after these fully reserved assets are utilized  we anticipate paying income taxes at a effective rate 
capital expenditures our capital expenditures can be summarized as follows dollars in millions new service centers information systems distribution network manufacturing other our capital needs going forward will be predominantly related to new service centers and to maintain information systems and manufacturing facilities 
we anticipate that ongoing annual capital needs will range from million to million 
financing activities cash was used in to repay borrowings million  terminate the interest rate swap million and to buy back preferred stock million 
we believe that our current million revolving credit facility the facility is sufficient to provide us with the necessary seasonal working capital and letters of credit for insurance programs and as collateral for our industrial revenue bonds 
as of december   the facility s unused capacity was million 
the facility contains only one financial covenant  relating to fixed charge coverage  which we were in compliance with at december  the facility expires in december 
table of contents we believe that the company s financial condition is strong and that its cash balances  other liquid assets  operating cash flows  access to debt and equity capital markets and borrowing capacity  collectively  provide adequate resources to fund short term and long term operating requirements and future capital expenditures related to service center expansion and other projects 
however  the company s operating cash flow and access to the capital markets can be impacted by factors outside of its control 
contractual obligations  commitments and off balance sheet arrangements we have various contractual obligations that are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements 
other items  such as certain purchase commitments and other executory contracts are not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements but are required to be disclosed 
for example  the company is contractually committed to make certain minimum lease payments for the use of property under operating lease agreements 
the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments at december  and the future periods in which such obligations are expected to be settled in cash 
in addition  the table reflects the timing of principal payments on outstanding borrowings 
additional details regarding these obligations are provided in footnotes to the consolidated financial statements

c for through  the company is committed to annual purchases of  tons of methylene urea fertilizer at a fixed conversion price of per ton plus the prevailing commodities market prices 
for presentation purposes  these future commodities market prices are estimated at per ton 
d in  the company sold its investment in commercial turf products  ltd 
to mtd consumer group  inc concurrent with the sale  the company entered into a five year supply agreement with ctp and mtd requiring minimum annual equipment purchases 
e other commitments include computer hardware and software maintenance commitments  hardware leases and telecommunications contracts 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and 
table of contents judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to the allowance for doubtful accounts  inventories  intangible assets  long lived assets  income taxes  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
management has discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates  and the disclosures made herein  with the audit committee of the board of directors and its external auditors 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the notes to consolidated financial statements and this discussion and analysis of financial condition contain various references and disclosures concerning our accounting policies 
additionally  we have identified each of the following as a critical accounting policy  either because it has the potential to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements  because of the significance of the financial item to which it relates  or because it requires judgment and estimation due to the uncertainty involved in measuring at a specific point in time events which will be settled in the future
