item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
you should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations together with the financial statements and the notes to such statements included elsewhere in this filing 
this discussion contains forward looking statements based on our current expectations  assumptions  estimates and projections about us and our industry 
these forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties including  but not limited to those discussed in risk factors set forth in item of this annual report 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors 
we undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward looking statements for any reason  even if new information becomes available or other events occur in the future 
executive overview our principal businesses are operating as a specialist on the nyse  amex and nybot and a market maker on the amex  nybot  cboe and phlx  and providing execution and clearing services to retail and institutional clients and correspondents 
adverse changes affecting the economy and or the securities markets  which may result in a decline in market volume traded  volatility or liquidity  also typically result in a decrease in revenues from our specialist  market making and execution and clearing activities 
historically  increases in our revenues have resulted primarily from acquisitions  increases in the volume of trading on the nyse  volatility in the prices of publicly traded securities and favorable conditions in the securities markets 
the year was a particularly challenging and disappointing period for us 
although the equity markets generally experienced substantial price gains  decreases in share volume  diminished volatility and an increase in program trading on the nyse resulted in a significant decline in our revenues 
in addition  our stock price dropped to its lowest level since our initial public offering  due to our weak quarterly earnings and the prolonged sec and nyse investigations into the trading activities of the five largest specialist firms 
our weak quarterly results and the depressed level of our stock price contributed to our goodwill impairment charge of million in furthermore  we were required to reflect a pre tax charge of million in our financial results because of our agreement in principle to settle the sec and nyse investigations 
notwithstanding the difficulties we experienced in  we have seen evidence in january and february of a possible return of the robust equity trading activity that prevailed in previous years 
in january and february  the nyse average daily trading volume has increased over the same period of in addition  in january  equity fund net inflow  which is the net dollar amount invested by mutual funds in equities for a given period  was billion  the strongest monthly reading since february we are confident that specialists will continue to play an integral role in equities trading 
the nyse has recently proposed to broaden access to  and the functionality of  its nyse direct automatic trade execution system 
if these changes are approved by the sec  the nyse may qualify as a fast market  thus mitigating the potentially adverse effect for us of the proposed modifications to the trade through rule 
our lsp subsidiary grew substantially in  and as a specialist and market maker in new products and new markets  should continue to grow in in terms of liquidity  we are actively searching for the most cost effective and flexible alternative to refinancing our senior notes before august under the covenants contained within the senior notes and senior subordinated notes  our cash flexibility has been restrained 
we will seek to alleviate or eliminate these current restraints 
new accounting developments in december  the fasb issued fin r  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
fin r requires a company to consolidate a variable interest entity vie if the company has variable interests that give it a majority of the expected losses or a majority of the expected residual returns  or both  of the entity 
fin r is effective no later than the end of the first reporting period that ends after march  we do not believe the implementation of fin r will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instrument with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas no 
establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas no 
is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective for the interim period beginning after june  since may   we have not entered into or modified any financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity as defined under sfas no 
additionally  we have no mandatorily redeemable stock 
the implementation of sfas no 
has had no impact on our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting estimates goodwill a critical accounting estimate is the determination of fair value of each of our reporting units and the fair value of each reporting unit s goodwill under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
in determining fair value  we use standard analytical approaches to business enterprise valuation bev  such as the market comparable approach and the income approach 
the market comparable approach is based upon comparisons of the subject company to similar companies engaged in an actual merger or acquisition or to public companies whose stocks are actively traded 
as part of this process  multiples of value relative to financial variables  such as earnings or stockholders equity  are developed and applied to the appropriate financial variables of the subject company to indicate its value 
the income approach involves estimating the present value of the subject company s future cash flows by using projections of the cash flows that the business is expected to generate  and discounting these cash flows at a given rate of return 
each of these bev methodologies requires the use of management estimates and assumptions 
for example  under the market comparable approach  we assigned a certain control premium to the average public market price of our common stock during the fourth quarter of in estimating the fair value of our reporting units 
similarly  under the income approach  we assumed certain growth rates for our revenues  expenses  earnings before interest  depreciation and amortization  effective tax rate  returns on working capital and other assets and capital expenditures  among others 
we also assumed a certain discount rate and terminal growth rates in our calculations 
for our goodwill impairment test  we engaged an independent business valuation firm to assist us in our bev analyses 
in our sfas no 
test  we compared the fair values of our reportable units and the fair values of our reporting units goodwill obtained based on the methods described above to their respective carrying values in two separate steps under sfas no 
guidelines to arrive at the million impairment loss we recognized for given the subjectivity involved in selecting which bev approach to use and in determining the input variables for use in our analyses  it is possible that a different valuation model and the selection of different input variables could produce a materially different estimate of fair value 
depending on market factors in and beyond  such as possible major changes in the nyse market structure  we could be faced with further impairment indicators on the carrying value of our goodwill at december  which could result in future goodwill impairment losses 
non marketable securities the use of fair value to measure certain non marketable investments is a critical accounting policy 
investments in non marketable securities consist of investments in equity securities of private companies  limited liability company interests and limited partnership interests  which do not have readily available price quotations 
our principal non marketable investment  by its nature  has little or no price transparency 
certain investments in non marketable securities are initially carried at cost as an approximation of fair value 
adjustments to carrying value are made if there are third party transactions evidencing a change in value 
in the absence of such transactions  we apply a discount factor to the carrying value of the investment  if we conclude that the expected realizable value of the investment is less than the carrying value 
in arriving at these conclusions  we consider factors such as the financial performance of the company in which we invested  its cash flow forecasts  expected timing of a possible initial public offering  trends within that company s industry and any specific rights associated with our investment  such as conversion features 
given management s judgment involved in valuing certain investments in non marketable securities  it is possible that a different conclusion of fair value as of a given point in time could be reached by a third party factoring in the same variables as we have 
other than temporary impairment of exchange memberships the determination of the fair value of exchange memberships is a critical accounting estimate 
exchange memberships owned by us are originally carried at cost as an approximation of fair value 
adjustments to carrying value are made if we deem that an other than temporary decline in value  as defined in emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments  has occurred 
in determining whether exchange memberships owned are impaired ie  fair market value is below cost and whether such impairment is deemed temporary or other than temporary  we consider many factors  including  but not limited to  information regarding recent sales prices of exchange memberships  historical trends of sales prices on a particular exchange  the current condition of the particular exchange s market structure  legal and regulatory developments affecting the particular exchange s market structure  trends in new listings on the particular exchange  general global and national economic factors and our knowledge and judgment of the securities market as a whole and the specialist industry in particular 
as a result of applying this accounting policy  we recognized a million other than temporary impairment of our amex exchange membership for it is possible that future other than temporary impairment charges could result from adverse changes in current market conditions 
off balance sheet arrangements lfsi  through the normal course of business  enters into various securities transactions as agent 
the execution  settlement and financing of these transactions can result in off balance sheet risk and concentration of credit risk 
lfsi s execution and clearing activities involve settlement and financing of various customer securities transactions on a cash or margin basis 
these activities may expose lfsi to off balance sheet risk in the event the customer or other broker is unable to fulfill its contractual obligations and lfsi has to purchase or sell securities at a loss 
for margin transactions  lfsi may be exposed to significant off balance sheet risk in the event margin requirements are not sufficient to fully cover losses that customers may incur in their accounts 
repurchases of our preferred stock on february   we repurchased approximately  shares of our series a preferred stock at  per share plus accrued and unpaid dividends up to but not including the date of purchase  pursuant to a tender offer commenced on january  as a result of the purchase  we recorded a one time expense of approximately million due to the acceleration of the discount accretion on the shares purchased

on february   we purchased approximately  shares of our series a preferred stock at a price of  per share  plus accrued and unpaid dividends up to but not including the date of purchase pursuant to a tender offer commenced on january  as a result of the purchase  we recorded an expense of approximately million due to the acceleration of the discount accretion on the shares purchased 
completed preferred stock exchange offer on january   we issued one share of our series b preferred stock in exchange for each of the approximately  shares of our issued and outstanding series a preferred stock pursuant to an exchange offer commenced on december  each share of series b preferred stock has a liquidation preference of  per share and generally accrues cumulative preferred dividends at an annual rate of of the liquidation preference of each share until march   until march  and thereafter  payable on the first day of january and the first day of july of each year 
under the terms of the series b preferred stock  because we did not pay the january  dividend with respect to the then outstanding series a preferred stock  the dividend payable on july  with respect to the series b preferred stock currently is accruing at an annual rate of 
additionally  if we do not timely pay the dividend payable on july  with respect to the series b preferred stock  then the dividends payable on january  will accrue at an annual rate of through september  and thereafter through december  the increase in the annual dividend rate from to with respect to the series b preferred stock will result in an additional charge of approximately million per quarter 
prior to the completion of the exchange offer  the terms of the series a preferred stock prevented us from paying bonuses to our employees or compensation in lieu thereof while we were not then current in our dividend payments with respect to the series a preferred stock 
under the terms of the series b preferred stock  however  until september   we are entitled to pay employee bonuses or compensation in lieu thereof while we are not then current in our payment of dividends with respect to our preferred stock 
thereafter  unless the full amount of all dividends on the series b preferred stock initially payable after september  have been paid  we will again be prevented from paying any bonuses to our employees or compensation in lieu thereof 
the holders of a majority of outstanding shares of series b preferred stock may at any time waive this prohibition on payment of employee bonuses 
results of operations specialist segment operating results for the years ended december  vs percentage change vs percentage change s omitted revenues net gain on principal transactions    commissions    other    total segment revenues    operating expenses goodwill impairment  restitution and fines  pre tax income loss    revenues from our specialist segment consist primarily of net gain earned from principal transactions in securities for which we act as specialist 
net gain on principal transactions represents trading gains net of trading losses and sec transaction fees  where applicable  and are earned by us when we act as principal buying and selling our specialist stocks  rights  options  etfs and futures 
also included in net gain on principal transactions are accrued dividends receivable or payable on our stock positions  net gains and losses resulting from our market making activities in etfs  options and futures  the net gains and losses resulting from trading of foreign currencies  futures and equities underlying the rights  etfs and options for which we act as specialist 
these revenues are primarily affected by changes in share volume traded and fluctuations in price of our stocks  rights  options  etfs and futures in which we are the specialist or in which we make a market 
commissions revenue generated by our specialist segment consists primarily of fees earned when our specialists act as agents by executing limit orders on behalf of brokers  professional traders and broker dealers after a specified period of time  we do not earn commissions when we match market orders or when we act as a market maker 
other revenue at our specialist segment consists primarily of interest income  proprietary trading gains or losses and gains or losses from an investment in a hedge fund 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  when assessing the performance and financial results of a specific period  management examines certain metrics to determine their impact on our financial results 
some of the key metrics that our management reviews and their values for and are as follows percentage change nyse average daily share volume in millions   lab share volume on the nyse in billions lab dollar value on the nyse in billions   share volume of principal shares traded in billions dollar value of principal shares traded in billions closing price of the cboe volatility index generally  an increase in the average daily share volume on the nyse  an increase in volatility as measured by the average closing price of the cboe s volatility index  or the vix or an increase in the dollar value and share volume of our principal shares enables the specialist to increase its level of principal participation and thus its ability to realize net gain on principal transactions 
while these metrics are monitored by management each period  they are not the sole indicators or factors in any given period that determine our level of revenues  profitability or our overall performance 
other factors  such as extreme price movements  unanticipated company news and events and other uncertainties may influence our financial performance either positively or negatively 
in  our net gain on principal transactions decreased primarily as a result of decreases in nyse share and dollar volumes traded for stocks in which we are the specialist  decreases in nyse market share and general volatility in the marketplace 
throughout  the dollar value and share volume of principal shares traded decreased significantly  thereby reducing our opportunity to trade profitably 
the nyse s share of consolidated volume of trades of nyse listed stocks decreased to as of december  as compared to as of december  the decline in volatility in the market  as measured by the vix also contributed to the lower net gain on principal transactions 
of our total million and million of net gain on principal transactions for the years ended december  and  respectively  million and million  respectively  were generated from our derivative trading activities at our lsp subsidiary 
commissions revenue earned by our specialist segment decreased due to a decrease in the share volume executed by us as agent and the effect of competitive price pressures on our billing structure 
the total share volume executed by us as agent in our specialist stocks decreased to billion shares for from billion shares for the share volume executed by us as agent is affected by the share volume of labranche co 
llc s specialist stocks on the nyse  which decreased as noted in the key metrics chart above 
for a discussion of operating expenses see our operating expenses below 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net gain on principal transactions increased as a result of increased share volumes in our specialist stocks traded on the nyse  which led to a increase in our principal trading share volumes from billion shares for to billion shares for the increase in net gain on principal transactions was also the result of a full year of revenues from our acquisitions 
the increase was partially offset by unfavorable market conditions including a decline in the nyse composite index for notwithstanding these unfavorable market conditions  we were required to fulfill our obligation as a specialist to minimize short term imbalances between supply and demand and maintain fair and orderly markets in our listed company stocks 
commissions revenue earned by our specialist segment increased as a result of increased share volume executed by us as agent  as well as the impact of our acquisitions  which increased the number of our specialist stocks 
this increase was partially offset by a reduction in billed commissions  as a result of our effort to provide the lowest execution costs to our clients 
the total share volume executed by us as agent in our specialist stocks increased to billion shares for  from billion shares for other revenue earned by our specialist segment decreased primarily due to a decline in interest income as a result of significantly lower interest rates for our short to medium term investments and stock borrow transactions 
in addition  the decrease was due to a decline in proprietary trading revenues  as well as an increase in losses from our investment in a hedge fund 
the decrease in other revenue was partially offset by a reduction of losses from our investments in joint trading books  as well as the reversal of a commercial paper investment loss accrual 
operating expenses for our specialist segment increased slightly due to an increase in employee compensation and related benefits and an increase in lease of exchange memberships  both of which were the result of a full year effect from our acquisitions 
these increases were offset by a significant decrease in amortization of intangibles  a result of the adoption of sfas no

year ended december  compared to year ended december  commissions revenue from our execution and clearing segment increased primarily due to a full year of revenues from our institutional execution group which commenced operations in july the growth in institutional execution group was also the result of the general growth and expansion of its customer base 
the increase in institutional execution group was partially offset by a decline in direct access and clearance revenues resulting from a discontinuation of the prime brokerage business  a decline in clearing customers and a general decrease in the volume of direct access executions during other revenue from our execution and clearing segment decreased primarily due to the decline in proprietary trading revenues as well as a decline in interest income

profitability based compensation may include cash compensation and stock based compensation paid or granted to managing directors  trading professionals and other employees based on our profitability

this indebtedness was incurred in connection with our reorganization from partnership to corporate form in  our acquisitions and the issuance of promissory notes in exchange for our preferred stock 
the interest expense at our specialist segment is primarily the result of subordinated indebtedness that has been approved by the nyse for inclusion in the net capital of our labranche co

our execution and clearing segment s exchange  clearing and brokerage fees expense consists of commissions paid to third parties for introduction of customers  use of certain proprietary information and third party execution fees 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  employee compensation and related benefits expense decreased as a result of a reduction in profitability based compensation accruals and other employee benefits due to lower revenues for the decrease was partially offset by an increase in employee salaries due to the hiring of additional trading and support personnel for lsp and lfsi 
employee compensation and related benefits expense increased to of total revenues for  from of total revenues for as a result of lower revenues 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded an impairment charge on our goodwill of million  of which million is attributable to our specialist segment and million is attributable to our execution and clearing segment 
in determining the goodwill impairment  we first compared the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value through an analysis of our market capitalization and discounted cash flows techniques 
for the year ended december   we engaged an independent valuation firm to assist us with these fair value tests 
since the carrying value of each reporting unit exceeded its fair value  we then compared the implied fair value of each reporting unit s goodwill to its carrying value 
the implied fair value of each reporting unit s goodwill was determined by valuing all assets and liabilities as if each reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination 
the impairment charge  which represents the excess of the carrying value of each reporting unit s goodwill over its implied fair value  was necessary to properly reflect the carrying value of our goodwill at december  during  the nyse and the sec announced the commencement of investigations regarding the trading practices of several nyse specialist firms  including labranche co 
llc 
in february  we and labranche co 
llc agreed in principle with the nyse and the staff of the sec  subject to final approval by the sec  to settle the nyse and sec specialist trading investigations 
pursuant to the agreement in principle  we expect to pay a total of million in restitution to customers and civil penalties for certain trades that occurred during the five year period from to an accrual was made for the settlement as of december  year ended december  compared to year ended december  employee compensation and related benefits expense increased due to our acquisitions and the general expansion of our business  which increased our average number of employees by approximately individuals for the year ended december   as compared to the same period in employee compensation and related benefits expense increased to of total revenues for  from of total revenues for interest expense decreased as the result of the repayment of million principal amount of subordinated indebtedness during  as well as the early retirement during of million principal amount of other indebtedness  which we assumed in connection with our acquisitions 
this decrease was partially offset by additional interest charges associated with the million of subordinated indebtedness incurred in connection with the acquisition of bocklet co 
llc in october  which was repaid in october interest expense decreased to of total revenues for  from of total revenues for exchange  clearing and brokerage fees expense increased primarily due to the increased activities  growth and expansion of our execution and clearing segment  as well as a full year of fees from our expanded execution and clearing segment 
in addition  an increase in our principal share volume as a result of an increase in overall share volume on the nyse  our acquisitions and the expansion of our amex specialist business led to an increase in fees at our specialist segment 
exchange  clearing and brokerage fees expense increased to of total revenues for  from of total revenues for other operating expenses decreased primarily due to a decline in depreciation and amortization of intangibles expense incurred at our specialist segment as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
as of january  this decrease in other operating expenses was partially offset by increases in lease of exchange memberships  legal and professional fees  communications  occupancy and other expenses due to the growth and expansion of our operating segments  as well as our acquisitions 
provision for income taxes decreased due to a decline in non deductible amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had  million in assets  of which million consisted of cash and short term investments  primarily in government obligations maturing within three months  cash and securities segregated under federal regulations and overnight repurchase agreements 
to date  we have financed our operations primarily with proceeds from our debt and equity offerings and our retained earnings from operations 
due to the nature of the securities business and our role as a specialist  market maker and execution agent  the amount of cash and short term investments as well as operating cash flow may vary considerably due to a number of factors  including the dollar amount of positions we take as principal  whether we are net buyers or sellers of securities  the dollar volume of executions by our customers and clearing house requirements 
certain regulatory requirements constrain the use of a portion of our liquid assets for financing  investing or operating activities 
similarly  the nature of our business lines  capital necessary to maintain current operations and our current funding needs subject our cash and cash equivalents to different requirements and uses 
our significant cash requirements relate to our senior notes  which mature in august  and certain other obligations 
as of december  the scheduled maturities of our indebtedness and operating lease obligations  without taking into account any available roll over provisions  were total year years years years s omitted short term and long term debt    subordinated liabilities     operating lease obligations     total     amounts represent aggregate amount to be paid at maturity and do not include discounts of approximately million as of december  the above table includes indebtedness with short term and long term maturities  whose interest and principal payments have a significant effect on the liquidity necessary to finance our current operations 
in addition  a significant portion of our indebtedness imposes certain financial covenants that affect our operations and the use of our capital resources 
our indebtedness includes million aggregate principal amount of senior notes issued on august   which bear interest at a rate of annually and mature in august and million aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated notes issued on march   which bear interest at a rate of annually and mature in march the indentures governing each of the senior notes and the senior subordinated notes include certain covenants that  among other things  limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness  pay dividends on  or repurchase  our stock  make certain investments  engage in transactions with stockholders and affiliates  create liens on our assets and sell assets or engage in mergers and consolidations  except in accordance with certain specified conditions 
under these financial covenants  our ability to incur additional indebtedness  pay dividends or redeem stock is limited if our consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio  which is based on a trailing four quarters  is at or below a threshold of the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio reflects a comparison between our consolidated earnings before interest  income tax  depreciation and amortization expenses ebitda  and the sum of our interest expenses and a tax effected multiple of dividend payments with respect to the outstanding shares of our preferred stock 
as of december   we were not in default of the indentures governing our senior notes and senior subordinated notes  but we were subject to both the covenant limiting our ability to incur additional indebtedness and the covenant limiting our ability to make certain restricted payments such as dividends or cash payments to purchase our stock  because our consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio was below however  we still are permitted to incur indebtedness pursuant to working capital facilities  including the million line of credit maintained by our labranche co 
llc subsidiary  subject to certain conditions and limitations 
as of december   due to the net loss we incurred primarily as a result of our goodwill impairment charge and the charge arising as a result of the nyse and sec specialist investigations  our ability to make restricted payments became subject to another limitation contained in the indentures governing our senior notes and senior subordinated notes 
because our cumulative restricted payments since the original issuance of our senior notes  including paying dividends with respect to our series a preferred stock  repurchasing shares of our series a preferred stock and making certain investments  was greater than the sum of i of our cumulative consolidated net income and ii of the net cash proceeds received from any issuance or sale of our capital stock  we became subject to a second limitation on our ability to make restricted payments 
accordingly  unless our ebitda increases above recent levels and our consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio again exceeds the threshold  and our cumulative consolidated net income returns to historical levels  the continuing application of these limitations could restrict our access to certain sources of financing and our ability to distribute earnings to our stockholders and strategically and flexibly deploy our capital 
we cannot be sure as to when our consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio will again exceed as of december   our four quarter trailing consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio was  as a result of the million charge related to the pending settlement agreement in principle with the nyse and sec as well as our operating results 
the senior subordinated notes also require us  within days after the end of each fiscal year  to offer to redeem from all holders of the senior subordinated notes a principal amount equal to our excess cash flow  as defined  at a price equal to of the principal amount being offered for purchase plus accrued and unpaid interest  if any  to the date of redemption 
each holder is entitled to be offered his or her pro rata share based upon his or her ownership percentage of the outstanding senior subordinated notes 
an excess cash flow offer is not required to be made for any fiscal year if the amount of such offer would be less than million 
excess cash flow is defined for this purpose as of the amount by which our consolidated ebitda exceeds the sum of our interest expense  tax expense  increase in net capital or net liquid asset requirements  capital expenditures  any cash amounts related to acquisitions of nyse specialists or any cash payments related to our payment at maturity of the principal amount of our existing or certain other indebtedness 
on may   we offered to purchase approximately million aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated notes based on our excess cash flow for the year ended december  this offer expired on june  without the tender of any senior subordinated notes 
an excess cash flow offer may not be made to the extent the offer would violate the prohibition on restricted payments contained in the indentures governing the senior notes 
thus  while the senior notes are outstanding  if our consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio is below  we may not offer to redeem any senior subordinated notes pursuant to an excess cash flow offer or otherwise 
we  therefore  do not anticipate being required to make an excess cash flow offer in based on our financial results in with respect to the senior notes due to mature in august  our management currently is exploring several alternatives for refinancing all or at least a substantial portion of the senior notes in order to enable us to repay the senior notes and accrued interest when due 
as part of this effort  we have secured from a major financial institution a commitment to fund a million revolving credit facility which  subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions including the execution of satisfactory credit documentation and our compliance with certain covenants  will be available if necessary  to fund in part our repayment of the senior notes 
although we believe we will be able to refinance the senior notes on reasonably acceptable terms  there can be no assurance in this regard 
if we are unable to refinance the senior notes prior to their maturity  we currently expect to be able to repay the senior notes without impairing our core specialist business operations by borrowing under the million revolving credit facility described above  by disposing of certain of our investment assets  scaling back or liquidating certain of our non core specialist operations  disposing of certain of our non core business assets and or selling additional shares of our common stock 
one or more of such steps may be necessary in view of the recent level of our cash flow from operations  our working capital needs  the net liquid asset requirements under nyse and amex rules  the capital requirements under sec regulations and other liquidity factors  as well as the recent tentative settlement of the sec s and nyse s investigations of our nyse specialist trading activity 
in the event we are unable to refinance or repay the senior notes when due  such inability would be deemed an event of default under the indenture governing the senior notes 
a default in repayment of the senior notes would also trigger an event of acceleration under certain of our other indebtedness  including the senior subordinated notes  requiring immediate repayment of such other indebtedness 
another potential source of liquidity to fund our labranche co 
llc subsidiary s inventory requirements is the committed line of credit maintained with a bank 
in october  labranche co 
llc extended this million committed line of credit agreement to october  on the same terms and conditions as the expiring agreement 
total commitment fees paid in in connection with this extension were  the credit agreement may be extended by labranche co 
llc  subject to the bank s approval  for additional one year terms by giving written notice to the bank at least days prior to the then current scheduled termination date 
amounts outstanding under this credit facility would be secured by our inventory of specialist stocks and bear interest at the bank s broker loan rate 
this facility can only be used to finance inventory requirements at labranche co 
llc

prior to recording this charge  labranche co 
llc s nla was million 
subsequent to the accrual for the settlement  labranche co

in connection with our march acquisition of rpm  we issued  shares of our nonconvertible series a preferred stock to the former stockholders of rpm 
after our and repurchases of series a preferred stock  approximately  shares of series a preferred stock remained issued and outstanding 
on january   we completed an exchange offer  pursuant to which we exchanged one share of a newly created series b preferred stock for each share of our issued and outstanding series a preferred stock

each of our approximately  outstanding shares of series b preferred stock has a liquidation preference of  per share and generally accrues cumulative preferred dividends at an annual rate of of the liquidation preference until march   until march  and thereafter  payable on the first day of january and the first day of july of each year 
the terms of the series b preferred stock provide  however  that if the dividend payable on january  with respect to the then outstanding series a preferred stock is not timely paid  the dividend payable on july  with respect to the series b preferred stock will accrue at an annual rate of 
because we did not pay the january  dividend with respect to the then outstanding series a preferred stock  the dividend payable on july  with respect to the series b preferred stock currently is accruing at an annual rate of 
additionally  if the dividend payable on july  with respect to the series b preferred stock is not paid timely  then the dividends payable on january  will accrue at an annual rate of through september  and thereafter through december  in connection with our acquisition of rpm  we assumed its liabilities and obligations under its deferred compensation plan

if the plan is terminated  the deferred compensation benefits including interest of all participants  to the extent not previously paid  must be distributed to the participants in one lump sum

the retention bonus pool requires that million be paid as bonus compensation on march  to as many as former employees of rpm  provided they are still employed on the payment date 
on october   our board of directors suspended the payment of dividends with respect to our common stock because of the decline in our profitability and because earnings have not been sufficient to support payment of further dividends in compliance with certain of the financial covenants contained in the indentures governing our senior notes and senior subordinated notes  as described more fully above

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk because our specialist equity activities on the nyse and amex expose our capital to significant risks  managing these risks is a constant priority for us 
our central role in the auction process helps us to reduce risks by enabling us to incorporate up to date market information in the management of our inventory  subject to our specialist obligations 
we have developed a risk management process which is designed to balance our ability to profit from our specialist activities with our exposure to potential losses 
our risk management process includes participation by our executive operating committee  our floor management committee  our floor team captains and our specialists 
these parties roles are described as follows executive operating committee 
our executive operating committee is composed of three executive officers of labranche co 
llc 
this committee is responsible for approving all risk management procedures and trading guidelines for particular specialist stocks  after receiving input and proposals from our floor management committee 
in addition  our executive operating committee reviews all unusual situations reported to it by our floor management committee 
floor management committee 
our floor management committee is composed of seven senior floor specialists 
this committee is responsible for formulating and overseeing our overall risk management procedures and trading guidelines for each of our specialist stocks 
in determining these procedures and guidelines  our floor management committee considers the advice and input from our floor team captains 
our floor management committee meets with all floor team captains on a weekly basis to review and  if necessary  revise the risk management procedures for labranche co 
llc and or for particular specialist stocks 
in addition  a member of our floor management committee is always available on the trading floor to review and assist with any unusual situations reported by a floor team captain 
our floor management committee reports to our executive operating committee about each of these situations as they occur 
floor team captains 
we have floor team captains who monitor the activities of labranche co 
llc s specialists throughout the trading day from various positions at labranche co 
llc s trading posts 
the captains observe trades and constantly review trading positions on a real time basis through our information systems 
in addition  the captains are readily available to assist labranche co 
llc s specialists in determining when to deviate from our procedures and guidelines to react to any unusual situations or market conditions 
the captains must report these unusual situations to floor management  including any deviations from our procedures and guidelines 
captains meet with each specialist at least once a week to evaluate the specialist s adherence to our risk management procedures and trading guidelines 
captains also meet to review risk procedures and guidelines and  if appropriate  make recommendations to the floor management committee 
specialists 
labranche co 
llc s specialists conduct auctions of our specialist stocks based upon the conditions of the marketplace 
in doing so  specialists observe our risk management procedures and trading guidelines in tandem with their responsibility to create a fair and orderly market 
specialists must immediately notify a captain of any unusual situations or market conditions requiring a deviation from our procedures and guidelines 
our equity specialist operations on the amex are conducted by five equity specialists 
we have one floor captain on the amex who monitors the trading activities of the amex equity specialists by observing trades and reviewing positions on a real time basis 
the floor captain regularly communicates with management to ensure that our amex equity specialists adhere to all risk management policies set by labranche co 
llc s executive operating committee 
circuit breaker rules 
the nyse and amex have instituted certain circuit breaker rules intended to halt trading in all nyse amex listed stocks in the event of a severe market decline 
the circuit breaker rules impose temporary halts in trading when the dow jones industrial average drops a certain number of points 
current circuit breaker levels are set quarterly at  and percent of the dow jones industrial average closing values of the previous month  rounded to the nearest points 
these rules provide investors extra time to respond to severe market declines and provide us an opportunity to insure compliance with our risk management procedures 
equity market risk a high concentration of labranche co 
llc s principal trading revenue is generated from its ten and twenty five most profitable nyse specialist stocks 
however  the percentage of labranche co 
llc s specialist trading revenue generated from its ten most profitable specialist stocks has decreased from to to of total principal trading revenue for  and  respectively 
the percentage of labranche co 
llc s specialist trading revenue generated from its twenty five most profitable specialist stocks has decreased from to to of total principal trading revenue for  and  respectively 
labranche co 
llc is not overly reliant on a particular group of specialist stocks  as the composition of its ten and twenty five most profitable specialist stocks changes frequently 
our specialist activities are subject to a number of risks  including risks of price fluctuations  rapid changes in the liquidity of markets and foreign exchange risk related to american depositary receipts adrs 
in any period  we may incur trading losses in our specialist stocks for a variety of reasons  including price fluctuations of our specialist stocks  lack of trading volume in our specialist stocks and the performance of our specialist obligations 
from time to time  we may have large position concentrations in securities of a single issuer or issuers engaged in a specific industry 
in general  because our inventory of securities is marked to market on a daily basis  any significant price movement in these securities could result in a reduction of our revenues and operating profits 
we have developed a risk management process  which is intended to balance our ability to profit from our specialist activities with our exposure to potential losses 
we have invested substantial capital  along with the nyse  in real time  on line systems which give our management instant access to specific trading information at any time during the trading day  including our aggregate long and short positions and our capital and profit and loss information on an aggregate or per issue basis 
subject to the specialist s obligation to maintain a fair and orderly market and to applicable regulatory requirements  we constantly seek to manage our trading positions relative to our principal trading revenues 
derivatives market risk as a specialist and market maker in options  etfs and futures  lsp is responsible for creating a fair and orderly market  and trades securities as principal out of both obligation and inclination 
lsp s options  etfs  futures and foreign currency trading exposes it to certain risks  such as price fluctuations  foreign currency movements and changes in the liquidity of markets 
in addition  these derivative instruments expose lsp to volatility  credit and foreign exchange risk  among other types of risks 
certain members of lsp s management are responsible for managing these risks 
these individuals utilize a third party software application to monitor lsp s positions on a real time basis 
by monitoring actual and theoretical profit and loss  volatility and other standard risk measures  these individuals seek to insure that all lsp traders are within the parameters set by management 
lsp s traders purchase and sell futures  the stocks underlying certain positions  and foreign currencies in an attempt to hedge market and foreign currency risk 
lsp s aggregate risk is under constant evaluation by certain members of management and its traders  and all significant trading strategies and positions are discussed among them 
lsp s options  futures and etf trading is executed on national and foreign exchanges 
these trades clear through the options clearing corporation  the national securities clearing corporation or the applicable exchange clearing organization thereby reducing potential credit risk 
the following chart illustrates how specified movements in the underlying securities prices of lsp s entire portfolio on the dates indicated would have impacted profits and losses from its trading activities profit or loss if the underlying securities move s omitted portfolio as of march  june  september    december     the information in the above table is based on certain theoretical assumptions  and thus does not fully represent the profit or loss exposure to changes in volatility  interest rates and dividends 
the zero percent change column represents the profit or loss lsp would experience on a daily basis if the market remained unchanged 
execution  clearing and operational risk in connection with their specialist and market making activities  labranche co 
llc and lsp are engaged in various securities trading and lending activities and assume positions in stocks  rights  options  etfs  futures and foreign currencies for which they are exposed to credit risk associated with the nonperformance of counterparties in fulfilling their contractual obligations pursuant to these securities transactions 
labranche co 
llc and lsp are also exposed to market risk associated with the sale of securities not yet purchased  which can be directly impacted by volatile trading on the nyse  amex and other exchanges 
additionally  in the event of nonperformance and unfavorable market price movements  labranche co 
llc and lsp may be required to purchase or sell financial instruments at a loss 
lfsi s execution and clearing activities require that lfsi execute transactions in accordance with customer instructions and accurately record and process the resulting transactions 
any failure  delay or error in executing  recording and processing transactions whether due to human error or failure of lfsi s information or communication systems could cause substantial losses for brokers  customers and or lfsi and could subject lfsi to claims for losses 
clearing activities include settling each transaction with both the contra broker and the customer 
in connection with lfsi s institutional and direct access floor brokerage customers a transaction is settled either when the customer pays for securities purchased and takes delivery  or delivers securities sold for payment 
settling retail customers and professional investors involves financing the transaction until the customer makes payment or  for margin accounts  advancing credit to the customer within regulatory and internal guidelines 
clearing direct access brokers transactions includes guaranteeing their transactions to the contra broker on the exchange floor 
these clearing activities may expose lfsi to off balance sheet risk in the event customers or brokers are unable to fulfill their contractual obligations and it is necessary to purchase or sell securities at a loss 
for margin transactions  lfsi may be exposed to off balance sheet risk in the event margin requirements are not sufficient to fully cover losses that customers may incur in their accounts 
the amount of risk related to lfsi s execution and clearance activities is linked to the size of the transaction  market volatility and the creditworthiness of customers and brokers 
lfsi s largest transactions involve those for institutional and direct access floor brokerage customers 
lfsi systematically monitors its open transaction risk starting when the transaction occurs and continuing until the designated settlement date 
transactions that remain unsettled after settlement date are scrutinized and necessary action to reduce lfsi s risk is taken 
credit risk that could result from contra brokers defaulting is minimized since much of the settlement risk for transactions with brokers is essentially transferred to the national stock clearing corporation 
the credit risk associated with institutional and direct access clearing customers is minimized since these customers have been qualified by the depository trust company dtc  the dtc participants or have met the prime broker qualification standards at other brokerage firms 
before conducting business with a prospective customer  lfsi s senior management  in conjunction with its compliance department  reviews the prospective customer s experience in the securities industry  financial condition and personal background  including a background check with a risk reporting agency 
for retail customers and professional investors  lfsi seeks to control the risks associated with customer activities by requiring customers to maintain margin collateral in compliance with various regulatory and internal guidelines 
lfsi monitors margin levels daily pursuant to such guidelines and requires customers to deposit additional collateral or reduce positions when necessary 
in each of our segments  we rely heavily on our information systems in managing our risk 
accordingly  working in conjunction with the nyse  we have made significant investments in our trade processing and execution systems 
our use of  and dependence on  technology has allowed us to sustain our growth over the past several years 
management members and floor captains at our nyse and amex operations must constantly monitor our positions and transactions in order to mitigate our risks and identify troublesome trends should they occur 
the substantial capital we have invested  along with the nyse  in real time  on line systems give management instant access to specific trading information at any time during the trading day  including our aggregate long and short positions  the various positions of each of our trading professionals  our overall position in a particular stock  and capital and profit and loss information on an aggregate  per specialist or per issue basis 
our information systems send and receive data from the nyse and amex through dedicated data feeds 
the nyse supplies us with specialist position reporting system terminals both on the trading floor and in our offices 
these terminals allow us to monitor our nyse trading profits and losses as well as our positions 
for our amex equity operations  our in house technology staff has developed applications to monitor our current positions and profits and losses 
our derivative trading operation utilizes a third party software application to monitor its positions and profits and losses on a real time basis 
we have developed and implemented a business continuity plan  which includes a comprehensive disaster recovery plan 
we have a back up disaster recovery center in new jersey which has connectivity with our labranche co 
llc  lfsi and lsp subsidiaries  as well as a second back up facility in new york which serves our lfsi and lsp subsidiaries 
this second back up facility also acts as a secondary disaster recovery facility for our labranche co 
llc operations 
regulatory risk as registered broker dealers  labranche co 
llc  lfsi and lsp are subject to certain regulatory requirements intended to insure their general financial soundness and liquidity 
these subsidiaries are subject to sec rules c  c and other requirements adopted and administered by both the nyse and amex
