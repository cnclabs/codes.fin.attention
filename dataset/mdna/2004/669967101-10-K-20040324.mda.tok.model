overview we develop  market and support speech software products for automating interactions over the telephone for a range of industries and applications 
our products include speech recognition software  which is used to recognize what a person says  deliver responses and information and perform transactions  text to speech synthesis software  which converts text  for example  from a database  email or web page into an audio signal to deliver speech over the telephone  voice authentication software  which can be used to verify the identity of speakers by the unique qualities of their voices  grammars  which define the dictionary of possible caller responses for use in applications  and a standards based software platform designed as a foundation for speech application deployment and management and a packaged speech routing application product 
two of these products are new and were released in nuance voice platform nvp  an open  standards based software platform optimized for speech solutions  was released in the first quarter and nuance call steering ncs  a packaged application designed to accurately and cost effectively route phone calls to the correct customer care destinations  was released in the second quarter of we plan to add additional applications for key industries  which  like ncs  will be designed to leverage the features inherent in our engines and platform while reducing deployment time and cost 
we seek to actively support both emerging industry standards as well as proprietary development environments 
our software is designed to work with voicexml  the recognized industry standard language for the creation of voice driven products and services 
we also offer a range of consulting  support and education services that enable our customers and third party resellers to develop and maintain voice driven applications that use our software products 
we sell our products both directly through our sales force and indirectly through third party resellers 
we sell our products to customers in the united states  canada  the united kingdom and other countries in europe  china and other countries in asia  and latin america 
we anticipate that markets outside of the united states will continue to represent a significant portion of total future revenue 
overview of operations our growth and anticipated profitability are heavily dependent upon general economic conditions and demand for information technology 
our growth has traditionally been fueled by sales to the telecommunications and financial services industries 
some industries have sustained slowdowns over the past several years 
even though information technology spending remains improved recently due to growth in the economy  it is difficult to predict the information technology spending trend for the foreseeable future 
in response to the challenging business environment  we have evolved and continue to evolve our strategic direction in a way that we believe will improve our business performance 
our strategic objectives include 
focusing resources on geographic and industry targets believed to have the highest potential for revenue  
evolving our voice platform and development tools to increase the speed and ease of deployment and reduce the total cost of ownership of speech systems  
developing speech applications designed to reduce deployment time and lower maintenance requirements  
developing and strengthening a multi channel selling model  and 
developing advanced speech technologies that deliver customer value and maintain our leadership position in the speech industry 
some specific operating changes have already been accomplished  such as the restructuring actions taken in  and  two newly released products in  nvp in march and ncs in june  the sales execution with a multi channel strategy  the development of the new platform value added resale var channel  and our focus on driving complete speech solutions into the large telecom and enterprise call center markets 
we plan to introduce certain new applications in the future 
other operating activities  including new products and changes to selling and delivery channels  will continue to evolve over the next several years 
we are making these strategic shifts because we believe that they will enhance our business performance  however  some of the actions we are taking  such as the introduction of new products  present inherent risks 
we believe that these new products will make speech systems faster and easier to deploy  and will create value for our customers 
the success of these products depends upon certain market factors such as information technology spending  market acceptance of packaged software applications and industry adoption of voicexml and related standards 
in addition  we are responding to customers requests to work more directly with them and provide them greater access to nuance s speech expertise across all levels of their speech solutions 
we believe that increasing our direct relationships with end users and delivering more complete solutions will allow us to reap greater value from these sales transactions 
however  this new sales and delivery model may also present increased costs and risks such as increased liability for complete solution delivery  costs and risks of subcontractors  and possible delays in recognition of revenue 
further  we may experience periodic fluctuations in our consulting services revenues when long term consulting projects come to completion 
in addition  while we are actively working to manage potential channel conflicts and maintain strong third party reseller relationships  certain third party reseller relationships may be adversely affected by our introduction of our own platform product and application product and or our direct sales activities  which may have an unfavorable impact on revenue from certain third party resellers 
we are committed to a multi channel sales approach and third party resellers have been and will continue to be instrumental in delivering speech engines  applications and services to our end customers 
we are actively working to maintain and build strong relationships with existing third party resellers as well as new third party resellers 
we will continue to focus efforts on fostering a strong third party reseller channel  particularly to leverage complementary capabilities in order to speed and ease deployment of speech solutions 
we may encounter difficulties or delays in finding third party reseller partners having such complementary capabilities and or establishing third party reseller partner relationships with such entities 
in addition  competition exists in the speech technology market 
we believe that our business and technology has the ability to compete effectively  however  the speech market is relatively new and susceptible to change 
our competitors may be able to develop superior technologies or may combine with each other to leverage complimentary technologies or relationships 
current and potential competitors may be larger than nuance and may be able to invest greater resources in competitive efforts and or may establish relationships among themselves or with third parties to increase their technological and or selling and marketing abilities 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires that management make a number of assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable 
such estimates include percentage of completion on certain revenue contracts  uncollectible accounts receivable  restructuring accrual for leases  taxes and contingencies 
although these estimates are based on management s best knowledge of current events and actions that may impact us in the future  actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions 
our critical accounting policies are those that affect our financial statements materially and involve a significant level of judgment by management 
those policies are as follows 
revenue recognition  
restructuring and impairment charges  
valuation allowance for doubtful accounts  
income taxes  
valuation of long lived assets 
revenue recognition revenues are generated from licenses  services and maintenance 
all revenues generated from our worldwide operations are approved at our corporate headquarters  located in the united states 
we apply the provisions of statement of position sop no 
 software revenue recognition  as amended by sop no 
 modification of sop no 
 software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions to all transactions involving the sale of software products 
we also recognize some revenue based on sop no 
 accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts and emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
applicability of american institute of certified public accountant statement of position to non software deliverables in an arrangement containing more than incidental software 
our license revenue consists of license fees for our software products 
the license fees for our software products are calculated primarily by determining the maximum number of calls that may be simultaneously connected to our software 
for licensed products requiring significant customization  we recognize license revenue using the percentage of completion method of accounting over the period that services are performed 
for all license and service agreements accounted for under the percentage of completion method  we determine progress to completion based on actual direct labor hours incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total direct labor hours required to complete the project 
we periodically evaluate the actual status of each project to ensure that the estimates to complete each contract remain accurate 
a provision for estimated losses on contracts is made in the period in which the loss becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated 
to date  these losses have not been significant 
costs incurred in advance of billings are recorded as costs incurred exceed the related billings on uncompleted contracts 
if the amount of revenue recognized exceeds the amounts billed to customers  the excess amount is recorded as unbilled accounts receivable 
if the amount billed exceeds the amount of revenue recognized  the excess amount is recorded as deferred revenue 
revenue recognized in any period is dependent on our percentage completion of projects in progress 
significant management judgment and discretion are used to estimate total direct labor hours 
any changes in or deviation from these estimates could have a material effect on the amount of revenue we recognize in any period 
for licensed products which do not require significant customization of components  we recognize revenue from the sale of software licenses when 
persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  
the software and corresponding authorization codes have been delivered  
the fee is fixed and determinable  
collection of the resulting receivable is probable 
we use a signed contract and either a purchase order  order form or royalty report as evidence of an arrangement 
products delivered with acceptance criteria or return rights are not recognized as revenue until all revenue recognition criteria are achieved 
if undelivered products or services exist that are essential to the functionality of the delivered product in an arrangement  delivery is not considered to have occurred 
delivery is accomplished through electronic distribution of the authorization codes or keys 
occasionally the customer will require that we secure their acceptance of the system in addition to the delivery of the keys 
such acceptance  when required  typically consists of a demonstration to the customer that  upon implementation  the software performs in accordance with specified system parameters  such as recognition accuracy or task completion rates 
in the absence of such required acceptance  we will defer revenue recognition until signed acceptance is obtained 
we consider the fee is fixed and determinable when the price is not subject to refund or adjustments 
we assess collectibility of the transaction based on a number of factors  including the customer s past payment history and its current financial position 
if we determine that collection of a fee is not probable  we defer recognition of the revenue until the time collection becomes reasonably assured  which is upon receipt of the cash payment 
we use the residual method to recognize revenue when a license agreement includes one or more elements to be delivered at a future date if vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of all undelivered elements exists 
vendor specific objective evidence of fair value is based on the price charged when the element is sold separately  or if not yet sold separately  is established by authorized management 
in situations where vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for undelivered elements does not exist  the entire amount of revenue from the arrangement is deferred and recognized when vendor specific objective evidence of fair value can be established for all undelivered elements or when all such elements are delivered 
in situations where the only undelivered element is maintenance and vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for maintenance does not exist  the entire amount of revenue from the arrangement is recognized ratably over the maintenance period 
as a general rule  license revenue from third party resellers is recognized when product has been sold through to an end user and such sales have been reported to us 
however  certain third party reseller agreements include time based provisions on which we base revenue recognition 
in these instances  there is no right of return possible 
the timing of license revenue recognition is affected by whether we perform consulting services in the arrangement and the nature of those services 
in the majority of cases  we either perform no consulting services or we perform services that are not essential to the functionality of the software 
when we perform consulting and implementation services that are essential to the functionality of the software  we recognize both license and consulting revenue utilizing contract accounting based on the percentage of the consulting services that have been completed 
this calculation is done in conformity with sop no 
 however  judgment is required in determining the percentage of the project that has been completed 
we have also explored the markets for complete speech solutions and delivering through combined product and services  where we are required to use contract accounting and recognize the bundled license and service revenue based upon percentage of completion 
this method of accounting is subject to certain judgments by us regarding amount of revenue allocated to percentage of work completed 
typically  we would recognize revenue based upon the proportional level of effort expended to complete certain milestones defined in the customer contract or statement of work 
service revenue consists of revenue from providing consulting  training and other revenue 
other revenue consists primarily of reimbursements for consulting out of pocket expenses incurred and recognized  in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf no 
 income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred 
for services revenue  we require a signed contract and statement of work and purchase order prior to recognizing any services revenue 
our consulting service contracts are bid either on a fixed fee basis or on a time and materials basis 
for a fixed fee contract  we recognize revenue using the percentage of completion method 
for time and materials contracts  we recognize revenue as services are performed 
training service revenue is recognized as services are performed 
losses on service contracts  if any  are recognized as soon as such losses become known 
maintenance revenue consists of fees for providing technical support and software upgrades 
we require a signed contract and purchase order prior to recognizing any maintenance revenue 
we recognize all maintenance revenue ratably over the contract term 
most customers have the option to renew or decline maintenance agreements annually for the contract term 
our standard payment terms are net to days from the date of invoice 
thus  a significant portion of our accounts receivable balance at the end of a quarter is primarily comprised of revenue from that quarter 
restructuring and asset impairment charges through december   we have accrued for restructuring costs when management approved and committed to a firm plan 
historically the main components of our restructuring plans have been related to workforce reductions  lease losses as a result of a decision not to occupy certain leased property and asset impairments 
workforce related charges were accrued based on an estimate of expected benefits that would be paid out to the employees 
to determine the sublease loss  after our cost recovery efforts from subleasing the building  certain assumptions were made related to the time period over which the building would remain vacant sublease terms sublease rates 
we established the reserves at the low end of the range of estimable cost against outstanding commitments  net of estimated future sublease income 
these estimates were derived using the guidance provided in staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 restructuring and impairment charges  eitf no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring and fasb no 
accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
these reserves were based upon management s estimate of the time required to sublet the property and the amount of sublet income that might be generated between the date the property was not occupied and expiration of the lease for the unoccupied property 
these estimates are reviewed and revised quarterly and may result in a substantial increase or decrease to restructuring expense should different conditions prevail than were anticipated in original management estimates 
valuation allowance for doubtful accounts we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current creditworthiness  as determined by our review of their current credit information 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based on a percentage of our accounts receivable  our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and appropriate reserves have been established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have experienced in the past 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of revenue and or expenses for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
income taxes in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating actual current tax exposures together with assessing tax credits and with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within the consolidated balance sheet 
we then assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we include an expense within the tax provision in our consolidated statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  income tax credits  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we have recorded a valuation allowance due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize some of our deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of the utilization of certain net operating loss carry forwards and foreign tax credits before they expire 
the valuation allowance is based on estimates of taxable income by the jurisdictions in which we operate and the period over which deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance  which could impact our financial position and results of operations 
valuation of long lived assets we have assessed the recoverability of long lived assets  including intangible assets other than goodwill  by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted future cash flows according to the guidance of sfas no 
accounting for the impairment of disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
superceded sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets in we assess the realizability of long lived assets  including intangibles in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
we assess the impairment of goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  which became effective in for assets to be held and used  including acquired intangibles  we initiate our review annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long lived asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of an asset is measured by comparison of its carrying amount to the expected future undiscounted cash flows without interest charges that the asset is expected to generate 
any impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 
significant management judgment is required in the forecasting of future operating results which are used in the preparation of projected discounted cash flows and should different conditions prevail  material write downs of net intangible assets and or goodwill could occur 
it is reasonably possible that the estimates of anticipated future gross revenue  the remaining estimated economic life of the products and technologies  or both  could differ from those used to assess the recoverability of these costs and result in a write down of the carrying amount or a shortened life of acquired intangibles in the future 
as of and for the years ended december  and  we have no goodwill balance and no impairment of intangibles was recorded 
for the year ended december   we recorded goodwill and work force impairments 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
results of operations revenues are generated from three primary sources sale of new software licenses  services  which include consulting services and training services  and maintenance  which includes software license updates and customer technical support 
software license revenues represent all fees earned from granting customers licenses to use our technology and applications software and exclude revenues derived from software license updates  which are included in maintenance revenue 
the vast majority of our software license arrangements include software license updates and product support  which are recognized ratably over the terms of the arrangement  typically one year 
software license updates provide customers with rights to unspecified software product upgrades  maintenance releases and patches released during the term of the support period 
product support services include internet access to technical content  as well as internet and telephone access to technical support personnel 
software license updates and product support are priced as a percentage of the net new software license fees 
most of our customers renew the software license updates and product support rights annually 
cost of license revenue consists primarily of fees payable on third party software  inventory write downs and amortization of purchased technology 
cost of service and maintenance revenue consists primarily of compensation and related overhead costs from employees engaged in consulting and training services  software license updates and customer technical support  and amounts paid to subcontractors 
our operating expenses are classified into seven general categories sales and marketing  research and development  general and administrative  amortization of goodwill and workforce  non cash compensation  restructuring charges and asset impairments 
we classify all charges to these operating expense categories based on the nature of the expenditures 
the sales and marketing  research and development  general and administrative categories consist primarily of the following expenses compensation  employee benefits  recruiting costs  equipment costs  travel and entertainment costs  insurance  facilities costs and third party professional services fees 
we allocate the total costs for information technology services and facilities to each functional area that uses information technology services and facilities based on headcount 
these allocated costs include rent and other facility related costs for our offices  communication charges and depreciation expense for property and equipment  and computer hardware and software maintenance 
from our inception through december   we have incurred approximately million of operating expenses  including million of restructuring charges and million of asset impairments 
approximately million of research and development expenditures were used to develop our current and future software products 
costs incurred in the research and development of software products are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility has been established  which usually occurs close to the completion of the software 
once established  these costs would be capitalized 
amounts that could have been capitalized were insignificant and  therefore  no software development costs have been capitalized to date 
as a result of these and other operating expenditures  we have incurred net operating losses in each year since inception 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our historical operating results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as being indicative of future performance 
our prospects must be considered in light of the risks  expenses and difficulties frequently experienced by companies in early stages of development  particularly companies in new and rapidly changing markets 
we have experienced both significant revenue growth and revenue declines in the past 
furthermore  we may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future

for the year ended december   we evaluated the third party software and wrote off  of excess inventory caused by lower than expected demand in for the year ended december   we continued to assess the remaining carrying value of the inventory in relation to recovery of future revenues and wrote off the remaining service revenue service revenue declined in from professional service revenue remained at higher levels in the first two quarters of as our service contracts supported the relatively large license contracts recorded in late were delivered 
these service contracts declined substantially in the latter half of maintenance revenue maintenance revenue increased from to the increased maintenance revenue was primarily due to increases in licenses revenue in over  an increase in support contract renewals and a one time benefit from fees paid by customers or third party resellers to reinstate support contracts

further reductions to service costs were attributed to the reassignment of certain professional services employees to support the sales organization 
these decreases were offset by an increase in consulting costs in of million from the use of subcontractors in order to meet the demand of certain customers as the level of consulting contracts increased again in the latter half of the cost of maintenance revenue decreased million from to this decrease was primarily due to the decrease in payroll and related costs from the reduction of six employees during the january and august reductions in force

versus the increase from to was primarily attributable to the million increase in payroll and related expenses and a million increase in external consulting service 
the increase in research and development expenses from to reflects our continuing efforts and investment to develop and deliver enhancements to our core speech engine products  to develop and deliver our new nvp product and ncs application product 
headcount for research and development personnel increased by employees  approximately  from employees at december  to employees at december  versus the decrease in research and development expenses from to was primarily due to the reduction of research and development personnel from the january and august reductions in force  which resulted in a decrease in payroll and related costs of million 
other factors that contributed to the decrease were the decrease in amortization costs for purchased technology of million following the december  write down of the impaired intangible asset and the decrease in infrastructure headcount related costs of million 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for administrative employees  legal services  accounting services and other general corporate expenses 
versus the decreases from to was primarily attributable to decreases in external consulting services  decreases in payroll and related overhead costs as a result of the headcount reduction in the first quarter  the third quarter and the third quarter  as well as the decreases in rent  partially offset by the increases in audit and tax services 
in  we realized the full benefit of the reduction in force actions taken in headcount for general and administrative personnel decreased by employees  a reduction of approximately  from employees at december  to employees at december  versus the increase from to was primarily the result of the increase in insurance costs 
additionally  there was also an increase in payroll related costs 
while there was a reduction of general and administrative personnel resulting from the january and august reductions in force  the cost savings benefit on payroll related expenses was not fully realized in as majority of the general and administrative personnel reductions occurred late in august amortization of goodwill and workforce we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no

accounting for stock issued to employees 
accordingly  we record deferred stock compensation equal to the difference between the grant price and fair value of our common stock on the date of grant 
in connection with the grant of stock options prior to our initial public offering  we recorded deferred stock compensation of approximately million within stockholders equity  representing the difference between the estimated fair value of the common stock for accounting purposes and the option exercise price of these options at the date of grant 
this amount is presented as a reduction of stockholders equity and is being amortized over the vesting period of the applicable options 
relating to approximately  stock options granted before our initial public offering at a weighted average exercise price of  for the years ended december   and  we recorded amortization of deferred compensation of million  million and million respectively 
during the same periods  we reversed excess amortization of deferred stock compensation due to termination of employees of million  million and million  resulting in no net expense for deferred compensation  million and million  respectively 
for the year ended december   we reversed approximately million of deferred stock compensation into additional paid in capital  representing unamortized deferred stock compensation relating to forfeitures of stock options by terminated employees 
deferred stock compensation was fully amortized as of december  in connection with our speechfront acquisition  we recorded deferred stock compensation of million 
this amount was part of the purchase agreement and was payable to the founders in common stock  equivalent to approximately  shares at acquisition date  and contingent upon their continued employment 
of that amount  million of stock  equivalent to approximately  shares at acquisition date  related to retention of the founders of speechfront and was released from escrow on the eighteen month anniversary of the acquisition date  which was may the remaining million of stock  equivalent to approximately  shares at acquisition date  also related to retention of the founders and was released from escrow on the twelve month anniversary of the acquisition date  which was november these amounts were amortized over months and months  respectively 
by may  the speechfront founders had been issued all  shares of common stock 
amortization expense related to these deferred compensation amounts were million and million for and speechfront related deferred compensation was fully amortized as of december  in december  we issued a warrant to a customer to purchase  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share subject to certain anti dilution adjustments 
the warrant was exercisable at the option of the holder  in whole or part  at any time between january and august in january  we valued the warrant at million  utilizing the black scholes valuation model using the following assumptions risk free interest rate of  expected dividend yields of zero  expected life of years and expected volatility of

 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation 
restructuring charges and asset impairments restructuring on headcount level we had full time employees as of december  in  our board of directors approved a restructuring plan to align our expenses with revised anticipated demand and create a more efficient organization 
as a result  we reduced our workforce by employees  with reductions ranging between and across all functional areas and affecting several locations 
in  in conjunction with the january and august restructuring plans approved by our board of directors  we reduced our workforce by another and employees  respectively  primarily to realign the sales organization  to align our cost structure with changing market conditions and to create a more efficient organization 
in august  we reduced our general and administrative workforce by  or employees  to further realign the organization to the company s structure 
we will continue to evaluate our resource and skills requirements and adjust our staffing appropriately 
we may  in the future be required to increase our workforce to respond to changes or growth in our business  and as a result may need to expand our operational and human resources  as well as information systems and controls  to support any such growth 
such expansion may place significant demands on our management and operational resources 
restructuring charges based on different plans fiscal year in april  with board of directors approval  we implemented a restructure plan to align our expenses with revised anticipated demand and create a more efficient organization 
in connection with the restructuring plan  we recorded a restructuring charge of million for lease loss and severance costs and an asset impairment charge of million on tenant improvements during in connection with the restructuring plan  we decided not to occupy a new leased facility pacific shores lease 
this decision has resulted in a lease loss of million for the year ended december   comprised of a sublease loss  broker commissions and other facility costs 
to determine the sublease loss  the loss after our cost recovery efforts from subleasing the building  certain assumptions were made related to the time period over which the building will remain vacant sublease terms and sublease rates 
we established the reserves at the low end of the range of estimable cost against outstanding commitments  net of estimated future sublease income 
these estimates were derived using the guidance provided in sab no 
 restructuring and impairment charges  and eitf no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
the lease loss was increased in august and september as described below and will continue to be adjusted in the future upon triggering events change in estimate of time to sublease  actual sublease rates  etc we recorded million in costs for the year ended december  associated with severance and related benefits 
fiscal year in january  with board of directors approval  we implemented a restructuring plan to reduce our workforce 
the restructuring was primarily to realign the sales and professional services organizations 
we recorded a restructuring charge of million during the three months ended march   consisting primarily of payroll and related expenses associated with reducing headcount 
this amount was paid out as of december  in august  with board of directors approval  we implemented a restructuring plan to reduce our worldwide workforce to realign our expense structure with near term market opportunities 
in connection with the reduction of workforce  we recorded a charge of million primarily for severance and related employee termination costs 
as of december   it was fully paid out 
for the third quarter  we also reversed an excess accrual for this restructuring plan  which resulted in recording of million as a credit to the restructuring charge line in the consolidated statement of operations 
the plan also included the consolidation of facilities through the closing of certain international offices that resulted in a charge of million 
in addition  we recorded an increase in the our previously reported real estate restructuring accrual related to the new leased facility we do not occupy and which has not been subleased as a result of continued declines in the condition of the san francisco bay area real estate market 
this additional charge of million resulted from an analysis of the time period during which the california property is likely to remain vacant  sub lease terms and sub lease rates  altogether reflecting continued softening of the local real estate market 
fiscal year in the third quarter  we reviewed the earlier estimate for the lease loss for the unoccupied leased facility and the condition of the san francisco bay area real estate market 
we estimated that it might take an additional months to sublease this unoccupied facility 
we also lowered the estimates for the expected sublease rates 
this evaluation resulted in recording an additional lease loss of million and was recorded as part of the restructuring charges on the consolidated statement of operations 
for the third quarter  we reduced our general and administrative workforce to realign the organization to our structure 
we recorded a restructuring charge of million primarily for severance and termination costs relating to the reduction in workforce 
as of december   severance was fully paid out 
in addition  we reversed the excess accrual for the august restructuring plan  which resulted in a million credit to the restructuring charge line in the consolidated statement of operations 
the restructuring charges and year end balances for the year ended december  are as follows in thousands lease loss severance related asset write down total restructuring plan total charges for the year ending december    amount utilized in the year ending december   accrual balance at december   total charges for the year ending december   amount utilized in the year ended december   balance at december   total charges for the year ending december   amount utilized in the year ending december   balance at december   current restructuring accrual  long term restructuring accrual  q plan total charges for the year ending december   amount utilized in the year ending december  balance at december  q plan total charges for the year ending december   amount utilized in the year ending december  balance at december  total charges for the year ending december  amount utilized in the year ending december  balance at december  current restructuring accrual q plan total charges for the year ending december  amount utilized in the year ending december  balance at december  current restructuring accrual balance at december  all restructuring plans total restructuring accrual current   total restructuring accrual long term  we expect the total cash outlay for the restructuring plans to be million  of which million was paid through december  and million remains accrued at december  we expect million of the lease loss to be paid out over the next twelve months and remaining million to be paid out over the remaining life of the lease of approximately years 
we have recorded a lease loss related to future lease commitments of our pacific shores lease  net of expected sublease income 
however  under the condition of the san francisco bay area real estate market  we may be required to periodically reevaluate the components of the expected sublease income  because it affects the estimated lease loss for the unoccupied leased facility 
specifically  we are required to reevaluate the time that it might take to sublease this unoccupied facility  as well as the expected sublease rates 
this evaluation may result in additional lease loss  and would likely increase the restructuring charges on the consolidated statement of operations 
asset impairments in  in connection with the august restructuring plan  we wrote off certain fixed assets as a result of consolidating and closing of certain international offices and recorded an asset impairment charge of million 
in february  we received cash and recorded an asset impairment credit of million related to a refund of tenant improvement costs for the building we do not occupy  following the landlord s reconciliation of tenant improvement costs 
this credit was recorded in restructuring charges and asset impairments in the consolidated statements of operations 
in connection with the acquisition of speechfront  inc speechfront on november   we allocated approximately million of the purchase price to in process research and development projects 
at december   we reviewed the current value of the recorded assets relating to the speechfront acquisition based on existing business conditions and determined that the voice instant messaging system technologies under development during the year were not aligned with our revised strategy and will not be utilized 
as a result  we impaired the intangible assets and recorded a charge of million 
the total asset impairment recorded in was million  which includes impairments of goodwill and work force related to speechfront of million charge details above  the intangibles related to the purchased technology of million charge and the asset impairment charge of million on tenant improvements 
acquisitions we had no acquisitions in in august  we purchased a set of two patents for  the patents are being amortized over the estimated useful life of five years 
the amortization for and are  and  respectively 
they were included in the research and development expense line of the consolidated statement of operations 
during  we entered into an agreement with a third party that gives us non exclusive intellectual property rights to text to speech software code 
we paid million for this purchased technology  which was capitalized and is being amortized over its estimated useful life of five years 
we amortized million to research and development in we also performed an impairment analysis for the year ended december  the asset was impaired and was written down by million to its estimated fair value based on estimated discounted future cash flows 
for each of the years ended december  and  we amortized million 
the agreement includes a royalty clause whereby we pay of all net revenue attributable to sublicenses of this technology to a third party 
the term of the royalty payments is eight years 
there was no royalty payable for the years ended december   and interest and other income  net interest and other income  net  consists primarily of interest income earned on cash and cash equivalents  short term and long term investments  interest expense  currency gain loss related to the remeasurement of certain balance sheet accounts  and other miscellaneous items 
the year to year decrease in interest and other income  net was mainly caused by the reduction of interest income  resulting from lower cash balances and decreased interest rates 
provision for benefit from income taxes we recorded state and foreign income tax for the years ended december    and of million  million and million  respectively 
for the year ended december   we recorded a tax benefit of million of state and foreign taxes  of which million resulted from the reversal of a prior year accrual related to tax assessments and penalties from the france tax authorities for the tax years ended december   and  thereby settling all claims for those years 
in addition  we recorded a tax benefit of million due to the recognition of research and development tax credits from our canadian operations 
a valuation allowance of million was required for the total gross deferred tax asset for the period ended december  based upon our limited operating history  our lack of profitability to date  and the uncertainty of future profitability at that time 
management believes it is more likely than not that we will realize a deferred tax benefit of million from deferred tax assets 
our income taxes payable for federal and state purposes has been reduced  and the deferred tax assets increased  by the tax benefits associated with taxable dispositions of employee stock options 
when an employee exercises a stock option issued under a nonqualified plan or has a disqualifying disposition related to a qualified plan  we receive an income tax benefit calculated as the difference between the fair market value of the stock issued at the time of the exercise and the option price  tax effected 
a portion of the valuation allowance relates to the equity benefit of our net operating losses 
we had approximately million  million  and million of taxable dispositions of employee stock options for the years ended december   and  respectively 
a portion of the valuation allowance  when reduced  will be credited directly to stockholders equity 
liquidity and capital resources overall our financial position remained strong at december   with cash and cash equivalents of million and short term investments of approximately million 
we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents  short term investment and other financing capabilities will be sufficient to satisfy our working capital  capital expenditure and other liquidity needs through we have incurred losses since our inception  including a net loss of approximately million for the year ended december  as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
cash  cash equivalents and short term investments cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments in time deposits held at major banks  commercial paper  united states government agency notes and bonds  money market mutual funds and other money market securities with original maturities of days or less 
short term investments include similar highly liquid investments that mature by december  the decrease in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments in was primarily due to the use of cash for our operating activities 
the largest use of cash from investing activity was million for purchase of investments 
the largest generation of cash from financing activity was the proceeds of million from the sale of common stock through the employee stock purchase plan and through the exercise of stock options 
net cash used in operating activities our operating activities used cash of million  million and million during  and  respectively 
in  accounts receivables used cash of million  increased million from million in the increase of cash usage in accounts receivable from to was mainly due to higher revenue amounts and a longer collection cycle from to in  accrued liability and other long term liabilities used cash of million versus million in  mainly due to income tax payable decreasing from million in to million in  as a result of the tax benefit of million of state and foreign taxes  of which million resulted from the reversal of a prior year accrual related to tax assessments and penalties from the france tax authorities for tax years ended december   and unrelated to the french tax  we recorded a tax benefit of million due to the recognition of research and development tax credits from our canadian operations 
the negative operating cash flow in resulted principally from our net losses  partially offset by an increase in the restructuring accrual 
the negative operating cash flow in resulted principally from our net losses  partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable and an increase in the restructuring accrual and the asset impairments 
we adopted sfas no 
effective january  sfas no 
had no effect for the year ended december  as all previously acquired goodwill was impaired or written off as of december  and no goodwill was acquired in this was the primary cause of the decline for amortization of goodwill and intangible assets line  which decreased from million in to million in to million in net cash provided by used in investing activities our investing activities provided cash of million in  and used cash of million and million for and  respectively 
the use of cash for investing activities in and and relates primarily to purchases of investments  offset by the maturities of certain portion of investments 
another use of cash related to the purchase of property and equipment 
investments in property and equipment continued to decrease from million in to in million to million in the decrease over the years was driven by our overall strategy of tight spending controls and cash conservation 
the majority of the property and equipment purchases were related to our investments in speech technology computer equipment  some of which were contributing to new product development 
we estimate the total cash outlays in for these initiatives will be approximately million 
net cash provided by financing activities our financing activities generated cash of million  million and million during  and respectively 
net cash provided by financing activities in  and related primarily to the proceeds from the sale of common stock through the employee stock purchase plan and through the exercise of stock options 
in  the proceeds from the sale of common stock through the employee stock purchase plan and through the exercise of stock options were million and million  respectively 
in  the proceeds from the sale of common stock through the employee stock purchase plan and through the exercise of stock options were million and million  respectively 
in  the proceeds from the sale of common stock through the employee stock purchase plan and through the exercise of stock options were million and million  respectively 
other we have contractual commitments for non cancelable operating leases 
we provide letters of credit as guarantees on these leases 
the letter of credits underlying amount are presented as restricted cash on consolidated balance sheet 
as of december   restricted cash balance was million 
it consisted of a million certificate of deposit required by the landlord as a rent deposit for our pacific shore lease in california and  related to our montreal lease 
except for this  we had no material guarantees or commitments

however  as a result of the condition of the san francisco bay area real estate market  we may be required to periodically reevaluate the components of the expected sublease income  because it affects the estimated lease loss for the unoccupied leased facility 
specifically  we are required to reevaluate the time that it might take to sublease this unoccupied facility  as well as the expected sublease rates 
this evaluation may result in additional lease losses 
off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business  we enter into contractual commitments to purchase materials and components from suppliers in exchange for favorable pricing or more beneficial terms 
these non cancelable purchase obligations for materials were not material as of december  capital expenditures our capital requirements depend on numerous factors 
we may continue to report significant quarterly operating losses resulting in future negative operating cash flows 
we do not plan to spend more than million on capital expenditures in the next months 
we believe that our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to fund our activities for at least the next months 
thereafter  we may need to raise additional funds in order to fund more rapid expansion  including increases in employees and office facilities  to develop new or enhance existing products or services  to respond to competitive pressures  or to acquire or invest in complementary businesses  technologies  services or products 
additional funding may not be available on favorable terms or at all 
in addition  we may  from time to time  evaluate potential acquisitions of other businesses  products and technologies 
we may also consider additional equity or debt financing  which could be dilutive to existing investors

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk the following section describes our exposure to market risk related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
this section contains forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
actual results could vary materially as a result of a number of factors including those set forth in the risk factors section of this annual report on form k 
foreign currency exchange rate risk to date  all of our recognized revenues have been denominated in us dollars and primarily from customers in the united states  and our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate changes has been immaterial 
we expect  however  that future product license and services revenues derived from international markets may be denominated in the currency of the applicable market 
as a result  our operating results may become subject to significant fluctuations based upon changes in the exchange rates of certain currencies in relation to the us dollar 
furthermore  to the extent that we engage in international sales denominated in us dollars  an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products less competitive in international markets 
although we will continue to monitor our exposure to currency fluctuations  and when appropriate  may use financial hedging techniques to minimize the effect of these fluctuations  we cannot assure you that exchange rate fluctuations will not adversely affect our financial results in the future 
interest rate risk as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million 
any decline in interest rates over time would reduce our interest income from our short term and long term investments 
based upon our balance of cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and long term investments  an absolute reduction in interest rates of would cause a corresponding decrease in our annual interest income by approximately million
