item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this annual report on this form k 
description of the company we are a biopharmaceutical company engaged in the development and commercialization of a diversified portfolio of product candidates  including multiple compounds in late stage clinical development 
we currently market sanctura for oab  and have four compounds in clinical development pagoclone for anxiety disorders  ip for pain and inflammatory disorders  pro for the prevention of infection by hiv and other sexually transmitted pathogens  and aminocandin for treatment of systemic fungal infections 
our primary therapeutic focus is in urology  gynecology and infectious diseases 
significant product developments in fiscal sanctura on may   our nda for sanctura was approved by the fda for the treatment of oab 
on april   we entered into the pliva agreement for the us commercialization of sanctura 
we granted pliva an exclusive right and license to co promote and sell sanctura in the united states 
the pliva agreement provides for payments to us from pliva  including million received in fiscal  million upon signing and million upon fda approval of sanctura twice daily 
in addition  we could receive up to million in future payments contingent upon the achievement of certain milestones related to the development of a once a day formulation of sanctura  as well as a payment of million related to the achievement of a long term commercialization milestone in for the first six months following the approval of sanctura  we received a commission based on net sales of sanctura 
during this period  we were responsible for funding our own sales force and certain advertising and promotional costs  and pliva and we co promoted sanctura through a joint sales force of approximately sales representatives 
we established a sales force initially numbering approximately representatives promoting sanctura to urology specialists  obstetricians and gynecologists  and certain primary care physicians 
on september   we made formal notification to pliva with respect to the termination of the co promotion period of the agreement  thereby converting the agreement into a royalty bearing structure 
the conversion became effective on november  under this royalty bearing structure  we receive royalties from pliva based on net sales of sanctura  and pliva is responsible for promotional and advertising costs 
additionally  our specialty sales force consisting of approximately sales representatives will be subsidized by pliva for the three years commencing november  and is continuing to promote sanctura to urology specialists  obstetricians and gynecologists  and other high prescribers 
pursuant to the nda  the sanctura finished product is being manufactured by our licensor  madaus ag madaus  at their manufacturing facility in germany 
we launched sanctura in august under the pliva agreement  we are responsible for funding the development of the once a day formulation of sanctura 
while we are responsible for the manufacture of sanctura and sell it to pliva at cost  pliva is responsible for product inventory management and sales order fulfillment including billing and collecting of customer receivables 
the pliva agreement is subject to termination by pliva under certain circumstances 
under the pliva agreement  we granted a security interest to pliva in our fda marketing authorizations or approvals relating to sanctura and agreed to indemnify pliva under certain circumstances 
our current formulation of sanctura is twice a day 
in march  we signed an exclusive agreement with shire under which shire is developing extended release formulations of sanctura 
we have completed pharmacokinetic and safety studies with several once a day formulations  and we expect to begin phase ii clinical trials with a lead formulation  to be known as sanctura xr  in the first half of calendar year  to be followed by the initiation of a phase iii clinical program with this formulation planned later in aminocandin in june  we announced that aminocandin  under development as a treatment for systemic fungal infections  was well tolerated among healthy volunteers in a phase i clinical trial and demonstrated a prolonged duration of antifungal activity following single dose administration 
the trial was designed to test the safety and tolerance of rising single doses of intravenously administered aminocandin among approximately healthy volunteers 
secondary objectives included the pharmacokinetic assessment of aminocandin in plasma and urine  and the determination of serum fungicidal activity 
dose levels achieved during this trial were approximately seven fold higher than the anticipated clinical dose and were all well tolerated 
of particular note was the absence of infusion related histamine reactions  a recognized effect of other drugs in the echinocandin class  and the lack of a significant infusion associated rise in plasma histamine levels  even at the highest doses and concentrations of administered drug 
furthermore  following single intravenous doses  significant fungicidal activity was observed in patients serum samples for up to one week 
on october   we announced the initiation of a multi dose phase i trial of aminocandin 
this trial tests the safety  tolerability and pharmacokinetics of raising multiple doses of aminocandin among healthy volunteers 
in addition  the in vitro activity of aminocandin will be evaluated in serum samples from trial subjects 
the study is ongoing and results of this trial will help optimize the dosing level and regimen for further clinical testing  including phase ii clinical trials expected to begin in citicoline effective january   we entered into a new agreement with ferrer covering the development  manufacture  and marketing of citicoline in the us and canada 
under the terms of the new agreement  we have granted ferrer exclusive rights to our patents and know how related to citicoline 
in exchange  ferrer agreed to assume all future development  manufacturing  and commercialization costs of citicoline 
we will receive of all milestone payments made to ferrer by a third party and royalties on net sales of the product 
this new agreement allows us to retain significant participation in the future economics of citicoline  should the product be approved and marketed in the us and canada  without incurring any further costs 
in october  ivax corporation announced a licensing arrangement with ferrer for citicoline 
under the terms of this arrangement  ivax will be responsible for fulfilling the requirements for fda approval of citicoline for acute stroke and for commercializing citicoline in the us significant judgments and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reported periods 
these items are regularly monitored and analyzed by management for changes in facts and circumstances  and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future 
changes in estimates are recorded in the period in which they become known 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from our estimates if past experience or other assumptions do not turn out to be substantially accurate 
expected term of the pliva agreement and deferred revenue the initial million payment received from pliva and the million payment received from pliva upon receipt of fda approval to market sanctura are significant and we are recording the initial and milestone payments received from pliva as deferred revenue and amortizing each of these components into revenue under the contingency adjusted method over the estimated remaining duration of the pliva agreement commencing on the date earned 
we believe the estimated term of the pliva agreement is a significant estimate which affects revenue recognized and the balance of deferred revenue on our balance sheet and we explain our estimate of the expected twelve year term of the pliva agreement below 
the pliva agreement expires on the later of i the twelfth th anniversary of the launch date of sanctura twice daily or ii the expiration of the last to expire patent included in the indevus patent rights covering sanctura once daily 
securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
sab specifies that unless evidence suggests otherwise  service revenues should be recognized over the contractual term of the arrangement or the expected period over which services are expected to be performed  if longer 
we considered the following factors in evaluating the expected duration of the pliva agreement sanctura twice daily does not have marketing protection afforded by patents and is currently being marketed pursuant to five years of market exclusivity provided by the waxman hatch act  the potential of success in developing sanctura once daily including the filing of an nda and ultimate approval by the fda to market sanctura once daily  the potential of success in obtaining approval of patents covering sanctura once daily and the protection such patents may afford  if protection from patents was not obtained for sanctura once daily  the potential benefit of any reliance on market exclusivity that may be provided by the waxman hatch act  the strong competition in the overactive bladder market including from large pharmaceutical companies 
after considering all of the above  we estimated the expected term of the pliva agreement to be twelve years  consistent with the negotiated minimum term of the arrangement of twelve years from launch of sanctura 
in the event development of sanctura once daily was terminated prior to approval for marketing by the fda the expected term of the arrangement would likely be less than twelve years 
in the event sanctura once daily is approved for marketing by the fda  achieves an acceptable measure of market success  and we are able to obtain and benefit from patent protection for sanctura once daily  the term of the arrangement may extend beyond the estimated twelve years 
we amortized  of deferred revenue into contract and license fee revenue in fiscal and the balance of deferred revenue at september  is  we will reevaluate our estimate of the expected term of the pliva agreement when new information is known that could affect this estimate 
if we change our estimate of the duration of the pliva agreement in the future and extend or reduce our estimate of its duration  we would decrease or increase  respectively  the amount of periodic revenue to be recognized from the amortization of remaining deferred revenue 
insurance claim receivable as of september   we had an outstanding insurance claim of approximately  for services rendered through may  by the group of law firms defending us in the redux related product liability litigation 
the full amount of our current outstanding insurance claim is made pursuant to our product liability policy issued to us by reliance insurance company reliance  which is in liquidation proceedings 
based upon discussions with our attorneys and other consultants regarding the amount and timing of potential collection of our claim on reliance  we previously recorded a reserve against our outstanding and estimated claim receivable from reliance to reduce the balance to the estimated net realizable value of  reflecting our best estimate given the available facts and circumstances 
we believe our reserve of approximately  against the insurance claim on reliance as of september  is a significant estimate reflecting management s judgment 
to the extent we do not collect the insurance claim receivable of  we would be required to record additional charges 
alternatively  if we collect amounts in excess of the current receivable balance  we would record a credit for the additional funds received in the statement of operations 
redux related liabilities in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we reduced our estimate of the amount of redux related expenses  including legal expenses  remaining due  in part  to a decline in the amount of actual payments during as a result  we reduced our accrued liability for redux related expenses by approximately  and reflected this reduction as a credit in marketing  general and administrative expense 
at september   we have an accrued liability of approximately  for such redux related expenses  including legal expenses 
the amounts we ultimately pay could differ significantly from the amount currently accrued at september  to the extent the amounts paid differ from the amounts accrued  we will record a charge or credit to the statement of operations 
significant accounting policy revenue recognition product revenue consists of revenues from sales of products  royalties and commissions 
contract and license fee revenue consists of revenue stemming from contractual initial and milestone payments received from customers  including amortization of deferred revenue from contractual payments  reimbursements from pliva for their share of sanctura promotion and advertising costs incurred by the company less an amount owed by the company to pliva for the company s share of sanctura promotion and advertising costs incurred by pliva  sales force subsidies from pliva  reimbursements from pliva for royalties owed by the company to madaus  and grants from agencies supporting research and development activities 
the company records sales of product as product revenue upon the later of shipment or as title passes to its customer 
in fiscal  the company commenced selling sanctura to pliva in bottles for resale and blister packs for distribution as samples see note n of notes to consolidated financial statements 
royalty revenue consists of payments received from licensees for a portion of sales proceeds from products that utilize the company s licensed technologies and are generally reported to the company in a royalty report on a specified periodic basis 
royalty revenue is recognized in the period in which the sales of the product or technology occurred on which the royalties are based unless the royalty report for such period is received subsequent to the time the company is required to report its results on form q or form k and the amount of the royalties earned is not estimable  in which case the company recognizes such royalty revenue in the subsequent accounting period when it receives the royalty report and when the amount of and basis for such royalty payments are reported to the company in accurate and appropriate form and in accordance with the related license agreement 
the company s business strategy includes entering into collaborative license and development or co promotion agreements with strategic partners for the development and commercialization of the company s products or product candidates 
the terms of the agreements typically include non refundable license fees  funding of research and development  payments based upon achievement of certain milestones and royalties on net product sales 
non refundable license fees are recognized as revenue when the company has a contractual right to receive such payment  the contract price is fixed or determinable  the collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured and the company has no further performance obligations under the license agreement 
in multiple element arrangements where the company has continuing performance obligations  license fees are recognized together with any up front payment over the term of the arrangement as the company completes its performance obligations  unless the delivered technology has stand alone value to the customer and there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value of the undelivered elements in the arrangement 
the company records such revenue as contract and license fee revenue 
revenues from milestone payments related to arrangements under which the company has continuing performance obligations are recognized as revenue upon achievement of the milestone only if all of the following conditions are met the milestone payments are non refundable  achievement of the milestone was not reasonably assured at the inception of the arrangement  substantive effort is involved in achieving the milestone  and the amount of the milestone is reasonable in relation to the effort expended or the risk associated with achievement of the milestone 
determination as to whether a milestone meets the aforementioned conditions involves management s judgment 
if any of these conditions are not met  the milestone payments are deferred and recognized as revenue over the term of the arrangement as the company completes its performance obligations 
revenues from milestone payments related to arrangements under which the company has no continuing performance obligations are recognized upon achievement of the related milestone 
the company records such revenue as contract and license fee revenue 
contractual subsidies of ongoing expenses are recorded as contract and license fee revenue 
under the pliva agreement  the initial and subsequent milestone payments  once earned  are recognized as contract and license fee revenue using the contingency adjusted performance model 
under this model  when a milestone is earned  revenue is immediately recognized on a pro rata basis in the period the company achieves the milestone based on the time elapsed from inception of the agreement to the time the milestone is earned over the estimated duration of the pliva agreement 
going forward  the remaining portion of the milestone payment is recognized on a straight line basis over the remaining estimated duration of the pliva agreement 
multiple element arrangements are evaluated pursuant to eitf  accounting revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
pursuant to eitf  in multiple element arrangements where we have continuing performance obligations  contract  milestone and license fees are recognized together with any up front payments over the term of the arrangement as we complete our performance obligation  unless the delivered technology has stand alone value to the customer and there is objective  reliable evidence of fair value of the undelivered element in the arrangement 
in the case of an arrangement where it is determined there is a single unit of accounting  all cash flows from the arrangement are considered in the determination of all revenue to be recognized 
additionally  pursuant to the guidance of securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin sab  unless evidence suggests otherwise  revenue from consideration received is recognized on a straight line basis over the expected term of the arrangements 
in particular relating to the pliva agreement see note n  the company and pliva are contractually bound to share certain promotion and advertising costs relating to sanctura 
for promotion and advertising costs incurred by the company  reimbursements from pliva for pliva s share are reflected in contract and license fee revenue 
for promotion and advertising costs incurred by pliva  reimbursements to pliva fur the company s share ware reflected as a reduction of contract and license fee revenue 
cash received in advance of revenue recognition is recorded as deferred revenue 
results of operations fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal year ended september our net loss increased  to  or per share  basic  in fiscal from  or per share  basic  in fiscal this increased net loss is primarily the result of our product launch and marketing of sanctura total revenues increased  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal this increase is primarily attributable to  of revenues pursuant to the pliva agreement offset by  of reduced revenues from lilly for sarafem 
product revenue increased  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal this increase is primarily attributable to sales of sanctura to pliva in fiscal which were  including  related to sales of samples 
this increase was partially offset by royalty revenue from lilly which decreased  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal  which included  of accelerated sales milestones which were one time payments and did not recur 
contract and license fee revenue increased  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal contract and license fees in fiscal relate almost entirely to the pliva agreement and include  from amortization of deferred revenue using the contingency adjusted method from pliva and  net reimbursement due to us comprised of  of pliva s share of sanctura promotion and advertising costs incurred by us less  owed by us to pliva for our share of sanctura promotion and advertising costs incurred by pliva 
fiscal contract and license fees consist primarily of  from an initial payment received from lilly related to the renegotiated agreement for sarafem 
cost of product revenue increased substantially in fiscal to  from  in fiscal fiscal cost of product revenue relates primarily to sales of sanctura which we sell to pliva at our cost 
also included in cost of product revenue in fiscal is approximately  of royalties we owe to massachusetts institute of technology for their portion of the royalties and contractual payments received from lilly 
this is a decrease of  or  from  included in fiscal cost of product revenue resulting from the reduction of revenue from lilly as described above 
research and development expense decreased  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal development costs related to sanctura decreased approximately  due to decreased costs related to sanctura twice daily and other development costs partially offset by increased development costs for sanctura once daily  including  of milestone payments in fiscal to shire which is developing once a day formulations of sanctura 
further contributing to the decrease were license fees in fiscal of  paid to aventis for aminocandin and  related to the transactions that resulted in our licensing ip directly from the owner of the intellectual property rights 
in fiscal  we extended the expiration dates of certain stock option grants to an officer which resulted in a noncash charge of approximately  to research and development expense and caused an increase in research and development expense 
increased staffing in fiscal resulted in approximately  of additional personnel costs and increased development activities related primarily to aminocandin  ip  dersalazine and pro resulted in approximately  of increased development costs 
total research and development expenses for fiscal substantially relate to our major compounds being developed as follows sanctura  pagoclone  ip  aminocandin  and pro  we also incurred research and development expenses for fiscal of  related to other compounds and initiatives 
marketing  general and administrative expense increased  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal marketing expenses increased  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal fiscal included significantly increased promotion and advertising expenses related to sanctura and the build up of the sales force infrastructure related to the launch and continued marketing of sanctura

in fiscal we also incurred approximately  of expense for a consultant which performed services related to the pliva agreement 
additionally in fiscal  we incurred approximately  of personnel related expense related to increased staffing to provide support services to the expanded company and approximately  of other costs related to the expansion of the company and other increased business activities 
investment income increased  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal this increase is due to higher average invested balances  offset somewhat by lower interest rates 
market interest rates have substantially decreased in fiscal from fiscal  however  due to the receipt of  in the three month period ended june  pursuant to the pliva agreement  average invested balances are substantially higher resulting in an increase in investment income 
interest expense of  and  in fiscal and  respectively  results from our july issuance of  of convertible senior notes due the notes 
annual interest expense includes approximately  of amortization of debt issuance costs 
in fiscal  the  of initial and milestone payments received from pliva in fiscal will be recognized as income for tax purposes  but will continue to be amortized into revenue for financial statement purposes over the expected term of the pliva agreement 
we expect to offset any net taxable income in fiscal with a portion of net operating loss carryforwards 
however due to limitations on the use of net operating loss for federal alternative minimum tax and state taxes we will incur alternative minimum tax and state tax expense in fiscal as a result of the conversion of the pliva agreement into a royalty bearing structure  we expect a reduction in our sales and marketing cost structure effective november  on that date approximately of our sales representatives who have been detailing sanctura to primary care physicians became pliva employees who will continue to detail sanctura to primary care physicians 
we retained approximately sales representatives who will continue detailing sanctura to urology specialists  obstetricians and gynecologists  and certain primary care physicians 
additionally  on november   pliva became financially responsible for all promotion and advertising services related to brand support provided by third parties 
commencing november   pliva will provide us a subsidy for our sales force of approximately  annually 
we will record this subsidy in contract and license fee revenue as earned 
we expect losses in fiscal will decrease as a result of these changes 
fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal year ended september our net loss increased  to  or per share  basic  in fiscal from  or per share  basic  in fiscal this increased net loss is primarily the result of our continued efforts to develop sanctura  including clinical trials  filing of an nda  and development of a once a day formulation  and premarketing activities related to trospium 
total revenues increased  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal product revenue  which comprises of total revenue  relates to royalties and other payments received from lilly for sarafem and increased  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal royalty revenue in fiscal was recognized pursuant to our renegotiated agreement with lilly see note n of notes to consolidated financial statements and includes  from an initial payment received from lilly related to the renegotiated agreement for sarafem and  of accelerated milestone payments received from lilly 
royalty revenue in fiscal was recognized pursuant to our original agreement with lilly and included approximately  of royalty revenue in the three month period ended december  which resulted from sales of sarafem in a higher royalty payment bracket 
contract and license fee revenue of  in fiscal consisted of a research grant related to funding of certain pro development 
contract and license fee revenue of  in fiscal consisted of a  milestone payment from amgen inc amgen related to continuation of development of leptin receptor technology which we licensed to amgen  funding of certain pro development from conrad and other revenue 
cost of revenues of  and  in fiscal and  respectively  consisted primarily of amounts due or paid to mit for their portion of the contractual payments and royalties received from lilly 
research and development expenses increased  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal this increase is primarily related to sanctura and includes increased clinical costs  including costs for the ongoing clinical trial  continuing development of extended release formulations of sanctura  and costs related to the preparation of the nda 
fiscal research and development expenses also include license and contractual payments aggregating  related to aminocandin and pro and increased costs related to the development of pagoclone and ip partially offsetting these increased costs is a decrease in noncash expense related to a stock option grant and modifications of stock option grants to an executive officer of the company in fiscal  a decrease in development expense related to dersalazine due our cessation of development of the compound  and a license fee of  related to ip in fiscal total research and development expenses for fiscal substantially relate to our major compounds being developed as follows sanctura  pagoclone  ip  aminocandin  and pro  we also incurred research and development expenses for fiscal of  related to other compounds and initiatives 
marketing  general and administrative expense increased  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal these increases are primarily due to continuing pre marketing activities for sanctura  and also include costs related to our attendance at the american urological association convention in april in connection with the filing and fda acceptance of the nda for sanctura  we have increased our rate of expenditure for sanctura pre marketing activities 
also contributing to increased marketing  general and administrative expense is higher legal  insurance and other administrative expenses 
partially offsetting these increases is a decrease in noncash expense related to modifications of stock option grants to directors and executive officers of the company in fiscal and other stock option grants to consultants and a reduction of approximately  of our accrued liability for redux related expenses 
investment income decreased  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal these decreases resulted primarily from reduced market interest rates 
interest expense of  in fiscal results from our july issuance of  of notes 
annual interest expense is expected to be approximately  which includes approximately  of amortization of debt issuance costs 
included in other is impairment of equity securities of  in fiscal reflects the write down of our investment in incara  inc incara to fair value as the decline in incara common stock was deemed other than temporary 
liquidity and capital resources cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities at september   we had consolidated cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of  compared to  at september  this increase of  was primarily the result of net cash provided by operating activities of  which included the receipt of  pursuant to the pliva agreement  less  expended on purchases of treasury stock 
we are continuing to invest substantial amounts in the ongoing development and sales and marketing activities related to sanctura 
we are investing in the production of inventories of sanctura and are selling the final product to pliva at cost 
we believe the funds received from pliva under the pliva agreement will be sufficient to meet our obligations for the commercialization of sanctura 
we believe we have sufficient cash for currently planned expenditures for at least the next twelve months 
we may require additional funds or corporate collaborations for the development and commercialization of our other compounds in development  as well as any new businesses  products or technologies acquired or developed in the future 
we have no commitments to obtain such funds 
there can such be no assurance that  if such funds are required  we will be able to obtain additional financing to satisfy future cash requirements on acceptable terms  or at all 
if such additional funds are not obtained  we may be required to delay product development and business development activities 
product development we expect to continue to expend substantial additional amounts for the development of our products 
in particular  we are continuing to expend substantial funds for sanctura  sanctura xr  and other related development efforts 
we could receive up to million in future payments contingent upon the achievement of certain milestones related to the development of sanctura xr 
additionally  after november   pliva is responsible for funding certain phase iv studies that may be conducted 
there can be no assurance that results of any ongoing or future pre clinical or clinical trials will be successful  that additional trials will not be required  that any drug or product under development will receive fda approval in a timely manner or at all  or that such drug or product could be successfully manufactured in accordance with cgmp or successfully marketed in a timely manner  or at all  or that we will have sufficient funds to develop or commercialize any of our products 
we have entered into an agreement with madaus for the manufacture of sanctura 
in order to manufacture sanctura for sale in the united states  madaus manufacturing facility must comply with cgmp requirements 
failure to meet or maintain compliance with cgmp requirements could cause a material disruption of  or cessation in  the commercialization of sanctura 
we may seek a second source for sanctura if madaus is unable to continue to meet all regulatory requirements or provide the necessary quantities of sanctura in a timely manner  this alternate source would require fda approval which may or may not be obtained 
total research and development expenses incurred by us through september  on the major compounds currently being developed or marketed  including allocation of corporate general and administrative expenses  are approximately as follows  for sanctura   for pagoclone   for pro   for aminocandin and  for ip in june  we re acquired rights to pagoclone from pfizer inc during the period pfizer had rights to pagoclone  pfizer conducted and funded all development activities for pagoclone 
estimating costs and time to complete development of a compound is difficult due to the uncertainties of the development process and the requirements of the fda which could necessitate additional and unexpected clinical trials or other development  testing and analysis 
results of any testing could result in a decision to alter or terminate development of a compound  in which case estimated future costs could change substantially 
certain compounds could benefit from subsidies  grants or government or agency sponsored studies that could reduce our development costs 
in the event we were to enter into a licensing or other collaborative agreement with a corporate partner involving sharing  funding or assumption by such corporate partner of development costs  the estimated development costs to be incurred by us could be substantially less than the estimates below 
additionally  research and development costs are extremely difficult to estimate for early stage compounds due to the fact that there is generally less comprehensive data available for such compounds to determine the development activities that would be required prior to the filing of an nda 
given these uncertainties and other risks  variables and considerations related to each compound and regulatory uncertainties in general  we estimate remaining research and development costs  excluding allocation of corporate general and administrative expenses  from september  through the preparation of an nda for our major compounds currently being developed as follows approximately  for pro  approximately  for ip  approximately  for aminocandin  and approximately  for pagoclone 
we cannot reasonably estimate the date of completion for any compound that is not at least in phase iii clinical development due to the uncertainty of the number of required trials and size of such trials and the duration of development 
we are unable to estimate the date of development completion for citicoline because ferrer is now responsible for its development 
we are unable to estimate the date of development completion for pagoclone due to the scope complexity and cost of the type of clinical trials necessary which may require the financial assistance of a partner to complete 
actual costs and time to complete any of our products may differ significantly from the estimates 
analysis of cash flows cash provided by operating activities for fiscal of  consisted primarily of the  received from pliva pursuant to the pliva agreement  of which  was classified as deferred revenue  and the net loss of  we paid  of interest on our convertible notes in fiscal increase in accounts receivable is primarily due to purchases of sanctura by pliva 
accrued expenses and other liabilities increased primarily due to increased marketing and production activities related to sanctura 
net cash used in investing activities of  is primarily due to  of net purchases of marketable securities 
marketable securities are purchased and mature during our normal investment activities related to available funds 
net cash used in financing activities of  is comprised of  used to purchase treasury stock and  net proceeds from the issuance of common stock and treasury stock upon the exercise of stock options and warrant and vestings of grants of common stock pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan 
we cannot predict if or when stock options will be exercised in the future 
other repurchase of common stock on july   we announced that our board of directors had authorized the repurchase from time to time of up to  shares of its common stock in open market transactions 
through september  and the date of this report  we repurchased  shares at an average price of approximately per share 
contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements the following chart summarizes our contractual payment obligations as of september  the notes and license fees are reflected as liabilities on our balance sheet as of september  operating leases are accrued and paid on a monthly basis 
purchase obligations relate to research and development agreements and arrangements and sanctura premarketing agreements and arrangements  portions of these amounts are reflected as accrued expenses on our balance sheet as of september  payments due by period contractual obligations less than year years years greater than years total notes operating leases interest on notes license fees purchase obligations total see note h of notes to consolidated financial statements 
see note g of notes to consolidated financial statements 
relates primarily to agreements and purchase orders with contractors for the conduct of clinical trials and other research and development activities and pre marketing activities related to sanctura 
pursuant to certain of our in licensing arrangements  we will owe payments to our licensors upon achievement of certain development  regulatory and licensing milestones 
while we cannot predict if or when such events will occur  depending on the successful achievement of certain development  regulatory and licensing milestones  we may owe up to approximately  in fiscal pursuant to agreements we have with les laboratoires servier  from whom we in licensed rights to redux  boehringer ingelheim pharmaceuticals  inc  the manufacturer of redux  and other parties  we may be required to indemnify such parties for redux related liabilities 
in addition to purchases of bulk sanctura tablets aggregating approximately  in fiscal  we are committed to purchase from madaus significant additional quantities during the initial launch year of sanctura aggregating approximately  pliva agreed to purchase from us commercial quantities of sanctura and to be responsible for commercial product procurement costs  including costs to manufacture sanctura 
we have an agreement to lease automobiles for our sales force  including sales representatives and field district managers 
as of september   no automobiles had been leased 
we expect to have approximately automobiles leased pursuant to this arrangement by december  under this operating lease arrangement  we expect our annual lease rental costs to be approximately  in addition  due to a substantial increase in employees  we are negotiating to lease additional office space in lexington  ma that would increase our future annual lease commitments 
recent accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued fin fin requires that if an entity has a controlling financial interest in a vie  the assets  liabilities and results of activities of the vie should be included in the consolidated financial statements of the entity 
fin requires that its provisions are effective immediately for all arrangements entered into after january  for those arrangements entered into prior to january   fin requires its provisions  as amended by fin r which was issued by the fasb in december  be adopted by us in the second quarter of fiscal the adoption of fin r did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
eitf was issued in march and is intended to clarify what is a participating security and how to apply the two class method of computing earnings per share once it is determined that a security is participating  including how to allocate undistributed earnings to such a security 
eitf is effective for reporting periods beginning after march  the adoption of this pronouncement did not have an impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we own financial instruments that are sensitive to market risks as part of our investment portfolio 
the investment portfolio is used to preserve our capital until it is required to fund operations  including our research and development activities 
none of these market risk sensitive instruments are held for trading purposes 
we do not own derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
interest rate risk related to cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities we invest our cash in a variety of financial instruments  primarily in short term bank deposits  money market funds  and domestic and foreign commercial paper and government securities 
these investments are denominated in us dollars and are subject to interest rate risk  and could decline in value if interest rates fluctuate 
our investment portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to help ensure portfolio liquidity and we have implemented guidelines limiting the duration of investments 
due to the conservative nature of these instruments  we do not believe that we have a material exposure to interest rate risk
