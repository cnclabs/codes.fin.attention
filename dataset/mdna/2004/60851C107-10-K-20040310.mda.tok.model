for this purpose  any statements that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward looking statements 
words such as believes  anticipates  plans  predicts  expects  estimates  intends  will  continue  may  potential  should and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements

business business risks and item qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk and the risks detailed from time to time in the company s future sec reports 
we are a leading supplier of high performance bioanalytical measurement systems which accelerate and improve drug discovery and other life sciences research 
our systems and consumables enable pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to leverage advances in genomics  proteomics and combinatorial chemistry by facilitating the high throughput and cost effective identification and evaluation of drug candidates 
our solutions are based on advanced core technologies that integrate our expertise in engineering  molecular and cell biology  and chemistry 
we enable our customers to improve research productivity and effectiveness  which ultimately accelerates the complex process of discovering and developing new drugs 
our customers include small and large pharmaceutical  biotechnology and industrial companies as well as medical centers  universities  government research laboratories and other institutions throughout the world 
the success of our business is impacted by research and development spending trends of these customers  which has been unpredictable over the last three years and remains unpredictable in the near term 
we focus on generating revenue growth through the development of innovative products for these customers 
in each of the last three years  our internal research and development efforts have enabled us to exceed our goal of generating over of annual revenues from products that are introduced in the last three years 
we divide our revenues into two product families based primarily on the customers to which they are sold into 
the drug discovery product family includes systems that integrate detection  liquid handling and automation  have price points in excess of  and are primarily sold to large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies 
product lines included in the drug discovery family are ionworks  flipr  analyst and discovery systems 
the life sciences product family  which includes bench top detection and liquid handling products  consists of maxline  metamorph  skatron and threshold product lines 
these single purpose instruments generally cost less than  and are sold throughout our entire customer base 
we recognize revenue on the sale of these products  when collectibility is reasonably assured  at the time of shipment and transfer of title to customers and distributors 
there are no significant customer acceptance requirements or post shipment obligations on our part 
in june  we acquired universal imaging corporation  a developer and distributor of cellular imaging software and drug discovery tools 
as a result  our operating results include five additional months of uic revenues and expenses not present in our results 
critical accounting estimates management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  equity investments  income taxes and warranty obligations 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

table of contents we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition and warranty we recognize product revenue at the time of shipment and transfer of title when collectibility is reasonably assured 
software revenue is recognized at the time of sale and in accordance with aicpa statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition sop 
there are no significant customer acceptance requirements or post shipment obligations on our part for product or software sales 
future warranty costs are estimated based on historical experience and provided for at the time of sale 
freight costs for revenue generating shipments are charged to costs of goods sold 
amounts received prior to completion of the earnings process are recorded as customer deposits or deferred revenue  as appropriate 
service contract revenue is deferred at the time of sale and recognized ratably over the period of performance 
accounts receivable we sell our products primarily to corporations  academic institutions  government entities and distributors within the drug discovery and life sciences research markets 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and generally do not require collateral 
we maintain reserves for potential credit losses  which are based on a number of factors including  but not limited to  the current financial condition of specific customers  payment trends and the overall economic environment 
such losses have been historically within our expectations 
inventories inventories are stated on a first in  first out basis at the lower of cost or market 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those we project  additional inventory write downs may be required 
such write downs have historically been within our expectations 
equity investments we invest in equity instruments of privately held companies for business and strategic purposes 
these investments are included in other long term assets and are accounted for under the cost method when ownership is less than percent of voting securities and we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over operations 
when our ownership exceeds percent of voting securities but is less than percent  or we have the ability to exercise significant influence  the investment is accounted for under the equity method 
under the equity method  the investee s proportionate share of net income or loss and amortization of the investee s net excess investment over its equity in net assets is included in net income or loss 
as of december   we did not hold any investments accounted for under the equity method 
we regularly review the assumptions underlying the operating performance and cash flow forecasts in assessing the fair values 
we monitor the preceding factors to identify events or circumstances that would cause us to test for other than temporary impairment and revise our assumptions for the estimated recovery of equity investments 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the liability method whereby deferred tax asset or liability account balances are calculated at the balance sheet date using current tax laws and rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized in the future 
at december   we had net deferred tax assets of million 
realization of these assets is dependent on our ability to generate significant future taxable income 
we believe that sufficient income will be earned in the future to realize these assets 
we will evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets and assess the need for valuation allowances periodically 
various factors may have favorable or unfavorable effects upon our effective tax rate in the future 
these factors include  but are not limited to  interpretations of existing tax laws  changes in tax laws and rates  future levels of r d spending  future levels of capital expenditures  and our success in r d and commercializing products 

table of contents results of operations the following table summarizes our consolidated statement of operations as a percentage of revenues years ended december  revenues cost of revenues gross profit research and development selling  general and administrative write off of acquired in process research and development income loss from operations other income  net income loss before income taxes income tax provision net income loss years ended december  and revenues for increased by to million from million in this increase was primarily due to the inclusion of a full year of revenues for uic 
drug discovery product family revenues increased in due to the addition of the discovery product line from uic as well as the continued success of our ionworks ht product line  which was launched in late revenues in the life sciences research product family also increased in largely due to the addition of the metamorph product line from uic and the growth in our maxline product line  which was driven by the launch of the spectramax m gross margin increased to in  from in this increase was primarily due to the increased sales of higher margin products  including ionworks ht  metamorph  and discovery systems  as well as consumable products 
research and development expenses remained relatively stable in  increasing only to million from million in this increase was largely due to a full year of research and development expenses at uic 
in  we continued to fund development programs related to ionworks  flipr and spectramax products 
in  we plan to continue to invest in these programs and keep research and development spending approximately flat in absolute dollars compared to selling  general and administrative expenses increased by to million in from million in this increase resulted from a full year of selling expenses at uic  movements in exchange rates that negatively affected spending at our european and japanese subsidiaries and legal expenses stemming from a patent lawsuit related to our imap program which was settled in november 
furthermore  we increased spending related to sales and service worldwide in an effort to enhance market acceptance of ionworks  take uic products direct in japan  and to increase the effectiveness of our worldwide service organization 
in  we expect selling  general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars due to variable expenses associated with increased revenues  but to decrease as a percentage of revenues 
other income  net  consisting primarily of interest income  decreased by to  in from million in this was due to lower interest rates received on our cash and investments portfolio in we recorded tax provisions of million an effective tax rate of and million an effective tax rate of for and  respectively 
the relative stability in our effective tax rate resulted from tax benefits recognized in and associated with our international operations 
we expect our effective tax rate for to be approximately 
table of contents years ended december  and revenues for increased by to million from million in this increase was due to the launch of the ionworks ht  along with the inclusion of seven months of revenue from uic  acquired on june  drug discovery revenues increased in due to launch of ionworks ht in the third quarter  increased sales of flipr products and the addition of the discovery product line from uic 
revenues in the life sciences research product family increased in largely due to the addition of the metamorph product line from uic and growth in sales of the threshold and skatron product lines 
gross margin decreased to in  from in this decrease was primarily due to overall product sales that were more heavily weighted in lower margin products 
research and development expenses increased by to million in from million in this increase was primarily driven by inclusion of a full year s research and development expenses at cytion sa cytion  which we acquired in july  and the research and development expenses incurred at uic 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by to million in from million in this increase resulted from the inclusion of the selling  general and administrative expenses of uic 
other income  net  consisting primarily of interest income  decreased by to million in from million in this was due to lower average cash and short term investment balances due to the share repurchase plan executed in the first quarter and the uic acquisition in the second quarter and decreased interest rates in we recorded tax provisions of million an effective tax rate of and million an effective tax rate of for and  respectively 
the decrease in our effective tax rate resulted from tax benefits recognized in associated with our international operations 
the effective tax rates for and are calculated on profit before tax excluding the write off of acquired in process research and development expenses in  which is not deductible for income tax purposes 
liquidity and capital resources we had cash  cash equivalents and short and long term investments of million at december  compared to million at december  in  operating activities provided million in cash 
net cash used by investing activities was million in  which included million of capital expenditures 
net cash used in financing activities was million in  due to million spent to repurchase  shares of our common stock  partially offset by million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock for options exercised and employee stock purchases 
the share repurchases occurred throughout  and accounted for approximately of the shares outstanding as of december  approximately  shares remained available for repurchase at december  under the stock repurchase program approved by our board of directors in october in february   shares of our common stock were repurchased for approximately million 
we believe that our existing cash and investment securities and anticipated cash flow from our operations will be sufficient to support our current operating plan for the foreseeable future 
our ability to generate our anticipated cash flow from operations is subject to the risks and uncertainties discussed above under business risks  including  in particular  variations in the amount of time it takes for us to sell our products and collect accounts receivable  the timing of customer orders  competition  risks associated with the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries  supplier or manufacturing problems or delays  and risks associated with past and potential future acquisitions 
likewise  our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward looking statement that involves risks and uncertainties  and actual results could vary as a result of a number of factors 
we have based this estimate on our current plans which may change and assumptions that may prove to be wrong 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the progress of our research and development  the number and scope of our research programs  
table of contents market acceptance and demand for our products  the costs that may be involved in enforcing our patent claims and other intellectual property rights  potential acquisition and technology licensing opportunities  the costs associated with repurchasing shares of our common stock  manufacturing capacity requirements  and the costs of expanding our sales  marketing and distribution capabilities both in the united states and abroad 
we have generated sufficient cash flow to fund our capital requirements primarily through operating and financing activities over the last three years 
however  we cannot assure you that we will not require additional financing in the future to support our existing operations or potential acquisition and technology licensing opportunities that may arise 
therefore  we may in the future seek to raise additional funds through bank facilities  debt or equity offerings or other sources of capital 
additional financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all  and may be dilutive to our then current stockholders 
our cash and investments policy emphasizes liquidity and preservation of principal over other portfolio considerations 
we select investments that maximize interest income to the extent possible given these two constraints 
we satisfy liquidity requirements by investing excess cash in securities with different maturities to match projected cash needs and limit concentration of credit risk by diversifying our investments among a variety of high credit quality issuers 
we believe that our existing cash and investment securities and anticipated cash flow from our operations will be sufficient to support our current operating plan for the foreseeable future 
our facilities are leased under noncancelable operating leases 
in addition  we have contractual commitments for the purchase of certain resale products and manufacturing components with certain vendors ending in as of december   the following is a summary of our contractual obligations in millions payments due by period to to and total thereafter operating leases unconditional purchase obligations total contractual cash obligations recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued a revision to interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
fin r 
fin r clarifies the application of arb no 
 consolidated financial statements  to certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support provided by any parties  including the equity holders 
fin r requires the consolidation of these entities  known as variable interest entities vies  by the primary beneficiary of the entity 
the primary beneficiary is the entity  if any  that will absorb a majority of the entity s expected losses  receive a majority of the entity s expected residual returns  or both 
we do not have any interests in vies 
in november  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
the eitf concluded that revenue arrangements with multiple elements should be divided into separate units of accounting if the deliverables in the arrangement have value to the customer on a standalone basis  if there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered elements  and as long as there are no rights of return or additional performance guarantees by the company 
the provisions of eitf issue no 
are applicable to agreements entered into after june  adoption of the consensus in the third quarter of fiscal did not have a material effect on the company s results of operations or financial condition 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk  including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
a discussion of our accounting policies for financial instruments and further disclosures relating to financial investments is included in the summary of significant accounting policies note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this report 
our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates  primarily us interest rates 
in this regard  changes in us interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash equivalents and short term investments 
we invest our excess cash primarily in demand deposits with united states banks and money market accounts and short term securities 
these securities  consisting of million of commercial paper and million of us government agency securities  are carried at market value  which approximate cost  typically mature or are redeemable within days to two years  and bear minimal risk 
we have not experienced any significant losses on the investments 
we are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily in the united kingdom  france  japan  germany and canada  where we sell direct in local currencies 
all other foreign sales are denominated in us dollars and bear no exchange rate risk 
however  a strengthening of the us dollar could make our products less competitive in overseas markets 
gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions have historically been immaterial 
translation gains and losses related to our foreign subsidiaries in the united kingdom  japan  germany  switzerland and norway are accumulated as a separate component of stockholders equity 
we do not currently engage in foreign currency hedging transactions  but may do so in the future
