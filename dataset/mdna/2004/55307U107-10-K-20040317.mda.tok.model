totals except yields which are averages production for the orchards purchased in and is net of unusable nuts  as stated in their respective nut purchase agreements 
production for the orchards purchased in and includes all nuts delivered 
the nut purchase contracts for the orchards require the purchaser  mauna loa macadamia nut corporation mauna loa  to purchase all of the nuts delivered from these orchards 
the contract  renegotiated this year  allows for a set price within a range of unusable of to 
the partnership reports on a calendar year basis  though the natural crop year generally begins in august and runs through april 
production in was lower than and lower than production in was lower than and higher than significant factors affecting the crop were as follows the drought in the ka u orchards in affected the nut set and development 
the below average rainfall in the keaau and mauna kea orchards negatively impacted the nut development in keaau 
mauna kea s nut production was not affected due to good soil moisture retention 
the ka u region was affected by a rainstorm and flood in november of rainfall from the storm replenished the soil moisture and improved the yields in this region for the ka u green shoe i orchard and the mauna kea orchard are fully mature 
as a result  the yields from these orchards are expected to produce on average with the partnership s mature orchards 
at full maturity under favorable growing conditions  a macadamia orchard can produce between  and  wis pounds of macadamia nuts per acre each year at ka u and between  and  wis pounds of macadamia nuts per acre each year at keaau 
all the trees have reached full maturity in the mauna kea area and it is expected that production will approximate keaau levels 
owned orchard segment nut revenue macadamia nut revenues depend on the number of producing acres  yields per acre and the nut purchase price 
the impact of these factors is summarized in the following table over over trees acres harvested average yield wis lbs 
acre nuts harvested s wis lbs 
nut price wis lbs 
gross nut sales s litigation adjustment nut price settlement nut price settlement early harvest agreement recorded nut sales s under three of the nut purchase contracts with mauna loa  the price for nuts delivered is based on the two year trailing average of usda published macadamia nut prices and on a netback component 
the netback component is determined by subtracting from mauna loa s gross revenues from the sale of macadamia products i allocable processing  packaging  marketing  selling and advertising costs and ii a capital charge on the difference between those aggregate gross revenues and aggregate allocable costs 
the following table sets forth the manner in which the nut purchase price per pound was determined for  and lb 
usda price two years prior a usda price one year prior a usda price two year trailing average gross revenues less allocable processing  packaging  marketing  sales and advertising costs less capital charge net back component usda price two year trailing average net back component average of usda two year trailing average price and net back component plus hawaii general excise tax net purchase price b c d e a mauna loa s own purchases comprise a substantial portion of nut purchases reported to the usda 
therefore  the usda price component of the purchase price is  to a substantial degree  the average price that mauna loa has paid to purchase macadamia nuts from the partnership and from third parties during the previous two years 
b the nut purchase price for the and orchards was the same for and all previous years 
with the change of ownership of mauna loa in  a quality conversion factor in the nut purchase contracts was initiated 
the effect was to cause a slightly different price of for the orchards in  in and in an early harvest round was requested by mauna loa resulting in a payment of  over the contract price 
with this payment the price was c the nut purchase contract covering nut production from the acre keaau lot orchard acquired in september defines the two year trailing average provision slightly differently from the and nut purchase contracts  and thus  results in a different nut price 
this was in affect for the first six months of a new contract was negotiated with a fixed price for all nuts with unusables in a range of to 
the nut price for this orchard was in  in  and in this orchard accounts for less than of the partnership s macadamia nut production 
d the nut purchase contract for the ka u o orchards purchased in may uses only the two year trailing usda average to determine its nut price  which was in  in and in e mauna loa has recently provided the final audited nut price to the partnership 
the result of the audited nut price was to increase the nut sales by  in the fourth quarter for nuts sold in the first three quarters of the increase by quarter was  related to the first quarter   related to the second quarter and  related to the third quarter 
the average nut price from all orchards increased from the average nut price from all orchards declined from the usda portion fell in and in the netback increased in compared to and was flat in compared to the current netback price reflects the operating performance of mauna loa 
the usda published price for the crop year was per pound wis at moisture  which is lower than the price of and lower than the price of 
the usda two year trailing average  which affects the partnership s nut price  will be  a decrease over the two year average 
owned orchard segment cost of goods sold agricultural unit costs depend on the operating expenses required to maintain the orchards and to harvest the crop as well as on the quantity of nuts actually harvested 
the partnership s unit costs expressed in dollars per wet in shell pound at moisture are calculated by dividing all agricultural costs for each orchard including lease rent  property tax  tree insurance and depreciation by the number of pounds of macadamia nuts produced by that orchard and are summarized below lb

all orchards as a result of the farming operations acquisition  the partnership now farms its own orchards  and some costs previously charged as farming expenses by kaci and mkaci were eliminated 
these are the hawaii general excise tax  capital recovery costs and the farming fee 
the partnership saved approximately  in hawaii general excise taxes for   in and  in the capital recovery savings in were  in were  and in were  the elimination of the farming fee in saved the partnership  in   in and  in the general and administrative expense in was  and in was  in addition  the general and administrative expenses incurred in the farming operation  which were previously billed and expensed as farming costs  have been classified as general and administration expenses 
this amounted to  in   in and  in cost of goods sold was  higher in than in  and  lower in than in  but the cost per pound was the same in than and higher in than the higher production costs in were the result of higher husking costs in keaau and mauna kea  higher field land lease costs in ka u and higher benefit costs 
the lower costs in were the result of lower production 
the increase in cost per pound in compared to was a result of increases in service costs such as insurance and employee benefits 
farming segment farming service revenue in connection with the acquisition  the partnership acquired approximately farming contracts to farm macadamia orchards owned by other growers 
these contracts cover macadamia orchards in the same three locations on the island of hawaii where the partnership owns orchards 
the farming contracts provide the partnership to be reimbursed for all direct farming costs cultivation  irrigation and harvesting  collect a pro rata share of indirect costs and overheads  and charge a management fee 
the management fee is based on the number of acres farmed or on a percentage of total costs billed 
revenues from farming services were million in  million in  and million for the farming service revenues were greater than anticipated because of the timing of harvesting 
the farming service revenues were less than anticipated in part as a result of a controversy surrounding the sale by c 
brewer co  ltd 
cbcl of approximately tree acres to third parties 
cbcl reported to the partnership that the buyers of the orchards did not wish to assume the farming contracts  therefore  cbcl was terminating the contracts 
the partnership believes the contracts are not terminable at will and is currently negotiating a settlement with cbcl 
also  in one of the major farming contracts requested longer harvest intervals for their orchards 
the farming services revenue was less than anticipated due to the abandonment of acres by one of the growers and less repairs required 
farming segment cost of services sold the cost of services sold relating to the farming contracts was million in  million in and million for these costs were all reimbursed to the partnership 
general and administrative costs general and administrative expenses are comprised of accounting and reporting costs  reimbursements to the managing partner for directors fees  office expenses and liability insurance  and the management fee 
in addition  general and administrative costs are also incurred in connection with the farming operations 
previous to the may acquisition  general and administration costs relating to the partnership s orchards were included in the partnership s farming expenses 
total general and administrative costs for were  lower than  which is attributed to lower service costs and orchard management costs 
general and administrative costs for were  lower than in all of the decrease was due to  in legal costs associated with the dispute related to the nut purchase contract with mauna loa in a management fee based on partnership cash flow is payable annually to the managing partner 
the amount paid was  in   in  and  for interest income and expense the partnership recorded interest expense of  in   in  and  in this was due to the long term loan used to acquire the farming operations  the assumption of several capitalized equipment leases  and interest expense on a revolving line of credit 
the partnership funds its working capital needs through funds on hand and  when needed  from short term borrowings  generating interest expense in the process 
net interest income or expense  therefore  is partly a function of any balance carried over from the prior year  the amount and timing of cash generated and distributions paid to investors in the current year  as well as the current level of interest rates 
interest was earned in the amount of  in   in and  in primarily from charges to mauna loa for late payment in other income of  was recorded in with  from crop insurance and  from the settlement of a written off receivable 
 was recorded in primarily from the early termination of a land and garage lease with cbcl 
other income of  was recorded in due mainly to the settlement agreement with mauna loa 
inflation and taxes in general  prices paid to macadamia nut farmers fluctuate independently of inflation 
macadamia nut prices are influenced strongly by prices for finished macadamia products  which depend on competition and consumer acceptance 
farming costs  particularly labor and materials  and general and administrative costs do generally reflect inflationary trends 
the partnership is subject to a gross income tax as a result of its election to continue to be taxed as a partnership rather than to be taxed as a corporation  as allowed by the taxpayer relief act of this tax is calculated at on partnership gross income net revenues less cost of goods sold beginning in the gross income tax was  in   in  and  in liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operations was million in an increase of approximately  over net cash provided by operations was million in and at december  the partnership s working capital was million and its current ratio was to  compared to million and to in and was million and to in in the increase in working capital compared to was a result of a higher revenue  higher interest and other income  lower general and administrative costs  and lower interest costs 
in payment by mauna loa resulted in liabilities being paid without incurring short term debt 
the partnership is in compliance with the credit agreement covenants 
capital expenditures in  and were   and  respectively 
capital expenditures planned for are less than  and are expected to be financed by way of new equipment leases  either capital or operating leases 
macadamia nut farming is seasonal  with production peaking late in the fall 
however  farming operations continue year round 
as a result  additional working capital is required for much of the year 
the partnership meets its working capital needs with cash on hand  and when necessary  through short term borrowings under a million revolving line of credit 
the line of credit was obtained on may  and expires may  the lender has agreed to extend the line of credit under comparable terms through or at december  the partnership had a cash balance of  and line of credit drawings outstanding of  at december  the partnership had a cash balance of  and line of credit drawings outstanding of  the cash balance was  at the end of  and the line of credit drawings were  at december it is the opinion of management that the partnership has adequate cash on hand and borrowing capacity available to meet anticipated working capital needs for operations as presently conducted 
however  with the september sale of mauna loa  the managing partner no longer has control over the timing of nut payments to the partnership 
the nut purchase contracts require mauna loa to make nut payments days after the end of each quarter 
during certain parts of the year  if payments are not received  as the contracts require  available cash resources could be depleted 
critical accounting policies and estimates management has identified the following critical accounting policies that affect the partnership s more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the partnership s financial statements 
the preparation of the partnership s financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires the partnership s management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  management evaluates those estimates  including those related to asset impairment  accruals for self insurance  compensation and related benefits  revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  contingencies and litigation 
the partnership states these accounting policies in the notes to the financial statements and in relevant sections in this discussion and analysis 
these estimates are based on the information that is currently available to the partnership and on various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could vary from those estimates 
the partnership believes that the following critical accounting policies affect significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of it financial statements the partnership maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the failure of its customers to make required payments  which results in bad debt expense 
management determines the adequacy of this allowance by continually evaluating individual customer receivables  considering the customer s financial condition  credit history and current economic conditions 
if the financial condition of customers were to deteriorate  or if a customer refuses to pay or disputes any such payment  additional allowances may be required 
the partnership maintains an accrual for workers compensation claims to the extent that the partnership s current insurance policies will not cover such claims 
this accrual is included in other accrued liabilities in the accompanying balance sheet 
management determines the adequacy of the accrual by periodically evaluating the historical experience and projected trends related to outstanding and potential workers compensation claims 
if such information indicates that the accrual is over or understated  the partnership will adjust the assumptions utilized in the methodologies and reduce or provide for additional accrual as appropriate 
retirement benefits the partnership sponsors a non contributory defined benefit pension plan for union employees 
several statistical and other factors which attempt to anticipate future events are used in calculating the expense and liabilities related to this plan 
these factors include assumptions about the discount rate  expected return on plan assets  withdrawal and mortality rates and the rate of increase in compensation levels 
the actuarial assumptions used by the partnership may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter mortality of participants 
these differences may impact the amount of retirement benefit expense recorded by the partnership in future periods 
the partnership reviews long lived assets held and used  or held for sale for impairment annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
if an evaluation is required  the estimated undiscounted future cash flows associated with the asset are compared to the asset s carrying amount to determine if an impairment charge is required 
all long lived assets for which management has committed to a plan of disposal are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value 
changes in projected cash flows generated by an asset based on new events or circumstances may indicate a change in fair value and require a new evaluation of recoverability of the asset 
recently issued accounting pronouncement the partnership has applied the revised disclosure provisions of sfas no 
 employers disclosure about pensions and other postretirement benefits 
the revisions to sfas no 
were issued in december  and require additional disclosures about the assets  obligations  cash flows and net periodic benefit cost of defined benefit pension plans and other defined benefit postretirement plans 
the disclosures that are required by sfas no 
are included in note 
legal proceedings mauna loa 
the partnership is a party to five macadamia nut purchase contracts with mauna loa 
three of these contracts  one written in and two in  require mauna loa to pay for all nuts delivered 
since the inception of these three contracts  mauna loa had always paid for all nuts delivered 
the other two nut purchase contracts were written in and and allow for the deduction of unusable nuts in calculating payment due 
on october   a dispute arose with mauna loa regarding the payment for nuts delivered by the partnership during the year 
in violation of the nut purchase contracts and past practice  mauna loa deducted  for certain substandard nuts related to the and contracts 
a demand letter was sent  litigation ensued and a motion for summary judgment was entered in may against mauna loa  awarding principal  interest and attorneys fees to the partnership 
settlement discussions followed the judgment in order to avoid an appeal and further litigation 
the partnership agreed to accept principal  interest and a portion of its legal fees along with a complete release by both parties 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the partnership is exposed to market risks resulting from changes in interest rates 
the interest rates on the partnership s credit agreement  which are based on libor farm credit discount note rate and the farm credit medium term note rate  are adjusted periodically based on the partnership s election to fix interest rates for periods ranging from between three months and five years 
as of december   a one percent increase or decrease in the applicable rate under the credit agreement will result in an interest expense fluctuation of approximately  item b 
controls and procedures a under the supervision and with the participation of management  including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer  we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures  as such term is defined under rule a c promulgated under the securities exchange act of  as amended the exchange act  within days of the filing date of this report 
based on their evaluation  our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that the partnership s disclosure procedures are effective 
b there have been no significant changes including corrective actions with regard to significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal controls or in other factors that could significantly affect these controls subsequent to the date of the evaluation referenced in paragraph a above
