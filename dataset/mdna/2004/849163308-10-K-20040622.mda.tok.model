item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations factors that may affect future results 
item business general sport chalet  inc referred to as the company  sport chalet  we  us  and our unless specified otherwise  founded in  is a leading operator of full service  specialty sporting goods superstores in california and nevada 
as of march   we had locations in southern california  two in northern california and two in nevada 
these stores average  square feet in size 
in addition  we operate a retail e commerce store through gsi commerce  inc at www 
sportchalet 
com 
our executive offices are located at one sport chalet drive  la canada  california  and our telephone number is operating history and growth plans in  norbert olberz  our chairman emeritus and principal stockholder the principal stockholder  purchased a small ski and tennis shop in la canada  california 
a focus on providing quality merchandise with outstanding customer service was the foundation of norbert s vision 
as a true pioneer in the industry  norbert s mission was three simple things 
to see things through the eyes of the customer  to do a thousand things a little bit better  and to focus on being the best  not the biggest 
over the last years  sport chalet has grown into a chain of specialty retail superstores serving both california and nevada 
our growth strategy had historically focused on southern california  but now includes opening new stores throughout california and nevada as suitable locations are found 
over the past three years  we have opened eight new stores  two of which include our recent expansion into the northern california market and two in the las vegas  nevada  market 
we currently plan to open at least five stores during the next months  of which three will continue our expansion into northern california  one will be in central california and one in southern california 
future store openings are subject to availability of satisfactory store locations based on local competitive conditions  site availability and cost and our ability to provide and maintain high service levels and quality brand merchandising at competitive prices 
for fiscal  average sales per store for stores open throughout both fiscal and fiscal were million  with corresponding average sales per square foot of store openings are expected to have a favorable impact on sales volume  but will negatively affect profit in the short term 
new stores tend to have higher costs in the early years of operation  due primarily to increased promotional costs and lower sales on a per employee basis until the store matures 
as the store matures  sales tend to level off and expenses decline as a percentage of sales 
our stores generally require three to four years to attract a stable  mature customer base 
we estimate the cost of opening an average new store to be approximately million consisting primarily of the investment in inventory net of average vendor payables  the cost of fixtures and equipment and pre opening expenses  such as the costs associated with training employees and stocking the store 
opening costs for each new store can vary significantly depending on how much the landlord has agreed to contribute to our required improvements 

table of contents our sales partially depend on the economic environment and level of consumer spending in california and nevada 
the retail industry historically has been subject to substantial cyclical variation  and a recession in the general economy or uncertainties regarding future economic prospects that affect consumer spending habits in our market areas have had  and may in the future have  a materially adverse effect on our results of operations 
stores and merchandising our prototype stores range in size from  to  square feet and showcase each product category with the feel of a specialty shop all contained under one roof 
the full service approach to customer service and product knowledge is enhanced by fixtures which feature specific categories  and give the customer an enhanced shopping experience 
each shop is staffed by trained sales associates with expertise in the merchandise they sell  permitting us to offer our customers a high level of product knowledge and service from the beginner to the professional sports enthusiast 
our prototype format boasts a natural and outdoor feel color scheme  clear coated fixtures  foot clear ceilings  large sport specific graphics  pool for scuba and watersports instruction and demonstrations  and a foot shoe wall  among other improvements 
in coming years we plan to retro fit certain mature stores to conform to the prototype 
during fiscal  four stores will be remodeled  with expected grand re openings in fall of and spring of for both new stores and remodels  we continually update our prototype format to remain competitive 
while we have taken advantage of unusual building layouts in the past  and when appropriate may do so in the future  we will utilize as many prototype design elements as possible 
we evaluate stores for remodel based on each store s age and competitive situation  as well as how much the landlord will contribute to our required improvements 
future store remodeling plans will depend upon several factors  including  but not limited to  general economic conditions  competition trends and the availability of adequate capital 
once a store is selected for remodel  an estimate of fixtures and leasehold improvements requiring disposal is prepared 
the remaining book value of these items are fully expensed through accelerated depreciation over the period prior to the completion of the remodel 
for fiscal this additional expense is expected to be approximately  with the scheduled new store openings and remodels  of our store base will be three years old or less 
our stores feature a number of distinct  specialty sporting goods divisions  offering a large assortment of quality brand name merchandise at competitive prices 
the stores include traditional sporting goods merchandise eg  footwear  apparel and other general athletic products and nontraditional merchandise such as downhill skiing  mountaineering and scuba 
the merchandise appeals to both experts and beginners 
in addition  our stores offer over services for the serious sports enthusiast  including backpacking  canyoneering  and kayaking instruction  custom golf club fitting and repair  ski rental and repair  scuba training and certification  scuba boat charters  team sales  racquet stringing  and bicycle tune up and repair 
our stores are open seven days a week  typically from am to am monday through saturday  and am to pm on sunday 
the following table sets forth the percentage of total net sales for each major category for each of the last three fiscal years year ended march  hardlines apparel footwear total 
table of contents we operate our online store through gsi commerce  inc gsi at www 
sportchalet 
com 
gsi creates and operates all aspects of the www 
sportchalet 
com shopping experience  including fulfillment and purchasing  while remaining transparent to the customer 
we receive a license fee based on a percentage of sales generated by the website 
the market for retail sporting goods is seasonal in nature 
as with many other retailers  our business is heavily affected by sales of merchandise during the holiday season 
in addition  our product mix has historically emphasized cold weather sporting goods merchandise  particularly winter sports related products 
in recent years  the months of november  december and january represented between and of our total net sales  while winter related products ranged from to of total net sales 
management anticipates that this seasonal trend in sales will persist 
to be less dependent upon winter business  management continues to emphasize a broadened product mix that offers merchandise generally purchased by consumers in the spring  summer and fall seasons 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations factors that may affect future results seasonality 
marketing and advertising we generate all of our marketing and advertising campaigns in house  with production support from outside vendors as needed 
the campaigns are designed to reflect our strategic direction through our brand and product offerings  as well as communicate a focused and consistent theme event calendar through media vehicles including newspaper  direct mail  radio  billboards  magazines and the internet 
through the team sales division  we reach out to communities in which our stores do business  contributing to local teams and leagues 
our advertising leverage has been boosted by vendor payments under cooperative advertising arrangements as well as vendor participation in sponsoring sporting events and programs 
purchasing and distribution in order to provide a full line of specialty and sporting goods brands and a wide selection  we purchase merchandise from over  vendors 
vendor payment terms typically range from to days from our receipt  and there are no long term purchase commitments 
our largest vendor  nike  inc  accounted for approximately and of our total inventory purchases for fiscal and  respectively 
in january  we moved our distribution operations to a new  square foot facility located in ontario  california 
this facility replaced our  square foot warehouse and a  square foot satellite facility  and has been designed to support growth plans for the foreseeable future 
labor savings from operating efficiency provided by the new facility have offset increases in occupancy costs in the short term and installation of warehouse management software should continue to improve warehousing and logistical cost management 
the distribution center serves as the primary receiving  distribution and warehousing facility 
common carriers deliver merchandise to our stores outside of southern california  while our own trucks deliver merchandise from the distribution center to the southern california stores 
for fiscal  we will completely outsource our intra company trucking 
a minimal amount of merchandise is shipped directly by vendors to our stores 
most of the product received at the distribution center is processed by unpacking and verifying the contents received and then sorting the contents by store for delivery 
some of the product received at the distribution center is pre packaged and pre ticketed by the vendor so it can be immediately cross docked to trucks bound for the stores 
due to the efficiencies cross docking creates  we encourage vendors to pre package their merchandise in a floor ready manner 
some of the merchandise is held at the distribution center for future allocation to the stores based on current sales trends as directed by our computerized replenishment system to optimize inventory levels 
we believe that the advantages of a single distribution center include reduced individual store inventory levels and better use of store floor space  timely inventory replenishment of store inventory needs  consolidated vendor returns  and reduced transportation costs 

table of contents we use a sophisticated computerized replenishment system from jda 
the jda e system consists of three modules i advanced warehouse replenishment  which manages purchases from vendors  ii advanced store replenishment  which manages warehouse to store replenishment  and iii network optimization  which synchronizes the two systems 
in addition  we utilize the jda consumer outlook and pinpoint seasonal profile software to help identify  create and manage the seasonal trends of our merchandise 
currently  inventory management utilizes the e system to manage approximately of our total inventory 
the remaining of the inventory purchases are managed by traditional methods conducted by the buying staff on a short term purchase order basis 
information systems we use a best of breed approach to information systems 
all new systems communicate with a legacy system that has become the centralized data repository and the primary financial system 
our inventory systems track purchasing  sales and inventory transfers down to the stock keeping unit or sku level and allow us to improve overall inventory management by identifying individual sku activity and projecting trends and replenishment needs on a timely basis 
we believe these systems enable us to increase margins by reducing inventory and markdowns while strengthening our in stock positions 
consistent with the stated direction to upgrade the legacy systems  those applications were migrated to a new sun computer in may in october  store systems were upgraded to the encore retail suite of applications from crs retail systems  an open technology allowing flexibility for the future 
a custom rental program was added to the store system in october merchandise replenishment is controlled by e software from the jda software group  inc  running on an ibm as in fiscal  the processing of debit credit card authorization was upgraded to allow on line debit and signature capture  and the distribution center was enhanced with warehouse management software from highjump 
highjump is web enabled  real time  scaleable software that can expand to meet the demands of our growth plans 
we continue ongoing enhancements to the legacy system as well as the evaluation  procurement and integration of new systems in order to keep pace with our growth plan 
trademarks and trade names we use the sport chalet name as a service mark in connection with our business operations 
we have registered sport chalet as a service mark with the state of california  and have obtained federal registration for certain purposes  which has been successfully defended in the past against attack by third parties 
we also retain common law rights to the name  which we have used since the lack of federal registration for certain purposes might pose a problem if we were to expand into a geographic area where the name or any confusingly similar name is used by someone with prior rights 
industry and competition the market for retail sporting goods is highly competitive  fragmented and segmented 
we compete with a variety of other retailers  including the following full line sporting goods chains  such as the sports authority  galyans  dick s sporting goods and big  specialty stores  such as rei  foot locker and west marine  supplier owned stores  such as nike  the north face  adidas and new balance  mass merchandisers  club stores  discount stores and department stores  such as wal mart  costco  target  macy s and sears  and internet retailers and catalog merchandisers 
many of these competitors have greater financial resources than we do  or better name recognition in regions into which we seek to expand 
our industry is dominated by sporting goods superstore retailers  ie  full line sporting goods chains with stores typically larger than  square feet  
table of contents often in freestanding locations 
superstore chains generally provide a greater selection of higher quality merchandise than other retailers  while remaining price competitive 
specialty retailers often have the advantage of a lower cost structure and a smaller footprint that can be located in shopping centers and strip malls  offering more customer convenience 
historically  we have distinguished ourselves from our competitors by providing a broader selection of higher end specialty items that require higher levels of customer service and sales associate expertise than other superstore retailers in the california and nevada areas 
we believe that our broad selection of high quality name brands and numerous specialty items at competitive prices  showcased by our well trained sales associates  differentiates us from discount and department stores  traditional and specialty sporting goods stores and other superstore operations 
our format takes advantage of several significant trends and conditions in the sporting goods industry 
these conditions include the size of the industry  fragmented competition  superstore dominance  limited assortments offered by many sporting goods retailers  consumer preference for one stop shopping  and the importance of delivering value through selection  quality  service and price 
employees as of march   we had a total of approximately  full and part time employees   of whom were employed in our stores and of whom were employed in warehouse and delivery operations or in executive office positions 
none of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement 
we encourage and welcome the communication of our employees ideas  suggestions and concerns and believe this contributes to our strong employee relations 
a typical store has approximately employees  of whom to are in the store at any given time on a normal operating basis 
generally  each store employs a general manager  two to three assistant managers  who along with area managers and department heads supervise the sales associates in customer service  merchandising  and operations 
additional part time employees are typically hired during the holiday and other peak seasons 
we are committed to the growth and training of our employees in order to provide the expert product knowledge and service to our customers 
our certified pro program ensures that employees attend product line specific clinics and receive hands on training to improve technical product and service expertise 
only after completing all of the clinics and training  in addition to passing specific testing  may an associate be considered a certified pro 
certified pro certification is offered in different service disciplines and is a requirement for new associates in their areas of expertise 
being knowledgeable and informed allows our work force to meet the customer s needs and enhance their shopping experience

outlet store relocated to a nearby regional shopping center in october 
table of contents all facilities are located on leased property 
the initial terms of the retail leases expire in through and typically provide for multiple five year renewal options 
all retail store leases provide for base rent which may or may not be credited against percentage rent based upon gross sales from the premises 
in some of the leases  base rental amounts increase as the lease term progresses  although in some cases  we expect that percentage rent will more than offset the base rental amounts 
we lease from corporations controlled by norbert olberz  sport chalet s chairman emeritus and principal stockholder the principal stockholder  our corporate office space in la canada and our stores in la canada  huntington beach and porter ranch  california 
in prior years  we also leased from him our warehouse and distribution facility in montclair  california 
although the term of this lease ran to  the principal stockholder agreed to cancel the lease when we moved to the new distribution center in january the new distribution center located in ontario  california  is leased from an unrelated third party 
we have incurred rental expense to the principal stockholder of million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
our corporate offices in prior years were spread over seven nearby buildings in la canada  california  neighboring our original store 
to facilitate our expansion plans  we leased a new  square foot corporate office in la canada from la canada properties  inc  a corporation controlled by the principal stockholder  in october we expect this building to support our growth plans for the foreseeable future 
management believes that the occupancy costs under the leases with corporations controlled by the principal stockholder described above are no higher than those which would be charged by unrelated third parties under similar circumstances 
item legal proceedings we are involved in various routine legal proceedings incidental to the conduct of our business 
management does not believe that any of these legal proceedings will have a material adverse impact on the business  financial condition or results of operations  either due to the nature of the claims  or because management believes that such claims should not exceed the limits of our insurance coverage

dividend policy we have not paid any dividends to stockholders since our initial public offering in november we currently intend to retain earnings for use in the operation and potential expansion of our business and  therefore  do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
the declaration and payment of any such dividends in the future will depend upon our earnings  financial condition  capital needs and other factors deemed relevant by the board of directors

ebitda is earnings before income taxes  interest expense and depreciation and amortization 
we believe that  in addition to cash flows from operations and net income  ebitda is a useful financial performance measure for assessing operating performance as it provides an additional basis to evaluate our ability to incur and service debt and to fund capital expenditures 
in evaluating ebitda  consideration should be given  among other things  to the amount by which ebitda exceeds interest costs for the period and how ebitda compares to capital expenditures for the period 
to evaluate ebitda  the components of ebitda such as revenue and operating expenses and the variability of such components over time should also be considered 
ebitda should not be construed  however  as an alternative to operating income as determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap as an indicator of our operating performance or to cash flows from operating activities as determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of liquidity 
our method of calculating ebitda may differ from methods used by other companies and  as a result  ebitda measures disclosed herein may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies

gross profit increased million or  primarily from increased sales 
as a percent of sales  gross profit increased from in fiscal to in fiscal the increase for fiscal compared to fiscal resulted primarily from ongoing improvements in purchasing practices which reduced the need for markdowns 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million or  primarily from additional stores 
as a percent of sales  these expenses increased from in fiscal to in fiscal the increase for fiscal compared to fiscal resulted from several primary factors i the write off of assets totaling  which came from two large scale remodels completed in the first quarter of fiscal  ii increased workers compensation expense of million  iii additional non cash compensation expense from a stock award of  from the principal stockholder to certain executives of the company  combined with a cash bonus of  paid by the company to cover the executives related income tax

fiscal compared to fiscal sales increased million or from million for the fiscal year ending march  to million for fiscal the increase was the result of opening two stores in fiscal and three in fiscal  offset by a comparable store sales decrease of 
the comparable store sales decrease reflects a prolonged sluggish retail environment  lackluster economic recovery  and the war in iraq 
in addition  the decrease reflects a second year of unseasonable warm and dry winter weather conditions at the resorts frequented by our customers throughout the third and fourth quarters which resulted in decreased sales of winter related merchandise 
sales exclusive of winter related merchandise increased in total and on a comparable store basis 
gross profit increased million or  primarily from increased sales 
as a percent of sales  gross profit increased from in fiscal to in fiscal the improvement in merchandise margins was partially offset by the effects of decreased comparable store sales which caused occupancy costs to increase as a percent of sales in fiscal compared to fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses increased million or  primarily from additional stores 
as a percent of sales  these expenses increased from in fiscal to in fiscal the increase was caused by increases in utility expenses  advertising expense  professional fees  incentive based labor and employment based insurance costs 
interest expense increased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal  as our expansion was partially funded by the increased use of our credit facility 
the effective tax rate as a percent of pretax income was for fiscal and for fiscal these rates differ from the statutory rate of primarily as a result of permanent differences between financial reporting and tax basis income 
the decrease was the result of reduced blended state income tax rate  from our expansion into nevada which has no income tax and qualifying tax credits from california not earned in the same period in the prior year 
net income decreased from million or per diluted share for fiscal  to million or per diluted share for fiscal  primarily due to higher selling  general and administrative expenses partially offset by higher sales and improved merchandise margins 
liquidity and capital resources our primary capital requirements are for inventory and store expansion  relocation and remodeling 
historically  cash from operations  credit terms from vendors and bank borrowing have met our liquidity needs 
we believe that these sources will be sufficient to fund currently anticipated cash requirements for the foreseeable future 
net cash provided by operating activities of million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively  was primarily the result of net income  adjusted for depreciation and amortization  and increases in bank overdraft combined with accounts payable offset by inventory purchases 
typically  inventory levels increase from year to year due to the addition of new stores 
inventories increased million in fiscal  million in and million in  primarily from the addition of three stores  two stores and three stores respectively 
in fiscal  the increase in inventory was partially offset by a decrease in average inventory per store compared to fiscal due to ongoing improvements in inventory management 

table of contents bank overdraft represents the total of checks in transit in excess of cash on hand 
although there is no bank overdraft at march   the overdraft is expected to continue to fluctuate due to the timing of vendor payments in the future 
historically  accounts payable increases as inventory increases 
however  the timing of vendor payments near the end of the fiscal year does influence this relationship 
as a result of these timing differences  accounts payable combined with the bank overdraft decreased million and million for fiscal and  respectively  compared to an increase of million for fiscal other accrued expenses increased by and million for fiscal and  respectively  primarily from increased sales

as a result of our ongoing growth and strategic initiatives  forecasted capital expenditures for fiscal are expected to be approximately million  which will be funded by cash flow from operations and our bank credit line  as needed 
approximately million of this amount will be used to open five new stores 
the remainder is primarily for expenditures on information systems and existing store improvements  which include four remodels 
depreciation is expected to be accelerated for the stores to be remodeled  increasing depreciation expense for those stores by approximately  through the remodel date 
we evaluate stores for remodel based on each store s age and competitive situation as well as how much the landlord will contribute to our required improvements 
net cash provided by financing activities reflects advances and repayments of borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
as of march    and  we had no outstanding borrowings on this facility 
our amended credit facility with bank of america  na the lender provides for advances up to million  increasing to million for the period october  through december  each year  less the amount of any outstanding draws  up to a million maximum in authorized letters of credit 
interest accrues at the lender s prime rate plus at march  or can be fixed for a period of time at the then current rate established under one of several indices  all at our option 
in addition  there is an unused commitment fee of 
per year  based on a weighted average formula 
this credit facility expires on september   and we expect to renegotiate and extend the term of this agreement or obtain another form of financing before that date 
our obligation to the lender is presently secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of our non real estate assets  and we are subject to several restrictive covenants 
the principal operating covenants require us to maintain certain minimum cash flow coverage and debt to equity ratios and restrict the level of capital expenditures  calculated on a quarterly basis 
we are currently in compliance with the covenants 
we believe our credit line with the lender is sufficient to 
table of contents fund capital expenditures for the foreseeable future and to meet seasonal fluctuations in cash flow requirements 
however  unexpected conditions could require us to request additional borrowing capacity from the lender or alter our expansion plans or operations 
our primary contractual obligations and commitments as of march   are store leases with initial terms expiring from through  which typically provide for multiple five year renewal options and employment contracts operating employment payments due by period leases contracts within year years years after years total all retail store leases provide for base rent which may or may not be credited against percentage rent based upon gross sales from the premises 
in some of the leases  base rental amounts increase as the lease term progresses although  in some cases  we expect that percentage rent will more than offset the base rental amounts 
generally  our purchase obligations are cancelable days prior to shipment from our vendors 
letters of credit amounting to  relating to purchase commitments were outstanding as of march  and expire within one year 
no cash dividends have been declared on common stock in fiscal we intend to retain earnings for use in the operation and expansion of our business and  therefore  do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates our significant accounting policies are described in note to the financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
in preparing the financial statements  we are required to make estimates and judgments which affect the results of its operations and the reported value of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe that the following summarizes critical accounting policies which require significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
inventory valuation 
merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out determined by the retail method of accounting or market 
we consider cost to include direct cost of merchandise  plus internal costs associated with merchandise procurement  storage and handling 
we regularly review aged and excess inventories to determine if the carrying value of such inventories exceeds market value 
a reserve is recorded to reduce the carrying value to market value as necessary 
a determination of market value requires estimates and judgment based on our historical markdown experience and anticipated markdowns based on future merchandising and advertising plans  seasonal considerations  expected business trends and other factors 
revenue recognition 
sales are recognized upon the purchase by customers at our retail store locations  less merchandise returned by customers 
we provide a reserve for projected merchandise returns based on historical experience 
as the reserve for merchandise returns is based on estimates  the actual returns could differ from the reserve  which could impact sales 
revenue from gift cards  gift certificates and store merchandise credits is recognized at the time of redemption 

table of contents self insurance 
property  general liability and workers compensation insurance coverage is self insured for various levels 
self insurance accruals include claims filed  as well as estimates of claims incurred but not yet reported based on historical trends 
projections of future loss are inherently uncertain because of the random nature of insurance claim occurrences and could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from historical trends 
gift card certificate redemption 
we offer our customers the option of purchasing gift cards and  in the past  gift certificates which may be used toward the future purchase of our product offerings 
the gift cards and certificates have no expiration dates 
we record unredeemed gift cards or certificates as a liability until the point of redemption 
our historical experience indicates that not all issued gift cards or certificates get redeemed 
accordingly  we periodically adjust the carrying value of the related liability 
we monitor redemption rates as a percent of issuances and use this information to estimate probable redemption of all outstanding gift cards or certificates 
this calculation is based on historical experience  and future redemption rates may vary if consumer purchasing practices change or if the pattern of redeeming gift cards is significantly different than we have experienced with gift certificates 
impairment of long lived assets 
we account for long lived assets in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is determined by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered impaired  the impairment recognized is measured by comparing projected individual store discounted cash flow to the asset carrying values 
declines in projected store cash flow could result in the impairment of assets 
accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing the financial statements  income taxes are estimated for each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within the balance sheet 
the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income is assessed  recognizing that future taxable income may give rise to new deferred tax assets 
to the extent that that future recovery is not likely  a valuation allowance would be established 
to the extent a valuation allowance is established or increased  an expense will be included within the tax provision in the income statement 
significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
based on our history of operating earnings  no valuation allowance has been recorded as of march  in the event that actual results differ from these estimates  or these estimates are adjusted in future periods  a valuation allowance may need to be established  which could impact our financial position and results of operations 
provisions for income taxes for  and are based on numerous factors that are subject to audit by the internal revenue service and the tax authorities in the various jurisdictions in which we do business 
factors that may affect future results our short and long term success is subject to many factors that are beyond our control 
stockholders and prospective stockholders in the company should consider carefully the following risk factors  in addition to other information contained in this report 
this annual report on form l k contains forward looking statements  which are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors including those set forth below 

table of contents economic conditions 
the retail industry historically has been subject to substantial cyclical variations 
the merchandise sold by us is generally a discretionary expense for its customers 
a recession in the general economy or uncertainties regarding future economic prospects that affect consumer spending habits has had  and may do so in the future have  a materially adverse effect on our results of operations 
terrorism war 
terrorist attacks may cause damage or disruption to our employees  facilities  information systems  vendors and customers  which could significantly impact net sales  costs and expenses and financial condition 
the potential for future terrorist attacks  the national and international responses to terrorist attacks  and other acts of war or hostility may cause greater uncertainty and cause us to suffer in ways that we currently cannot predict 
our geographical focus in california and nevada may make us more vulnerable to such uncertainties than other comparable retailers who may not have similar geographical concentration 
competition 
the sporting goods business and the retail environment are highly competitive  and we compete with national  regional and local full line sporting goods chains  specialty stores  supplier owned stores  discount and department stores  and internet retailers 
a number of our competitors are larger and have greater resources 
regional market concentration 
currently  most of our stores are located in southern california and the balance are located in northern california and the las vegas area of nevada 
accordingly  we are subject to regional risks  such as the economy  weather conditions  natural disasters and government regulations 
for example  warm winter weather in the resorts frequented by our customers has affected sales in the past 
when the region suffers an economic downturn or when other adverse events occur  historically there has been an adverse effect on our net sales and profitability and this could also affect our ability to implement our planned growth 
several of our competitors operate stores across the united states and  thus  are not as vulnerable to such regional risks 
reliance on a single distribution center 
we currently rely on a single distribution center in ontario  california 
any natural disaster or other serious disruption to this distribution center due to fire  earthquake or any other cause could damage a significant portion of our inventory and could materially impair both our ability to adequately stock our stores and our net sales and profitability 
expansion plan 
our continued growth depends on a strategy of opening new  profitable stores in existing markets and in new regional markets 
the ability to successfully implement this growth strategy could be negatively affected by any of the following suitable sites may not be available for leasing  we may not be able to negotiate acceptable lease terms  we might not be able to hire and retain qualified store personnel  and we might not have the financial resources necessary to fund our expansion plans 
in addition  our expansion in new and existing markets may present competitive  distribution and merchandising challenges that differ from the current challenges 
these potential new challenges include competition among our stores  added strain on our distribution center  additional information to be processed by our management information systems and diversion of management attention from ongoing operations 
we face additional challenges in entering new markets  including consumers lack of awareness of the company  difficulties in hiring personnel and problems due to our unfamiliarity with local real estate markets and demographics 
new markets may also have different competitive conditions  consumer tastes and discretionary spending patterns than our existing markets 
to the extent that we are not able to meet these new challenges  net sales could decrease and operating costs could increase 
furthermore  a decline in our overall financial performance  increased rents or any other adverse effects arising from the commercial real estate market in our geographical markets may adversely affect our current growth plan 
there can be no assurance that we will possess sufficient funds to finance the expenditures related to our planned growth  that new stores can be opened on a timely basis  that such new stores can be operated on a profitable basis  or that such growth will be manageable 

table of contents future capital requirements 
we may not be able to fund our future growth or react to competitive pressures if we lack sufficient funds 
unexpected conditions could cause us to be in violation of our lender s operating covenants 
currently  we feel we have sufficient cash available through our bank credit facilities and cash from operations to fund existing operations for the foreseeable future 
we cannot be certain that additional financing will be available in the future if necessary 
management of growth 
since our inception  we have experienced periods of rapid growth 
no assurance can be given that we will be successful in maintaining or increasing our sales in the future 
any future growth in sales will require additional working capital and may place a significant strain on our management  management information systems  inventory management  distribution facilities and receivables management 
any failure to timely enhance our operating systems  or unexpected difficulties in implementing such enhancements  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
dependence on key personnel 
we depend on the continued service of our senior management 
the loss of the services of any key employee could hurt our business 
also  our future success depends on our ability to identify  attract  hire  train and motivate other highly skilled personnel 
failure to do so may adversely affect future results 
seasonality 
our sales volume increases significantly during the holiday season as is typical with other sporting goods retailers 
in addition  our product mix has historically emphasized cold weather sporting goods increasing the seasonality of our business 
in recent years  the months of november  december and january represented between and  of our total net sales  while winter related products ranged from to of total net sales 
the operating results historically have been influenced by the amount and timing of snowfall at the resorts frequented by our customers 
an early snowfall often has influenced sales because it generally extends the demand for winter apparel and equipment  while a late snowfall may have the opposite effect 
suppliers in the ski and snowboard industry require us to make commitments for purchases of apparel and equipment by april for fall delivery  and only limited quantities of merchandise can be reordered during the fall 
consequently  we place our orders in the spring anticipating snowfall in the winter 
if the snowfall does not at least provide an adequate base or occurs late in the season  or if sales do not meet projections  we may be required to mark down our winter apparel and equipment 
variability of quarterly results 
we have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  a substantial variation in our net sales and operating results from quarter to quarter 
we believe that the factors which influence this variability of quarterly results include general economic and industry conditions that affect consumer spending  changing consumer demands  the timing of our introduction of new products  the level of consumer acceptance of each new product  the seasonality of the markets in which we participate  the weather and actions of competitors 
accordingly  a comparison of our results of operations from period to period is not necessarily meaningful  and our results of operations for any period are not necessarily indicative of future performance 
closely controlled stock 
at june   norbert olberz  the company s founder  chairman emeritus  director and principal stockholder  owned approximately of sport chalet s outstanding common stock 
mr 
olberz effectively has the ability to control the outcome on all matters requiring stockholder approval  including  but not limited to  the election and removal of directors  and any merger  consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets  and to control our management and affairs 

table of contents information systems are vulnerable 
our success  in particular our ability to successfully manage inventory levels and our centralized distribution system  largely depends upon the efficient operation of our computer hardware and software systems 
we use management information systems to track inventory information at the store level  replenish inventory from our warehouse  and aggregate daily sales information among other things 
these systems and our operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquake  fire  flood and other natural disasters  power loss  computer systems failures  internet and telecommunications or data network failure  operator negligence  improper operation by or supervision of employees  physical and electronic loss of data and similar events  and computer viruses  penetration by hackers seeking to disrupt operations or misappropriate information and other breaches of security 
we seek to minimize these risks by the use of backup facilities and redundant systems 
nevertheless any failure that causes an interruption in our operations or a decrease in inventory tracking could result in reduced net sales 
our business depends on anticipating consumer tastes 
if we fail to anticipate changes in consumer preferences  we may experience lower net sales  higher inventory markdowns and lower margins 
products must appeal to a broad range of consumers whose preferences cannot be predicted with certainty 
these preferences are also subject to change 
sporting goods are often subject to short lived trends  such as the short lived popularity of in line scooters 
outdoor wear is significantly influenced by fashion 
our success depends upon the ability to anticipate and respond in a timely manner to trends in sporting goods merchandise and consumers participation in sports 
failure to identify and respond to these changes may cause net sales to decline 
in addition  because we generally make commitments to purchase products from vendors up to six months in advance of the proposed delivery  misjudging the market may over stock unpopular products and force inventory markdowns that could have a negative impact on profitability  or have insufficient inventory of a popular item that can be sold at full markup 
stock price 
our common stock is thinly traded making it difficult to sell large amounts 
the market price of our common stock is likely to be volatile and could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to factors such as quarterly variations in operating results  operating results which vary from the expectations of securities analysts and investors  changes in financial estimates  changes in market valuations of competitors  announcements by us or our competitors of a material nature  additions or departures of key personnel  future sales of common stock and stock volume fluctuations 
also  general political and economic conditions such as a recession or interest rate fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to interest rate risk consists primarily of borrowings under our credit facility  which bears interest at floating rates primarily libor rates 
the impact on earnings or cash flows during the next fiscal year from a change of basis points in the interest rate would not be significant
