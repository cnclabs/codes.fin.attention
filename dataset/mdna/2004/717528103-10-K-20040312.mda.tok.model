the company regularly performs various analytical procedures with respect to its investments  including identifying any security whose fair value is below its cost 
upon identification of such securities  a detailed review is performed for all securities  except interests in securitized assets  meeting predetermined thresholds to determine whether such decline is other than temporary 
if the company determines a decline in value to be other than temporary  based upon its detailed review  or if a decline in value for an equity investment has persisted continuously for nine months  the cost basis of the security is written down to its fair value 
the factors considered in reaching the conclusion that a decline below cost is other than temporary include  but are not limited to  whether the issuer is in financial distress  the investment is secured  a significant credit rating action has occurred  scheduled interest payments have been delayed or missed  or changes in laws and or regulations have impacted an issuer or industry 
the amount of any write down is included in earnings as a realized loss in the period the impairment arose 
this evaluation resulted in non cash realized investment losses of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
such non cash realized investment losses resulted from other than temporary declines in the fair value of certain holdings in the company s common stock portfolio occurring primarily in the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of the company primarily attributes these other than temporary declines in fair value to the uncertain economic climate  the overhang of corporate governance issues  and the high profile bankruptcies occurring during into early additionally  the company conducts its impairment evaluation and recognition for interests in securitized assets in accordance with the guidance provided by the emerging issues task force of the financial accounting standards board eitf in eitf under this guidance  impairment losses on securities must be recognized if both the fair value of the security is less than its book value and the net present value of expected future cash flows is less than the net present value of expected future cash flows at the most recent prior estimation date 
if these criteria are met  an impairment charge  calculated as the difference between the current book value of the security and its fair value  is included in earnings as a realized loss in the period the impairment arose

as previously discussed  there are certain risks and uncertainties inherent in the company s impairment methodology  such as the financial condition of specific industry sectors and the resultant effect on underlying security collateral values 
should the company subsequently determine a decline in the fair value below the cost basis to be other than temporary  the security would be written down to its fair value and the difference would be included in earnings as a realized loss for the period such determination was made
