the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and notes included under item of this annual report 
in addition  the reader should review cautionary statement regarding forward looking information and risk factors under item of this annual report for information regarding forward looking statements made in this discussion and certain risks inherent in our business 
other risks involved in our business are discussed under quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk included under item a of this annual report 
additionally  please see part iii  item for a discussion of related party matters  including our relationship with shell 
recent developments on december   we and certain of our affiliates  el paso corporation and certain of its affiliates el paso  and gulfterra energy partners  lp gulfterra and certain of its affiliates entered into a series of agreements under which one of our wholly owned subsidiaries and gulfterra would merge  with gulfterra surviving the merger and becoming wholly owned by us 
formed in  gulfterra is a publicly traded limited partnership nyse symbol  gtm that manages a balanced  diversified portfolio of interests and assets relating to the midstream energy sector 
prior to december   el paso was majority owner of gulfterra s general partner and owns a limited partner interest in gulfterra 
in general  gulfterra s business lines include ownership or interests in over  miles of natural gas pipeline systems 
these pipeline systems include gathering systems onshore in alabama  colorado  louisiana  mississippi  new mexico and texas and offshore in some of the most active drilling and development regions in the gulf of mexico 
gulfterra also owns interests in five natural gas processing and treating plants located in new mexico  texas and colorado  ownership in over  miles of intrastate ngl gathering and transportation pipelines and four ngl fractionation plants located in texas 
gulfterra also owns interests in three offshore oil pipeline systems  which extend over miles  owns a mmbbl propane storage and leaching business located in mississippi and owns or leases ngl storage facilities in louisiana and texas with aggregate capacity of approximately mmbbls  ownership in two salt dome natural gas storage facilities located in mississippi that have a combined current working capacity of bcf 
in addition  gulfterra has the exclusive right to use a natural gas storage facility located in wharton  texas under an operating lease that expires in january this facility has a working gas capacity of bcf  interests in seven multi purpose offshore hub platforms in the gulf of mexico that were specifically designed to be used as deepwater hubs and production handling and pipeline maintenance facilities  and interests in four oil and natural gas producing properties located in waters offshore louisiana 
production is gathered  transported  and processed through gulfterra s pipeline systems and platform facilities  and sold to various third parties and el paso 
gulfterra is one of the largest natural gas gatherers  based on miles of pipeline  in the prolific natural gas supply regions offshore in the gulf of mexico and onshore in texas and in the san juan basin  which includes a significant portion of the four contiguous corners of arizona  colorado  new mexico and utah 
these regions  especially the deepwater regions of the gulf of mexico  which is one of the united states fastest growing oil and natural gas producing regions  offer gulfterra significant growth potential through the acquisition and construction of pipelines  platforms  processing and storage facilities and other energy infrastructure 
the proposed merger is a three step process outlined as follows step one 
on december   we purchased a membership interest in gulfterra s general partner gulfterra energy company  llc or gulfterra gp for million 
this investment is accounted for using the equity method 
this transaction is referred to as step one of the proposed merger and will remain in effect even if the remainder of the proposed merger and post merger transactions  which we refer to as step two and three  do not occur 
step two 
if all necessary regulatory and unitholder approvals are received and the other merger agreement conditions are either fulfilled or waived and the following steps are consummated  we will own of the limited and general partner interests in gulfterra 
at that time  the proposed merger will be accounted for using the purchase method and gulfterra will be a consolidated subsidiary of our company 
step two of the proposed merger includes the following transactions el paso s contribution to our general partner of el paso s remaining interest in gulfterra gp for a interest in our general partner  and the subsequent capital contribution by our general partner of such interest in gulfterra gp to us without increasing our general partner s interest in our earnings or cash distributions 
our purchase of  gulfterra series c units and  gulfterra common units owned by el paso for million  and the exchange of each remaining gulfterra common unit for enterprise common units  resulting in the issuance of approximately million enterprise common units to gulfterra unitholders 
step three 
immediately after step two is completed  we expect to acquire nine cryogenic natural gas processing plants  one natural gas gathering system  one natural gas treating plant  and a small natural gas liquids connecting pipeline from el paso for million 
we refer to the assets that we will acquire from el paso as the south texas midstream assets 
our preliminary estimate of the total consideration for steps one  two and three we would pay or grant is approximately billion 
for a period of three years following the closing of the proposed merger  el paso will provide support services to gulfterra similar to those provided by el paso prior to the closing of the merger 
gulfterra will reimburse el paso for of its direct costs of such services excluding any overhead costs 
el paso will make transition support payments to us in annual amounts of million  million and million for the first  second and third years of such period  respectively  payable in equal monthly installments for each such year 
these transition support payments are included in our preliminary estimate of total consideration 
we are working to complete the merger as soon as possible 
a number of conditions must be satisfied before we can complete the merger  including approval by the unitholders of both the company and gulfterra and the expiration or termination of applicable waiting periods under the hart scott rodino antitrust improvements act of while we cannot predict if and when all of the conditions to the merger will be satisfied  we expect to complete the merger in the second half of to review a copy of the merger agreement and related transaction documents  please read our current report on form k filed with the securities and exchange commission on december  our results of operations we have five reportable business or operating segments pipelines  fractionation  processing  octane enhancement and other 
pipelines consists of ngl  petrochemical and natural gas pipeline systems  storage and import export terminal services 
fractionation primarily includes ngl fractionation  isomerization and propylene fractionation 
processing includes our natural gas processing business and related ngl marketing activities 
octane enhancement represents our investment in a facility that produces motor gasoline additives to enhance octane currently producing mtbe 
the other business segment consists of fee based marketing services and various operational support activities 
we evaluate segment performance based on the non gaap financial measure of gross operating margin 
gross operating margin either in total or by individual segment is an important performance measure of the core profitability of our operations 
this measure forms the basis of our internal financial reporting and is used by senior management in deciding how to allocate capital resources among business segments 
we believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that our management uses in evaluating segment results 
the gaap measure most directly comparable to total segment gross operating margin is operating income 
our non gaap financial measure of total segment gross operating margin should not be considered as an alternative to gaap operating income 
we define total segment gross operating margin as operating income before depreciation and amortization expense  operating lease expenses for which we do not have the payment obligation  gains and losses on the sale of assets  and selling  general and administrative expenses 
gross operating margin is exclusive of other income and expense transactions  provision for income taxes  minority interest and extraordinary charges 
gross operating margin by segment is calculated by subtracting segment operating costs and expenses net of the adjustments noted above from segment revenues  with both segment totals before the elimination of intercompany transactions 
in accordance with gaap  intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation 
we include equity earnings from unconsolidated affiliates in our measurement of segment gross operating margin 
our equity investments with industry partners are a vital component of our business strategy 
they are a means by which we conduct our operations to align our interests with those of our customers  which may be a supplier of raw materials or a consumer of finished products 
this method of operation also enables us to achieve favorable economies of scale relative to the level of investment and business risk assumed versus what we could accomplish on a stand alone basis 
many of these businesses perform supporting or complementary roles to our other business operations

these subleases the retained lease expense in the previous table are part of the epco agreement now referred to as the administrative services agreement that we executed with epco in connection with our formation in epco holds these items pursuant to operating leases for which it has retained the corresponding cash lease payment obligation 
operating costs and expenses as shown in the statements of consolidated operations and comprehensive income treat the lease payments being made by epco as a non cash related party operating expense  with the offset to partners equity on the consolidated balance sheets recorded as a general contribution to the company 
apart from the partnership interests we granted to epco at our formation  epco does not receive any additional ownership rights as a result of its contribution to us of the retained leases 
in addition  epco has assigned to us the purchase options associated with these leases

on september   we increased our ownership interest in this facility to 
as a result of this increased ownership interest  beginning with the fourth quarter of  the financial results of this facility are now consolidated in our financial statements

the indicative gas processing gross spread is a relativemeasure used by the ngl industry as an indicator of the gross economic benefit derived from extracting ngls from natural gas production on the us gulf coast 
specifically  it is the amount that the economic value of a composite gallon of ngls exceeds the value of the equivalent amount of energy of natural gas based on ngl and natural gas prices on the us gulf coast 
it is assumed that a gallon of ngls is comprised of ethane  propane  normal butane  isobutane and natural gasoline 
the value of a composite gallon of ngls is determined by multiplying these component percentages by industry index prices listed in the table above 
the value of the equivalent amount of energy of natural gas to one gallon of ngls is of the price of a mmbtu of natural gas 
the indicative gas processing gross spread does not consider the operating and fuel costs incurred by a natural gas processing plant to extract the ngls nor the transportation and fractionation costs to deliver the ngls and natural gas to market 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues for increased billion over those recorded during likewise  costs and expenses increased billion over those of the increase in revenues and costs and expenses is primarily due to higher product sales and purchase prices and the financial results of business acquisitions  both of which offset the effect of lower volumes at some of our pipelines and facilities 
in addition  costs and expenses for includes a million loss related to commodity hedging activities 
in general  higher market prices result in increased revenues from our various marketing activities  however  these same higher prices also increase our cost of sales within these activities as feedstock and other purchase prices rise 
in addition  higher natural gas market prices during increased energy related costs for many of our businesses versus the same period in the weighted average market price of ngls was cpg during versus cpg during the market price of natural gas averaged per mmbtu during versus per mmbtu during when compared to  volumes at some of our downstream pipelines and facilities were lower due to a combination of i decreased demand for ngls  principally ethane  by the ethylene segment of the petrochemical industry the ethylene industry and ii lower ngl extraction rates at domestic gas processing facilities 
the most significant determinant of the relative economic value of ngls is demand by the ethylene industry for use in manufacturing plastics and chemicals 
during  this industry operated at lower utilization rates when compared to primarily due to a recession in the domestic manufacturing sector 
also during  as a result of the higher relative cost of ngls to crude based alternatives such as naphtha  the ethylene industry utilized crude based feedstock alternatives in greater quantities than during the resulting weaker demand for ngls by this industry limited the ability of ngl producers to sell at higher product prices  which in turn resulted in decreased ngl extraction rates during for information regarding our outlook for ngl demand by the petrochemical industry  please read our results of operations general outlook for equity earnings from unconsolidated affiliates decreased million year to year primarily due to a million decrease in equity earnings from bef 
the million decrease in equity earnings from bef is primarily due to a million asset impairment charge we recorded during the third quarter of  increased facility downtime during for maintenance and economic reasons  and an overall decrease in mtbe sales margins 
in addition to lower earnings from bef  approximately million of the overall decrease in equity earnings is due to a rate case settlement recorded by starfish in as a result of items noted in the previous paragraphs  operating income for increased million from that posted during total segment gross operating margin increased million year to year due to the same general reasons underlying the increase in operating income 
operating income includes costs such as depreciation and amortization and selling  general and administrative expenses that are excluded from the non gaap financial measure of total segment gross operating margin 
the following information highlights the significant year to year variances in gross operating margin by business segment pipelines 
gross operating margin from our pipelines segment was million for compared to million during on an energy equivalent basis  net pipeline throughput was  mbpd during the period versus  mbpd during the period 
the increase in gross operating margin was primarily due to our acquisition of mid america and seminole 
these two systems earned gross operating margin of million during on aggregate net volumes of mbpd 
since we acquired interests in these systems at the end of july  the period includes million in gross operating margin for august through december when compared to their historical operating rates  net pipeline transportation volumes on the mid america and seminole systems recorded for were lower than those reported by these systems for the full year of primarily due to decreased demand for ngls  principally ethane  by the ethylene industry and lower ngl extraction rates at regional gas processing facilities 
excluding the contributions of mid america and seminole  gross operating margin for the pipelines segment was million for versus million for on an energy equivalent basis excluding mid america and seminole  net pipeline throughput volumes increased to mbpd during from mbpd during the period 
an increase in gross operating margins from our houston ship channel ngl import terminal and related hsc pipeline  the lou tex ngl and lou tex propylene pipelines and our recently acquired port neches pipeline partially offset a net decline in our other gulf coast area pipeline operations due in part to lower ngl extraction rates at regional gas processing facilities and demand for ngls by industry  a million decrease in equity earnings from starfish related to the settlement of a rate case in  and a million decrease in gross operating margins from our ngl and petrochemical storage operations due in part to higher energy related costs and net charges associated with the measurement of liquids volumes held in storage 
the mbpd increase in net volumes was primarily due to higher throughput rates at our ngl import terminal and related hsc pipeline 
fractionation 
gross operating margin from our fractionation segment was million for compared to million for gross operating margin from ngl fractionation improved million year to year 
net ngl fractionation volumes decreased to mbpd during from mbpd during the increase in ngl fractionation gross operating margin is primarily due to i mixed ngl measurement gains we recognized during at our mont belvieu facility and ii higher percent of liquids revenues during at norco attributable to the general increase in ngl prices  both of which more than offset a decline in gross operating margin from our other ngl fractionation facilities generally due to lower volumes and higher energy related costs 
the decrease in ngl fractionation volumes period to period was primarily due to lower ngl extraction rates at gas processing facilities and reduced demand for ngls by the petrochemical industry 
gross operating margin from propylene fractionation declined million year to year primarily due to lower petrochemical marketing margins resulting from higher feedstock and energy related operating costs 
net propylene fractionation volumes were mbpd for compared to mbpd during gross operating margin from isomerization increased million year to year 
isomerization volumes were mbpd during the period compared to mbpd during the period 
the increase in gross operating margin from isomerization was generally attributable to higher isomerization fees and by product revenues  which were partially offset by lower volumes and higher energy related operating costs 
processing 
gross operating margin from our processing segment was million for compared to a gross operating margin loss of million in our results for include million in commodity hedging losses  the underlying strategies of which were discontinued in our commodity hedging results for were a loss of million 
equity ngl production at our gas processing plants averaged mbpd during compared to mbpd during the decrease in equity ngl production year to year was largely attributable to reduced demand for ngls  principally ethane  by the ethylene industry and higher natural gas prices relative to ngl prices  which caused most natural gas processors to minimize the amount of ngls extracted at their facilities 
to meet the natural gas processing needs of shell our largest natural gas processing customer in this challenging business environment  we renegotiated certain provisions of the year shell natural gas processing agreement during the first quarter of for a general discussion of this amendment  please read related party transactions relationship with shell included under item of this annual report 
during  we renegotiated a number of our natural gas processing contracts 
in general  our objective has been to convert our traditional keepwhole arrangements to either margin band keepwhole contracts such as the shell agreement referenced in the preceding paragraph  percent of liquids contracts or fee based contracts 
the goal of these renegotiations is to minimize our direct exposure to the volatility of natural gas prices  especially to the extent it increases the ptr cost we would pay under traditional keepwhole arrangements to the point that processing natural gas to extract ngls becomes uneconomical for us 
when ngl extraction is uneconomical  ngls are left in the natural gas stream to the extent allowed while keeping the natural gas in compliance with pipeline quality specifications  thus reducing the amount of ngls available for downstream activities such as pipeline transportation and ngl fractionation 
for an additional discussion of our current natural gas processing contract mix and an explanation of the various types of contracts we use  please read the company s operations processing included under item of this annual report 
octane enhancement 
our equity and consolidated earnings from bef were a loss of million for compared to equity income of million during net mtbe production from this facility decreased to mbpd during versus mbpd during the million decrease in equity earnings is primarily due to a million impairment charge we recorded during the third quarter of for our share of an impairment charge recorded by bef  increased downtime during for maintenance and economic reasons  and an overall decrease in mtbe sales margins 
bef owns a facility that currently produces mtbe  a motor gasoline additive that enhances octane and is used in reformulated gasoline 
the production of mtbe is primarily driven by oxygenated fuel programs enacted under the federal clean air act amendments of as a result of environmental concerns  several states have enacted legislation to ban or significantly limit the use of mtbe in motor gasoline within their jurisdictions 
in addition  federal legislation has been drafted to ban mtbe and replace the oxygenate with renewable fuels such as ethanol 
as a result of declining domestic demand and a prolonged period of weak mtbe production economics  several of bef s competitors have announced their withdrawal from the marketplace 
due to the deteriorating business environment and outlook and the completion of its preliminary engineering studies regarding conversion alternatives  bef evaluated the carrying value of its long lived assets for impairment during the third quarter of this review indicated that the carrying value of its long lived assets exceeded their collective fair value  which resulted in bef recording a non cash impairment charge of million 
bef s assets were written down during the third quarter of to fair value  which was determined by independent appraisers using present value techniques 
the impaired assets principally represent the plant facility and other assets associated with mtbe production 
the fair value analysis incorporates future courses of action being taken or contemplated to be taken by bef management  including the production of iso octane and alkylate 
if the underlying assumptions in the fair value analysis change  resulting in the present value of expected future cash flows being less than the new carrying value of the facility  additional impairment charges may result in the future 
bef is currently in the process of preparing detailed engineering plans to modify the facility to iso octane production 
the facility will continue to produce mtbe as market conditions warrant and will be capable of producing either mtbe or iso octane once the plant modifications are complete 
depending on the outcome of various factors including pending federal legislation the facility may be further modified to produce alkylate 
upon our acquisition of an additional partnership interest in bef  it became a majority owned consolidated subsidiary of ours on september  historically  bef was accounted for as an equity method unconsolidated affiliate 
its results will continue to be reported under our octane enhancement segment 
for information regarding uncertainties surrounding our investment in bef  please read other items uncertainties regarding our investment in facilities that produce mtbe 
selling  general and administrative costs 
these expenses were million for compared to million during the period includes approximately million that we paid to williams for transition services associated with our acquisition of mid america and seminole compared to million paid in for these services 
these payments ceased in february when we began operating these two pipeline systems 
interest expense 
interest expense increased to million during from million in the increase is primarily due to additional debt we incurred as a result of business acquisitions 
our weighted average debt principal outstanding was billion during compared to billion during interest expense for includes million of loan cost amortization related to the day term loan  which was incurred in july and fully repaid in february for additional information regarding our debt obligations and changes in our debt obligations since december   please read our liquidity and capital resources our debt obligations 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues for increased million over those for the increase is primarily due to the financial results of acquired businesses during such as the purchase of mid america and seminole from williams and propylene fractionation and ngl and petrochemical storage assets from diamond koch 
costs and expenses increased million year to year primarily due to the addition of costs and expenses of acquired businesses and an unfavorable change in results from our commodity hedging activities 
operating income decreased million and gross operating margin decreased million primarily as a result of such changes 
pipelines 
gross operating margin from our pipelines segment was million for compared to million for on an energy equivalent basis  net pipeline throughput volume for was  mbpd compared to mbpd during our acquisition of the mid america and seminole ngl pipelines in july accounted for million of the improvement in segment gross operating margin and mbpd of the increase in throughput rates 
gross operating margin from our mont belvieu storage businesses improved million in primarily due to the acquisition of diamond koch s storage business in january another million of the improvement in year to year gross operating margin was caused by the inclusion of a full year s results of operations from acadian gas in  whereas included only nine months 
we acquired acadian gas in april fractionation 
gross operating margin from our fractionation segment was million for compared to million for we expanded our propylene fractionation business in february with the acquisition of splitter iii from diamond koch 
our propylene fractionation volumes increased to mbpd during from mbpd during gross operating margin from these businesses increased million year to year 
splitter iii accounted for mbpd of the increase in volumes and million of the increase in gross operating margin 
our isomerization business posted a million decrease in gross operating margin for when compared to isomerization volumes increased to mbpd during versus mbpd during the positive effect of the higher isomerization volumes was offset by a decrease in isomerization revenues 
certain of our isomerization fees are indexed to historical natural gas prices which were higher in relative to 
lastly  gross operating margin from our ngl fractionation businesses decreased million in when compared to ngl fractionation volumes increased to mbpd during from mbpd during the year to year decrease in ngl fractionation gross operating margin is primarily due to lower revenues from our mont belvieu ngl fractionation facility caused by strong competition at this industry hub  partially offset by the addition of earnings from the toca western facility we acquired in june of the mbpd increase in ngl fractionation volumes  mbpd is due to our purchase of an additional interest in the mont belvieu facility and mbpd is due to the acquisition of toca western 
processing 
gross operating margin from our processing segment was a loss of million for compared to income of million for of the million change in gross operating margin  million is due to a decrease in results from our commodity hedging activities 
we recorded a loss of million from these activities during versus income of million during also  gross operating margin from ngl marketing activities included in this segment benefited from unusually strong demand for propane and isobutane during early and mid which did not repeat during the year to year net decline in commodity hedging results and earnings from our ngl marketing activities was partially offset by a favorable decrease in ngl inventory valuation adjustments 
also  gross operating margin for includes the million expense we recorded related to amounts owed to us by enron  which filed for bankruptcy in december our equity ngl production was mbpd during versus mbpd during the mbpd increase in equity ngl production rates is primarily due to improved gas processing conditions 
as noted above  the million decrease in commodity hedging results was the primary reason for the year to year decline in gross operating margin from this segment 
in order to manage the risks associated with our processing segment  we may enter into short term  highly liquid commodity financial instruments to hedge our exposure to price risks associated with natural gas  ngl production and inventories  firm commitments and certain anticipated transactions 
we have employed various hedging strategies to mitigate the effects of fluctuating commodity prices primarily ngl and natural gas prices on our earnings from processing segment businesses 
beginning in late and extending through march  a large number of our commodity hedging transactions were based on the historical relationship between natural gas prices and ngl prices 
this type of hedging strategy utilized the forward sale of natural gas at a fixed price with the expected margin on the settlement of the position offsetting or mitigating changes in the anticipated margins on ngl marketing activities and the market values of our equity ngl production 
throughout  this strategy proved very successful as the price of natural gas declined relative to our fixed positions and was responsible for most of the million in commodity hedging income we recorded during in late march  the effectiveness of this strategy was reduced due to an unexpected rapid increase in natural gas prices whereby the loss in the value of our fixed price natural gas financial instruments was not offset by increased gas processing margins 
due to the inherent uncertainty surrounding natural gas prices at the time  we decided that it was prudent to exit this strategy  and we did so by late april the increased ineffectiveness of this strategy is the primary reason for the million in commodity hedging losses recorded during a variety of factors influence whether or not our hedging strategies are successful 
for additional information regarding our financial instrument portfolios  please read item a of this report 
octane enhancement 
our equity earnings from bef were million for compared to million for the improvement is primarily due to increased mtbe production attributable to lower maintenance downtime 
on a gross basis  bef s mtbe production increased to mbpd during compared to mbpd during other 
gross operating margin from this segment decreased million year to year primarily due to an increase in information technology related facility support costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
these expenses increased to million during compared to million during the increase is primarily due to the additional staff and resources needed to support our expansion activities resulting from acquisitions and other business development 
the majority of the additional costs for are attributable to amounts we paid williams for transition services associated with our acquisition of mid america and seminole 
interest expense 
interest expense increased to million during compared to million during the increase is primarily due to debt obligations we incurred as a result of business acquisitions and investments in inventory 
of the million increase in interest expense  million is attributable to the debt incurred to finance the mid america and seminole acquisitions 
in addition  income from our interest rate hedging activities which is recorded as a reduction in interest expense decreased million in when compared to the change in interest rate hedging results is primarily due to certain elections by counterparties during to terminate interest rate hedging agreements 
general outlook for we expect our business to be affected by the following key trends and events during our expectations are based on assumptions made by us and information currently available to us 
to the extent our underlying assumptions about or interpretations of available information prove to be incorrect  our expectations may vary materially from actual results 
as noted earlier  the most significant determinant of the relative economic value of ngls is demand by the ethylene industry for use in manufacturing plastics and chemicals 
during  this industry operated at lower utilization rates when compared to primarily due to a recession in the domestic manufacturing sector 
as the domestic economy began to strengthen during the third and fourth quarters of  ngl demand by the ethylene industry increased  but remained below the five year average for these products 
as we begin  we are encouraged by further improvement in demand for ngls by the ethylene industry 
we have received indications from many of our largest ngl consuming customers that their operating rates and demand for ngls should be greater in than based on the demand for their products and the prospects of a further strengthening in the domestic and global economies 
if our expectations regarding demand for ngls by the ethylene industry are met and natural gas prices remain stable  we should realize improved operating rates at many of our facilities and pipelines 
our overall results of operations and financial position during will be affected by the timing and successful completion of our proposed merger with gulfterra 
the assets of the proposed combined partnership would include over  miles of pipelines comprised of over  miles of natural gas pipelines   miles of ngl pipelines and miles of offshore gulf of mexico large capacity crude oil pipelines 
the combined partnership s other logistical assets would also include ownership interests in mmbbls of ngl storage capacity and bcf of natural gas storage capacity  seven offshore gulf of mexico hub platforms  and import and export terminals on the houston ship channel 
the combined partnership would also own interests in fractionation plants with a net capacity mbpd and natural gas processing plants with a net capacity of bcf d 
we believe the assets and businesses of these two partnerships are complementary 
we believe the scale and business opportunities for the combined partnership would provide us with a number of avenues to create value for our unitholders and our producing and consuming customers 
we are working to complete the merger as soon as possible 
a number of conditions must be satisfied before we can complete the merger  including approval by the unitholders of both enterprise and gulfterra and the expiration or termination of applicable waiting periods under the hart scott rodino antitrust improvements act of while we cannot predict if and when all of the conditions to the merger will be satisfied  we expect to complete the merger in the second half of for additional information regarding the proposed merger  please read recent developments beginning on page as a result of our acquisition of a interest in gulfterra gp in december  our equity earnings from this investment will increase earnings from the pipelines segment and increase cash distributions from unconsolidated affiliates 
this acquisition is step one of our proposed merger with gulfterra 
for additional information regarding the proposed merger with gulfterra  please read recent developments 
during february  we received the first quarterly cash distribution from gulfterra gp  which was approximately million 
future distributions and earnings from gulfterra gp will be dependent on the declared distribution rates and operating results of gulfterra 
earnings from our octane enhancement business will continue to be subject to mtbe sales margins until our iso octane project is completed 
several states  including california  new york and connecticut  implemented mtbe bans on january  although these bans have weakened overall demand for mtbe  several mtbe suppliers exited the industry during the reduced supply for mtbe during should help to stabilize prices over the short term while we work to convert the facility to iso octane production 
we are currently in the process of modifying bef s mtbe production facility to produce iso octane  a motor gasoline octane enhancement additive derived from isobutane 
we expect iso octane demand by refiners to replace octane volume that is lost as a result of mtbe being eliminated as a motor gasoline blendstock 
our modification project is expected to be complete during the third quarter of the facility will continue to produce mtbe as market conditions warrant and will be capable of producing either mtbe or iso octane once the plant modifications are complete 
our isomerization rates related to bef will depend on the extent that mtbe and iso octane are produced both products use isobutane as a feedstock 
for additional information regarding our octane enhancement business including regulatory and environmental matters  please read the company s operations octane enhancement included under item of this annual report 
our liquidity and capital resources general our primary cash requirements  in addition to normal operating expenses and debt service  are for capital expenditures both sustaining and expansion related  business acquisitions and distributions to our partners 
we expect to fund our short term needs for such items as operating expenses and sustaining capital expenditures with operating cash flows 
capital expenditures for long term needs resulting from internal growth projects and business acquisitions are expected to be funded by a variety of sources including either separately or in combination cash flows from operating activities  borrowings under commercial bank credit facilities  the issuance of additional partnership equity and public or private placement debt 
we expect to fund cash distributions to partners primarily with operating cash flows 
our debt service requirements are expected to be funded by operating cash flows and or refinancing arrangements 
as noted above  certain of our liquidity and capital resource requirements are fulfilled by borrowings made under debt agreements and or proceeds from the issuance of additional partnership equity 
at december   we had approximately billion in principal outstanding under various debt agreements 
on that date  total borrowing capacity under our revolving commercial bank credit facilities was million of which million was unused 
for additional information regarding our debt  please read our debt obligations 
in february  we filed a universal shelf registration with the sec covering the issuance of up to million of partnership equity or public debt obligations 
in october  we sold  common units under this shelf registration statement which generated million of cash to us including related capital contributions from our general partner 
in january  we sold an additional  common units under this shelf registration which generated million of cash to us including related capital contributions from our general partner 
we used the cash generated by these equity offerings to reduce debt outstanding under our day term loan and for working capital purposes 
also  in january and february  we issued senior notes c million principal amount and senior notes d million principal amount  respectively 
for information regarding our application of cash obtained through these debt offerings  please read our debt obligations 
in january  we filed a new billion universal shelf registration statement with the sec covering the issuance of an unallocated amount of partnership equity or public debt obligations separately or in combination 
in june  we sold  common units under this shelf registration statement  which generated million of cash to us including related capital contributions from our general partner 
we used the cash generated by this equity offering to reduce debt outstanding under our revolving credit facilities 
as a result of meeting certain financial tests  the subordination period as defined in our partnership agreement  with respect to our subordinated units  ended on august  with the expiration of the subordination period  we may prudently issue an unlimited number of units for general partnership purposes 
in july  we filed a registration statement with the sec covering our distribution reinvestment plan the drp 
the drp provides unitholders of record and beneficial owners of our common units a voluntary means by which they can increase the number of common units they own by reinvesting the quarterly cash distributions they would otherwise receive in the purchase of additional common units 
currently  the registration statement covers the issuance of up to  common units under the drp 
as a result of reinvestment proceeds from our limited partners under the drp  our general partner will be required to make cash capital contributions to us in order to maintain its ownership interest 
we expect to use the cash generated from this reinvestment program for general partnership purposes 
initial reinvestments under the drp occurred in august for all of  we issued  common units in connection with the drp and received proceeds of approximately million 
epco s reinvestment accounted for approximately million of the million reinvested during to support our growth objectives and financial flexibility  epco has announced that it expects to reinvest under the drp an additional million of its cash distributions from the first quarter of through the first quarter of as a result  we are preparing to increase the number of common units that can be issued under the drp to approximately  common units 
in december  we sold  class b special units to an affiliate of epco for million in a private transaction 
our general partner contributed approximately million in connection with this offering in order to maintain its ownership interest 
we used the net proceeds from this offering to repay million of the debt we incurred to finance our december purchase of a interest in gulfterra gp and the remainder for general partnership purposes 
if deemed necessary  we believe that additional financing arrangements can be obtained on reasonable terms 
furthermore  we believe that maintenance of our investment grade credit ratings combined with a continued ready access to debt and equity capital at reasonable rates and sufficient trade credit to operate our businesses efficiently provide a solid foundation to meet our long and short term liquidity and capital resource requirements 
the following discussions highlight significant year to year comparisons in consolidated operating  investing and financing cash flows for year ended december  net income    adjustments to reconcile net income to cash flows provided by used for operating activities before changes in operating accounts depreciation and amortization    equity in income of unconsolidated affiliates   distributions received from unconsolidated affiliates   changes in fair market value of financial instruments  other    cash flow from operating activities before changes in operating accounts net effect of changes in operating accounts    operating activities cash flows    operating cash flows primarily reflect net income adjusted for depreciation and amortization  equity earnings and cash distributions from unconsolidated affiliates  fluctuations in the fair value of financial instruments and changes in operating accounts 
the net effect of changes in operating accounts is generally the result of timing of sales and purchases near the end of each period 
cash flow from operations is primarily based on earnings from our business activities 
as a result  these cash flows are exposed to certain risks 
the products that we process  sell or transport are principally used as feedstocks in petrochemical manufacturing  in the production of motor gasoline and as fuel for residential  agricultural and commercial heating 
reduced demand for our products or services by industrial customers  whether because of general economic conditions  reduced demand for the end products made with our products  increased competition from petroleum based products due to pricing differences or other reasons  could have a negative impact on our earnings and thus the availability of cash from operating activities 
other risks include fluctuations in ngl and energy prices  competitive practices in the midstream energy industry and the impact of operational and systems risks 
for a more complete discussion of these and other risk factors pertinent to our business  please read cautionary statement regarding forward looking information and risk factors included under item of this annual report 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  operating cash flows 
cash flow from operating activities was an inflow of million during compared to an inflow of million during as shown in the preceding table  cash flow before the net effect of changes in operating accounts was an inflow of million during versus million during we believe that cash flow from operating activities before the net effect of changes in operating accounts is an important measure of our ability to generate core cash flows from our assets and other investments 
the million increase in this element of our cash flows is primarily due to earnings from newly acquired businesses in the period but not in the period particularly those of mid america and seminole  which we acquired in july  the period including million of commodity hedging losses versus million of such losses during the period  offset by higher interest costs associated with debt we incurred and issued since the first quarter of to finance acquisitions 
the million increase in depreciation and amortization is primarily due to additional businesses acquired since the first quarter of the net effect of changes in operating accounts is generally the result of timing of cash receipts from sales and cash payments for inventory  purchases and other expenses near the end of each period

our general partner also contributed million to our operating partnership in connection with these offerings 
distributions to our partners and minority interests increased to million during from million during the million increase in distributions to partners is primarily due to increases in both the declared quarterly distribution rates and the number of units eligible for distributions 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  operating cash flows 
cash flow from operating activities was an inflow of million during compared to million during as shown in the preceding table  cash flow before changes in operating accounts was an inflow of million during versus million during the million year to year decrease in this element of our cash flows is primarily due to net hedging losses in versus net hedging income in offset by increased distributions from unconsolidated affiliates and earnings from businesses we acquired during the million increase in depreciation and amortization is primarily due to businesses we acquired during changes in operating accounts are generally the result of timing of cash receipts from sales and cash payments for inventory  purchases and other expenses near the end of each period

net proceeds from the sale of the common units were million 
this amount includes the general partner s aggregate contribution to us and our operating partnership of million to maintain its combined general partner interest 
cash distributions to our partners and minority interests increased million year to year primarily due to increases in both the declared quarterly distribution rates and the number of units eligible for distributions 
the number of units eligible for distributions was higher in due to the conversion of million of shell s class a special units to an equal number of common units in august and our issuance of the million new common units in october debt issuance costs increased million year to year primarily due to the million in fees we paid to lenders in july associated with the short term financing of the mid america and seminole acquisitions

on december  as the result of our execution of definitive agreements with gulfterra and el paso to merge with gulfterra  moody s put our rating under review for possible downgrade and standard and poor s placed our rating on credit watch with negative implications 
both debt rating agencies will be reviewing the credit attributes and the risk profile of the merged partnership as well as the execution risk of the permanent financing of the proposed merger 
on november   our senior unsecured credit rating as rated by standard and poor s was lowered from bbb to bbb with a negative outlook 
standard and poor s indicated that the negative outlook reflected their concern that the rebound in ngl demand was temporary and that weak demand could return in standard and poor s also indicated that our rating was subject to downgrade if our financial performance in was less than the then current expectations 
standard and poor s cited concerns regarding our financial performance during the second and third quarters of and the sustainability of increased ngl demand by the petrochemical industry during standard and poor s indicated that it was also evaluating what effect  if any  that epco s purchase of shell s interest in our general partner might have on our overall credit quality

we maintain regular communications with these ratings agencies  each of which independently judges our creditworthiness based on a variety of quantitative and qualitative factors 
capital spending forecasts at december   we had million in estimated outstanding purchase commitments attributable to capital projects  practically all of which were related to the construction of assets that will be recorded as property  plant and equipment

in ops issued safety regulations containing requirements for the development of integrity management programs for oil pipelines which includes ngl and petrochemical pipelines such as ours in certain high consequence areas 
high consequence areas include but are not limited to high population areas  environmentally sensitive locations  and areas containing drinking water supplies 
in connection with these regulations  we developed a pipeline integrity management program and  by the end of  had identified the segments of our liquids pipelines that were located in such areas 
the regulations stipulate that a pipeline company must assess the condition of its pipelines in such areas and perform any necessary repairs 
we are required to evaluate at least of our identified pipeline mileage in such high consequence areas by the end of with the balance completed before april after this initial testing is complete  the identified pipeline segments must be reassessed every five years thereafter 
on november   congress passed the pipeline safety improvement act  which contains requirements for the development of integrity management programs on gas pipelines located in certain high consequence areas  and effective february   ops adopted regulations to implement this statute 
the new regulations require gas pipeline operators to develop by december   integrity management programs for gas transmission pipelines that could impact high consequence areas in the event of a failure 
we anticipate that our implementation of the gas pipeline regulations will proceed on a timely basis 
during  we spent approximately million to comply with these new regulations  of which million was expensed 
during each of the years through  our cash outlays for this program are expected to be in the range of million to million 
at present  we expect that approximately of these future expenditures will be recorded as operating expenses within our pipelines segment

our adoption of fin as amended by finr in has had no material effect on our financial statements 
our critical accounting policies in our financial reporting process  we employ methods  estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements 
these methods  estimates and assumptions also affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
investors should be aware that actual results could differ from these estimates should the underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect 
the following describes the estimation risk in each of these significant financial statement items depreciation methods and estimated useful lives of property  plant and equipment property  plant and equipment is recorded at cost and is depreciated using the straight line method over the asset s estimated useful life 
our plants  pipelines and storage facilities have estimated useful lives of five to years 
our miscellaneous transportation equipment have estimated useful lives of three to years 
depreciation is the systematic and rational allocation of an asset s cost  less its residual value if any  to the periods it benefits 
straight line depreciation results in depreciation expense being incurred evenly over the life of the asset 
the determination of an asset s estimated useful life must take a number of factors into consideration  including technological change  normal depreciation and actual physical usage 
if any of these assumptions subsequently change  the estimated useful life of the asset could change and result in an increase or decrease in depreciation expense 
at december  and  the net book value of our property  plant and equipment was billion and billion  respectively 
we recorded million and million in depreciation expense during and  respectively 
for additional information regarding our property  plant and equipment  please read notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item of this annual report 
impairment charges and underlying estimated fair values if we determine that an asset s undepreciated cost may not be recoverable due to impairment of the asset  then we are required to take a charge against earnings 
long lived assets with recorded values that are not expected to be recovered through future expected cash flows are written down to their estimated fair values 
an asset is tested for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that its carrying value may not be recoverable 
the carrying value of a long lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the existing asset 
our estimates of such undiscounted cash flows are based on a number of assumptions including anticipated margins and volumes  estimated useful life of the asset or asset group  and salvage values 
if we initially determine that an asset s carrying value is recoverable through such undiscounted estimated cash flows and later revise these assumptions and determine that the opposite is true  we would be required to ascertain the fair value of the facility  which might ultimately result in an impairment charge being recorded 
if the carrying value of an asset exceeds the sum of its undiscounted expected cash flows  an impairment loss equal to the amount that the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset is recognized 
the quoted market price of an asset on an active exchange or similar venue is the best determinant of fair value 
however  in many instances  quoted market prices in such markets are not available 
in those instances  the estimate of fair value is based on the best information available  including prices for similar assets and the results of using other valuation techniques including present value techniques 
since most of our plant and other fixed and intangible assets are not traded in an active market  we generally rely on the use of present value techniques when determining the fair value of such assets for the purpose of impairment testing 
these techniques incorporate our best available information and assumptions regarding future cash flows  alternative courses of action  probabilities of such courses of action occurring and discount rates 
to the extent that any of these underlying assumptions prove incorrect  we may be required to take additional impairment charges in the future 
due to a deteriorating business environment and outlook and the completion of its preliminary engineering studies regarding conversion alternatives  bef evaluated the carrying value of its long lived assets for impairment during the third quarter of this review indicated that the carrying value of bef s long lived assets exceeded their collective fair value  which resulted in a non cash impairment charge of million 
our share of this loss is million and is recorded as a component of equity in income loss of unconsolidated affiliates in our statements of consolidated operations and comprehensive income for the three and nine months ended september  our historical equity and in the future  consolidated earnings from bef are classified under the octane enhancement business segment 
for additional information regarding this impairment charge  please read note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item of this annual report 
amortization methods and estimated useful lives of qualifying intangible assets the specific  identifiable intangible assets of a business enterprise depend largely upon the nature of its operations 
potential intangible assets include intellectual property such as technology  patents  trademarks and trade names  customer contracts and relationships  and non compete agreements  as well as other intangible assets 
the approach to the valuation of each intangible asset will vary depending upon the nature of the asset  the business in which it is utilized  and the economic returns it is generating or is expected to generate 
our recorded intangible assets primarily include the estimated value assigned to certain contract based assets representing the rights we own arising from contractual agreements 
a contract based intangible with a finite useful life is amortized over its estimated useful life  which is the period over which the asset is expected to contribute directly or indirectly to the future cash flows of the entity 
it is based on an analysis of all pertinent factors including the expected use of the asset by the entity  the expected useful life of related assets ie  fractionation facility  storage well  etc  any legal  regulatory or contractual provisions  including renewal or extension periods that would not cause substantial costs or modifications to existing agreements  the effects of obsolescence  demand  competition  and other economic factors and the level of maintenance required to obtain the expected future cash flows 
if the underlying assumption s governing the amortization of an intangible asset were later determined to have significantly changed either favorably or unfavorably  then we may be required to adjust the amortization period of such asset to reflect any new estimate of its useful life 
such a change would increase or decrease the annual amortization charge associated with the asset at that time 
during  we did not find it necessary to adjust the estimated useful life or amortization period of any of our intangible assets 
should any of the underlying assumptions indicate that the value of the intangible asset might be impaired  we may be required to reduce the carrying value and subsequent useful life of the asset 
any such write down of the value and unfavorable change in the useful life ie  amortization period of an intangible asset would increase operating costs and expenses at that time 
at december  and  the carrying value of our intangible asset portfolio was million and million  respectively 
we did not recognize any impairment losses related to our intangible assets during or for additional information regarding our intangible assets  please read notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item of this annual report 
methods we employ to measure the fair value of goodwill our goodwill is attributable to the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired and is primarily comprised of the million associated with the purchase of propylene fractionation assets from diamond koch in february since our adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  on january   our goodwill amounts are no longer amortized 
instead  goodwill is tested annually at a reporting unit level  and goodwill is tested more frequently if certain circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of goodwill is below its carrying amount 
if such indicators are present ie  loss of a significant customer  economic obsolescence of plant assets  etc  then the fair value of the reporting unit  including its related goodwill  is calculated and compared to its combined book value 
currently  our goodwill is primarily recorded as part of the fractionation operating segment based on the assets to which the goodwill relates 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its book value  then goodwill is not considered impaired and no adjustment to earnings would be required 
should the fair value of the reporting unit including its goodwill be less than its book value  a charge to earnings would be recorded to adjust goodwill to its implied fair value 
at december  and  the carrying value of our goodwill was million and million  respectively

our investment in dixie and gulfterra gp exceeded our share of the historical cost of the underlying net assets of such entities excess cost 
the excess cost of these investments is reflected in our investments in and advances to unconsolidated affiliates for these entities 
the excess cost of dixie and gulfterra includes amounts attributable to goodwill 
equity method investments are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that there is a loss in value of the investment which is other than a temporary decline 
for additional information regarding our excess cost amounts  please read notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item of this annual report 
for dixie  the amount attributable to goodwill at december  was million 
for gulfterra gp  the amount attributable to goodwill at december  was estimated at million 
the goodwill amount for gulfterra gp represents our preliminary allocation of the purchase price pending completion of a fair value analysis which is expected to be completed during the second half of to the extent that our preliminary allocation of the excess cost of gulfterra gp is ultimately attributed to depreciable or amortizable assets  our equity earnings from gulfterra will be reduced from what it otherwise would be 
the table below shows the potential decrease in equity earnings from gulfterra gp if certain amounts of the million of excess cost preliminarily attributable to goodwill were ultimately assigned to fixed or intangible assets 
for purposes of calculating this sensitivity  we have applied the straight line method of cost allocation ie depreciation or amortization over an estimated useful life of years to various fair values 
excess cost attributed to tangible or intangible assets estimated annual reduction in equity earnings of excess cost   of excess cost   of excess cost   of excess cost   of excess cost   our revenue recognition policies in general  we recognize revenue from our customers when all of the following criteria are met i firm contracts are in place  ii delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  iii pricing is fixed and determinable and iv collectibility is reasonably assured 
when contracts settle ie  either physical delivery of product has taken place or the services designated in the contract have been performed  we determine if an allowance is necessary and record it accordingly 
historically  the consolidated revenues we recorded were not materially based on estimates 
however  as sec regulations require us to submit financial information on increasingly accelerated timeframes  our use of estimates will increase 
we believe the assumptions underlying any revenue estimates that we might use will not prove to be materially different from actual amounts due to our development and implementation of a fully integrated volume management system that is inclusive of operational activities through financial accounting

mark to market accounting for certain financial instruments our earnings are also affected by use of the mark to market method of accounting for certain financial instruments 
we use short term  highly liquid financial instruments such as swaps  forwards and other contracts to manage price risks associated with inventories  firm commitments and certain anticipated transactions  primarily within our processing segment 
the use of mark to market accounting for financial instruments may cause our non cash earnings to fluctuate based upon changes in underlying indexes  primarily those related to commodity prices 
fair value for the financial instruments we employ is determined using price data from highly liquid markets such as the nymex commodity exchange 
during  we recognized a loss of million from our commodity hedging activities 
of this loss  million was attributable to the change in fair value of the portfolio between december  and december  in march  the effectiveness of our primary commodity hedging strategy deteriorated due to an unexpected rapid increase in natural gas prices  therefore  the loss in value of our fixed price natural gas financial instruments was not offset by increased gas processing margins 
we exited the strategy underlying this loss in during  we utilized a limited number of commodity financial instruments from which we recorded a loss of million 
the fair value of open positions at december  was a nominal receivable amount

other items uncertainties regarding our investment in facilities that produce mtbe we have a ownership interest in bef  which owns a facility currently producing mtbe 
at december   the value of our underlying equity in bef was million 
the production of mtbe is primarily driven by oxygenated fuel programs enacted under the federal clean air act amendments of in recent years  mtbe has been detected in water supplies 
the major source of ground water contamination appears to be leaks from underground storage tanks 
as a result of environmental concerns  several states have enacted legislation to ban or significantly limit the use of mtbe in motor gasoline within their jurisdictions 
in addition  federal legislation has been drafted to ban mtbe and replace the oxygenate with renewable fuels such as ethanol 
a number of lawsuits have been filed by municipalities and other water suppliers against a number of manufacturers of reformulated gasoline containing mtbe  although generally such suits have not named manufacturers of mtbe as defendants  and there have been no such lawsuits filed against bef 
it is possible  however  that mtbe manufacturers such as bef could ultimately be added as defendants in such lawsuits or in new lawsuits 
while we believe that we currently have adequate insurance to cover any adverse consequences resulting from our production of mtbe  we have been informed by our insurance carrier that upon renewal of our policy in april  mtbe related claims may be excluded from the scope of our insurance coverage 
for additional information regarding the impact of environmental regulation on bef  please read business and properties regulation and environmental matters impact of the clean air act s oxygenated fuels programs on our bef investment included under items and of this annual report 
as a result of these developments  we are currently in the process of modifying the facility to also produce iso octane  a motor gasoline octane enhancement additive derived from isobutane 
we expect iso octane to be in demand by refiners to replace the amount of octane that is lost as a result of mtbe being eliminated as a motor gasoline blendstock 
the modification project is expected to be completed during the third quarter of at a total cost of approximately million 
the facility will continue to produce mtbe as market conditions warrant and will be capable of producing either mtbe or iso octane once the plant modifications are complete 
depending on the outcome of various factors including pending federal legislation the facility may be further modified in the future to produce alkylate 
conversion of epco subordinated units to common units on may    of epco s subordinated units converted to common units as a result of our satisfying certain financial tests 
the remaining  subordinated units converted to common units on august  these conversions have no impact upon our earnings per unit or distributions since subordinated units are already included in both the basic and fully diluted earnings per unit calculations and are distribution bearing 
conversion of shell special units to common units on august   the last  of shell s non distribution bearing special units converted to common units 
the conversion impacted basic earnings per unit beginning in the third quarter of these units were already included in our fully diluted earnings per unit computations 
since common units are distribution bearing  our limited partner cash distributions to shell increased beginning with the distribution we made in november facility and sensitive infrastructure security matters following the terrorist attacks in the united states  we instituted a review of security measures and practices and emergency response capabilities for all facilities and sensitive infrastructure 
in connection with this activity  we have participated in security coordination efforts with law enforcement and public safety authorities  industry mutual aid groups and regulatory agencies 
as a result of these steps  we believe that our security measures  techniques and equipment have been enhanced as appropriate on a location by location basis 
further evaluation will be ongoing  with additional measures to be taken as specific governmental alerts  additional information about improving security and new facts come to our attention

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in commodity prices and interest rates 
we may use financial instruments ie  futures  forwards  swaps  options  and other financial instruments with similar characteristics to mitigate the risks of certain identifiable and anticipated transactions  primarily within our processing segment 
in general  the types of risks we attempt to hedge are those relating to the variability of future earnings and cash flows caused by changes in commodity prices and interest rates 
as a matter of policy  we do not use financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes

commodity price risk the prices of natural gas  ngls  petrochemical products and mtbe are subject to fluctuations in response to changes in supply  market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control 
in order to manage the risks associated with our processing segment activities  we may enter into various commodity financial instruments 
the primary purpose of these risk management activities is to hedge our exposure to price risks associated with natural gas  ngl production and inventories  firm commitments and certain anticipated transactions 
the commodity financial instruments we utilize may be settled in cash or with another financial instrument 
we do not hedge our exposure related to mtbe price risks 
in addition  we generally do not hedge risks associated with the petrochemical marketing activities that are part of our fractionation segment 
in our pipelines segment  we utilize a limited number of commodity financial instruments to manage the price acadian gas charges certain of its customers for natural gas 
lastly  due to the nature of the transactions  we do not employ commodity financial instruments in our fee based marketing business accounted for in the other segment 
we have adopted a policy to govern our use of commodity financial instruments to manage the risks of our natural gas and ngl businesses 
the objective of this policy is to assist us in achieving our profitability goals while maintaining a portfolio with an acceptable level of risk  defined as remaining within the position limits established by our general partner 
we enter into risk management transactions to manage price risk  basis risk  physical risk or other risks related to our commodity positions on both a short term less than days and long term basis  not to exceed months 
the general partner oversees our strategies associated with physical and financial risks such as those mentioned previously  approves specific activities subject to the policy including authorized products  instruments and markets and establishes specific guidelines and procedures for implementing and ensuring compliance with the policy 
our commodity financial instruments may not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under the specific guidelines of sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  because of ineffectiveness 
a financial instrument is generally regarded as effective when changes in its fair value almost fully offset changes in the fair value of the hedged item throughout the term of the instrument 
due to the complex nature of risks we attempt to hedge  our commodity financial instruments have generally not qualified as effective hedges under sfas no 
 with the result being that changes in the fair value of these positions being recorded on the balance sheet and in earnings through mark to market accounting 
mark to market accounting results in a degree of non cash earnings volatility that is dependent upon changes in the commodity prices underlying these financial instruments 
even though these financial instruments may not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under sfas no 
 we view such contracts as hedges since this was the intent when we entered into such positions 
upon entering into such positions  our expectation is that the economic performance of these instruments will mitigate or offset the commodity risk being addressed 
the specific accounting for these contracts  however  is consistent with the requirements of sfas no 
we assess the risk of our commodity financial instrument portfolio using a sensitivity analysis model 
the sensitivity analysis performed on this portfolio measures the potential income or loss eg  the change in fair value of the portfolio based upon a hypothetical movement in the underlying quoted market prices of the commodity financial instruments outstanding at the dates noted within the following table 
in general  the quoted market prices used in the model are from those actively quoted on commodity exchanges ie  nymex for instruments of similar duration 
in those rare instances where prices are not actively quoted  we employ regression analysis techniques possessing strong correlation factors 
the sensitivity analysis model takes into account the following primary factors and assumptions the current quoted market price of natural gas  the current quoted market price of ngls  changes in the composition of commodities hedged ie  the mix between natural gas and related ngls  fluctuations in the overall volume of commodities hedged for both natural gas and related ngl hedges outstanding  market interest rates  which are used in determining the present value  and a liquid market for such financial instruments 
an increase in fair value of the commodity financial instruments based upon the factors and assumptions noted above approximates the income that would be recognized if all of the commodity financial instruments were settled at the dates noted within the table 
conversely  a decrease in fair value of the commodity financial instruments would result in the recording of a loss 
the sensitivity analysis model does not include the impact that the same hypothetical price movement would have on the hedged commodity positions to which they relate 
therefore  the impact on the fair value of the commodity financial instruments of a change in commodity prices would be offset by a corresponding gain or loss on the hedged commodity positions  assuming the commodity financial instruments function effectively as hedges of the underlying risk  the commodity financial instruments are not closed out in advance of their expected term  and as applicable  anticipated underlying transactions settle as expected 
we routinely review our outstanding financial instruments in light of current market conditions 
if market conditions warrant  some financial instruments may be closed out in advance of their contractual settlement dates thus realizing income or loss depending on the specific exposure 
when this occurs  we may enter into a new commodity financial instrument to reestablish the economic hedge to which the closed instrument relates 
the following table shows the effect of hypothetical price movements on the fair value fv of our commodity financial instrument portfolio and the related potential impact on our earnings ie at the dates indicated dollars in thousands scenario resulting classification at at at fv assuming no change in quoted market prices asset liability fv assuming increase in quoted market prices asset liability ie assuming increase in quoted market prices income loss fv assuming decrease in quoted market prices asset liability ie assuming decrease in quoted market prices income loss during  we recognized a loss of million from our commodity hedging activities that was recorded as an increase in our operating costs and expenses in the statements of consolidated operations 
of the loss recognized in  million is related to commodity hedging activities associated with natural gas purchases within the pipeline segment offset by a million gain from commodity hedging activities associated with the hedging of ngl production within the processing segment 
during  we recognized a loss of million from our commodity hedging activities that was recorded as an increase in our operating costs and expenses in the statements of consolidated operations 
of the loss recognized in  million was related to non cash mark to market income recorded on open positions at december  due to commodity hedging losses we incurred during the first quarter of  we exited most of our positions 
for additional information regarding our processing segment s results for  please read management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  included under item of this annual report 
at end of and  we had a limited number of commodity financial instruments outstanding 
the fair value of the portfolio at february  was a nominal asset amount and was again comprised of a limited number of positions 
product purchase commitments 
we have long and short term purchase commitments for ngls  petrochemicals and natural gas with several suppliers 
the purchase prices that we are obligated to pay under these contracts are based on market prices at the time we take delivery of the volumes 
for additional information regarding these commitments  please read management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our contractual obligations included under item of this annual report 
interest rate risk our interest rate exposure results from variable interest rate borrowings and fixed interest rate borrowings 
we assess the cash flow risk related to interest rates by identifying and measuring changes in our interest rate exposures that may impact future cash flows and evaluating hedging opportunities to manage these risks 
we use analytical techniques to measure our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates  including cash flow sensitivity analysis to estimate the expected impact of changes in interest rates on our future cash flows 
the general partner oversees the strategies associated with these financial risks and approves instruments that are appropriate for our requirements 
interest rate swaps 
at december   we had one interest rate swap outstanding having a notional amount of million that was terminated on march  at the election of the counterparty 
upon the termination  we received million associated with the final settlement of this swap 
the fair value of this swap at december  was million 
there was no earnings impact from the termination of this swap 
on january   we entered into three interest rate swaps under which we agreed to pay variable rates of interest to mitigate the changes in fair value of fixed rate debt as shown below hedged fixed rate debt effective date termination date notional amount senior notes d  fixed rate million senior notes c  fixed rate million senior notes c  fixed rate million we have designated these swaps as fair value hedges 
the swap agreements have a combine notional amount of million and match the maturity of the underlying debt being hedged 
under the swap agreements  we pay to the counterparty a floating libor based interest rate plus an applicable margin and receive back from the counterparty a fixed rate payment equivalent to rate being charged us under the debt being hedged  all based on the notional amounts stated in each swap agreement 
the following table shows the effect of hypothetical price movements on the fair value fv of our interest rate swap portfolio and potential change in the fair value of the debt 
income is not affected by changes in the fair value of the swap 
however  the swap effectively converted the hedged portion of the fixed rate debt to a floating rate debt 
therefore  interest expense and related cash flow will increase or decrease with the change in the periodic reset rate associated with the respective interest rate swaps 
the reset rate is the agreed upon index rate published for the first day of the six month interest calculation period 
scenario resulting classification at change in fair value of debt fv assuming no change in underlying interest rates asset liability fv assuming increase in underlying interest rates asset liability fv assuming decrease in underlying interest rates asset liability treasury locks 
during the fourth quarter of  we entered into seven treasury lock transactions with original maturities of either january  or april  a treasury lock is a specialized agreement that fixes the price or yield on a specific us treasury security for an established period of time 
the purpose of these transactions was to hedge the underlying treasury interest rate associated with our anticipated issuance of debt in early to partially refinance the mid america and seminole acquisitions 
our treasury lock transactions were accounted for as cash flow hedges under sfas no 
the notional amounts of these transactions totaled million  with a total treasury lock rate of approximately 
we elected to settle all of the treasury locks in early february in connection with our issuance of senior notes c and d 
for additional information regarding senior notes c and d  please read management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our liquidity and capital resource our debt obligations included under item of this annual report 
the settlement of the treasury locks resulted in our receipt of million of cash 
the million is being amortized into income as a reduction of interest expense over a year period 
the amortization period is based on the terms of the anticipated transaction as required by sfas no 
the fair value of these instruments at december  was a current liability of million offset by a current asset of million 
the million net liability was recorded as a component of comprehensive income on that date  with no impact to current earnings 
with the settlement of the treasury locks  the million net liability was reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income in partners equity to offset the current asset and liabilities we recorded at december   with no impact to earnings
