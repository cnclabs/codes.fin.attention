the company s center for molecular biology and pathology  located in research triangle park  nc is a leader in the development and application of molecular diagnostics and polymerase chain reaction  or pcr  technologies in the areas of diagnostic genetics  oncology and infectious disease 
the company believes that these technologies may represent a significant savings to the healthcare system by increasing the detection of early stage treatable diseases 
the company s national genetics institute in los angeles  ca  develops novel  highly sensitive pcr methods used to test for hepatitis c and other infectious agents and is the only laboratory in the us that is fda approved to screen plasma for infectious diseases 
viro med laboratories  inc  based in minneapolis  mn  offers molecular microbial testing using real time pcr platforms and provides significant additional capacity to support the continued expansion of the company s advanced testing business 
these centers of excellence enable the company to provide a broad menu of testing services for the infectious disease and cancer markets  which the company believes represent two of the most significant areas of future growth in the clinical laboratory industry 
the company completed the acquisition of dianon on january  this acquisition significantly enhances the company s oncology testing capabilities and enables the company to nationally offer one of the broadest menu of specialized anatomic pathology and gene based cancer testing in the us at the end of  the company was ahead of schedule with the integration and had achieved the synergy savings of approximately million 
the company expects to achieve additional synergy savings of approximately million by the end of  and a total net savings of approximately million by the company began applying dianon s standardized anatomic pathology processes in early this dianization of the company will take approximately three years

the company is continuing interactions with celera to support the development of new gene based assays in a variety of disease areas 
through an agreement with correlogic systems  the company plans to commercialize their protein pattern blood test for the detection of ovarian cancer  which offers the prospect of accurate and early detection of ovarian cancer 
this is a common disease  which if detected early enough  is readily treated and often curable 
the company will initially plan to offer the test to those women at greater than average risk for ovarian cancer sometime during in addition to the acquisitions and relationships discussed above  the company believes future performance will be positively affected by several factors the expansion of higher value genomic tests such as cystic fibrosis  hcv and hiv genotyping  along with the continued growth of hiv viral loads and hpv testing  continued conversion of traditional pap smears to the newer  high value monolayer technology  continued progress with existing licensing and business relationships such as myriad genetics  exact sciences  correlogic and most recently  biopredictive  the company s ongoing business acquisition strategy  and growing demand for genomic testing creating a positive shift in test mix toward higher value testing 
on december   the company s board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program under which the company may purchase up to an aggregate of million of its common stock from time to time 
it is the company s intention to fund future purchases of its common stock with cash flow from operations 
seasonality volume of testing generally declines during the year end holiday periods and other major holidays

testing volume growth  measured by accessions  increased approximately and was affected by the acquisitions of dynacare and dianon as well as growth in the company s esoteric test volumes including hpv and cystic fibrosis 
price per accession increased approximately  compared to the growth in price was affected by this same shift in test mix and from shifts in histology testing which is primarily dianon related 
these improvements were partially offset by the impact of severe winter weather during the first quarter of and physician strikes to protest rising malpractice insurance rates during the second quarter 
cost of sales  which includes primarily laboratory and distribution costs  was  million for compared to  million in  an increase of 
the increase in cost of sales is primarily the result of increases in volume and supplies due to recent acquisitions  growth in the base business and growth in esoteric and genomic testing with significant increases in cystic fibrosis and hpv testing 
cost of sales as a percentage of net sales was for and in  reflecting the additional infrastructure costs facilities and personnel of dynacare and dianon acquisitions

the strengthening of the canadian dollar versus the us dollar during the year ended december  has had a positive impact on this income as well as the cash generated from the canadian investments 
the provision for income taxes as a percentage of earnings before taxes was in compared to in the decrease in the effective tax rate for is due to a million state tax recovery during the third quarter of year ended december  compared with year ended december  net sales for were  million  an increase of from  million reported in the comparable period 
testing volume  measured by accessions  increased primarily as a result of the dynacare acquisition and esoteric volume growth and price per accession increased due in part to the shift in test mix to higher value esoteric tests compared to cost of sales  which includes primarily laboratory and distribution costs  was  million for compared to  million in  an increase of 
in the third quarter of  the company announced a slowdown in volume growth in the carolinas 
in order to reverse these declines in volume  the company initiated a reinvestment program that included adding individuals and facilities to improve client service 
although this reinvestment moderately increased the fourth quarter expenses as expected  there was an improvement in the ratio of new to lost accounts in the affected region 
also  the company incurred certain costs associated with the acquisition and integration of dynacare such as additional overtime and temporary help and the payment of retention bonuses 
additional costs were incurred due to growth in esoteric and genomic testing and higher volume of pap tests performed using more expensive monolayer technology

in  the company will concentrate its conversion activities on the remaining dynacare locations as well as its salt lake city  reno  san diego and viro med facilities 
continuing initiative to reduce the number of requisitions received that are missing certain billing information 
this initiative involves counting the number of clinical requisitions received from an ordering client  as well as determining what specific information was not provided 
the company then identifies root causes of why the information was missing and takes steps to ensure that information is provided in the future 
these steps include re educating clients as to what information is needed in order for the company to bill and collect for the test 
as of december   the percentage of requisitions received which were missing billing information was as compared to at the end of implementation of numerous initiatives related to self pay accounts receivable

critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods 
significant estimates include the allowances for doubtful accounts  amortization lives for intangible assets  accruals for self insurance reserves and reserves for professional liability claims 
the process for estimating the ultimate collection of receivables involves significant assumptions and judgments 
billings for services under third party payor programs  including medicare and medicaid  are recorded as revenues net of allowances for differences between amounts billed and the estimated receipts under such programs 
adjustments to the estimated receipts  based on final settlement with the third party payors  are recorded upon settlement as an adjustment to net revenues 
in addition  the company has implemented a process to estimate and review the collectibility of its receivables based on the period they have been outstanding 
historical collection and payor reimbursement experience is an integral part of the estimation process related to reserves for doubtful accounts 
the company also assesses the current state of its billing functions in order to identify any known collection or reimbursement issues in order to assess the impact  if any  on the reserve estimates  which involves judgment 
the company believes that the collectibility of its receivables is directly linked to the quality of its billing processes  most notably  those related to obtaining the correct information in order to bill effectively for the services provided 
revisions in reserve for doubtful accounts estimates are recorded as an adjustment to bad debt expense within selling  general and administrative expenses 
the company believes that its collection and reserves processes  along with the close monitoring of its billing processes  helps reduce the risk associated with material revisions to reserve estimates resulting from adverse changes in collection and reimbursement experience and billing operations 
the company s pension expense is developed from actuarial valuations 
inherent in these valuations are key assumptions  including discount rates and expected return on plan assets  which are usually updated on an annual basis at the beginning of each year 
the company is required to consider current market conditions  including changes in interest rates  in making these assumptions 
changes in pension costs may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions 
the key assumptions used in accounting for the defined benefit plans were a discount rate and an expected return on plan assets 
compared with the prior year  net pension cost increased million and is projected to decrease approximately million in  primarily as a result of the performance of plan assets in  which should reduce plan expense by approximately million  plan amendments  which should result in reduced plan expense by approximately million  and offset by increased expense of approximately million as a result of the reduction of the discount rate 
in establishing its expected return on plan assets assumption  the company reviews asset allocation considering plan maturity and develops return assumptions based on different asset classes adjusting for plan operating expenses 
actual asset over under performance compared to expected returns will respectively decrease increase unrecognized loss 
the change in the unrecognized loss will change amortization cost in upcoming periods 
a one percentage point change in the expected return assumption in the current year would have resulted in a change in pension expense of approximately million 
effective december   the company adopted the revised statement of financial accounting standards no 
employers disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits 
this standard is an amendment of sfas no 
 and and a revision of sfas no 
the provisions of this statement do not change the measurement and recognition provisions of these previously issued statements  but requires that additional disclosures are made 
some of the required disclosures include plan assets by category  investment policies and strategies  target allocation percentages or target ranges for plan asset categories  projections of future benefit payments  estimates of future contributions to fund pension and other postretirement benefit plans  and interim disclosures of certain items 
effective january   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
this standard requires that goodwill and other intangibles that are acquired in business combinations and that have indefinite useful lives are not to be amortized and are to be reviewed for impairment annually based on an assessment of fair value 
other intangibles patents and technology  customer lists and non compete agreements  are amortized on a straight line basis over the expected periods to be benefited  such as legal life for patents and technology  to years for customer lists and contractual lives for non compete agreements 
the impact of adopting sfas no 
is summarized in note to the consolidated financial statements 
accruals for self insurance reserves including workers compensation  auto and employee medical are determined based on historical payment trends and claims history  along with current and estimated future economic conditions 
the company is self insured for professional liability claims arising in the normal course of business  generally related to the testing and reporting of laboratory test results 
the company records an accrual for such claims payable and claims incurred but not reported based on an actuarial assessment of the accrual  which is performed at least annually 
while management believes these estimates are reasonable and consistent  they are by their very nature  estimates of amounts that will depend on future events 
accordingly  actual results could differ from these estimates 
the company s audit committee periodically reviews the company s significant accounting policies
