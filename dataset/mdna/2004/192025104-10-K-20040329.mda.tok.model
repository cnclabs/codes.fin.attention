the gap analysis begins by assigning interest rate sensitive assets and interest rate sensitive liabilities into future time periods  typically one year  based on a scheduled maturity or repricing date 
repriceable liabilities are then subtracted from repriceable assets to determine a difference  or gap 
the measurement process relies on many assumptions such as the amount and timing of repriceable cash flows from interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities 
the following assumptions are made about repriceable cash flows from interest rate sensitive assets variable rate instruments reprice daily  adjustable rate instruments reprice at the interest maturity date  fixed rate loans reprice at their scheduled maturity date and include estimated prepayments  fixed rate investment securities  except for mortgage backed instruments  reprice at their scheduled maturity date  or call date if more appropriate  and fixed rate mortgage backed instruments reprice based on principal paydown estimates 
generally  cash flow assumptions for interest sensitive assets apply to interest sensitive liabilities with the exception of now and savings deposits which do not have scheduled maturities 
technically  now and savings deposits can be repriced at any time 
historically  now and savings deposits and rates have been relatively stable despite changes in market interest rates 
this stability assumption was made in the current measurement process 
a schedule showing balance sheet repricing characteristics and an estimate of gap at december  is provided below 
the gap is one way to measure how a change in market interest rates might impact net interest income for specific time frames 
for example  the cumulative gap in the repricing category represents a one year net asset position of million or percent of interest earning assets on december  the asset sensitive gap position implies that over the next year net income will increase if market interest rates rise and decrease if rates decline 
the theory is that more assets will reprice  at higher market interest rates  than the liabilities that fund them 
a gap analysis is limited in its usefulness since it represents a one day position  which is continually changing and not necessarily indicative of codorus valley s position at any other time 
gap analysis does not consider the complexity of interest rate relationships and spreads depending on the direction  magnitude and timing of changes in market interest rates 
additionally  it does not consider the impact of financial strategies that management could employ 
due to its limitations  interest rate risk implications from a gap analysis may differ significantly from the results of an interest sensitivity simulation analysis
