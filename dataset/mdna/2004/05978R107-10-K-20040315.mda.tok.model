item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the following discussion and analysis focuses on information about banctrust financial group  inc and its subsidiaries that is not otherwise apparent from the consolidated financial statements and related footnotes appearing below in this annual report 
reference should be made to those statements and the financial data presented elsewhere in this report for a complete understanding of the following discussion and analysis 
on april   gulf coast community bancshares  inc  the parent company of wewahitchka state bank now banktrust of florida  was merged into the company 
this merger has been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
therefore  the results of operations of banktrust of florida have been included in the consolidated results of the company from april  on december   commercesouth  inc commercesouth the parent company of commercesouth bank alabama now banktrust of alabama and commercesouth bank florida now banktrust was merged into the company 
this merger has been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
therefore  the results of operations of these two banks have been included in the consolidated results of the company from december  summary net income for was million compared to million in on a per share basis  basic earnings were

critical accounting policies and estimates the accounting principles followed by the company and the methods of applying these principles conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and with general practices within the banking industry 
critical accounting policies relate to the allowance for loan losses and intangible assets 
a description of these policies is as follows allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level considered by management to be sufficient to absorb losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
banctrust s determination of its allowance for loan losses is determined in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards nos 
and the amount of the allowance for loan losses and the amount of the provision charged to expense is based on periodic reviews of the portfolio  past loan loss experience  current and expected economic conditions and such other factors which  in management s judgment  deserve current recognition in estimating loan losses 
a regular  formal and ongoing loan review is conducted to identify loans with unusual risks or probable loss 
management uses the loan review process to stratify the loan portfolio into risk grades 
for higher risk graded loans in the portfolio the banks determine estimated amounts of loss based on several factors  including historical loss experience  management s judgement of economic conditions and the resulting impact on higher risk graded loans  the financial capacity of the borrower  secondary sources of repayment including collateral and regulatory guidelines 
this determination also considers the balance of impaired loans which are generally considered to be non performing loans  excluding residential mortgages and other homogeneous loans 
specific allowances for impaired loans are based on comparisons of the recorded carrying values of the loans to the present value of these loans estimated cash flows at each loan s effective interest rate  the fair value of the collateral  or the loans observable market price 
recovery of the carrying value of loans is dependent to a great extent on economic  operating and other conditions that may be beyond the company s control 
in addition to evaluating probable losses on individual loans  management also determines probable losses for all other loans in the portfolio 
the amount of the allowance for loan losses related to all other loans in the portfolio is determined based on historical and current loss experience  portfolio mix by loan type and by collateral type  current economic conditions  the level and trend of loan quality ratios  and such other factors which  in management s judgement  deserve current recognition in estimating inherent loan losses 
the methodology and assumptions used to determine the allowance are continually reviewed as to their appropriateness given the most recent losses realized and other factors that influence the estimation process 
the model assumptions and resulting allowance level are adjusted accordingly as these factors change 
financial condition average assets and liabilities average assets in were million  compared to million in average loans  net  in were million or percent higher than average loans of million in loan growth at the company was slow during the years through in the markets served by banctrust  however there was a significant increase in loan demand in management anticipates that the increased loan demand will continue through average deposits of million in were percent higher than average deposits in short term borrowings consist of federal funds purchased  federal home loan bank fhlb borrowings  overnight repurchase agreements and deposits in the treasury tax and loan account 
reliance on these funds at the company historically has been low  however  management might increase its reliance on these types of funds if loan demand increases more quickly than deposit growth 
average long term debt consists primarily of loans from the fhlb 
these funds  when borrowed  are used to fund assets of comparable maturities such as investment securities and loans

the average loan to deposit ratio was percent in compared to percent in the two banks acquired in the commercesouth transaction have significantly higher loan to deposit ratios than the other banks in the company  and  as a result  the loan to deposit ratio of the company at year end rose to percent compared to percent at year end it is management s goal to make loans with relatively short maturities or  in the case of loans with longer maturities  with floating rate arrangements when possible 
of the outstanding loans in the categories of commercial  financial and agricultural  real estate construction and real estate mortgage at december   million  or percent  mature within one year and are therefore subject to interest rate changes  if needed  to adjust for asset liability management purposes 
of the remaining loans in these categories maturing after one year  percent are on a floating rate basis 
of the total loans outstanding in these categories at december   percent are available for repricing within one year  either because the loans mature within one year or because they are based on a variable rate arrangement 
the company makes available to its customers fixed rate  longer term loans  especially in the residential real estate mortgage area 
banctrust is able to offer  through third party arrangements  certain loan products which do not require that the longer term loans be carried on the books of the company 
these products allow the company to gain the benefit of a larger variety of product offerings and have generated a significant amount of fee income during the recent period of lower mortgage rates 
these fees have come from home purchases as well as significant home refinancing volume 
if interest rates rise  the company expects that this volume will decrease 
some reduction in volume has already been felt in the last quarter of as refinancing activity began to slow 
table shows the distribution of loans by major category at december   and at each of the previous four year ends 
table depicts maturities of selected loan categories and the interest rate structure for such loans maturing after one year

 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities requires that securities be classified into one of three categories held to maturity  available for sale  or trading 
securities classified as held to maturity are stated at amortized cost 
this classification means that management has the positive intent  and the company has the ability  to hold the securities until they mature 
securities classified as available for sale are stated at fair value 
securities in this category are held for indefinite periods of time  and include securities that management intends to use as part of its asset liability strategy  or that may be sold in response to changes in interest rates  changes in prepayment risks  changes in liquidity needs  the need to increase regulatory capital or other similar factors 
at december   all of the company s securities were in the available for sale category 
the company holds no trading securities or those classified as held to maturity 
the maturities and weighted average yields of securities available for sale at december   are presented in table at amortized cost using the average stated contractual maturities 
the average stated contractual maturities may differ from the average expected life because of amortized principal payments or because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations 
tax equivalent adjustments  using a percent tax rate  have been made when calculating yields on tax exempt obligations 
included in other investments are equity securities  primarily fhlb stock in the amount of  which do not mature but are included in the after years category

banctrust defines core deposits as total deposits less certificates of deposit of  or more 
core deposits  as a percentage of total deposits  increased slightly in as they represented percent of total deposits at year end  compared to percent at year end while the primary emphasis at banctrust remains on attracting and retaining core deposits  management recognizes that  in order to fund loan growth  it might be necessary from time to time to pursue non core funding sources such as large certificates of deposit and other borrowed funds more vigorously than in the past 
table reflects maturities of time deposits of  or more at december  deposits of million in this category represented percent of total deposits at year end  compared to percent at year end short term borrowings include three items federal funds purchased  securities sold under agreements to repurchase  which are overnight transactions with large corporate customers  commonly referred to as repos  and other  representing borrowings from the fhlb  from the federal reserve through its discount operations and us treasury tax and loan funds on deposit subject to a note payable to the us treasury department 
the company sold federal funds of million on average during while average short term borrowings were only million 
management has sought to control the volume of funds in this category within certain acceptable limits  however  a greater reliance on these types of funds may be necessary in order to fund loan growth in the future 
one of management s asset liability management goals relating to liquidity is to maintain a net sold position whereby federal funds sold exceed short term borrowings 
in the past three years  average federal funds sold have exceeded short term borrowings

they are flexible  allowing the company to quickly obtain the necessary maturities and rates that best suit its overall asset liability management strategy 
fhlb advances totaled million at december   an increase of million from december  the purchase of the eufaula bank accounted for million of this increase  with the remaining changes being an advance at the mobile bank of million and a payment by the demopolis bank of million 
all of the outstanding advances have fixed interest rates  however million of fhlb advances outstanding at december  are convertible  at the discretion of the fhlb  to variable rates 
note to the consolidated financial statements  included elsewhere in this report  includes additional information relating to outstanding balances  scheduled maturities and rates of fhlb advances 
the company borrowed funds from a trust in to finance a portion of the purchase price of commercesouth  inc the trust was created to issue trust preferred securities which the company is currently allowed by the federal reserve bank to include in the company s calculations of tier i capital 
this payable to trust was million at december  compared to at december  the company does not have the option to repay any amounts of the payable to trust until asset liability management the purpose of asset liability management is to maximize return while minimizing risk 
maximizing return means achieving or exceeding the company s profitability and growth goals 
minimizing risk means managing four key risk factors liquidity  interest rate sensitivity  capital adequacy  and asset quality 
asset liability management at the company involves a comprehensive approach to statement of condition management which meets the risk and return criteria established by management and the board of directors 
to this point  management has not used derivative financial instruments as part of its asset liability management process 
the company s primary market risk is its exposure to interest rate changes 
interest rate risk management strategies are designed to optimize net interest income while minimizing fluctuations caused by changes in the interest rate environment 
it is through these strategies that the company seeks to manage the maturity and repricing characteristics of its statement of condition 
the modeling techniques used by the company simulate net interest income and impact on fair values of the company s assets and liabilities under various rate scenarios 
important elements of these techniques include the mix of floating versus fixed rate assets and liabilities  and the scheduled  as well as expected  repricing and maturing volumes and rates on the existing statement of condition 
under a scenario simulating a hypothetical basis point rate increase applied to all interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  the company would expect a net decrease in net interest income of million over one year 
under a scenario simulating a hypothetical basis point decrease  the company would expect a net increase in net interest income of thousand 
these hypothetical examples are not a precise indicator of future events 
instead  they are reasonable estimates of the results anticipated if the assumptions used in the modeling techniques were to occur 
liquidity liquidity represents the ability of a bank to meet loan commitments as well as deposit withdrawals 
liquidity is derived from both the asset side and the liability side of the statement of condition 
on the asset side  liquidity is provided by marketable investment securities  maturing loans  federal funds sold and cash and cash equivalents 
on the liability side  liquidity is provided by a stable base of core deposits 
additionally  the company has available  if needed  federal funds lines of credit  fhlb lines of credit and an operating line of credit from a correspondent bank

table commitments in thousands one year or less over one year through five years over five years total lines of credit unused standby letters of credit total interest rate sensitivity by monitoring the company s interest rate sensitivity  management attempts to maintain a desired balance between the growth of net interest revenue and the risks that might result from significant changes in interest rates in the market 
one tool for measurement of this risk is gap analysis  whereby the repricing of assets and liabilities is compared within certain time categories 
by identifying mismatches in repricing opportunities within a time category  interest rate risk can be identified 
the interest sensitivity analysis presented in table is based on this type of gap analysis  which assumes that rates earned on interest earning assets and rates paid on interest bearing liabilities will move simultaneously in the same direction and to the same extent 
however  the rates associated with these assets and liabilities actually change at different times and in varying amounts 
changes in the composition of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities can increase or decrease net interest revenue without affecting interest sensitivity 
the interest rate spread between assets and their corresponding liability can be significantly changed while the repricing interval for both remains unchanged  thus impacting net interest revenue 
over a period of time  net interest revenue can increase or decrease if one side of the statement of condition reprices before the other side 
an interest sensitivity ratio of earning assets divided by interest bearing liabilities  which represents a matched interest sensitive position  does not guarantee maximum net interest revenue 
before investing  management must evaluate several factors  including the general direction of interest rates  in order to determine the type of investment and the maturity needed 
management may  from time to time  accept calculated risks associated with interest sensitivity in an attempt to maximize net interest revenue 
the company does not currently use derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate sensitivity 
at december   the company s three month gap position  earning assets divided by interest bearing liabilities  was percent and at twelve months the gap position  on a cumulative basis  was percent  both within the range established by management as acceptable 
the company s three month gap position indicates that  in a period of rising interest rates  each of assets which reprice upward could be followed with more than in liabilities which could reprice upward within three months 
thus  under this scenario  net interest revenue might decrease during the three month period of rising rates 
in a period of falling rates  the opposite effect might occur 
while certain categories  such as some loans and certain certificates of deposit  are contractually tied to interest rate movements  most are subject only to competitive pressures and do not necessarily reprice directly with changes in market rates 
management has a certain amount of flexibility when adjusting rates on these products

certain types of savings and now accounts included in interest bearing demand deposits are included in the non interest sensitive within years category 
in management s opinion  these liabilities do not reprice in the same proportions as rate sensitive assets  as they are not responsive to general interest rate changes in the economy 
capital resources tangible shareholders equity shareholders equity less goodwill  other intangible assets and accumulated other comprehensive income was million at december   compared to million at december  the decrease resulted from the purchase of commercesouth and the addition of approximately million in goodwill and other intangible assets 
at year end  the tier i capital ratio decreased to percent from percent at year end in december the company formed a trust which issued million of trust preferred securities  the proceeds of which were used to partially finance the purchase of commercesouth 
these securities  for regulatory purposes  are added to tangible common shareholders equity to calculate tier i capital 
the company s leverage ratio  defined as tangible shareholders equity divided by quarterly average assets  was percent at year end the eufaula bank s and the santa rosa beach bank s assets are only included in the calculation of average assets from december   the date of acquisition 
had these bank s assets been included for the entire quarter  the consolidated leverage ratio would have been percent 
the federal reserve and the fdic require that bank holding companies and banks maintain certain minimum levels of capital as defined by risk based capital guidelines 
these guidelines consider risk factors associated with various components of assets  both on and off the statement of condition 
under these guidelines  capital is measured in two tiers  and these capital tiers are used in conjunction with risk based assets in determining risk based capital ratios 
the ratios  expressed as a percentage of total risk adjusted assets  for tier i and total capital were percent and percent  respectively  at december  the company exceeded the minimum risk based capital guidelines at december    and see capital adequacy on page  regulatory issue on page and footnote of notes to consolidated financial statements

changes in interest rates  changes in the volume of assets and liabilities  and changes in the asset liability mix are the major factors that influence net interest revenue 
presented in table is an analysis of net interest revenue  weighted average yields on earning assets and weighted average rates paid on interest bearing liabilities for the past three years 
net yield on interest earning assets is net interest revenue  on a tax equivalent basis  divided by total interest earning assets 
this ratio is a measure of the company s effectiveness in pricing interest earning assets and funding them with both interest bearing and non interest bearing liabilities 
the company s net yield in  on a tax equivalent basis  decreased basis points to percent compared to percent in the numerous and rapid interest rate reductions that began in early had an adverse effect on the net yield in and  as the rates earned on loans and other interest earning assets decreased more rapidly than rates paid on the liabilities  primarily deposits  used to support those assets 
as rates stabilized in  so did the company s net yield on interest earning assets 
the banking industry trend has been toward lower net interest yields over the past several years  and management expects this trend to continue in the industry

tax equivalent net interest revenue in was million higher than in total interest revenue decreased by million  which was more than offset by the decrease in total interest expense of million 
both total interest revenue and total interest expense decreased due to rate  a result of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities continuing to reprice downward due to the general lowering of interest rates which began in all major categories of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  with the exception of fhlb advances and long term debt  increased due to volume

provision for loan losses and allowance for loan losses the provision for loan losses is the cost of providing an allowance that is adequate to absorb inherent losses on loans in the portfolio 
management reviews the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses on a continuous basis by assessing the quality of the loan portfolio and adjusting the allowance when appropriate 
loan review procedures are in place to ensure that potential problem loans are identified 
the procedures include a continuous review of the portfolios at the affiliate banks by the company s loan review department 
management s evaluation of each loan includes a review of the financial condition and capacity of the borrower  the value of the collateral  current economic trends  historical losses  work out and collection arrangements  and possible concentrations of credit 
the loan review process also includes an evaluation of credit quality within the mortgage and installment loan portfolios 
in establishing the allowance  loss percentages are applied to groups of loans with similar risk characteristics 
these loss percentages are determined by historical experience  portfolio mix  and other economic factors 
each quarter this review is quantified in a report to management which uses it to determine whether an appropriate allowance is maintained 
this report is then submitted to the company s board of directors quarterly 
the amount of the allowance is affected by i loan charge offs  which decrease the allowance  ii recoveries on loans previously charged off  which increase the allowance  and iii the provisions for loan losses charged to income  which increase the allowance 
table sets forth certain information with respect to the company s average loans  allowance for loan losses  charge offs and recoveries for the five years ended december  net charge offs increased to million in compared to million in  due primarily to the charge off of one large loan in this loan is also primarily responsible for the increase in the addition to the allowance charged to operating expense of million

these credits were considered in determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and  while current  are regularly monitored for changes within a particular industry or general economic trends which could cause the borrowers severe financial difficulties 
any loans  other than those described earlier in this paragraph  which are classified for regulatory purposes as loss  doubtful  substandard or special mention  and which are not included as non performing loans  do not i represent or result from trends or uncertainties which management reasonably expects will materially impact future operating results  or ii represent material credits about which management is aware of any information which causes management to have serious doubts as to the ability of such borrower to comply with the loan repayment terms

these two sources accounted for approximately percent of total non interest revenue at banctrust in service charges on deposit accounts increased by thousand  or percent over the category other income  charges and fees increased percent in compared to  with mortgage fee income accounting for the largest increase within this category 
while the current low rate environment has exerted significant pressure in the past three years on interest margins at banctrust  it has also presented an opportunity to increase fee revenue in the mortgage area 
management intends to continue to pursue this and additional opportunities to increase non interest revenue 
while refinancing activity has slowed  the addition of a larger branch network in northwest florida should provide increased opportunities for mortgage fees from new purchases of homes and condominiums 
securities gains decreased from thousand in to thousand in in making the decision to sell securities  management considers the likelihood of these securities being called and the current types and rates of bonds available for reinvestment

net occupancy expenses increased percent in and resulted from the opening of several new facilities 
intangible amortization decreased from thousand in to thousand in this decrease was caused by the adoption of sfas no 
by the company on january  under sfas no 
 intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are no longer amortized but instead are tested annually for impairment 
the company s goodwill qualifies for the nonamortization provisions of sfas no 
and as a result no goodwill amortization expense was recorded in or other operating expenses in increased thousand  or percent  from in the company began the process of consolidating its banks and these efforts will continue in management expects that this continuing consolidation  together with the effect of the commercesouth merger  will result in an improvement in earnings per share in table non interest expense in thousands year ended december  non interest expense salaries pension and other employee benefits furniture and equipment expenses net occupancy expenses intangible amortization other operating expenses total income taxes income tax expense was million in  compared to million in  and million in the effective combined tax rate was percent in  compared to percent in and percent in inflation and other issues because the company s assets and liabilities are essentially monetary in nature  the effect of inflation on the company s assets is less significant compared to most commercial and industrial companies 
inflation has an impact on the growth of total assets in the banking industry and the resulting need to increase capital at higher than normal rates in order to maintain an appropriate equity to assets ratio 
inflation also has a significant effect on other expenses  which tend to rise during periods of general inflation 
management believes  however  that the company s financial results are influenced more by its ability to react to changes in interest rates than by inflation 
regulatory issue as noted in the capital adequacy section on page of this annual report and in footnote in the notes to consolidated financial statements  some commentators have predicted that the federal reserve system may reduce or eliminate a bank holding company s ability to include amounts related to trust preferred securities in the tier capital calculation 
if banctrust s million payable to trust were excluded from the tier capital calculation altogether as a result of a retroactive regulatory change  that would have the effect of reducing banctrust s tier capital ratio to percent at december  this ratio would be below the threshold required for banctrust to be considered well capitalized 
if banctrust is no longer considered well capitalized under the federal reserve s standards  or if banctrust s capital is materially reduced to a level near the threshold for being considered well capitalized  banctrust may be limited in its ability to grow and to take actions that would further reduce its capital  such as share redemptions or dividend increases 
except as discussed in this management s discussion and analysis  management is not aware of trends  events or uncertainties that will have or that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on the liquidity  capital resources or operations of the company 
management is not aware of any current recommendations by regulatory authorities which  if they were implemented  would have such an effect
