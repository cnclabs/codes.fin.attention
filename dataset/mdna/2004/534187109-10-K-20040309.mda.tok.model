introduction lincoln national corporation lnc is a holding company 
through subsidiary companies lnc operates multiple insurance and investment management businesses 
the collective group of companies uses lincoln financial group as its marketing identity 
lnc is the th largest based on assets united states corporation fortune  largest us corporations  april 
operations are divided into four business segments lincoln retirement  life insurance  investment management and lincoln uk 
lnc reports operations not directly related to the business segments and unallocated corporate items ie  corporate investment income  interest expense on corporate debt  unallocated overhead expenses  and the operations of lincoln financial advisors lfa and lincoln financial distributors lfd and the amortization of the deferred gain on the sale of lincoln re in other operations 
prior to the fourth quarter of  lnc had a reinsurance segment 
total employment of lnc at december  on a consolidated basis was  executive summary lnc s annuities  life insurance  money management and financial planning businesses all benefited from the improving financial markets experienced during growth in equity markets translated into improved earnings as fee income based on account values increased  reserves for variable annuity guaranteed minimum death benefits declined  and credit losses in the investment portfolios dropped significantly 
the elevated account values position lnc for earning increased ongoing fee based revenues from variable annuities  variable life insurance and asset advisory services 
key marketplace themes of the past year against the backdrop of improving financial markets included continuing demand for variable annuity products containing guaranteed benefits  the relative safety and predictability of universal life insurance  and the desire to work with investment advisors with proven track records earned over difficult market periods 
lnc s ability to meet these needs led to the successes of excellence in enhanced product offerings and outstanding investment management performance contributed to an acceleration of positive net cash flows into lnc s product offerings  particularly evident in the latter half of the year 
while historically low interest rates continue to create a challenge for lnc s products that generate investment spread profits  such as fixed annuities and universal life insurance  careful management of crediting rate policies allowed lnc to minimize spread compression effects 
managing investment spread businesses remains an important consideration in the current interest rate environment 
other challenges that lnc anticipates include intensifying competitive pressures and growing uncertainty created by emerging legislative and regulatory responses to recent events in the financial services marketplace 
in this fiercely competitive and highly uncertain financial marketplace  lnc intends to continue to distinguish itself by consistently delivering product excellence while maintaining pricing discipline and prudent risk management  by continuing to extend its distribution reach while keeping a sharp focus on effective cost management  and by continuing to expand the power of the lincoln financial group brand 
as it executes on these key strategic drivers  lnc has its long term focus on the emerging opportunity that will occur as the baby boomer generation reaches retirement age 
lnc intends to capitalize on that opportunity 
table of contents by positioning itself to be the partner of choice for the intermediaries and organizations that serve the baby boomer generation in meeting their wealth accumulation  retirement income and wealth transfer needs 
the following management discussion and analysis contains details on recent progress made by lnc toward that goal 
critical accounting policies given the nature of lnc s business  lnc s accounting policies require the use of judgments relating to a variety of assumptions and estimates 
because of the inherent uncertainty in the assumptions and estimates underlying these accounting policies  under different conditions or assumptions the amounts reported in lnc s financial statements could be materially different 
throughout management s discussion and analysis  the application of these various critical accounting policies is addressed along with the effect of changes in estimates and assumptions 
to provide an overall perspective on these critical accounting policies  and guidance as to the specific areas within management s discussion and analysis where these critical accounting policies are discussed in detail  a summary of critical accounting policies and the disclosure location is as follows accounting for intangible assets requires numerous assumptions  such as estimates of expected future profitability for various lnc operations and lnc s ability to retain its existing blocks of life and annuity business in force 
lnc s accounting policies for the intangible assets of deferred acquisition costs dac and the present value of acquired blocks of in force policies pvif are discussed within the lincoln retirement  life insurance and lincoln uk segments 
lnc s overall accounting policy for other identified intangibles and goodwill is discussed within results of consolidated operations 
a key assumption affecting the accounting for dac and pvif is the performance of equity markets 
lnc s net income sensitivity to changes in equity market performance is discussed under the heading first quarter guidance for the effects of equity market volatility found within lnc s discussion of consolidated operating results 
additionally  lnc has goodwill resulting from various acquisitions 
refer to the accounting for business combinations and goodwill and other intangible assets section for a discussion of the evaluation of goodwill for impairment 
within the investment management segment  lnc has an intangible asset for deferred dealer commissions 
refer to the investment management results of operations section for further discussion of this asset 
determining whether a decline in current fair values for invested assets is other than a temporary decline in value can frequently involve a variety of assumptions and estimates  particularly for investments that are not actively traded on established markets 
for instance  assessing the value of some investments requires an analysis of expected future cash flows 
some investment structures  such as collateralized debt obligations  often represent selected levels  or tranches collateralized by underlying investments in a wide variety of underlying issuers 
lnc s accounting policies for its invested assets are discussed within results of consolidated operations and consolidated investments 
specific discussion of lnc s accounting policy for write downs for securities that were determined to have declines in fair value that were other than temporary along with analysis of securities available for sale in an unrealized loss position can be found within consolidated investments 
to protect itself from a variety of equity market and interest rate risks that are inherent in many of lnc s life insurance and annuity products  lnc uses various derivative instruments 
assessing the effectiveness of these hedging programs and evaluating the carrying values of the related derivatives often involves a variety of assumptions and estimates 
lnc s accounting policies for derivatives are discussed within results of consolidated operations  consolidated investments and within the discussion of quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
in addition  the potential impact on interest spreads in a falling rate environment is presented in the interest rate risk falling rates section within lnc s quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
establishing adequate liabilities for lnc s obligations to its policyholders requires assumptions to be made regarding mortality and morbidity 
the effect of variances in these assumptions is discussed within the lincoln 
table of contents retirement and life insurance segments 
in addition  refer to the discussion of personal accident and disability income reserves included within the acquisition and divestiture discussion of the disposition of lnc s former reinsurance segment within other operations 
as discussed within the lincoln retirement segment  one of the liabilities is the reserve for guaranteed minimum death benefits gmdb 
a key assumption affecting the accounting for gmdb is the performance of equity markets 
sensitivity to changes in equity market performance upon gmdb and lnc s net income is discussed under the heading first quarter guidance for the effects of equity market volatility 
the accounting for gmdb reserves will change in  as a result of new guidance affecting guaranteed benefits 
see the topic new accounting pronouncements and the disclosure under the heading statement of accounting position pursuant to the accounting rules for lnc s obligations to employees under its various retirement and welfare benefit plans  lnc is required to make a large number of assumptions  such as the future performance of financial markets and the composition of lnc s employee workforce in the future 
lnc s accounting for its employee plans is discussed in detail within note employee benefit plans  which is included in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
establishing reserves for litigation and compliance related regulatory actions inherently involves a variety of estimates of potential outcomes 
these matters are discussed within results of consolidated operations and in the lincoln uk segment  with additional detail provided within note restrictions  commitments and contingencies  which is included in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
as lnc responds to an ever changing business environment and continues to adapt its organizational and operational structures  the frequency of necessary restructuring activities increases 
establishing reserves for the expected costs of these restructurings requires a variety of estimates and assumptions 
the accounting for lnc s restructurings is set forth within results of consolidated operations and within results of operations for each affected business segment  as well as within note restructuring charges included in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
continued access to capital markets and maintenance of favorable debt and insurance financial strength ratings are critical to lnc s future success 
lnc s liquidity  in a wide variety of areas  is inherently dependant upon continued access to capital and maintaining adequate ratings 
detailed discussion of lnc s access to capital markets  liquidity status and ratings are contained within review of consolidated financial condition 
finally  it is lnc s policy to provide disclosure of commitments or guarantees so that its financial statements present as complete a picture of lnc s financial condition as possible 
the vast majority of these commitments or guarantees relate to lnc s life insurance and retirement businesses and  as such  are reflected on lnc s balance sheet 
any off balance sheet commitments or guarantees that lnc is subject to are disclosed within review of consolidated financial condition and note restrictions  commitments and contingencies which is included in the notes to consolidated financial statements

table of contents summary comparison of to net income for increased significantly from a key driver of results was the favorable performance of the equity markets 
in  the s p index increased  compared to a decline of in the increase in the equity markets positively affected net income through increased fee revenue  favorable changes on the amortization of deferred acquisition costs and lower costs associated with reserves and benefits for guaranteed minimum death benefits 
the impact of the equity markets is discussed in more detail within the discussion of results of operations by business segment 
lnc s losses from credit markets as reflected in the realized loss on investments and derivatives were million lower in compared to this improvement was reflective of the improvements in the credit markets as lnc did not experience the same level of effect from declines in value and write downs of fixed maturity securities available for sale 
additional details on lnc s investment performance are provided in the consolidated investment section on page in  lnc reported losses of million related to reserve increases on the business sold through indemnity reinsurance to swiss re 
in  lnc recorded additional charges on this business  but significantly less than in the accounting for these charges and the effect on lnc s results in the future is more fully described in the acquisition and divestiture section 
as more fully discussed in the following section on new accounting pronouncements on page  net income for includes the effects of implementing financial accounting standards board fasb derivative implementation group statement no

b dig b 
this required lnc to recognize an embedded derivative resulting from the structure of several significant reinsurance arrangements  which was recorded as a cumulative effect of accounting change 
coincident with the recording of the embedded derivative  lnc reclassified a substantial portion of the investment securities supporting these reinsurance arrangements from available for sale to trading 
this resulted in the recognition in earnings of the unrealized gains on these investment securities previously reported in accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity 
revenues the increase in consolidated revenues includes the million reclassification of trading account securities and the significant reduction in realized losses on investments and derivative securities 
excluding these items  consolidated revenues were slightly higher than this largely reflects the timing of equity market effects on average account values and assets under management  which declined during and through the first half of  and did not recover to previous levels until the end of the fourth quarter of net investment income was level with as declining investment yields substantially offset growth in investment securities 
benefits and expenses consolidated expenses exclusive of restructuring charges  reserve increases on business sold through reinsurance and federal income taxes decreased from the favorable effects of equity markets on dac and pvif amortization and unlocking  and on the level of gmdb reserves were primarily responsible for this improvement 
spread management through lower crediting rates on interest sensitive and contractholder deposit funds also contributed to the improvement 
the increase in restructuring charges in was a result of expense initiatives undertaken by lnc during the year to improve operational efficiencies 
additional details on this activity are provided in the restructuring charge section on page 
table of contents comparison of to the decrease in net income in from included an increase in realized losses on investments and derivatives and expenses recorded in related to increases in reserves for the business sold through indemnity reinsurance to swiss re 
the realized losses on investments resulted from declines in value and the sale and write downs of fixed maturity securities 
see the consolidated investments section on page for further discussion of this matter 
a significant contributor to the decrease in net income was the effect of the poor performance of the equity markets on fee income  dac and pvif amortization and gmdb reserves and benefits 
the equity market impact is discussed in more detail within the discussion of results of operations by segment 
revenue consolidated revenue decreased primarily due to the reduction of revenue of  million pre tax  excluding realized losses on investments  from the disposition of the reinsurance segment in another contributor to the decline in revenue was the increase in realized losses on investments noted above 
included in revenue was a full year of the amortization of the deferred gain on indemnity reinsurance compared to amortization for one month in the lincoln retirement and lincoln uk segments experienced decreased fee income due to the negative impact that and equity market declines had on average variable annuity retirement and unit linked lincoln uk account values 
the investment management segment had decreased investment advisory fees and other revenue and fees as a result of lower retail and institutional assets under management during the decrease in assets under management resulted primarily from declining equity markets 
expenses consolidated expenses excluding goodwill amortization  restructuring charges  reserve increases on business sold through reinsurance and federal income taxes decreased largely due to the sale of lnc s reinsurance business to swiss re in the fourth quarter of expenses for the operations of the former reinsurance segment  excluding goodwill amortization were  million in expenses were negatively affected by the decline in the equity markets  which resulted in negative unlocking of dac and pvif in the lincoln retirement  life insurance and lincoln uk business segments  increased reserves and payments for gmdb in the lincoln retirement segment 
for  lnc reported a tax benefit of million on a pre tax loss of million 
this unusual relationship between tax and pre tax earnings results from the fact that lnc has tax preferred investment income that does not change proportionately with the change in consolidated pre tax earnings 
lnc s tax preferred investment income is primarily the result of dividend received deductions attributable to lnc s allocable share of dividend income generated by equity securities held within the retirement segments separate accounts 
see note  federal income taxes  to the consolidated financial statements for more details

first quarter guidance for the estimated effect of equity market volatility during  lnc provided guidance on the estimated effect of equity market volatility on its quarterly results 
as discussed below  lnc will adopt the gmdb reserving provisions of statement of accounting position accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises for certain nontraditional long duration contracts and for separate accounts the sop effective january  lnc does not expect the initial adoption of these rules to materially change the aggregate level of gmdb reserves that existed at december  however  it is probable that changes in future equity markets will have different effects on lnc s gmdb reserves under the rules of the sop than was the case under lnc s prior approach to gmdb reserving 
in 
table of contents addition  lnc is now hedging some of its gmdb exposure 
lnc s current gmdb hedging program is intended to reduce the effect on gaap earnings of increases in gmdb reserves that is created by drops in the equity markets 
lnc is continuing to evaluate how the new rules of the sop  combined with the gmdb hedging program  will affect future gmdb reserve fluctuations due to changes in equity markets 
in addition  lnc is studying the inter relationship between the fluctuations in dac amortization and the fluctuations in gmdb reserves 
once lnc has completed these analyses  lnc intends to provide guidance regarding the effects that changes in equity market performance can be expected to have on lnc s earnings 
new accounting pronouncements accounting for variable interest entities 
in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued initial guidance under interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin  which requires the consolidation of variable interest entities vie by an enterprise if that enterprise has a variable interest that will absorb a majority of the vie s expected losses if they occur  receive a majority of the entity s expected residual returns if they occur  or both 
if one enterprise will absorb a majority of a vie s expected losses and another enterprise will receive a majority of that vie s expected residual returns  the enterprise absorbing a majority of the losses shall consolidate the vie 
a vie is an entity in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
in response to concerns raised by lnc and others in the insurance and investment industries with respect to the initial guidance  the fasb significantly modified several key aspects of the rules in a revised interpretation issued in december lnc adopted the final fin rules on december  prior to the issuance of the revised guidance  fin would have required lnc to include the gross amount of all fees earned by lnc for managing collateralized debt obligation cdo pools in the analysis of expected residual returns 
as discussed in lnc s third quarter form q filing  under the initial requirements of fin  lnc may have been required to bring onto the consolidated balance sheet approximately billion of invested assets underlying the cdos and approximately billion of liabilities owed by the cdo issuer to third party investors 
because of changes made by fasb to the initial interpretation in december of  these amounts were not reflected on lnc s balance sheet when lnc adopted fin on december  as explained below  under the revised guidance lnc is not treated as the primary beneficiary of these cdos and will not consolidate the cdo assets or liabilities 
lnc currently manages seven cdos  and of these there are five where the asset management fees paid to lnc no longer contain performance based incentives 
as a result  lnc is not considered the primary beneficiary of these vies 
lnc s maximum exposure to loss in these five cdos is an investment in a small portion of the senior debt issued by one of these cdo pools  which had a carrying and estimated fair value of approximately million  at december  for the other two cdos  lnc still has the right to earn performance based fees above the base asset management fees 
these performance based fees are considered variable fees for purposes of performing the analysis of expected residual returns 
in addition  lnc also holds investment interests in these cdos 
however  in these two cdos  lnc has determined that the expected variability in its fees and the level of other lnc interests in the cdo are currently below the level that would result in lnc being treated as the primary beneficiary 
future changes in the interest held by the third party investors in these two cdo pools  relative to lnc s interest  will require retesting lnc s potential status as primary beneficiary 
lnc will continue to disclose its variable interests in these two cdo pools 
lnc s maximum exposure to loss is its investment in these two cdo pools  which had a carrying value of approximately million and an estimated fair value of approximately million  at december  
table of contents accounting for modified coinsurance 
during the fourth quarter of  lnc implemented the fasb s derivative implementation group statement implementation issue no 
b dig b 
dig b provides that the embedded derivatives included within modified coinsurance agreements modco and coinsurance with funds withheld cfw reinsurance agreements must be accounted for separately from the underlying reinsurance agreements 
the effective date for implementation of dig b for lnc was the october  start date of the fourth quarter 
the following table summarizes the various effects on shareholders equity from the implementation of dig b in millions initial adoption shareholder equity effect on october  notes pre tax after tax recording of embedded derivative a cumulative effect of accounting change b release of liability for unrealized investment gains total a reclassification of available for sale securities to trading securities b release of unrealized available for sale security gains in other comprehensive income total available for sale to trading adjustment total effect on shareholders equity from dig b implementation on october  a 
at the time of adoption  lnc recorded a charge to net income as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting  representing the fair value of the embedded derivatives included in various modco and cfw reinsurance agreements 
b 
in conjunction with recording the above charge in a  lnc also recorded an increase in other comprehensive income relating to the fact that prior to the adoption of dig b the net unrealized gains on the underlying available for sale securities supporting these reinsurance agreements had been accounted for as gains benefiting the reinsurance companies assuming the risks under these modco and cfw reinsurance agreements 
a 
concurrent with the initial recording of the embedded derivative associated with these reinsurance arrangements  lnc reclassified related available for sale securities to trading account classification 
b 
the previously recorded increases to shareholder s equity reported in other comprehensive income as a result of the available for sale classification of these securities were reversed as part of the reclassification accounting 
during the fourth quarter and going forward  changes in the fair value of the embedded derivative flow through net income  as do changes in the fair value of the trading account securities  as represented by adjustments a and b in the table below 
for the quarter ended december   the effect of the two new mark to market adjustments on net income was million pre tax million after tax 
the table combines the trading account and embedded derivative mark to mark accounting with the implementation effects discussed above to demonstrate the effects on the income statement for the quarter ended december  in millions 

table of contents net income effect for the quarter ended december  notes pre tax after tax revenues a trading account securities change during fourth quarter b embedded derivative change during fourth quarter gain on reinsurance embedded derivative trading securities in fourth quarter reclassification of available for sale securities to trading account securities income before accounting changes cumulative effect of accounting change effect on net income as indicated in the above tables  the implementation of dig b resulted in an initial decrease to shareholders equity and the ongoing accounting of dig b will continue to give rise to ongoing gains and losses flowing through net income as the embedded derivative and trading account securities are continuously marked to market 
these adjustments do not net to zero in any one particular accounting period because not all of the invested assets supporting these modco and cfw reinsurance agreements were available for sale securities that could be reclassified to trading account securities and not all modco and cfw reinsurance agreements have segregated portfolios of securities that can be classified as trading account securities 
however  it is important to note that these differences in net income will reverse over the term of the underlying modco and cfw reinsurance agreements  reflecting the fact that the new accounting for the embedded derivatives prescribed in dig b changes the timing of the recognition of income under these modco and cfw reinsurance agreements but does not change the total amount of earnings that will ultimately be reported over the life of these agreements 
statement of accounting position in july  the accounting standards executive committee acsec of the american institute of certified public accountants issued statement of position  accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises for certain nontraditional long duration contracts and for separate accounts the sop 
lnc will adopt the sop as of january  the sop provides guidance related to the reporting and disclosure of certain insurance contracts and separate accounts  including guidance for computing reserves for products with guaranteed benefits  such as guaranteed minimum death benefits gmdb  and for products with annuitization benefits such as guaranteed minimum income benefits 
in addition  the sop addresses the presentation and reporting of separate accounts  the capitalization and amortization of sales inducements  and secondary guarantees on universal life type contracts 
gmdb reserves 
although there was no method prescribed under generally accepted accounting principles for gmdb reserving until the issuance of the sop  lnc s retirement segment has been recording a reserve for gmdbs 
at december   lnc s gmdb reserve was million 
based upon a comparison of the requirements of the sop to lnc s established practice of reserving for gmdb  the adoption of the gmdb reserving methodology under the sop is not expected to have a material effect on lnc s financial statements 
sales inducements 
lnc s retirement segment variable annuity product offerings include contracts that offer a bonus credit  typically ranging from to of each deposit 
lnc also offers enhanced interest rates to variable annuity contracts that are under dollar cost averaging dca funding arrangements 
bonus credits and 
table of contents excess dca interest are considered sales inducements under the sop and  as such  are to be deferred as a sales inducement asset and amortized as a benefit expense over the expected life of the contract 
amortization will be computed using the same methodology and assumptions used in amortizing dac 
lnc currently defers bonus credits as part of the dac asset and reports the amortization of bonus credits as part of dac amortization 
upon adoption of the sop  lnc will reclassify bonus credits from dac to deferred sales inducements on its balance sheet and report deferred sales inducement amortization as part of benefit expense 
prior period balance sheet and income statement line item presentation will be reclassified to conform to the new basis of presentation 
lnc currently reports excess dca interest as benefit expense when the excess interest is earned under the contract 
upon adoption of the sop  lnc will begin deferring excess dca interest as deferred sales inducements and amortizing these deferred sales inducements as benefit expense over the expected life of the contract 
amortization will be calculated using the same methodology and assumptions used in amortizing dac 
while over the long run the same amount of excess dca interest expense will emerge under the sop as under lnc s current accounting method  because of the prospective treatment of new deferred sales inducements  lnc expects earnings to be slightly higher under the sop  relative to lnc s current approach  for near term financial reporting periods 
for instance  had the rules for excess dca interest expense under the sop been in effect for  lnc estimates that lincoln retirement would have reported increased earnings of about million 
the actual effect on lnc s results in future periods will depend upon the volume of business written with excess dca interest 
separate accounts 
lnc s current accounting is consistent with the provisions of the sop relating to the reporting and measuring of separate account product assets and liabilities as general account assets and liabilities when specific criteria are not met  as well as for the reporting and measuring seed money in separate accounts as general account assets  and for recognizing contractholder liabilities 
the adoption of these provisions of the sop are expected to have no effect on lnc s financial statements 
universal life contracts 
lnc s life insurance segment offers individual and survivor life universal life insurance products that provide a secondary guarantee to the contract holder  commonly referred to as a no lapse guarantee 
this feature permits a policy that would normally terminate  if the net cash value were to fall below zero  to remain in force as long as the conditions of the no lapse provision are met 
lnc s analysis of this benefit indicates that this feature should be considered insignificant  as newly defined by the sop 
in general  lnc does not expect to record an additional liability for its current secondary guarantee offerings 
however  in the event that an additional liability is required under the sop for certain of lnc s current secondary guarantee features  lnc would not expect the adoption of the sop to have a material effect on its financial statements 
lnc understands that throughout the life insurance industry a wide variety of interpretations and approaches to the application of the sop to fixed and variable universal life contracts have recently begun to emerge 
industry wide concern over this inconsistency in interpretation has become so great that on february  the american council of life insurers acli submitted a letter on behalf of the industry to the chairman of acsec  requesting a delay of the effective date for the sop  as it applies to universal life insurance  until such time that guidance for these implementation matters can be made available 
if acsec decides to address these industry wide concerns and issue new guidance  lnc s current estimates of the expected effects of the adoption of the sop could change 
other products and riders 
lnc continues to review the features and characteristics of other products and riders offered within its retirement  life insurance  and lincoln uk segments  and to evaluate the potential applicability of the sop to these other products and riders 
with respect to the other products and riders that are the subject of this ongoing review  lnc does not currently expect that the adoption of the sop should have a material effect on lnc s financial statements 

table of contents fasb financial staff position no 
fas medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of in december  the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of the medicare act became law 
beginning in  the medicare act provides various alternatives that could result in an offset to some portion of the costs of prescription drug benefits provided to retirees 
in january  the staff of the fasb issued financial staff position no 
fas fsp  which permits a sponsor of a post retirement health care plan that provides retiree prescription drug benefits to make a one time election to defer accounting for the effects of the medicare act 
there are several uncertainties that exist as to the eventual effects of the medicare act on the cost of the prescription drug benefits currently included in lnc s retiree medical benefit plan 
these uncertainties include various administrative components related to the medicare act that have yet to be developed  the potential for significant legislative changes to the medicare act prior to its implementation in  and the interrelated effects that the existence of various cost containment measures currently included within lnc s retiree medical benefit plans may have under the new legislation 
however  regardless of the outcome of these various uncertainties  lnc does not currently expect that the medicare act would have a material affect on future net income due to the cost containment measures already in place under lnc s retiree medical benefit plans 
due to these uncertainties and expected immaterial impact  lnc has elected to defer accounting for the effects of the medicare act 
having made this deferral election  fsp prohibits lnc from accounting for the effects of the medicare act until such time as either final fasb guidance is issued or a significant event occurs that would require a remeasurement of plan assets and obligations 
accordingly  the measures of accumulated post retirement benefit obligation and periodic post retirement benefit cost in lnc s financial statements for the year ended december  do not reflect the effects of the medicare act 
accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
in  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities fas  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies emerging issues task force issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an action including certain costs incurred in a restructuring issue 
the principal difference between fas and issue is that fas requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred  rather than at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan 
fas is effective for exit or disposal activities after december  lnc adopted fas on january  and the adoption of fas affects the timing of when an expense is recognized for restructuring activities

intangible assets that do not have indefinite lives continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives 
lnc adopted fas on january  after consideration of the provisions of the new standards regarding proper classification of goodwill and other intangible assets on the consolidated balance sheet  lnc did not reclassify any goodwill or other intangible balances held as of january  in compliance with the transition provision of fas  lnc completed the first step of the transitional goodwill impairment test during the second quarter of the valuation techniques used by lnc to estimate the fair value of the group of assets comprising the different reporting units varied based on the characteristics of 
table of contents each reporting unit s business and operations 
a discounted cash flow model was used to assess the goodwill of the reporting units within lnc s lincoln retirement  life insurance and lincoln uk segments 
a valuation technique combining multiples of revenues  earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda and assets under management was used to assess the goodwill in lnc s investment management segment 
the results of the first step of the tests indicated that lnc did not have impaired goodwill 
in accordance with fas  lnc has chosen october as its annual review date 
as such  lnc performed another valuation review during the fourth quarter of and the results of the tests performed as of october  and indicate that lnc did not have impaired goodwill 
the valuation techniques used by lnc for each reporting unit were consistent with those used during the transitional testing 
as a result of the application of the non amortization provisions of the new standards  lnc had an increase in net income of million per common share on a fully diluted basis for the year ended december  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets

during the second quarter of  lincoln retirement completed a review of its entire internal information technology organization 
as a result of that review  lincoln retirement decided to reorganize its it organization in order to better align the activities and functions conducted within its own organization and its it service providers 
this change was made in order to focus lincoln retirement on its goal of achieving a common administrative platform for its annuities products  to better position the organization and its service providers to respond to changing market conditions  and to reduce overall costs in response to increased competitive pressures 
this plan was completed in the third quarter of 
table of contents in january  the life insurance segment announced that it was realigning its operations in hartford  connecticut and schaumburg  illinois to enhance productivity  efficiency and scalability while positioning the segment for future growth 
in february  lincoln retirement announced plans to consolidate its fixed annuity operations in schaumburg  illinois into fort wayne  indiana 
in june  lnc announced that it was combining its retirement and life insurance businesses into a single operating unit focused on providing wealth accumulation and protection  income distribution and wealth transfer products 
the realigned organization is expected to significantly reduce operating expenses while positioning lnc for future growth and to take advantage of the recent market recovery 
in august  lnc announced additional realignment activities  which impact all of lnc s domestic operations 
these realignment activities are expected to result in total charges of million 
the realignment activities are expected to be completed by the first quarter of acquisition and divestiture on august   lnc acquired the administrative management group  inc amg  an employee benefits record keeping firm for million in cash 
contingent payments up to an additional million may be paid over a period of years if certain criteria are met 
lincoln retirement recorded an expense of million after tax million pre tax for relating to such contingent payments

in addition  lnc retained the capital supporting the reinsurance operation 
after giving effect to the increased levels of capital needed within the life insurance and lincoln retirement segments that result from the change in the ongoing mix of business under lnc s internal capital allocation models  the disposition of lnc s reinsurance operation freed up approximately million of retained capital 
the transaction structure involved a series of indemnity reinsurance transactions combined with the sale of certain stock companies that comprised lnc s reinsurance operation 
at closing  an immediate gain of million after tax was recognized on the sale of the stock companies 
a gain of million after tax billion pre tax relating to the indemnity reinsurance agreements was reported at the time of closing 
this gain was recorded as a deferred gain on lnc s consolidated balance sheet  in accordance with the requirements of fas  and is being amortized into earnings at the rate that earnings on the reinsured business are expected to emerge  over a period of years 
effective with the closing of the transaction  the former reinsurance segment s historical results were moved into other operations 
during december lnc recognized in other operations million million pre tax of deferred gain amortization 
in addition  in december  lnc recognized million million pre tax of accelerated deferred gain amortization relating to the fact that certain canadian indemnity reinsurance contracts were novated after the sale  but prior to december  on october   lnc and swiss re settled disputed matters totaling about million that had arisen in connection with the final closing balance sheets associated with swiss re s acquisition of lnc s reinsurance operations 
the settlement provided for a payment by lnc of million to swiss re  which was recorded by lnc as a reduction in deferred gain 
as a result of additional information made available to lnc following the settlement with swiss re in the fourth quarter of  lnc recorded a further reduction in the deferred gain of million after tax million pre tax  as well as a million after tax million pre tax reduction in the gain on the sale of subsidiaries 
as part of the dispute settlement  lnc also paid million to swiss re in satisfaction of lnc s million indemnification obligation with respect to personal accident business 
as a result of this payment  lnc has no further underwriting risk with respect to the reinsurance business sold 
however  because lnc has not been relieved of it legal liabilities to the underlying ceding companies with respect to the portion of the business indemnity reinsured by swiss re  under fas the reserves for the underlying reinsurance contracts as well as 
table of contents a corresponding reinsurance recoverable from swiss re will continue to be carried on lnc s balance sheet during the run off period of the underlying reinsurance business 
this is particularly relevant in the case of the exited personal accident and disability income reinsurance lines of business where the underlying reserves are based upon various estimates that are subject to considerable uncertainty 
as a result of developments and information obtained during relating to personal accident and disability income matters  lnc increased these exited business reserves by million after tax million pre tax

critical accounting policies deferred acquisition cost statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting by insurance companies for certain long duration contracts realized gains losses on investment sales fas requires that acquisition costs for variable annuity contracts be amortized over the lives of the contracts in relation to the incidence of estimated gross profits 
estimated gross profits on variable annuity contracts vary based on surrenders  fee income  expenses and realized gains losses on investments 
the amortization is adjusted retrospectively dac 
table of contents unlocking when estimates of current or future gross profits to be realized from variable annuity contracts are revised 
because equity market movements have a significant impact on the value of variable annuity accounts and the fees earned on these accounts  estimated future profits increase or decrease with movements in the equity markets 
movements in equity markets also have an impact on reserves and payments for the guaranteed minimum death benefit feature within certain annuity contracts 
the lincoln retirement segment s assumption for the long term annual gross growth rate of the equity markets used in the determination of dac amortization and gmdb benefits is  which is reduced by mortality and expense charges m e and asset management charges resulting in a net variable account growth assumption of less than 
as equity markets do not move in a systematic manner  lnc uses a methodology referred to as reversion to the mean for its long term gross growth rate assumption while also giving consideration to the effect of short term swings in the equity markets 
the application of this methodology results in the use of a higher or lower future gross equity market growth assumption for a period of four years subsequent to the valuation date which  together with actual historical gross equity growth  is expected to produce a gross return 
the use of a reversion to the mean assumption is common within the industry  however  the parameters used in the methodology are subject to judgment and vary within the industry 
an important aspect of lnc s application of the reversion to the mean is the use of caps and floors on the equity market growth rate assumption  which limits the gross growth rate assumption to reasonable levels above and below the long term assumption 
in the fourth quarter  lnc adjusted its reversion to the mean gross equity market growth rate assumption to 
going forward  as the growth rate of the equity market varies from lnc s growth rate assumption  the period over which the reversion to the mean gross growth rate needs to occur will be four years 
the lincoln retirement segment has incorporated a cap of and a floor of into the reversion to the mean methodology 
at december   lincoln retirement s reversion to the mean gross growth rate assumption for equity markets was 
if a flat equity market growth rate had been used instead of the reversion to the mean rate  the december  dac and pvif balance would have been million higher on a pre tax basis and net income would have been million higher on an after tax basis 
on a quarterly basis  lnc reviews the assumptions of its dac amortization model and records a retrospective adjustment to the amount expensed  ie  unlocks the dac 
on an annual basis  lnc reviews and adjusts as necessary its assumptions for prospective amortization of dac  as well as its other intangible asset  pvif 
guaranteed minimum benefit reserves lnc currently offers minimum guarantee features with certain variable annuity products  which include various types of guaranteed minimum death benefit features gmdb and a recently introduced guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit gmwb 
the gmwb feature was introduced during in light of the favorable performance of the equity markets since the introduction of the gmwb feature  lnc held no reserves for gmwb liabilities as of december  further discussion of the current structure of lnc s gmwb feature  as well as related hedging activities  is presented after the following discussion of the various types of gmdb features that lnc offers 
the reserves for the gmdb are a function of the net amount at risk nar  mortality  persistency  and incremental death benefit m e expected to be incurred over the period of time for which the nar is positive 
at any given point in time  the nar is the difference between the potential death benefit payable and the total account balance  with a floor value of zero when account values exceed the potential death benefit there is no amount at risk 
as part of the estimate of future nar  equity market growth rates with a reversion to the mean assumption are utilized  which are consistent with those used in the dac valuation process 
if a flat equity market growth rate had been used instead of the reversion to the mean rate  the december  gmdb balance would have been million lower on a pre tax basis and net income would have been million higher on an after tax basis 
this compares to the fourth quarter change to the reversion to the mean assumption  which resulted in an increase to gmdb reserves and reduced net income by million 
at each valuation date  projections of account values and nar followed by the computation of the present value of expected nar death claims using product pricing mortality assumptions less expected gmdb m e revenue during the period for which the death benefit options are assumed to be in the money are made for every variable 
table of contents annuity contract with a gmdb benefit feature 
if equity market returns exactly match lnc s reversion to the mean rate and actual mortality and lapse experience is as assumed  the gaap reserve plus interest and gmdb m e revenue would exactly cover the future expected gmdb payments as they arise 
a decline in the equity markets results in increased gmdb reserves and benefit payments which negatively effects lincoln retirement s income  while an increase in the equity markets results in a decrease in gmdb reserves and benefit payments which favorably effects lincoln retirement s income 
although there was no method prescribed under generally accepted accounting principles for gmdb reserving until the issuance of the sop  which lnc will adopt effective january   lnc has used a method that recognizes that there is an amount at risk that will result in future payments and that over time the equity market growth will reduce the payment stream 
this approach results in a reserve that is expected to cover future gmdb payments  net of future gmdb fee income 
due to strong equity market performance  at december   lnc s gmdb nar was billion and the gaap reserve was million 
this is a significant decrease from the billion in nar and gaap reserve of million at december  the reserve for statutory reporting was million at december  compared to million at december   reflecting the more conservative market performance and mortality assumptions that are required to be used under statutory reporting 
in evaluating the gmbd exposures that exist within lnc s variable annuity business relative to industry peers  it is important to distinguish between the various types of gmdb structures  and other factors such as average account values  average amounts of nar  and the age of contractholders 
the following table and discussion provides this information for lnc s variable annuity business as of december  type of gmdb feature return of premium high water mark roll up no gmdb total variable annuity account value billions of total annuity account value average account value average nar    n a  gaap reserve millions n a nar billions n a average age of contract holder of contract holders years of age lnc average ages are lower than industry average per the gallup organization s survey due to the mix of business that includes significant amounts of qualified and employer sponsored business 
lnc s average non qualified contract holder s attained age is just over with over age compared to the industry average attained age of with over age lnc has variable annuity contracts containing gmdb s that have a dollar for dollar withdrawal feature 
under such a feature  withdrawals reduce both current account value and the gmdb amount on a dollar for dollar basis 
for contracts containing this dollar for dollar feature  the account holder could withdraw a substantial portion of their account value resulting in a gmdb that is multiples of the current account value 
lnc s exposure to this dollar for dollar risk is somewhat mitigated by the fact that lnc does not allow for partial exchanges on non qualified contracts 
to take advantage of the dollar for dollar feature  the contract holder must take constructive receipt of the withdrawal and pay any applicable surrender charges 
lnc will report the appropriate amount of the withdrawal that is taxable to the irs  as well as indicating whether or not tax penalties apply under the premature distribution tax rules 
lnc closely monitors its dollar for dollar withdrawal gmdb exposure and works with key broker dealers that distribute lnc s variable annuity products 
as of december   there were contracts for which the death benefit to account value ratio was greater than ten to one 
the nar on these contracts was million 
effective may  the gmdb feature offered on new sales is a pro rata gmdb feature whereby each dollar of withdrawal reduces the gmdb benefit in proportion to the current gmdb to account value ratio 

table of contents hedge program for guaranteed minimum benefits during  the lincoln retirement segment developed a hedging strategy designed to mitigate the income statement volatility caused by falling equity markets associated with the introduction of the principal security sm guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit and lnc s various gmdb features 
see the discussion below under the heading net deposits for details of lnc s principal security sm guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit 
at december   there was no hedge in place for the gmwb  as there was no required reserve for this feature due to the favorable performance of the equity markets since the feature was introduced 
lnc s gmdb hedging program is designed to mitigate the equity market volatility associated with the gaap reserves for this benefit 
at december  account balances covered in this hedging program combined with account balances for which there is no death benefit represent approximately of total variable annuity account balances 
lnc expects to continue expanding the coverage of its gmdb hedging program on an opportunistic basis  as the underlying account values increase due to equity market appreciation 
this hedging program reflects the benefit designs of the segment s products and has been effective to date 
lnc continues to evaluate various hedging tools and opportunities as it considers additional benefits  product features  and alternative hedging strategies 
equity markets the lincoln retirement segment s net income has been significantly affected by volatility in the equity markets 
changes in the equity markets impact the segment s earnings through the level of variable annuity account values and the effect on fees that the segment earns  unlocking of deferred acquisition costs dac and the present value of in force intangible pvif  and changes to reserves and benefit payments for gmdb 
dac unlocking  pvif unlocking and gmdb reserve adjustments that result from changes in equity market volatility are based upon end of period equity market values and are immediately reflected in lnc s earnings 
however  variable annuity account values are valued on a daily basis with lnc s fees earned on those daily balances  rather than end of period values 
as a result  the point to point changes in equity market indexes do not affect the retirement segment s variable annuity fee income in the immediate period as much as does the timing of when the changes in the equity markets occurred during the period 
these effects are highlighted in the discussion of lincoln retirement s results of operations 
refer to the results of operations discussion provided below for information relating to variable annuity account values and an analysis of the comparative effects that movements in the equity markets have had on lincoln retirement s earnings 
as discussed earlier  lnc will adopt the gmdb reserving provisions of the sop effective january  although lnc does not expect the initial adoption of these rules to materially change the aggregate level of gmdb reserves that existed at december   it is probable that changes in future equity markets will have different effects on lnc s gmdb reserves under the rules of the sop than was the case under lnc s prior approach to gmdb reserving 
in addition  lnc is now hedging some of its gmdb exposure 
lnc s current gmdb hedging program is intended to reduce the magnitude of increases in gmdb reserves that is created by drops in the equity markets 
lnc is continuing to evaluate how the new rules of the sop  combined with the gmdb hedging program  will effect future gmdb reserve fluctuations due to changes in equity markets 
in addition  lnc is studying the inter relationship between the fluctuations in dac amortization and the fluctuations in gmdb reserves 
once lnc has completed these analyzes  lnc intends to provide guidance regarding the effects that changes in equity market performance can be expected to have on lnc s earnings 
reinsurance the retirement segment utilizes reinsurance in the management of the fixed annuity business 
the reinsurance arrangements are on a modified coinsurance basis  which results in lnc retaining the assets supporting the business and sharing in the risks associated with the fixed annuity business with the reinsurer 
at december   the amount of business reinsured represents approximately of the gross fixed annuity account values exclusive of the fixed portion of variable annuity contracts 
during  lnc received notice of 
table of contents termination of reinsurance coverage for new business from the fixed annuity reinsurer 
starting january   lnc is retaining all the new fixed annuity business written

net income for also includes the effects of fourth quarter implementation of dig b  which required the recording of an embedded derivative related to the modco reinsurance arrangements supporting the segment s fixed annuity business 
investment securities supporting these arrangements were reclassified at the beginning of the fourth quarter from available for sale to trading resulting in an increase to net income 
additional details on the retirement segment s reinsurance arrangements are provided in the section on reinsurance 
the restructuring charges for were incurred in connection with the combining of the lincoln retirement and life insurance operations and the consolidation of fixed annuity operations formerly located in schaumburg  illinois into fort wayne  indiana 
for further details on these restructuring charges  refer to the restructuring charge section on page the increase in variable annuity account values for the year resulted from net positive cash flows  the overall improvement in the equity markets in  and shifts from the fixed portion of variable annuity products into the variable portion of variable annuity products 
however  average daily variable annuity account values  a key driver of fee income for the segment  were below last year  reflecting the timing of equity market movements over the two year period  and resulted in reduced fee income in relative to as indicated in the above tables  variable annuities account values stood at billion at december   declined to billion at december  and recovered to billion at december  over this same timeframe  average variable account values were billion during  billion during and billion during the timing of when the equity markets declined and increased during these three years is a primary reason for the decline in fee revenues as reported on an annual basis 
within these annual periods  on a quarterly basis the equity markets were generally declining from the first quarter of through the first quarter of until the fourth quarter market improvement occurred  the daily average variable annuity account values were 
table of contents below the levels reported in the comparable quarters 
this explains why  despite the strong overall equity market performance experienced for the year  fee revenue for lagged behind revenues reported for however  because equity market performance in exceeded the expected market performance used in lnc s dac assumptions  favorable retrospective unlocking and net changes in amortization for dac and pvif were reported for equity market performance also drove decreases in gmdb reserves and benefit payments resulting in favorable effects on net income 
in addition  the annual review of the various assumptions underlying dac  pvif  and gmdb calculations resulting in prospective unlocking which increased net income by million in this compared to a large negative impact from prospective unlocking in investment margins on fixed annuity products contributed to the improvement in net income in the table below presents the improvement in the investment rate margin 
although the net investment income yield declined year over year  lnc was able to reduce crediting rates to offset this decrease 
in addition  during the investment margins were positively impacted by million from increases in mortgage loan prepayments and make wholes 
annuity product investment rate margins represent the excess of the yield on earning assets over the average crediting rate 
the yield on earning assets is calculated as net investment income on fixed product investment portfolios divided by average earning assets 
the average crediting rate is calculated using interest credited on annuity products less bonus credits and excess dollar cost averaging dca interest  divided by the average fixed account values net of coinsured account values 
fixed account values reinsured under modified coinsurance agreements are included in account values for this calculation 
see discussion on investment margins and the interest rate risk due to falling interest rates in item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk on page investment income on investment partnerships was below expected levels in and however  the performance of these partnerships did improve in over this improvement resulted in million of additional income 
the income improvement from the increase in average fixed annuity account values resulted from net flows in change in rate over prior year basis points year ended december in millions net investment income yield interest rate credited to policyholders interest rate margin comparison of to net income decreased significantly in the decrease in net income between periods was primarily the result of the decline in the equity markets and an increase in realized losses on investments and derivative instruments  resulting from the decline in value and the sale and write downs of fixed maturity securities 
the significant decline in the equity markets negatively affected the segment s earnings through lower fees from lower average variable account values  negative unlocking of dac and pvif and increases in reserves and benefit payments for gmdb 
the decline in the equity markets in resulted in average daily variable annuity account values and ending variable annuity account values for being significantly lower than for the decrease in variable annuity account values reduced fees and lowered net income 
the lower equity markets resulted in negative retrospective unlocking of dac and pvif and changes in the rate of amortization 
the negative unlocking in was due to actual equity market performance lagging the expected market performance used in lnc s dac assumptions 
increases in gmdb reserves and benefit payments also significantly decreased net income in

decreased earnings from investment partnerships resulted in a negative variance of million compared to partially offsetting the negative variances were million from higher investment margins 
overall investment spreads on fixed annuity products excluding the impact of the policy loan interest adjustment and investment income earned on invested capital supporting the segment which includes investment partnerships were relatively flat between years in  excluding an adjustment to interest on policy loans  versus average fixed annuity account values increased significantly in increasing net income 
the increase in fixed annuity account values was due to the positive net cash flows for fixed annuities  reflecting strong sales of the stepfive  lincoln select and lincoln choiceplus sm fixed annuity products in net flows lincoln retirement s product deposits  withdrawals and net flows were as follows improvement decline over prior year year ended december in billions variable portion of annuity deposits variable portion of annuity withdrawals variable portion of annuity net flows fixed portion of variable annuity deposits fixed portion of variable annuity withdrawals fixed portion of variable annuity net flows total variable annuity deposits total variable annuity withdrawals total variable annuity net flows n m fixed annuity deposits fixed annuity withdrawals fixed annuity net flows total annuity deposits total annuity withdrawals total annuity net flows incremental deposits incremental deposits represent gross deposits reduced by transfers from other lincoln annuity products 
lnc has been following a two pronged approach to improving net flows over the last few years 
attracting new deposits and retaining existing accounts are key drivers of the retirement segment s ability to achieve profitable future earnings growth 
variable product sales were up six percent in over while fixed product sales were down from the prior year 
through the fourth quarter of  the retirement segment has experienced ten consecutive quarters of positive net flows 

table of contents new deposits improvement decline year ended december in billions individual annuities variable fixed total individual employer sponsored annuities variable fixed total employer sponsored total annuity deposits variable fixed total individual annuities new deposits are an important component of lnc s effort to grow the annuity business 
in the past several years  this effort has concentrated on both product and distribution breadth 
although overall annuity deposits were down in compared to  lnc maintained deposit levels in the individual variable annuity business and saw growth in the employer sponsored business 
the overall decline was a result of a reduction in individual fixed annuities  as interest rates remained at low levels in lnc s sales in of individual variable annuities were driven by the introduction of the principal security sm benefit in june of lincoln choiceplus sm variable annuity gross deposits were up and american legacy variable annuity gross deposits were up nearly compared to as a result of guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit gmwb feature of the principal security sm benefit

in addition to the introduction of the lincoln principal security sm feature  lincoln financial distributors lfd added wholesalers in the latter part of  and more are expected to be added in the near future 
the increase in wholesalers is expected to increase sales 
lfd is the primary wholesale distributor of lnc s individual annuity products 
during  lnc worked with american funds distributors afd to transition the wholesaling of the american legacy variable annuity to lfd 
with this change  lfd has a dedicated team focused on key broker dealer relationships developed in conjunction with afd  which is expected to continue to renew growth in american legacy variable annuity sales 
also as a result of this change  lfd now has two distinct annuity product wholesaling groups the single manager american legacy and the multi manager choiceplus sm and multi fund 

table of contents the decrease in individual fixed product sales is the result of declining interest rates and competitive pressures in with the decline in interest rates over the last few years  it has been more difficult to offer rates that were competitive in the marketplace and still allow lnc to achieve targeted spreads on the fixed annuity products 
lnc s approach in and into is to approach the fixed annuity marketplace on an opportunistic basis where lnc intends to only offer products with rates that are consistent with lnc s required spreads 
during and  the poor performance of the equity markets  resulted in an increase in sales of fixed annuity products 
lnc s fixed annuity sales in through were bolstered by product offerings that were introduced in including the lincoln select fixed annuity and the stepfive fixed annuity 
the guarantees of the stepfive fixed annuity made it an important product for lnc in the financial institutions channel 
new product offerings launched in in the financial institutions channel included accelarate and choiceguarantee 
in  lnc experienced an increase in deposits in the employer sponsored business as a result of increased deposits in variable and fixed products within the alliance program 
the alliance program enables the retirement segment to sell a multi manager mutual fund based product within the employer sponsored marketplace 
deposits of the alliance program were million in  an increase of from deposits of million in a significant portion of the deposits  million  came in the first quarter of from a large number of enrollments from employer sponsored plans 
retention of assets one of the key assumptions in pricing a product is the account persistency  often referred to as the lapse rate 
the lapse rate compares the amount of withdrawals to the retained account values 
one way to measure a company s success in retaining assets is to look at the overall level of withdrawals from period to period 
however  this alone does not tell the whole story 
by comparing actual lapse rates to the rates assumed in designing the annuity product  it is possible to gauge the impact of persistency on profitability 
overall lapse rates were in  in and in in all three years  overall lapse rates have been more favorable than the level of persistency assumed in product pricing 
in addition  as described above  lnc experienced an increase in deposits within the alliance program offered within the employer sponsored marketplace 
the persistency of the employer sponsored business tends to be higher than in the individual annuity marketplace as employer sponsored products involve systematic deposits and are part of an overall employee benefit plan which are generally not subject to the level of exchange activity typically experienced in the individual marketplace 
bush administration tax legislation president bush s tax legislation has not provided a pass through of reduced rates on qualified dividends or long term capital gains for non qualified annuities  as is the case for other financial services products  such as mutual funds 
the long term impact of this for the annuity industry is unknown 
however  lnc expects that the income guarantee provided within an annuity will continue to be viewed as a significant benefit 
the guaranteed living and death benefits offered within annuity products are not found in any other investment vehicle 
because of the equity market volatility over the last few years  in lnc s experience  the demand for these benefits appears to have outweighed any potential detrimental impact of tax law changes 
lnc believes that the guarantees within an annuity should continue to drive annuity sales 
in addition  lnc continues to support tax legislation that recognizes and rewards the long term nature of annuity investments and the unique benefit payout alternatives that are only available from annuity products 
outlook economic and market conditions  and the level of interest rates have been volatile over the past several years 
this volatility and uncertainty in the marketplace has impacted fixed and variable annuity sales for both the industry and lincoln retirement 
customer behavior has been influenced by these factors as well as by the introduction of new products and product features  including the very popular living benefits products 

table of contents lincoln retirement s living benefit product  principal security sm  was rolled out in june of and resulted in an immediate increase in sales in the second half of the year 
while lnc expects this sales momentum to continue  history has shown that competitive pressures and new product innovations can have a short term impact on market share 
looking forward  continued low interest rates would lower portfolio earned rates and move more of lnc s crediting rates to contractual minimum  causing a drop in investment spreads 
conversely  if interest rates were to rise rapidly it could lead to disintermediation risk 
changes in tax laws and additional regulatory scrutiny of variable annuities could have a negative impact on lnc s ability to grow the business 
to deal with these uncertainties  lnc remains committed to its two pronged approach of growing new deposits and retaining existing assets to manage its net flows 
lnc expects to continue to strengthen its distribution breadth  utilize and improve upon its balanced portfolio of fixed and variable annuities and aggressively manage expenses as key profitability drivers in the challenging annuity market 
life insurance the life insurance segment  with principal operations in hartford  connecticut  and fort wayne  indiana  with additional operations in schaumburg  illinois  creates and protects wealth for its clients through the manufacture and sale of life insurance products throughout the united states 
the life insurance segment offers universal life ul  variable universal life vul  interest sensitive whole life iswl  term life term and corporate owned life insurance coli 
a majority of the life insurance segment s products are distributed through lfd and lfa 
life insurance products the life insurance segment offers a broad portfolio of life insurance products 
in addition to term  the segment offers three distinct permanent insurance product types universal life  variable universal life and interest sensitive whole life 
within these product types are wealth accumulation and wealth transfer specific products  including single life and survivorship versions of all three 
insurance riders such as return of premium  lapse protection  and long term care benefit provisions are available with certain products 
the long term care benefit is available in the ul moneyguard product 
in addition  the segment offers both ul and vul versions of coli 
this allows the segment to effectively align its portfolio of products with the primary affluent market segments and to also provide products that perform under a variety of market conditions 
given the economic environment of the recent past  portfolio breadth has proven its value 
the industry has experienced a dramatic shift from variable to fixed products over the last few years  driven primarily by the equity market declines in and and a flight to conservatism 
although the equity markets improved during  there was not a movement back to variable from fixed products and the life insurance segment s mix of business has continued to shift from vul to ul 
the life insurance segment has continued to develop products that meet the changing needs of its target affluent market 
during times when the consumer has less tolerance for market risk  it is important to have a competitive fixed ul product portfolio 
in  the segment focused its efforts on maintaining the series of products with the lapse protection rider lpr 
these products  originally introduced in  offer an innovative rider  which is designed to provide flexibility and guaranteed death benefit coverage see guideline axxx section for a description of the guarantee feature 
new single life and survivorship versions of these products were released in february and updated again in october to address continuing movement in the market by competitors 
in may  the segment s corporate specialty markets unit released an updated vul product called lincoln cv the segment continued to strengthen the guarantees available in its vul portfolio to generate additional interest in this line 
the response to all of these new products has been very positive 
in  the segment plans to continue to be aggressive in product development 

table of contents critical accounting policy dac  pvif and dfel fas requires that acquisition costs for ul policies and vul policies be amortized over the lives of the contracts in relation to the incidence of estimated gross profits  consistent with the treatment noted previously for variable annuities 
factors affecting estimated gross profits are mortality net of reinsurance ceded  investment margins and expense margins 
for the life insurance segment  based on the current mix of life insurance in force on the books  the factors that have the most significant impact on estimated gross profits are mortality experience net of reinsurance  premium and policy persistency  and interest margins 
each of these sources of profit is  in turn  driven by other factors 
for example assets under management and the spread between earned and credited rates drive investment margins  net amount at risk drives the level of cost of insurance charges and reinsurance premiums 
market movement  which has the greatest impact on dac amortization for the retirement segment relative to its variable annuity block of business  has less impact on dac amortization for the life insurance segment 
on a quarterly basis  lnc reviews the assumptions of its dac amortization model and records a retrospective adjustment to the amount expensed  ie  unlocks the dac 
on an annual basis  lnc reviews and adjusts as necessary its assumptions for prospective amortization of dac  as well as its other intangible asset  pvif 
changes in future assumptions resulted in prospective unlocking  which increased amortization by million in the third quarter of in addition  as a result of a significant increase in the degree to which customers were utilizing their option to reduce the face amount of their policies  the company recorded net prospective unlocking adjustments  which increased amortization by million during  most of which occurred in the first quarter of results of operations the life insurance segment s financial results  first year premiums by product  account values and in force amounts were as follows increase decrease year ended december in millions net income items included in net income after tax realized loss on investments and derivative instruments restructuring charges net gain loss on reinsurance derivative trading securities cumulative effect of accounting changes goodwill amortization cumulative effect of accounting changes for results from the recording in the fourth quarter of the embedded derivative for modco reinsurance arrangements resulting from implementation of dig b the changes relate to the transition adjustment of million recorded in the first quarter of upon adoption of fas and the adjustment of million recorded in the second quarter of upon adoption of eitf refer to new accounting pronouncements section beginning on page for further discussion of these items

comparison of net income comparison of to the increase in net income in was primarily due to the absence of realized losses on investments and derivative instruments that was experienced in the decrease to net income from restructuring charges was a result of the realignment of the lincoln retirement and life insurance segments and the realignment of operations from the schaumburg  illinois office to hartford  connecticut 
the segment also experienced a minor impact from the fourth quarter implementation of dig b a significant negative effect on net income in was the negative prospective dac pvif dfel unlocking  and the resulting higher dac amortization from the increase in the dac amortization rate associated with these prospective assumption changes 
see the discussion of the third quarter prospective unlocking presented above within the topic critical accounting policy dac  pvif and dfel 
the improvement in the equity markets during increased net income through higher fees and favorable retrospective dac unlocking relative to mortality experience mortality assessments less net death benefits and mortality related retrospective dac unlocking in was favorable relative to the improvement in mortality resulted from lower death benefits and favorable unlocking relative to volatility is expected from mortality risk  but lnc attempts to lessen the impact of volatility on earnings by reinsuring approximately of the mortality risk on new business written by the life insurance segment 
as presented in the table below  investment margins in the interest sensitive lines of business ul and iswl improved basis points in resulting in additional income of million 
partially offsetting this improvement in margins was lower investment yields on traditional non par lines of business  which reduced income by million 
traditional non par business includes term and whole life insurance 
investment margins for the interest sensitive line of business represent the excess of the yield on earning assets  calculated as net investment income on fixed product investment portfolios divided by the average earning assets  over the average crediting rate  calculated using interest credited on life products divided by the average fixed account values 
investment yield on traditional non par products decreased to in from in for these products  the yield on earning assets is calculated as net investment income on non par investment portfolios divided by average earning assets

mortality experience in was less favorable relative to investment yields declined at a faster pace than reductions in crediting rates  which reduced the interest rate margin on interest sensitive products by basis points and the investment yield on traditional products by seven basis points resulting in a reduction to income of million 
in addition  earnings from investment partnerships were lower in than and resulted in a negative variance of million

table of contents increase decrease december in billions account values universal life variable universal life interest sensitive whole life total life insurance account values in force face amount universal life and other term insurance total in force total sales as measured by first year premiums increased from the sales growth for ul was driven by sales of moneyguard  a ul product with a long term care rider  and strong growth in other fixed ul products 
despite the equity market turnaround  sales of vul continued to decline in the dollar decline in vul sales has been more than offset by the dollar increase in ul sales 
ul accounted for of total retail ul vul sales in versus of those sales in in analyzing the impact of sales growth as a predictive measure of future earnings it is important to understand that product mix of sales affects future profitability 
the moneyguard product  an important driver of recent sales growth  is typically sold as a single premium product 
as a result  the relative profitability of moneyguard on a per dollar of first year premium basis is less than that of other types of permanent life insurance such as ul and vul 
however  the product s profitability does meet lnc s overall profitability targets 
the increase in life insurance in force has been driven by the growth in term life insurance 
an unusually high level of face amount reductions by policyholders electing to reduce their coverage dampened the growth in ul and other products in force 
excluding the effects of face amount reductions  the general level of policy lapsation was in line with segment expectations 
it is important to view the in force growth separately for term products versus the universal life and other products permanent products as term products by design have a lower profitability to face amount relationship than do permanent products 
growth in account values reflects positive net flows  net of fees assessed to the policyholders of approximately million  interest earned on ul and interest sensitive whole life and the effect of a strong equity market recovery on vul account values 
the increase in net flows was driven by the sales of ul products 
estate tax reform permanent repeal of the estate tax after continues to be debated by the federal legislature 
the outlook for permanent repeal remains highly uncertain 
to date  lnc has not experienced any significant change in life insurance sales as a result of the changes in estate tax laws enacted in total survivorship sales as a percent of overall sales were flat at of total retail first year premiums in and lnc s life insurance products are designed to support a wide variety of financial planning needs such as business succession  charitable giving and fringe benefit planning  not just management of estate tax exposure 
guideline axxx the application of the valuation of life insurance policies model regulation axxx was developed to clarify statutory reserve requirements for particular policy designs under the naic valuation of life insurance 
table of contents policies model regulation regulation xxx 
axxx was effective for ul policies sold beginning in and increases statutory reserves for ul policies with secondary guarantees using shadow accounts and for specified premium guarantees that are prefunded 
the secondary guarantee promises to keep a policy in force as long as certain conditions are met 
regardless of whether the policy has any cash value  the policy will not lapse as long as the shadow account is positive 
a shadow account is a hypothetical account that accumulates actual premium payments and interest less fees based on the secondary guarantee assumptions 
however  the shadow account does not provide any cash value to the policyholder 
in addition to secondary guarantees using shadow accounts  all companies offering secondary guarantees that allow prefunding are impacted by axxx to a greater or lesser degree depending on product design 
a prefunded policy is one where premiums are paid earlier than is necessary to maintain the policy s benefits 
lnc s single life and survivorship ul products offer secondary guarantees using shadow accounts 
use of this design provides more flexibility to policyholders than a premium based approach 
in  these products were redesigned twice to reflect both the financial requirements of axxx and a changing competitive landscape 
lnc expects secondary guarantees to be critical to lnc s target affluent market and expects that the axxx version of these products will continue to be competitive 
lnc also markets many life insurance products that do not offer secondary guarantees and which were not impacted by axxx 
lnl is actively exploring strategies to lesson the burden of increased axxx reserves 
strategies include both reinsurance and capital markets solutions that provide for risk transfer and associated reserve and surplus relief 
see contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements part ii page split dollar new regulations have set forth the irs views regarding the tax treatment of split dollar funding arrangements 
split dollar is a premium funding mechanism that has been used for many years  with irs approval  to provide life insurance benefits to a firm s key executives  or to provide life insurance benefits to family members of closely held firms  etc 
the final irs regulations issued in are effective for arrangements entered into or materially modified after september  the new regulations do not eliminate split dollar arrangements  but clarify certain issues 
as a result of the final regulation  some split dollar plans may not be as attractive as before  but some plans may be better 
accounting reforms under sarbanes oxley  which prohibit publicly traded companies from extending credit to their directors or executives  affect some split dollar programs 
however  most of the products sold by lnc for use in split dollar arrangements are sold to closely held companies  limited partnerships and family owned businesses  not publicly traded companies 
given lnc s target market  and the fact that the amount of lnc s split dollar sales in relationship to the level of total first year life premium sold is insignificant  these changes are expected to have minimal overall effect on lnc s sales 
coli lnc s coli products are only marketed to organizations for coverage of officers and require the prospective permission of the officers to be covered under the coli policy 
in february  the senate finance committee approved a coli provision which provides that the death benefits from a coli contract are not taxable if the deceased individual was an employee within months of death  or the death benefits are payable to the employee s family  beneficiary  estate  or are used to purchase an equity interest in the employer buy sell agreement  or the employee is a key person defined as either a highly compensated employee currently income over k  or is a highly compensated individual salary in the top for employer  or is a director 
in all cases  the employee must receive notice of coverage and provide written consent 
passage of this legislation is uncertain  but the recent action of the senate finance committee  which has shown the most interest in the issue  should provide more certainty to the market 
if the existing proposal becomes law  it is not expected to have a detrimental effect on coli markets in which lnc participates 

table of contents outlook lnc expects will be another challenging year for the life insurance segment 
on the positive side  the improvement in the equity and credit markets seen in should bode well for sales to the affluent market an area of focus for lnc as well as the degree to which policyholders seek reductions in coverage 
however  current new money rates are approximately basis points below existing portfolio yields 
as a result  the segment may need to take further action to lower crediting rates to reduce the impact on interest rate margins 
as stated earlier  with approximately of fixed account values for interest sensitive lines of business already at their minimum guaranteed interest rate  lnc s ability to lower crediting rates is somewhat limited 
there was substantial pricing pressure in  particularly with respect to products with secondary guarantees 
it is uncertain as to whether there will be a return to more rational pricing in the market in as discussed above  the segment uses reinsurance to manage the mortality risk 
there was also pricing pressure in in the reinsurance market 
while the segment has  for the most part  factored the higher reinsurance prices into product pricing  all indications are that the reinsurance marketplace may continue to tighten 
further price increases to cover this would only add to existing competitive pressures 
despite this difficult operating environment  lnc believes the segment has sustainable competitive advantages to continue to grow profitably into the future 
lnc s balanced portfolio of products should be positioned to take advantage of the demand among the affluent for sophisticated life products to meet a variety of tax  business and family needs 
in addition  the segment has taken the necessary rate actions to manage investment margins  has aggressively managed expenses  and expects to maintain a strong in force management discipline to maintain favorable persistency 
lnc believes the segment s underwriting capabilities are well respected in the reinsurance marketplace  which should enable lnc to remain well positioned relative to the competition 
investment management the investment management segment  with principal operations in philadelphia  pennsylvania  offers a variety of asset management services to retail and institutional clients located throughout the united states and certain foreign countries 
its product offerings include mutual funds and managed accounts 
it also provides investment management and account administration services for variable annuity products  k  college savings plans  pension  endowment  trust and other institutional accounts 
the primary operating companies within this segment are the subsidiaries of delaware management holdings  inc delaware 
the segment employs the services of the lincoln national life insurance company for its k director product 
retail products are primarily marketed by lfd through financial intermediaries  including lfa 
institutional asset management products are marketed by a separate sales force within delaware  which works closely with pension consultants 
diversity of investment styles  as well as diversity of clients served  are prudent ways to manage risk in varying market environments 
delaware has evolved into an investment manager with strong and diversified offerings across all major asset classes  including value and growth equity investment styles  high grade  high yield and municipal fixed income investment styles  balanced and quantitative investment styles  and international and global equity and fixed income investment styles 
critical accounting policies dac during the first quarter of  the investment management segment implemented a new system for calculating the amortization of dac consistent with the system and methodology utilized by the lincoln retirement and life insurance segments 
the dac is related to the annuity based k director product 
the segment s dac asset was million as of december  
table of contents deferred dealer commission asset the investment management segment has a deferred dealer commission asset of approximately million as of december  relating to upfront sales commissions paid to brokers for the sale of class b shares of delaware retail mutual funds 
the asset is amortized over the estimated period of time that it is expected to be realized or recovered from future cash flows in the form of asset based distribution b fees from the mutual funds or contingent deferred sales charges cdscs from shareholders who redeem shares during the cdsc period 
the estimate of future cash flows from these sources was positively impacted by the equity markets improvement in in accordance with sfas accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  should the estimated undiscounted future cash flows from b fees and cdsc s drop below the carrying value of the deferred dealer commission asset  then an impairment write down would be required to be recognized 
in that event  the amount of the impairment write down would be computed by comparing the carrying value of the deferred dealer commission asset to the discounted value of the future b and cdsc cash flows 
as of december   the estimated undiscounted future b and cdsc cash flows exceeded the carrying value of the deferred dealer commission asset 
lnc monitors the net asset values navs of the underlying retail mutual funds to determine if a write down of the deferred dealer commission asset would be required 
lnc is also monitoring potential regulatory changes concerning b fees  and possible effects on the recoverability of the deferred dealer commission asset 
equity markets the investment management segment s net income is significantly affected by volatility in the equity markets 
changes in the equity markets impact the segment s earnings through the level of assets managed and their effect on fees that the segment earns 
refer to the results of operations discussion provided below for an analysis of the comparative effects that movements in the equity markets have had on the investment management s segment earnings 
within the segment there are two items  in addition to the fees from assets under management  which are affected by changes in the equity markets 
these are two unrelated items that currently tend to move in opposite directions 
first  the segment has invested capital  referred to as seed capital  for the start up of products 
these investments are accounted for in a method consistent with trading securities with changes in market value reported through net income 
after the funds reach a certain threshold  the seed capital will be returned to lnc 
the second item  moving in an opposite direction to the changes in value of the seed capital  are the changes in value of the deferred compensation liability for delaware employees 
deferred compensation is further discussed within note employee benefit plans in the notes to the consolidated financial statements

included in the impact from dac unlocking is million of positive unlocking from refinement of the methodology during as described in the equity markets section  the segment s net income was positively impacted in by the equity markets through an increase in value of the seed capital  which was partially offset by increased expense on the deferred compensation liability 
managing expenses is important to the success of the investment management segment 
the increase in operating and administrative expenses in over was primarily related to incentive compensation and 
table of contents expenses impacted by both net flows and markets 
in  the segment benefited from a release of accrued compensation of million resulting from the resignation of the segment s ceo 
as part of lnc s overall expense management initiatives the segment incurred restructuring charges in additional details on this activity are provided in the restructuring charges section 
the segment benefited from a change in tax laws in the united kingdom permitting a deduction for stock compensation expense 
the tax benefit recognized in the fourth quarter of reflects a deduction for the fair value of options granted in current and prior years that remained outstanding at the beginning of the year 
comparison of to excluding the effect of goodwill amortization in  net income decreased approximately million in the decrease in income was primarily a result of declines in the equity markets reducing retail and institutional assets under management and the resulting lower revenues earned on the assets under management 
positive net cash flows in partially offset the negative effect of the equity markets on assets under management and revenues 
additional positives were reduced operating and administrative expenses from cost containment efforts and the release of the former ceo s accrued compensation

estimated gross profits on unit linked contracts vary based on surrenders  fee income  expenses and realized gains losses on investments 
the amortization is adjusted retrospectively when estimates of current or future gross profits to be realized from unit linked contracts are revised 
because equity market movement has such a significant impact on fee income  estimated future profits will go up or down accordingly

outlook during  lincoln uk will continue to focus on protecting and enhancing the value of its customer base  evaluating new income streams and delivering business excellence through quality people and business processes 
the segment continues to maintain reserves established in and for misselling activities 
payments and expenses for these activities have generally been in line with the established reserves 
during  the regulatory authority in the uk confirmed that there is a time limit for policyholders to make claims which should further limit lincoln uk s exposure to this issue 
the segment remains subject to volatility in the equity markets and changes in the foreign currency exchange rate between the us dollar and the british pound sterling 
significant changes in either could cause net income to fluctuate period to period 
other operations activity that is not included in the major business segments is reported in other operations 
other operations includes the operations of lfa and lfd and operations not directly related to the business segments  unallocated corporate items ie  corporate investment income  interest expense on corporate debt  unallocated overhead expenses  and the amortization of the gain on the sale of the reinsurance business 
prior to the fourth quarter of  lnc had a reinsurance segment lincoln re 
lnc s reinsurance business was acquired by swiss re in december as the majority of the business acquired by swiss re was via indemnity reinsurance agreements  lnc is not relieved of its legal liability to the ceding companies for this business 
this means that the liabilities and obligations associated with the reinsured contracts remain on the balance sheets of lnc with a corresponding reinsurance receivable from swiss re 
in addition  the gain resulting from the indemnity reinsurance portion of the transaction was deferred and is being amortized into earnings at the rate that earnings on the reinsured business are expected to emerge  over a period of years 
the ongoing management of the indemnity reinsurance contracts and the reporting of the deferred gain will be within lnc s other operations 
given the lengthy period of time over which lnc is amortizing the deferred gain  and the fact that related assets and liabilities will continue to be reported within lnc s financial statements  the historical results for the reinsurance segment prior to the close of the transaction with swiss re are not reported as discontinued operations  but as a separate line in other operations

table of contents the reinsurance operation that lnc sold to swiss re 
investment securities supporting these arrangements were reclassified at the beginning of the fourth quarter from available for sale to trading  resulting in pre tax income of million 
lnc financing benefited in from investment income on the proceeds from the sale to swiss re 
during  the proceeds were used to repurchase stock and during the fourth quarter  the remaining proceeds were reinvested in lnc s business segments 
excluding the investment income on the proceeds  lnc financing benefited from lower interest rates due to the changes made to lnc s outstanding debt during as described in the liquidity and cash flow section 
within other corporate in  there were costs associated with lnc s realignment activities 
these costs totaled million  including million reported as a restructuring charge 
lfd experienced a reduction in net losses in however  included in lfd s net loss were expenses of million resulting from a decision to expense previously deferred costs related to specific initiatives to expand life insurance sales 
excluding this expense  lfd s net loss increased by million in expenses primarily associated with the expansion of the wholesaling force were the main contributor to the additional loss in increased sales in life insurance increase in retail and increase in coli  variable annuity increase and investment products increase partially offset the increase in expenses 
as discussed within the retirement segment  lfd did experience a decrease in fixed annuity sales decrease 
lfd expects to continue to focus in on strengthening its strategic alliances and increasing the number and effectiveness of wholesalers across all distribution channels 
lfa s net losses in include million of realignment costs  of which million were reported as restructuring charges 
the significant improvement in the equity markets resulted in an increase to lfa s deferred compensation liability and increased lfa s loss by million 
however  this loss was more than offset by equity market related gains of million in the variable annuity purchased in to provide an economic hedge of the deferred compensation liability 
this compared to a combined loss on the deferred compensation liability and the annuity contract of million in lfa experienced strong sales growth in all business lines in a key to lfa s ability to reduce its net losses is related to the success of the realignment activities initiated in to enhance productivity and operational efficiencies 
comparison of to the net loss in includes charges required by fas for increases in personal accident and disability income reserves for the business sold through indemnity reinsurance to swiss re 
amortization of the deferred gain on indemnity reinsurance increased due to a full year s amortization in compared to one month s amortization in net income for included eleven months of income from the operations of the former reinsurance segment

in addition to the investment income  there was a decrease in long term debt expense associated with various long term financing activities that occurred in the second half of and third quarter of as described in the liquidity and cash flow section of the review of consolidated financial condition 
short term borrowing costs were also lower due to lower interest rates and lower daily average borrowings under the commercial paper program in the uk the net loss in in other corporate included a restructuring charge related to the consolidation of operations and the reduction of excess space in lnc s fort wayne  indiana operations resulting from lnc s divestiture of its reinsurance operations 

table of contents lfa s increased net loss for included the effects of changes in the value of lfa s liability for deferred compensation and variable annuity contract 
the combined effect was an increased loss of million in compared to in addition  in the fringe benefit operation fbd was moved from lfa to the retirement segment 
in  fbd had a loss of million that was included in lfa s results 
excluding the net effect of the deferred compensation liability  the annuity and fbd  lfa s net loss for increased million over one of the contributors to the increased loss was that lfa s sales during the fourth quarter did not reflect the typical seasonal fourth quarter increase over the prior three quarters of the year as had been seen during the fourth quarter of the previous four years 
this deviation from the prior trend in sales resulted in a decrease in revenues for relative to lfd experienced a reduction in net losses in however  included in lfd s net losses were expenses of million described in the to comparison above 
excluding this expense  lfd s net losses improved from a combination of increased sales in all of its product categories including life insurance  annuity and investment products and a reduction in fixed operating costs primarily due to lower expenses following two restructuring activities occurring in litigation in  lnl concluded the settlement of all class action lawsuits alleging fraud in the sale of lnl non variable universal life and participating whole life policies issued between january  and december  since  lnl has reached settlements with a substantial number of the owners of policies that opted out of the class action settlement 
lnl continues to defend a small number of opt out claims and lawsuits 
while there is continuing uncertainty about the ultimate costs of settling the remaining opt out cases  it is management s opinion that established reserves are adequate and future developments will not materially affect the consolidated financial position of lnc 
lnc and lnl have pursued claims with their liability insurance carriers for reimbursement of certain costs incurred in connection with the class action settlement and the settlement of claims and litigation brought by owners that opted out of the class action settlement 
during the fourth quarter of  lnc and lnl settled their claims against three liability carriers on a favorable basis

table of contents investment objective invested assets are an integral part of the lincoln retirement  life insurance and lincoln uk segments operations 
for discussion of external assets under management  ie  retail and institutional assets  see the investment management segment discussion starting on page lnc follows a balanced approach of investment for both current income and prudent risk management  with an emphasis on generating sufficient current income to meet lnc s obligations 
this approach requires the evaluation of risk and expected return of each asset class utilized  while still meeting the income objectives of lnc 
this approach also permits lnc to be more effective in its asset liability management  since decisions can be made based upon both the economic and current investment income considerations affecting assets and liabilities 
investment portfolio composition and diversification fundamental to lnc s investment policy is diversification across asset classes 
lnc s investment portfolio  excluding cash and invested cash  is composed of fixed maturity securities  mortgage loans on real estate  real estate either wholly owned or in joint ventures and other long term investments 
lnc purchases investments for its segmented portfolios that have yield  duration and other characteristics that take into account the liabilities of the products being supported 
the dominant investments held are fixed maturity securities available for sale  which represent approximately of the investment portfolio 
trading securities  which are primarily fixed maturity securities  represent approximately of the investment portfolio 
the total investment portfolio increased billion in and billion in the increase in was due to the purchase of investments from cash flow generated by the business units  positive net flows for fixed annuity and life insurance portfolios and market value appreciation of fixed maturity securities resulting from overall improvements in the credit markets 
the increase in was due to the purchase of investments from cash flow generated by the business units  positive net flows for fixed annuity portfolios and market value appreciation of fixed maturity securities due to the significant decline in interest rates during the quality of lnc s available for sale fixed maturity securities portfolio  as measured at fair value and by the percentage of fixed maturity securities invested in various ratings categories relative to the entire available for sale fixed maturity security portfolio  as of december  was as follows aaa and agencies bbb aa bb a less than bb the ratings data listed above have been determined by using the lowest of all publicly available ratings assigned to a particular fixed maturity security 
if no public ratings exist  a rating is assigned based upon lnc s analysis of the inherent risks of the individual security 
as of december  and december   billion  or  and billion  or  respectively  of all fixed maturity securities available for sale were invested in below investment grade securities less than bbb 
this represents and of the total investment portfolio at december  and december   respectively 
when viewed on a cost basis  below investment grade securities held at december  and december  represented and  respectively  of fixed maturity securities 
securities available for sale securities that are classified as available for sale make up of lnc s fixed maturity and equity securities portfolio 
these securities are carried at fair value on lnc s balance sheet 
because the general intent of the available for sale accounting rules is to reflect shareholders equity as if unrealized gains and losses were actually recognized  it is necessary for lnc to consider all related accounting adjustments that would occur upon such a hypothetical recognition of unrealized gains and losses 
such related balance sheet effects include adjustments to the balances of deferred acquisition costs  policyholder commitments and deferred income taxes 
adjustments to each of these balances are charged or credited directly to shareholders equity as part of lnc s available for sale accounting 
for instance  deferred acquisition costs are adjusted upon the recognition of unrealized gains or losses since the amortization of deferred acquisition costs is 
table of contents based upon an assumed emergence of gross profits on certain insurance business 
in a similar manner  adjustments to the balances of policyholder reserves or commitments are made because lnc has either a contractual obligation or has a consistent historical practice of making allocations of investment gains or losses to certain policyholders 
deferred income tax balances are also adjusted  since unrealized gains or losses do not affect actual taxes currently paid 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for details of the gross unrealized gains and losses as of december  and trading securities as discussed more fully in the discussion on accounting for modified coinsurance in the accounting changes section beginning on page  lnc reclassified fixed maturity and equity securities in designated portfolios that support modco and cfw reinsurance arrangements from available for sale to trading 
this was done in connection with the implementation of new accounting requirements that required the recording of an embedded derivative for these types of arrangements 
investment results for these portfolios  including gains and losses from sales  are passed directly to the reinsurers through the contractual terms of the reinsurance arrangements 
trading securities are carried at fair value and changes in fair value are recorded in net income as they occur 
offsetting these amounts are corresponding changes in the fair value of the embedded derivative liability associated with the underlying reinsurance arrangement 
mortgaged backed securities lnc s fixed maturity securities include mortgage backed securities 
the mortgage backed securities included in lnc s investment portfolio are subject to risks associated with variable prepayments 
this may result in these securities having a different actual cash flow and maturity than expected at the time of purchase 
securities that have an amortized cost greater than par and are backed by mortgages that prepay faster than expected will incur a reduction in yield or a loss 
those securities with an amortized cost lower than par that prepay faster than expected will generate an increase in yield or a gain 
in addition  lnc may incur reinvestment risks if market yields are lower than the book yields earned on the securities 
prepayments occurring slower than expected have the opposite impact 
lnc may incur disinvestment risks if market yields are higher than the book yields earned on the securities and lnc is forced to sell the securities 
the degree to which a security is susceptible to either gains or losses is influenced by the difference between its amortized cost and par  the relative sensitivity of the underlying mortgages backing the assets to prepayment in a changing interest rate environment and the repayment priority of the securities in the overall securitization structure 
lnc limits the extent of its risk on mortgage backed securities by prudently limiting exposure to the asset class  by generally avoiding the purchase of securities with a cost that significantly exceeds par  by purchasing securities backed by stable collateral  and by concentrating on securities with enhanced priority in their trust structure 
such securities with reduced risk typically have a lower yield but higher liquidity than higher risk mortgage backed securities 
at selected times  higher risk securities may be purchased if they do not compromise the safety of the general portfolio 
at december   lnc did not have a significant amount of higher risk mortgage backed securities 
there are negligible default risks in the mortgage backed securities portfolio as a whole as the vast majority of the assets are either guaranteed by us government sponsored entities or are supported in the securitization structure by junior securities enabling the assets to achieve high investment grade status 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional detail about the underlying collateral 
mortgage loans on real estate and real estate as of december   mortgage loans on real estate and investments in real estate represented and of the total investment portfolio 
as of december   the underlying properties supporting the mortgage loans on real estate consisted of in commercial office buildings  in retail stores  in industrial buildings  in apartments  in hotels motels and in other 
in addition to the dispersion by property type  the mortgage loan portfolio is geographically diversified throughout the united states 
however  mortgage loans on real estate in california and texas accounted for approximately of the total carrying value of mortgage loans at december  
table of contents the following summarizes key information on mortgage loans in millions december  december  total portfolio net of reserves impaired mortgage loans impaired mortgage loans as a percentage of total mortgage loans mortgage loans two or more payments delinquent including in process of foreclosure restructured loans in good standing reserve for mortgage loans all mortgage loans that are impaired have an established allowance for credit loss 
changing economic conditions impact lnc s valuation of mortgage loans 
increasing vacancies  declining rents and the like are incorporated into the discounted cash flow analysis that lnc performs for monitored loans and may contribute to the establishment of or an increase in an allowance for credit losses 
in addition  lnc continues to monitor the entire commercial mortgage loan portfolio to identify risk 
areas of current emphasis are the hotel mortgage loan portfolio and retail  office and industrial properties that have deteriorating credits or have experienced debt coverage reduction 
where warranted  lnc has established or increased loss reserves based upon this analysis 
impaired mortgage loans as a percentage of total mortgage loans has deteriorated over the last two years as a result of increased credit losses in the sectors noted above 
this percentage was       and as of december        and  respectively 
while the percentage of impaired mortgage loans has been increasing slightly over prior years  all commercial mortgage loans in the portfolio are current in principal and interest payments 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional detail regarding impaired mortgage loans 
limited partnership investments as of december  and  there were million and million  respectively  of limited partnership investments included in consolidated investments 
these include investments in approximately different partnerships that allow lnc to gain exposure to a broadly diversified portfolio of asset classes such as venture capital  hedge funds  and oil and gas 
they are generally fairly large partnerships with several third party partners 
these partnerships do not represent off balance sheet financing to lnc 
select partnerships contain capital calls which require lnc to contribute capital upon notification by the general partner 
these capital calls are contemplated during the initial investment decision and are planned for well in advance of the call date 
the capital calls are not material in size and pose no threat to lnc s liquidity 
the capital calls are included on lnc s table of contingent commitments on page limited partnership investments are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and the majority of these investments are included in other investments in the consolidated balance sheets 
net investment income net investment income increased slightly in when compared to the favorable effects of asset growth from net flows  partnership income and prepayment and makewhole premiums were substantially offset by a declining portfolio yield  due to lower interest rates on new securities purchased as assets matured and net product sales flowed into the portfolio 
net investment income decreased in compared to due to a decrease in the yield on investments and net losses on investment partnerships 
the decrease in yield was primarily due to lower interest rates on new securities purchased along with higher than historical levels of defaults due to the weak economy in the following discussion addresses lnc s invested assets excluding trading account securities 
as discussed above  investment results attributable to the trading securities are passed directly to the reinsurers under the terms of the reinsurance arrangements 
critical accounting policy realized gain loss on investments and derivative instruments lnc had net pre tax realized losses on investments and derivatives of million  million and 
table of contents million in  and  respectively 
prior to the amortization of acquisition costs  provision for policyholder commitments and investment expenses  net pre tax realized losses were million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
the gross realized gains on fixed maturity and equity securities were million  million and million  in   and  respectively 
gross realized losses on fixed maturity and equity securities were million  million and million  respectively 
included within losses are write downs for impairments of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
while losses from sales and impairments occurred in a number of sectors  approximately of gross realized losses for were attributable to losses incurred on asset backed securities abs  the electric utilities and airlines sectors  and parmalat 
losses incurred on abs investments included securities collateralized by manufactured housing receivables as well as collateralized debt obligations cdos 
abss secured by manufactured housing receivables have experienced deterioration in value following the bankruptcy filing of a major servicer in the industry 
this servicer was granted changes to the existing servicing agreements by the bankruptcy court during the first quarter of servicing fees were increased and moved to a more senior position in the capital structure 
for those securities where the subordination was not at levels high enough to withstand this increase in fees without impairing value  write downs of million were recorded in deterioration in the underlying collateral pools of other abs investments during led to decreased expectations of future cash flows 
as a result  additional losses of million were realized on various abs holdings  including cdos 
this deterioration in collateral pools primarily occurred in the first half of and quarterly losses on cdos decreased throughout amortization  sales and impairments have reduced lnc s cdo exposure from of invested assets at december  to of lnc s invested assets at december  as measured on a cost basis  with over of the cdos remaining investment grade 
the unrealized loss position on the cdo portfolio has been reduced to approximately million  compared to million at the end of any further deterioration or additional realized losses in the cdo portfolio will depend on economic factors such as economic growth  corporate profitability and future asset default rates 
cash flow testing of the cdo portfolio as required under eitf supports the conclusion that these unrealized losses are temporary 
a full recovery of principal and interest is expected under the current economic environment 
electric utility sector losses were taken on selected issuers whose securities had not recovered with the rest of the electric utility issues in the market 
the deterioration of these securities  along with a lack of improvement in the underlying credit  led to the determination that the declines in value of these securities were other than temporary 
losses taken in this sector totaled million for lnc s exposure to the airline sector is primarily equipment trust certificates etcs and enhanced equipment trust certificates eetcs 
aircraft owned or operated by domestic air carriers collateralize these securities 
the war in iraq  intense competition in the industry and the sale of several aircraft by a domestic carrier all put downward pressure on valuations of securities issued by domestic carriers 
the sale of aircraft in the first quarter of provided a market clearing price for used aircraft at levels lower than what the market had previously anticipated 
this resulted in a re evaluation of the underlying collateral in etc and eetc structures 
the combination of these factors  along with increased concerns reflected in the market during the first quarter of relating to the potential bankruptcy filing for amr corporation  resulted in a write down on amr corporation s etcs to the fair market value at that time 
the change in valuation of the underlying collateral and continued economic pressures on the sector also led to an additional write down of ual corporation s etcs of million 

table of contents parmalat  an italian dairy producer  sought bankruptcy court protection in december after it was revealed that a previously reported bank account did not exist 
as a result of this and other fraudulent disclosures by company management  lnc realized a gross loss of million in december for the write down of securities issued by parmalat 
this write down reduced lnc s parmalat holdings to their fair value of million at december  lnc has considered economic factors and circumstances within countries and industries where recent write downs have occurred in its assessment of the status of securities owned by lnc of similarly situated issuers 
while it is possible for realized or unrealized losses on a particular investment to affect other investments  lnc s risk management has been designed to identify correlation risks and other risks inherent in managing an investment portfolio 
once identified  strategies and procedures are developed to effectively monitor and manage these risks 
the areas of risk correlation that lnc s investment management group pays particular attention to are risks that may be correlated within specific financial and business markets  risks within specific industries and risks associated with related parties 
critical accounting policy write downs and allowance for losses securities available for sale that were deemed to have declines in fair value that were other than temporary were written down to fair value 
the fixed maturity securities to which these write downs apply were generally of investment grade at the time of purchase  but were subsequently down graded by rating agencies to below investment grade 
factors considered by lnc in determining whether declines in the fair value of fixed maturity securities are other than temporary include the significance of the decline  lnc s ability and intent to retain the investment for a sufficient period of time for it to recover  the time period during which there has been a significant decline in value  and fundamental analysis of the liquidity  business prospects and overall financial condition of the issuer 
based upon these factors  securities that have indications of potential impairment are subject to intensive review 
where such analysis results in a conclusion that declines in fair values are other than temporary  the security is written down to fair value 
see note to the consolidated financial statements fair value of financial instruments for a general discussion of the methodologies and assumptions used to determine estimated fair values 
fair values for private securities are estimated by a matrix process that employs discounting expected future cash flows using a current market rate applicable to the coupon rate  credit quality  industry sector and maturity of the investments  third party supplied prices or secondary market transactions  and applying professional judgment to arrive at the fair value based upon prices of public or non public securities of similarly situated issuers 
the fair value for all private securities was  million and  million at december  and  respectively  representing about and of total invested assets  respectively 
as the discussion above indicates  there are risks and uncertainties associated with determining whether declines in the fair value of investments are other than temporary 
these include subsequent significant changes in general overall economic conditions  as well as specific business conditions affecting particular issuers  future financial market effects such as interest rate spreads  stability of foreign governments and economies  future rating agency actions and significant accounting  fraud or corporate governance issues that may adversely affect certain investments 
in addition  there are often significant estimates and assumptions required by lnc to estimate the fair values of securities  including projections of expected future cash flows and pricing of private securities 
lnc is continuously monitoring developments and updating underlying assumptions and financial models based upon new information 
provided below are additional facts concerning the potential effect upon lnc s future earnings and financial position should management later conclude that some of the current declines in fair value of securities are other than temporary declines 
eitf changed the manner in which impairment of certain investments in collateralized securities is determined 
the cumulative effect adjustment that lnc recorded in connection with the adoption of eitf in the second quarter of was a net realized loss on investments of million after tax million pre tax 

table of contents write downs and allowances for losses on select mortgage loans on real estate  real estate and other investments were established when the underlying value of the property was deemed to be less than the carrying value 
these write downs and provisions for losses  as well as the provisions for write downs on fixed maturity and equity securities are disclosed within the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements see note to the consolidated financial statements 
unrealized gains and losses available for sale securities at december  and  gross unrealized gains on securities available for sale were  million and  million  respectively  and gross unrealized losses on securities available for sale were million and million  respectively 
at december   gross unrealized gains and losses on fixed maturity securities available for sale were  million and million  respectively  and gross unrealized gains and losses on equity securities available for sale were million and million  respectively 
at december   gross unrealized gains and losses on fixed maturity securities available for sale were  million and million  respectively  and gross unrealized gains and losses on equity securities available for sale were million and million  respectively 
part of the change in unrealized gains and losses from december  to december  resulted from the reclassification of securities from available for sale to trading that was previously discussed 
the great majority of the remaining unrealized gains and losses can be attributed to changes in interest rates  which have created temporary price fluctuations 
however  within the portfolio of securities with unrealized losses are certain securities that lnc has identified as exhibiting indications that the decline in fair value may be other than a temporary decline in value 
where detailed analysis by lnc credit analysts and investment portfolio managers leads to the conclusion that a security s decline in fair value is other than temporary  the security is written down to fair value 
in instances where declines are considered temporary  the security will continue to be carefully monitored 
the following information is applicable to unrealized loss securities that were subject to enhanced analysis and monitoring processes as of the relevant balance sheet date 
in viewing this information  it is important to realize that lnc is continuously reviewing and updating the status of its investment portfolios 
accordingly  the information presented below relates to the status of securities that were being monitored at a particular point in time  and may not be indicative of the status of lnc s investment portfolios subsequent to the balance sheet date 
further  since the timing of the recognition of realized investment gains and losses through the selection of which securities are sold is largely at management s discretion  it is important to consider the information provided below within the context of the overall unrealized gain or loss position of lnc s investment portfolios 
these are important considerations that should be included in any evaluation of the potential impact of unrealized loss securities upon lnc s future earnings

as of december   gross unrealized losses including assets held at lincoln uk totaled million  a improvement over gross unrealized losses of million at december  this improvement occurred  despite a rise in interest rates over the year  as a result of a sustained rally in credit spreads in as of december   there were gross unrealized losses of million in the airline  abs  electric utility and banking sectors  representing of total unrealized losses 
lnc s view of risk factors at december  with respect to these industries is presented below 
airline holdings ended with an unrealized loss of million  an improvement of million over year end airline securities issued by relatively stronger carriers improved in market value significantly throughout for those relatively stronger airlines  lnc believes the unrealized loss positions at december   are temporary  and lnc expects an ultimate recovery of full principal and interest as these securities mature 
all of lnc s airline holdings in an unrealized loss position are secured as either etc or eetc structures 
for the portion of the airline sector exposure that is invested in eetc structures  lnc holds securities that are enhanced through the liquidity facilities present in these securities and their relatively higher quality aircraft collateral pools 
the abs exposure of the lnc portfolio ended with a gross unrealized loss of million  an improvement of million from year end of this amount  million relates to cdos and million relates to abs secured by manufactured housing receivables 
cdos had experienced pressure due to the nature of the assets  poor historical experience and the risk of downgrade for individual tranches held by lnc 
overall improvements in the underlying collateral pools of cdos have driven up market pricing of these securities and helped to improve the gross unrealized loss 
the electric utility sector had million of unrealized losses at december   compared with million at december  during the first half of  several utilities were able to complete asset sales and secure the financing needed in order to maintain operations through the energy cycle 
lnc believes that as the over capacity in the market for electricity is rectified by increased economic activity and as old  inefficient power plants are taken off line  margins should begin to revert to mid cycle valuations 
as this cycle progresses  lnc expects to see further improvement in this sector and believes that the unrealized losses are temporary 
the banking sector had million in unrealized losses at december  the majority of this unrealized loss is economically offset by unrealized gains in the derivative portfolio for hedging that is related to these securities 
although million of the unrealized losses relates to securities with offsetting derivative gains  the unrealized gains on the derivative position was million at december  all the underlying credits that have been swapped have an average rating of a and lnc does not anticipate any credit related losses on these securities 

table of contents unrealized loss on fixed maturity securities available for sale in excess of million as of december   lnc held fixed maturity securities available for sale with gross unrealized losses of million  or greater  as discussed below for fixed maturity securities available for sale with gross unrealized losses of million held by lnc at december  and  the fair value  amortized cost  unrealized loss and length of time in a loss position are presented in the table below

as such  lnc expects that the level of securities with overall unrealized losses will fluctuate  as will the level of unrealized loss securities that are subject to enhanced analysis and monitoring 
the recent volatility of financial market conditions has resulted 
table of contents in increased recognition of both investment gains and losses  as portfolio risks are adjusted through sales and purchases 
as discussed below  this is consistent with lnc s classification of its investment portfolios as available for sale 
during the year ended december  and  lnc sold securities at gains and at losses 
as discussed earlier  in the process of evaluating whether a security with an unrealized loss reflects an other than temporary decline  lnc considers its ability and intent to hold the security until its value recovers 
however  subsequent decisions on securities sales are made within the context of overall risk monitoring  assessing value relative to other comparable securities and overall portfolio maintenance 
although lnc s portfolio managers may  at a given point in time  believe that the preferred course of action is to hold securities with unrealized losses that are considered temporary until such losses are recovered  the dynamic nature of portfolio management may result in a subsequent decision to sell 
these subsequent decisions are consistent with the classification of lnc s investment portfolio as available for sale 
in the future  lnc expects to continue to manage all non trading invested assets within its portfolios in a manner that is consistent with the available for sale classification 
use of derivatives the primary use of derivatives at lnc is to hedge interest rate risk that is embedded in either life insurance and annuity product liabilities or investment portfolios 
to a lesser extent  derivatives are also used to hedge exposures to foreign currency and equity market risks 
derivatives held at december  contain industry standard terms and are entered into with financial institutions with long standing  superior performance records 
review of consolidated financial condition liquidity and cash flow liquidity refers to the ability of an enterprise to generate adequate amounts of cash from its normal operations to meet cash requirements with a prudent margin of safety 
the consolidated statements of cash flows on page indicate that operating activities provided cash of billion  billion and billion in  and  respectively 
this statement also classifies the other sources and uses of cash by investing activities and financing activities and discloses the amount of cash available at the end of the year to meet lnc s obligations 
when considering lnc s liquidity and cash flow it is important to distinguish between the needs of lnc s principal insurance subsidiary  the lincoln national life insurance company lnl and its insurance subsidiaries  and the needs of the holding company  lnc 
insurance company liquidity and cash flow liquidity considerations because of the interval of time from receipt of deposit or premium until payment of benefits or claims  lnl and other insurers employ investment portfolios as an integral element of operations 
by segmenting its investment portfolios along product lines  lnl enhances the focus and discipline it can apply to managing the liquidity  as well as the interest rate and credit risk of each portfolio commensurate with the profile of the related product liabilities 
for example  portfolios backing products with less certain cash flows and or withdrawal provisions are generally kept more liquid than portfolios backing products with more predictable cash flows 
lnl monitors its liquidity position via weekly conference calls between the product actuaries and investment portfolio managers 
additionally  the liquidity position and liquidity targets by portfolio are reviewed at monthly asset liability committee meetings 
the committee includes actuarial and asset management professionals and is chaired by lnl s appointed actuary 
the committee utilizes various measures of liquidity  including liquidity ratios measure of liquid assets to liquid liabilities and more comprehensive liquidity studies to monitor the insurance company s liquidity at specific points in time 
rating agencies also monitor lnl s liquidity through a variety of approaches 
lnl sets target levels for each of these measures consistent with current ratings 
quarterly  lnl computes the actual rating agency measures versus targets and reviews potential action steps as needed 

table of contents the asset liability management process is more concentrated within the annuity blocks of business given market sensitive liabilities 
the retail and employer sponsored orientation of lnc s core products reduces liquidity risk as liabilities tend to be less sensitive to movements in the markets 
lnc does not manufacture or distribute institutional spread products such as guaranteed investment contracts  the direct sale of funding agreements  and the issuance of medium term notes secured by insurance company funding agreements 
capital  regulatory and dividend considerations capital considerations for lnl are impacted by factors influencing lnl s risk based capital and statutory earnings performance 
the most common measure of risk based capital rbc is the national association of insurance commissioners naic rbc formula 
the naic rbc formula requires a company to hold minimum capital against the quality and liquidity of assets  insurance risk  interest rate risk  and general business risk 
lnl currently targets a naic rbc ratio of three times the naic s defined company action level 
the company action level is the minimum level of capital required before necessitating a plan of action filed with the regulators 
lnc believes this target to be consistent with maintaining or increasing its current financial strength ratings 
lnc revisits rbc and other key financial ratio targets as the company risk profile  environmental conditions  and or rating agency views of industry risk change 
in addition  merger and acquisition activity may give rise to short term fluctuations in rbc and other key financial ratios 
at december  lnl s reported naic rbc was of company action level 
in addition  lnc s insurance subsidiaries are subject to certain insurance department regulatory restrictions as to the transfer of funds and payment of dividends to the holding company 
in general  dividends are not subject to prior approval from the indiana insurance commissioner commissioner provided lnl s statutory earned surplus is positive and such dividends do not exceed the standard limitation of the greater of of total statutory earned surplus or the amount of statutory earnings in the prior calendar year 
generally  these restrictions pose no short term liquidity concerns for the holding company 
however  as discussed in detail within note to the consolidated financial statements  the acquisition of two blocks of business in resulted in negative statutory earned surplus for lnl  which triggered certain approval requirements in order for lnl to declare and pay dividends to lnc 
as a result of negative earned surplus  lnl was required to obtain the prior approval of the commissioner before paying any dividends to lnc until its statutory earned surplus became positive 
lnl dividends lnl paid dividends of million to lnc during in the first quarter  lnl received approval from the commissioner to reclassify total dividends of million paid to lnc in from lnl s earned surplus to paid in capital 
this change plus the increase in statutory earned surplus from the indemnity reinsurance transaction with swiss re resulted in positive statutory earned surplus for lnl at december lnl dividends dividends of million were paid by lnl to lnc in the second quarter of these distributions were made in two installments 
as both installments exceeded the standard limitation noted above  a special request was made for each payment and each was approved by the commissioner 
both distributions represented a portion of the proceeds received from the indemnity reinsurance transaction with swiss re 
as a result of the payment of dividends and net statutory losses generated in  lnl s statutory earned surplus was negative at december  lnl dividends during  lnl received prior approval from the commissioner and paid dividends of million 
as occurred in  the dividends approved and paid while statutory earned surplus was negative were classified as a reduction to paid in capital 
statutory earnings for together with a reduced dividend payment  resulted in a positive earned surplus position at december  
table of contents lnl is recognized as an accredited reinsurer in the state of new york  which effectively enables it to conduct reinsurance business with unrelated insurance companies that are domiciled within the state of new york 
as a result  in addition to regulatory restrictions imposed by the state of indiana  lnl is also subject to the regulatory requirements that the state of new york imposes upon accredited reinsurers 
holding company liquidity and cash flow lnc s liquidity and cash flow position is driven principally by dividends and interest payments from subsidiaries augmented by holding company short term investments  bank lines of credit  a commercial paper program  and the ongoing availability of long term financing under a sec shelf registration 
these sources of liquidity and cash flow support the general corporate needs of the holding company including its common stock dividends  interest and debt service  funding of callable securities  securities repurchases  and acquisitions 
lnc debt financing and related activity although lnc generates adequate cash flow to meet the needs of its normal operations  periodically lnc may issue debt or equity securities to fund internal expansion  acquisitions  and the retirement of lnc s debt and equity 
in april  a shelf registration statement was declared effective by the sec 
the new shelf registration totaled billion including million of registered but unissued securities from previous registration statements 
after giving consideration to million in securities issued in through detailed below  lnc has million of remaining authorization under the shelf registration to issue various securities  including debt securities  preferred stock  common stock  warrants  stock purchase contracts and stock purchase units of lnc and trust preferred securities of four subsidiary trusts 
the net proceeds from the sale of the securities offered by this shelf registration are expected to be used by lnc for general corporate purposes  including repurchases of outstanding common stock  repayment or redemption of outstanding debt or preferred stock  the possible acquisition of financial services businesses or assets thereof  and working capital needs

lnc return of capital to shareholders one of the principal liquidity and capital requirements for lnc is providing a return to its shareholders 
through dividends and stock repurchases  lnc has an established record of providing significant cash returns to its shareholders 
the following table summarizes this activity over the most recent three years 
in millions dividends to shareholders repurchase of common stock total cash returned to shareholders number of shares repurchased average price per share lnc has established a year track record of increasing its dividend 
in determining its dividend payout  lnc balances the desire to increase dividends against capital needs  rating agency considerations  and requirements for financial flexibility 
stock repurchase and issuance activity repurchase activity the table below details lnc s share repurchase activity and the status of existing board authorizations 
repurchase activity in and reflects the decision to use a portion of the proceeds from the sale of lincoln re to swiss re for share repurchases 
lnc suspended its stock repurchase program during and focused on building capital and protecting the company s strong credit ratings after experiencing difficult capital market conditions in lnc expects to return to share repurchase in with the amount and timing dependent on trends in key capital ratios  rating agency expectations  the generation of free cash flow  and the relative attractiveness of alternative uses for the capital 
repurchase authorizations and availability in millions stock repurchase activity amount remaining authorizations may  closed november closed july august total issuance activity in lnc settled mandatory stock purchase contracts issued in conjunction with the feline prides financing 
this action resulted in the issuance of million shares of lnc stock at per share 
investors had the option of settling the purchase contract with separate cash or by having the collateral securing their purchase obligations sold 
investors who held the trust originated preferred securities toprs as collateral for the purchase contracts were permitted to enter into a remarketing process with proceeds used to settle the contracts 
the remarketing failed  resulting in the retirement of million of the toprs 
a total of million of two year toprs remained outstanding  representing investors who chose to settle with separate cash and hold onto their toprs until maturity on august the remaining million in toprs were retired august 
table of contents acquisition and divestiture activity on december   swiss re acquired lnc s reinsurance operation for billion 
in addition  lnc retained the capital supporting the reinsurance operation 
after giving affect to the increased levels of capital needed within the life insurance and lincoln retirement segments that results from the change in the ongoing mix of business under lnc s internal capital allocation models  the disposition of lnc s reinsurance operation freed up approximately million of capital 
the transaction structure involved a series of indemnity reinsurance transactions combined with the sale of certain stock companies that comprised lnc s reinsurance operation 
approximately million of the proceeds from the transaction were used to pay taxes and associated deal costs and approximately billion was used to repurchase stock  reduce debt  and support holding company cash flow needs 
lnc used million to pay the fourth quarter settlement with swiss re see the divestiture disclosure on page for details regarding the settlement with swiss re 
the remaining proceeds were dedicated to the ongoing capital needs of lnl 
holding company sources and uses of cash flow the following tables highlight significant sources and uses of cash flow at the holding company during through the tables focus on significant and recurring cash flow items and exclude the effects of certain financing activities  namely the periodic issuance and retirement of debt and cash flows related to lnc s intercompany cash management account see alternative sources of liquidity page 
taxes have been eliminated from the analysis as a tax sharing agreement is in place with lnc s primary subsidiaries resulting in a modest impact on net cash flows at the holding company 
also excluded from this analysis is the modest amount of investment income on short term investments of the holding company

the following table summarizes the primary uses of lnc cash flow 
in millions lnc debt service interest expense lnc common dividends common stock repurchase total significant trends in sources and uses of cash flow lnc cash flow is driven largely by the dividend capacity and surplus note interest payments of lnl

as risk based capital and statutory earnings improve  the insurance subsidiary s dividend capacity 
table of contents to the holding company increases 
see the discussion in the insurance company liquidity and cash flow section on lnl dividends to lnc 
in recent periods  delaware investments and lnc s uk operations have contributed significant free cash flow 
improved financial performance at delaware and lnc s decision to run off significant blocks of business in the uk are driving improved cash flow and the return of capital to the holding company 
dividend capacity lnl ended the year with statutory net gain from operations of million and a positive unassigned surplus of million 
lnl now qualifies for the ordinary dividend process with the indiana department of insurance idoi requiring only notification to the idoi of dividend payments as opposed to requiring formal approval for the dividend 
dividend capacity is largely dictated by insurance regulations in the company s state of domicile  for lnl the indiana department of insurance 
insurance companies domiciled in the state of indiana follow the so called greater of rule on statutory dividend capacity 
provided unassigned surplus is positive after giving effect for the dividend request  the cumulative total of all dividends paid in the past months cannot exceed the greater of of statutory capital and surplus lnl capital and surplus was billion at december  or statutory operating earnings for the previous year end statutory operating earnings were million for lnl 
lnl paid million in cumulative dividends for the months ended december  it is important to note that  regardless of the particular state regulations  lnc takes into account the overall health of the business  capital quality  and business and environmental risk in determining statutory dividend strategy

fitch s action did not impact lnc s commercial paper rating or the insurance financial strength ratings of lnc s insurance subsidiaries 
the move was part of industry wide action on several life insurance companies given the recent market environment and  in the case of lnc  reflects fitch s desire to maintain a traditional three notch separation between debt and insurance financial strength ratings 
the rating action had no effect on lnc s liquidity  access to capital  or cost of capital 

table of contents in september  am best lowered lnc s senior debt ratings from a to a and the trust preferred security ratings for lincoln capital iv  and v from a to bbb with both on stable outlook 
am best s action did not impact lnc s commercial paper rating or the insurance financial strength ratings of lnc s insurance subsidiaries 
the move was part of industry wide action to address the notching practices between insurance company financial strength and senior debt 
the ratings action was described as an affirmation of lincoln s ratings rather than a downgrade  as the adjustment was unrelated to lincoln s financial condition 
the rating action had no effect on lnc s liquidity  access to capital  or cost of capital 
although there are less investors for a p commercial paper and there are periods in which there is weak investor interest in a p commercial paper  through december   lnc s liquidity has not been adversely impacted by the lack of a p rating 
lnc can draw upon alternative short term borrowing facilities such as revolving bank lines of credit 
lnc bank lines and commercial paper program at december   lnc maintained three revolving credit agreements with a group of domestic and foreign banks totaling million 
lnc s commercial paper is supported by two facilities  a million three year revolving credit facility maturing in february and a million revolving credit facility maturing in december the uk facility was renewed in january for million maturing in january at december   lnc did not have any loans outstanding under any of the bank lines 
on average  lnc s commercial paper borrowing rates have increased per annum since lnc was downgraded to an a p issuer 
however  historically there have been times of greater volatility in commercial paper borrowing rates for an a p issuer with the spread above a p rates ranging from to 
during such times of greater volatility  lnc may experience difficulty in placing longer term commercial paper defined as day maturities  and as a result  experience increased short term financing costs 
as a result of increased cash flow from operations  lincoln national uk plc was able to retire its remaining outstanding commercial paper in the second quarter of and lnc eliminated the bank lines and ratings associated with this program 
bank line covenants  ratings  and liquidity under all three agreements  lnc must maintain senior unsecured long term debt ratings of at least s p a and moody s a or be restricted by an adjusted debt to capitalization ratio 
in addition  lnc must maintain a minimum level of capitalization 
lnc completes a quarterly compliance certificate for its banks computing each financial covenant 
at december  lnc was in compliance with all such covenants 
if current debt ratings and claims paying ratings were downgraded in the future  certain covenants of various contractual obligations may be triggered which could negatively impact overall liquidity 
in addition  contractual selling agreements with intermediaries could be negatively impacted which could have an adverse impact on overall sales of annuities  life insurance and investment products 
at december   lnc maintains adequate current financial strength and senior debt ratings and does not anticipate any ratings based impact to future liquidity 
guideline axxx reserves and standby letters of credit lnl is actively exploring strategies to lessen the burden of increased axxx reserves 
strategies include both reinsurance and capital markets solutions that provide for risk transfer and associated reserve and surplus relief 
of the million in outstanding letters of credit as of december   approximately million in standby letters of credit are dedicated for this purpose 
lnc and lnl are exploring alternative capital market solutions 
it is likely lnl will apply a mix of letters of credit  reinsurance  and capital market strategies in addressing long term axxx and xxx needs

proposed legislation the bush administration s budget includes various proposals  which  if enacted  could have an effect on lnc s business 
the more significant of these include the president s proposals to make permanent recent reductions in individual tax rates  to permanently repeal the estate tax  and to reintroduce the modified proposals for the lifetime savings accounts lsas and the retirement savings accounts rsas 
with the increasing focus on the projections for growing federal budget deficits  and the significant tax revenue costs associated with these particular proposals  the legislative outlook for these elements of the administration s budget is extremely uncertain 
until such time that an indication of the likely form of what may evolve from the ongoing legislative process emerges  it will not be possible for lnc to predict the potential effects of these proposals 
in the meantime  lnc continues to support reductions in the tax burden imposed on its businesses  employees and policyholders 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk exposures of financial instruments lnc analyzes and manages the risks arising from market exposures of financial instruments  as well as other risks  in an integrated asset liability management process that takes diversification into account 
by aggregating the potential effect of market and other risks of the entire enterprise  lnc estimates  reviews and in some cases manages the risk to its earnings and shareholder value 
lnc has exposures to several market risks including interest rate  default risk  foreign currency exchange  liquidity and equity price risks 
the exposures of financial instruments to market risks  and the related risk management processes  are most important in the lincoln retirement and life insurance segments 
it is within these segments where most of the invested assets support accumulation and investment oriented insurance products 
as an important element of its integrated asset liability management process  lnc uses derivatives to minimize the effects of changes in interest levels and the shape of the yield curve 
in this context  derivatives are designated as a hedge and serve to reduce interest rate risk by mitigating the effect of significant increases in interest rates on lnc s earnings 
additional market exposures exist in lnc s other general account insurance products and in its debt structure and derivatives positions 
the primary sources of market risk are substantial  relatively rapid and sustained increases or decreases in interest rates  fluctuations in currency exchange rates or a sharp drop in equity market values 
each of these market risks are discussed in detail in the following pages 
interest rate risk accumulation and investment oriented insurance products 
general account assets supporting accumulation and investment oriented insurance products total billion or and billion or of total invested assets at december  and  respectively 
with respect to these products  lnc seeks to earn a stable and profitable spread between investment income and interest credited to account values 
if lnc has adverse experience on investments that cannot be passed onto customers  its spreads are reduced 
alternatively  lnc may seek to maintain spreads and this may result in crediting rates that are not competitive in the market place 
this strategy could result in adverse surrender experience on policies and could force lnc to liquidate a portion of its portfolio to fund cash surrender value benefits 
provided interest rates continue to gradually return to levels that are more typical from a long term perspective  lnc does not view the near term risk to spreads over the next twelve months to be material 
the combination of a probable range of interest rate changes over the next twelve months  asset liability management strategies  flexibility in adjusting policy crediting rate levels and protection afforded by policy surrender charges and other switching costs all work together to mitigate this risk 
the interest rate scenarios of concern are those in which there is a substantial  relatively rapid increase or decrease in interest rates that is then sustained over a long period 
fixed deferred annuities 
assets of billion and billion at december  and  respectively  support the largest category of accumulation and investment oriented insurance products  fixed deferred annuities 
for these products  lnc may adjust renewal crediting rates monthly or quarterly  subject to guaranteed minimums ranging from to 
the higher minimums apply to in force blocks of older products that no longer are sold 
annuity insurance customers have the right to surrender their policies at account value less a surrender charge that grades to zero over periods ranging from to years from policy issue date or  in some cases  the date of each premium received 
in some cases  a market value adjustment may also apply 
due to lnc s ability to change crediting rates to reflect investment experience on the majority of its traditional annuity products  the underlying assets are assumed to be a good proxy for the interest rate risk inherent in these liabilities 
this assumption is appropriate for probable movements in interest rates over the next months 
this assumption may not be appropriate for a substantial  relatively rapid increase or decrease in interest rates that is then sustained over a long period 

table of contents universal life and interest sensitive whole life 
lnc had billion and billion in assets at december  and  respectively  supporting universal life and interest sensitive whole life insurance on which it has the right to adjust renewal crediting rates 
the credited rates are subject to guaranteed minimums ranging from to for universal life and to for interest sensitive whole life at december  at december   of these assets support universal life insurance products 
similar to annuities  universal life insurance customers have the right to surrender their policies at account value less a surrender charge that grades to zero over periods ranging from to years from policy issue date or  in some cases  the date of each premium received 
group pension annuities and guaranteed interest contracts 
lnc had assets totaling billion at december  and that support guaranteed interest contracts  group pension immediate and deferred annuities 
generally  the cash flows expected on these liabilities do not vary with fluctuations in market interest rates and are not adjustable by lnc 
accordingly  if experience on the assets supporting these products is more adverse than the assumptions used in pricing the products  spreads will tend to be below expectations 
lnc limits exposure to interest rate risk by managing the duration and maturity structure of each investment portfolio in relation to the liabilities it supports 
guaranteed investment contracts supported by these assets were approximately million at december  other general account insurance products 
lnc had billion and billion of assets at december  and  respectively  supporting general account products  including term life insurance 
for these products  the liability cash flows may have actuarial uncertainty 
however  their amounts and timing do not vary significantly with interest rates 
lnc limits interest rate risk by analyzing the expected cash flows of the products and structuring investment portfolios with similar cash flows 
interest rate risk falling rates 
interest rates have generally been declining in recent years 
for instance  the five year treasury yield stood at at the end of  declined to at the end of  declined to at the end of  declined to at the end of and then rose slightly to at the end of should interest rates remain at levels that are significantly lower than those existing prior to the declines of recent years  the average earned rate of return on lnc s annuity and universal life insurance investment portfolios will continue to decline 
relative to the book yield at december   the book yield at december  on annuity investment portfolios declined from to  while the book yield on universal life insurance portfolios declined from to 
declining portfolio yields may cause the spreads between investment portfolio yields and the interest rate credited to policyholders to deteriorate  as lnc s ability to manage spreads can become limited by minimum guaranteed rates on annuity and universal life insurance policies 
minimum guaranteed rates on annuity and universal life insurance policies generally range from to  with an average guaranteed rate of approximately 
the following table provides detail on the percentage differences between the current interest rates being credited to policyholders and the respective minimum guaranteed policy rate  broken out by policyholder account values reported within the retirement and life segments at december

the maturity structure and call provisions of the related portfolios are structured to afford protection against erosion of investment portfolio yields during periods of declining interest rates 
lnc devotes extensive effort to evaluating the risks associated with falling interest rates by simulating asset and liability cash flows for a wide range of interest rate scenarios 
lnc seeks to manage these exposures by maintaining a suitable maturity structure and by limiting its exposure to call risk in each respective investment portfolio 
lnc believes that the portfolios supporting its accumulation and investment oriented insurance products have a prudent degree of call protection individually and on a consolidated basis 
for instance  as of december   the mortgage backed securities mbs and asset backed securities abs portion represented a total of billion or of the billion of general account assets supporting such products 
of this portfolio  of general account assets or billion is subject to residential prepayment risk from investments made in collateralized mortgage obligations cmos  mortgage pass throughs  manufactured housing and home equity loans 
as of december   the mbs and abs portion of the portfolio represented a total of billion or of the billion of general account assets supporting such products 
lnc s mbs portfolio has equal to or slightly less prepayment risk than the mbs pass through market in general primarily due to holding more seasoned securities in the portfolio 

table of contents interest rate risk rising rates 
for both annuities and universal life insurance  a rapid and sustained rise in interest rates poses risks of deteriorating spreads and high surrenders 
the portfolios supporting these products have fixed rate assets laddered over maturities generally ranging from one to ten years or more 
accordingly  the earned rate on each portfolio lags behind changes in market yields 
as rates rise  the lag may be increased by slowing mbs prepayments 
the greater and faster the rise in interest rates  the more the earned rate will tend to lag behind market rates 
if lnc sets renewal crediting rates to earn the desired spread  the gap between its renewal crediting rates and competitors new money rates may be wide enough to cause increased surrenders 
if lnc credits more competitive renewal rates to limit surrenders  its spreads will narrow 
lnc devotes extensive effort to evaluating these risks by simulating asset and liability cash flows for a wide range of interest rate scenarios 
such analysis has led to adjustments in the target maturity structure and to hedging the risk of rising rates by buying out of the money interest rate cap agreements and swaptions see discussion below 
with these instruments in place  the potential adverse impact of a rapid and sustained rise in rates is kept within corporate risk tolerances 
debt 
as of december   lnc had short term debt  long term debt and junior subordinated debentures issued to affiliated trusts totaling billion billion with fixed rates and billion with floating rates on the balance sheet 
as of december   lnc had short term debt  long term debt and junior subordinated debentures issued to affiliated trusts totaling billion billion with fixed rates and billion with floating rates on the balance sheet 
lnc manages the timing of maturities and the mixture of fixed rate and floating rate debt as part of the process of integrated management of interest rate risk for the entire enterprise 
derivatives 
as indicated in note to the consolidated financial statements  lnc has entered into derivative transactions to reduce its exposure to rapid rises in interest rates 
the five programs discussed below are used to help lnc achieve more stable margins while providing competitive crediting rates to policyholders during periods when interest rates are rising 
failure to maintain competitive crediting rates could cause policyholders to withdraw their funds and place them in more competitive products 
lnc uses interest rate cap agreements to hedge against the negative impact of a significant and sustained rise in interest rates 
interest rate caps are contracts that require counterparties to pay lnc at specified future dates the amount  if any  by which a specified market interest rate exceeds the cap rate stated in the agreements  applied to a notional amount 
as of december  and  lnc had agreements with notional amounts of billion and billion  respectively 
at december   the agreements had cap rates ranging from to basis points above prevailing interest rates 
the cap rates in some contracts increase over time 
these agreements expire in through lnc also uses swaptions to hedge against the negative impact of a significant and sustained rise in interest rates 
swaptions are options to enter into a swap at a specified future date 
if the option is exercised at expiration  the option is either settled in cash or exercised into a swap agreement 
lnc purchases swaptions to be settled in cash 
at expiration  the counterparty is required to pay lnc the amount  if any  of the present value of the difference between the fixed rate on a market rate swap and the strike rate stated in the agreement  applied to a notional amount 
as of december   lnc had agreements outstanding with notional amounts of billion 
there were no swaptions outstanding at december  for future periods  the fair value of lnc s interest rate caps and swaptions depends on the levels of future us treasury and us dollar swap interest rates 
the table below shows estimates of fair value levels for the cap and swaption portfolio at december  for future time periods and selected potential future interest rate levels

table of contents lnc uses interest rate swap agreements to hedge its exposure to floating rate bond coupon payments  replicating a fixed rate bond 
an interest rate swap is a contractual agreement to exchange payments at one or more times based on the actual or expected price level  performance or value of one or more underlying interest rates 
lnc is required to pay the counterparty the stream of variable interest payments based on the coupon payments from the hedged bonds  and in turn  receives a fixed payment from the counterparty  at a predetermined interest rate 
in addition  lnc uses interest rate swap agreements to hedge its exposure to interest rate fluctuations related to the forecasted purchase of assets to support newly acquired blocks of business or certain other portfolios of assets 
finally  lnc uses interest rate swap agreements to hedge the risk of paying a higher fixed rate interest on junior subordinated debentures issued to affiliated trusts holding solely junior subordinated debentures and on senior debt than can be paid on long term debt based on current interest rates in the marketplace 
as of december  and  lnc had swap agreements with a notional amount of million and million  respectively 
the agreements expire in through lnc used a treasury lock agreement to hedge its exposure to variability in future semi annual interest payments  attributable to changes in the benchmark interest rate  related to the issuance of its year million senior debt in december and its year million senior debt in a treasury lock is an agreement that allows the holder to lock in a benchmark interest rate  so that if the benchmark interest rate increases  the holder is entitled to receive a payment from the counterparty equal to the present value of the difference in the benchmark interest rate at the determination date and the locked in benchmark interest rate 
if the benchmark interest rate decreases  the holder must pay the counterparty an amount equal to the present value of the difference in the benchmark interest rate at the determination date and the locked in benchmark interest rate 
as of december   lnc did not have any open treasury locks 
in addition to continuing existing programs  lnc may use derivative products in other strategies to limit risk and enhance returns  particularly in the management of investment spread businesses 
lnc has established policies  guidelines and internal control procedures for the use of derivatives as tools to enhance management of the overall portfolio of risks assumed in lnc s operations 
annually  lnc s board of directors reviews lnc s derivatives policy

table of contents foreign currency forward contracts 
lnc uses foreign currency forward contracts to hedge some of the foreign exchange risk related to its investments in fixed maturity securities denominated in foreign currencies 
lnc typically engages in short term currency forward contracts of less than six months and actively monitors currency markets in determining those currencies to hedge  the duration of the hedge and the nominal amount to hedge 
a foreign currency forward contract obligates lnc to deliver a specified amount of currency at a future date at a specified exchange rate 
the value of the foreign exchange forward contracts at any given point fluctuates according to the underlying level of exchange rate and interest rate differentials 
during  lnc entered into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge its net investment in lincoln uk 
at december   the total notional and fair value for these contracts was million and million  respectively 
these contracts expire in foreign currency swaps 
a foreign currency swap is a contractual agreement to exchange the currencies of two different countries at a specified rate of exchange in the future 
lnc uses foreign currency swaps to convert the cash flow of foreign currency securities to us dollars 
equity market exposures lnc s revenues  assets  liabilities and derivatives are exposed to equity market risk 
refer to the section captioned first quarter guidance for the estimated effect of equity market volatility for additional discussion of equity market risk 
fee revenues 
the fee revenues of lnc s investment management segment and fees earned from variable annuities and variable life insurance products are exposed to the risk of a decline in equity market values 
these fees are generally a fixed percentage of the market value of assets under management 
in a severe equity market decline  fee income could be reduced by not only reduced market valuations but also by customer withdrawals and redemptions 
such withdrawals and redemptions from equity funds and accounts might be partially offset by transfers to lnc s fixed income accounts and the transfer of funds to lnc from its competitors customers 
assets 
while lnc invests in equity assets with the expectation of achieving higher returns than would be available in its core fixed income investments  the returns on  and values of  these equity investments are subject to somewhat greater market risk than its fixed income investments 
these investments  however  add diversification benefits to lnc s fixed income investments

this program is being hedged with equity derivatives as discussed below 

table of contents derivatives hedging equity risks 
lnc uses otc equity call options on lnc stock to hedge against the increase in its liabilities arising from stock appreciation rights granted on lnc stock in through these call options require the counterparty to pay lnc at specified future expiration dates the amount  if any  of the increase in lnc s stock price over the strike price of the option  applied to the number of contracts 
lnc had million and million call options on an equal number of shares of lnc stock at december  and  respectively 
the call options expirations are matched to the liabilities and expire in through default risk 
lnc s portfolio of invested assets was billion as of december  of this total  billion consists of corporate bonds and billion consists of commercial mortgages 
lnc manages the risk of adverse default experience on these investments by applying disciplined credit evaluation and underwriting standards  prudently limiting allocations to lower quality  higher yielding investments  and diversifying exposures by issuer  industry  region and property type 
for each counterparty or borrowing entity and its affiliates  lnc s exposures from all transactions are aggregated and managed in relation to formal limits set by rating quality and industry group 
lnc remains exposed to occasional adverse cyclical economic downturns during which default rates may be significantly higher than the long term historical average used in pricing 
as of december   lnc had a portfolio of invested assets of billion 
lnc is depending on the ability of derivative product dealers and their guarantors to honor their obligations to pay the contract amounts under various derivatives agreements 
in order to minimize the risk of default losses  lnc diversifies its exposures among several dealers and limits the amount of exposure to each in accordance with the credit rating of each dealer or its guarantor 
lnc generally limits its selection of counterparties that are obligated under these derivative contracts to those with an a credit rating or above 
credit related derivatives 
lnc uses various credit related derivatives to minimize exposure to various credit related risks 
lnc uses credit default swaps to hedge against a drop in bond prices due to credit concerns of certain bond issuers 
a credit swap allows lnc to put the bond back to the counterparty at par upon a credit event by the bond issuer 
a credit event is defined as bankruptcy  failure to pay  or obligation acceleration 
as of december  and  lnc had credit swaps with a notional amount of million and million  respectively 
the credit swaps expire in other credit related derivatives used periodically by lnc include spread lock agreements to hedge a portion of the value of its fixed maturity investments against the risk of widening in the spreads between their yields and the yields of comparable maturity us or other government obligations  put options  combined with various perpetual fixed income securities and interest rate swaps to replicate fixed income  fixed maturity investments  and total return swaps to hedge its exposure to interest rate and spread risk resulting from the forecasted sale of assets in a securitization of certain lnc mortgage loans 
as of december   lnc did not have any open amounts for these derivatives 
ratings based termination events 
lnc and lnl are required to maintain minimum ratings as a matter of routine practice in negotiating isda agreements 
under the majority of isda agreements and as a matter of policy  lnl has agreed to maintain financial strength or claims paying ratings above s p bbb and moody s baa a downgrade below these levels would result in termination of the derivatives contract at which time any amounts payable by lnc would be dependent on the market value of the underlying derivative contract 
in certain transactions  lnc and the counterparty have entered into a collateral support agreement requiring lnc to post collateral upon significant downgrade 
lnc is required to maintain long term senior debt ratings above s p bbb and moody s baa lnc also requires for its own protection minimum rating standards for counterparty credit protection 
lnl is required to maintain financial strength or claims paying ratings above s p a and moody s a under certain isda agreements  which collectively do not represent material notional exposure 
lnc does not believe the inclusion of termination or collateralization events poses any material threat to its liquidity position
