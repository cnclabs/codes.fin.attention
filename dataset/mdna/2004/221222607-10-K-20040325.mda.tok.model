item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we develop  market and sell a communications platform that we refer to as our ip service delivery platform 
our product is designed to enable network service providers to rapidly deliver a portfolio of communication services to business and consumer customers 
we market our ip service delivery platform through our direct sales force and through resellers to network service providers in asia  europe and north america 
we provide customer service and support for our products directly and through support partners 
the market for our ip service delivery platform is still in the early stages of development  and the volume and timing of orders are difficult to predict 
a customer s decision to purchase our platform typically involves a significant commitment of its resources and a lengthy evaluation  testing and product qualification process 
the long sales cycles and the timing of our customers rollout of services made possible by our platform  which affects repeat business  may cause our revenue and operating results to vary significantly and unexpectedly from quarter to quarter 
while we believe that the market for network based ip services will continue to grow and represents a significant opportunity  we have not generated sufficient revenue to fund our operations 
we believe that we have a technically strong product that can deliver ip services at a lower cost than competing products 
however  we must increase our revenue in the short term in order to reduce our cash consumption and remain a viable and competitive supplier 

table of contents management s overview of the company s position is discussed in more detail in the outlook section on page and the liquidity section on page critical accounting policies and estimates general our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory valuation  long lived assets  warranties and equity issuances 
additionally  the audit committee of our board of directors reviews these critical accounting estimates at least annually 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates form the basis for certain judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
the following accounting policies are significantly affected by the judgments and estimates we use in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition most of our sales are generated from complex arrangements 
recognizing revenue in these arrangements requires our making significant judgments  particularly in the areas of customer acceptance and collectibility 
certain of our sales arrangements require formal acceptance by our customers 
in such cases  we do not recognize revenue until we have received formal notification of acceptance 
although we work closely with our customers to help them achieve satisfaction with our products prior to and after acceptance  the timing of customer acceptance can greatly affect the timing of our revenue 
while the end user of our product is normally a large network service provider  we also sell product and services through small resellers and to small network service providers in asia  europe and north america 
to recognize revenue before we receive payment  we are required to assess that collection from the customer is probable 
if we cannot satisfy ourselves that collection is probable  we defer revenue recognition until we have collected payment 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts in connection with estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to pay our invoices 
in order to estimate the appropriate level of this allowance  we analyze historical bad debts  customer concentrations  current customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment patterns 
in future periods  if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate and affect their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventory valuation in assessing the value of our inventory  we are required to make judgments about future demand and then compare that demand with current inventory quantities and firm purchase commitments 
if our inventories and firm purchase commitments are in excess of forecasted demand  we write down the value of our inventory 
we generally use a month forecast to assess future demand 
inventory write downs are charged to cost of sales 
during  we charged million of inventory write downs and million of excess purchase commitments to cost of sales primarily as the result of reduced forecasted demand for certain of our components and we sold million of previously written down inventory 
if actual demand for our products is less than our forecasts  additional inventory write downs may be required 

table of contents long lived assets we evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets  consisting primarily of property  plant and equipment  whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
in assessing the recoverability of long lived assets  we compare the carrying value to the undiscounted future cash flows the assets are expected to generate 
if the total of the undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the assets  the assets will be written down to their estimated fair value 
fair value is generally determined by calculating the discounted future cash flows using a discount rate based on our weighted average cost of capital or specific appraisal  as appropriate 
significant judgments and assumptions are required in the forecast of future operating results used in the preparation of the estimated future cash flows  including long term forecasts of overall market conditions and our participation in the market 
changes in these estimates could have a material adverse effect on the assessment of the long lived assets such that we may be required to record further asset write downs in the future 
we had no impairment charges in or during  we charged million to operating expenses as a result of impairments 
warranties we provide a basic limited warranty  including repair or replacement of parts  and technical support 
the specific terms and conditions of those warranties vary depending on the customer or region in which we do business 
we estimate the costs that may be incurred under our basic limited warranty and record a liability in the amount of such costs at the time product revenue is recognized 
our warranty obligation is affected by the number of installed units  product failure rates  materials usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting product failures 
each quarter  we assess the adequacy of our recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary 
in future periods  if actual product failure rates  materials usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  adjustments to cost of sales may result 
impact of equity issuances on operating results equity issuances have a material impact on our operating results 
the equity issuances that have affected operating results to date include warrants granted to customers and suppliers  stock options granted to employees and consultants  stock issued in lieu of cash compensation to suppliers and re priced stock options 
our revenue in was affected significantly by warrants issued to our first three customers  qwest communications international  inc  aduronet limited and broadband office  inc these warrants were issued upon receipt of substantial purchase orders in which were preceded by a period of cooperation with us in the marketing  development and refinement of our products 
our revenue from these customers consisted of receipts from sales  including equity issued in connection with sales  less receipts for equity issued in connection with sales 
as of december   the value of the warrants granted to these customers was fully amortized and as a result  our revenue in and was not affected by the value of warrants granted to customers 
our cost of goods sold  operating expenses and interest expense were also affected significantly in by charges related to warrants and options issued for services 
furthermore  some of our employee stock option transactions have resulted in deferred compensation  which is presented as a reduction of stockholders equity on our balance sheet and is amortized over the vesting period of the applicable options using the graded vesting method 
the deferred compensation and amortization associated with shares and options relating to the following transactions is required to be re measured at the end of each accounting period  based on the current stock price 
the re measurement at the end of each accounting period will result in unpredictable charges or credits in future periods  depending on future fluctuations in the market prices of our common stock non recourse promissory notes receivable during the fourth quarter of  we converted full recourse promissory notes received from employees upon the early exercise of unvested employee stock options to non recourse obligations 
accordingly  we are required to re measure the compensation associated with these shares until the earlier of repayment of the note or default 
deferred compensa 
table of contents tion expense  which is recorded at each re measurement  is amortized over the remaining vesting period of the underlying options 
re priced stock options in november  we re priced  outstanding employee stock options to purchase shares of our common stock with original exercise prices ranging from per share to per share 
these options were re priced to per share  which was higher than the fair market value of the underlying shares on the re pricing date 
in july  we re priced  unexercised employee stock options to per share  the fair market value of the underlying shares on the re pricing date 
these options had previously been granted at prices ranging from to per share 
compensation will be re measured for these options until they are exercised  canceled  or expire 
at december    stock options re priced in november were still outstanding 
some of the stock options granted to our employees have resulted in deferred compensation as a result of stock options having an exercise price below their estimated fair value 
deferred compensation is presented as a reduction to stockholders equity on the balance sheet and is then amortized using an accelerated method over the vesting period of the applicable options 
when an employee terminates  an expense credit is recorded for any amortization that has been previously recorded as an expense in excess of vesting 
results of operations for the years ended december   and  we reported basic and diluted net losses per share of  and  respectively 
charges related to equity issuances to customers  suppliers  employees and consultants increased net loss per share by for the year ended december   decreased net loss per share by for the year ended december  and increased net loss per share by for the year ended december  all per share amounts have been restated to reflect our for reverse stock split  effected in september revenue the majority of our revenue is recognized from the sale of our ip service delivery platform and subsequent service support arrangements 
we recognize product revenue at the time of shipment  assuming that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection is probable  unless we have future obligations for installation or require customer acceptance  in which case revenue is deferred until these obligations are met 
our product incorporates software that is not incidental to the related hardware and  accordingly  we recognize revenue in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants issued statement of position software revenue recognition 
for arrangements that include the delivery of multiple elements  the revenue is allocated to the various products based on vendor specific objective evidence of fair value vsoe 
we establish vsoe based on either the price charged for the product when the same product is sold separately or for products not yet sold separately  based on the list prices of such products individually established by management with the relevant authority to do so 
revenue from perpetual software licenses is recognized upon shipment or acceptance  if required 
revenue from one year term licenses is recognized on a straight line basis over the one year license term 
post delivery technical support  such as on site service  phone support  parts and access to software upgrades  when and if available  is provided under separate support services agreements 
in cases where the support services are sold as part of an arrangement including multiple elements  we allocate revenue to the support service based on the vsoe of the service and recognize it on a straight line basis over the service period 
revenue from consulting and training services is recognized as the services are provided 
amounts billed in excess of revenue recognized are included as deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 

table of contents revenue from customers by geographic region for the years ended december   and was as follows  in thousands united states asia pacific europe total revenue hardware  software and service revenue for the years ended december   and was as follows  in thousands hardware software services receipts from sales  including equity issued in in connection with purchase orders less receipts for equity issued in in connection with purchase orders total revenue in  unit shipments declined 
the decline reflects sales to fewer customers  as we have focused our sales efforts on certain large service providers 
the decline also reflects lower sales to existing customers  due in part to the timing of their expansion plans 
partially offsetting this decline  our average selling price improved in as compared to due to a favorable product and regional mix 
software revenue declined million due to fewer new customers 
we generally sell our primary software product  invision  in our initial sale to new customers 
because the market for network based ip services is in the early stages of development  service provider demand for our products may fluctuate until service providers are able to further develop enterprise demand for such services and accelerate revenue growth from the sale of such services 
see outlook section on page and risk factors section on pages to we issued no warrants to customers during the years ended december   and at december   and  there were no unamortized non cash charges related to warrants issued to customers

cost of goods sold cost of goods sold includes all costs of producing our sold products  including the costs of outsourced manufacturing  software royalties  shipping  warranties  related manufacturing overhead costs and the costs of providing our service offerings  including personnel engaged in providing maintenance and consulting services to our customers 
to the extent that the value of inventory is written down  this will be reflected in cost of goods sold 
we have also incurred non cash charges and credits related to equity issuances 
we have outsourced the majority of our manufacturing and repair operations 
a significant portion of our cost of goods sold consists of payments to our contract manufacturers 
we conduct manufacturing engineering  final assembly  configuration testing and documentation control at our facilities in redwood city  california 
for the year ended december   cost of goods sold was million  of which million or represented materials  labor  production overhead and warranties  million or represented software royalties  million or represented reductions in overhead absorption rate for raw materials and semi finished goods  million or represented inventory write downs  million or represented non cash charges related to equity issuances and million or represented the sale of previously written down inventory

gross profit for the years ended december   and  gross profit was million  or of revenue  million  or of revenue and million  or of revenue  respectively 

table of contents the twelve percentage point improvement in gross margin for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was primarily the result of a ten percentage point reduction in materials  labor and product overhead costs as a percentage of sales 
a lower provision for inventory write downs additionally improved gross margin by five percentage points 
the improvements were partially offset by a reduction in the inventory overhead rate on raw materials and semi finished goods  which accounted for a three percentage point reduction in gross margin 
primarily accounting for the reduction in materials  labor and overhead cost as a percentage of sales were an increase in average selling price due to the regional mix of sales  more favorable product configurations and reductions in maintenance contract support costs due to headcount and overhead reductions 
we expect our gross margin to be primarily affected by regional product mix and configurations  the volume of product sold and pricing pressures  the amount of excess inventory reserve charges and the amount of written down inventory sold 
the mix of products that our customers purchase is unpredictable and  because of lead times required to buy certain components and the timing of our customers orders  we purchase inventory based on forecasted demand 
the amount of excess inventory purchase commitments and excess inventory charges related to on hand inventory is dependent on us purchasing the correct mix of inventory 
in addition  if our unit sales volumes are significantly lower than forecasted demand  excess inventory charges will result 
research and development expenses research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel costs  fees paid to contractors and outside service providers  and the costs of laboratory equipment and prototypes related to the design  development and testing of our products 
we have also incurred non cash charges and credits related to equity issuances 
we expense our research and development costs as they are incurred 
several components of our research and development effort require significant expenditures  the timing of which can cause significant quarterly variability in our expenses 
the number of prototypes required to build and test a complex product such as the ip service delivery platform is large  and this building and testing process occurs over a short period of time 
research and development expenses were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
research and development expense decreased million or in the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  this resulted partly from a million reduction in salary and employee related expenses reflecting a full year of lower headcount in following our may and october restructurings 
depreciation expense was million lower due to the reduced carrying value of assets resulting from impairment charges recorded in the second and third quarters of see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details

table of contents sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel engaged in sales  marketing and customer evaluations  as well as the costs associated with customer evaluations and trials and other promotional and marketing expenses 
we devote substantial sales and marketing resources to customer evaluations and trials 
the complexity of our ip service delivery platform and the networks in which it is installed and integrated may often require extensive evaluation periods and trials 
these trials are conducted by our customers at customer designated locations or within our sales laboratories and require support from our highly trained systems engineers and service and support personnel 
these evaluations and trials generally take approximately three to months 
we anticipate that customer evaluations and trials will continue to require a substantial amount of our sales and marketing resources 
we have also incurred non cash charges related to equity issuances 
since april of  we have had several restructurings in order to reduce our operating expenses 
these restructurings involved significant reductions in our workforce  including our sales and marketing group 
we will attempt to partially offset the effect of these reductions by establishing relationships with resellers in selected markets 
sales and marketing expenses were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively

facilities and information technology infrastructure expense declined by million as a result of reductions in personnel  square footage occupied and sales office rents 
travel expense declined million due to cost saving measures and associated reductions in headcount 
marketing spending on events and market development declined million due to attending fewer tradeshows and cost saving measures 
partially offsetting those savings  non cash charges related to equity issuances increased million due to credits for the reversal of amortization of deferred compensation expense in excess of vesting in for employees who were terminated during that year 
absorption to cost of goods sold of spending to support maintenance contracts and warranty declined million 
such support costs are initially charged to sales and marketing expense and subsequently reclassified to either cost of sales or the provision for warranty claims based on associated activity such as product return levels and technical support case data 
due primarily to a smaller customer installed base  activity associated with maintenance and warranty was less than in the prior year 
sales and marketing expense decreased million or in the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  this resulted partly from a million decrease in non cash charges related to equity issuances due to the reversal of amortization of deferred compensation in excess of vesting for employees who were terminated and our use of an accelerated amortization method for employee stock compensation  which results in lower charges in each subsequent period

 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
based on an undiscounted cash flow analysis  the cash flows expected to be generated by our long lived assets during their estimated remaining useful lives were not sufficient to recover the net book value of the assets 
consequently  we obtained a valuation report outlining the estimated fair value of the assets  based on quoted market prices  from an independent appraiser and recorded an impairment charge of  to write down the carrying value of our long lived assets held for use to their fair values in the second and third quarters of in addition  property and equipment that was idled or abandoned was written down by approximately  to its estimated net realizable value

interest expense for the year ended december   interest expense was million  a decrease of million when compared with the year ended december  for the year ended december   interest expense was million  a decrease of million when compared with the year ended december  the year over year decreases reflect reduced equipment loans and capital leases 
income tax provision provisions for income taxes of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  were comprised entirely of foreign corporate income taxes  which are a function of our operations in subsidiaries in various countries 
the provision for income taxes is based on income taxes on minimum profits the foreign operations generated for services they provided to us 
our tax expense for fiscal will continue to depend on the amount and mix of income derived from sources subject to corporate income taxes of foreign taxing jurisdictions 
we have not recognized any benefit from the future use of net operating loss carryforwards for these periods  or for any other periods  since our incorporation 
we are not recognizing the potential tax benefits of our net operating loss carryforwards because we do not have sufficient evidence that we will generate adequate profits to use them 
use of the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code of  and similar state provisions 
the annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards before utilization 
liquidity and capital resources currently  we are not generating sufficient revenue to fund our operations 
we expect our operating losses and net operating cash outflows to continue unless we are able to significantly increase our revenues  reduce our operating expenses or both 
in april and september  may and october and  to a lesser extent  in march and may  we announced that we had adopted business plans to reduce our operating expenses to reflect current and expected business conditions 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to decrease our operating expenses significantly below current levels and still remain a viable and competitive supplier 
based on our rate of quarterly cash consumption in of approximately million which excludes million paid to settle a lease obligation related to facilities we exited in redwood city  california  we believe that we possess sufficient liquidity and capital resources to fund our operations and working capital requirements for at least the next months 
however  because of our history of losses and use of cash in operations  certain of our existing and prospective customers may have concerns regarding our long term financial viability and our ability to support their businesses  and as a result may choose to purchase equipment from other larger and more established suppliers 
see risk factors on pages prior to our initial public offering in september  we financed our operations primarily through sales of convertible preferred stock for net proceeds of million  plus equipment and working capital loans and 
table of contents capital leases 
upon the closing of our initial public offering on september   we received cash proceeds  net of underwriters discount and offering expenses  totaling million  and all of our convertible preferred stock was converted into million shares of common stock 
we may seek to raise additional funds through debt or equity financing or from other sources 
there can be no assurances that additional funding will be available at all  or that if available  such financing will be obtainable on terms favorable to us 
cash  cash equivalents and short term investments at december   cash  cash equivalents and short term investments were million 
this compares with million at december  operating activities we used million in cash for operations for the year ended december   a decrease of million from the amount used in our million decrease in net loss was partially offset by an increase in accrued expenses  a less favorable decrease in accounts receivable and lower non cash expenses in compared to items primarily contributing to the increase in accrued expense and lower non cash charges include the following accrued other liabilities declined million  primarily as a result of paying down million of restructuring expenses accrued in the the net loss for the year ended december  included a non cash write down of million for the impairment of fixed assets 
depreciation expense declined million due to the reduced carrying value of property and equipment resulting from impairment charges recorded in the second and third quarters of and some property and equipment becoming fully depreciated 
we used million in cash for operations for the year ended december   a decrease of million from the amount used in the decrease in use of cash in was primarily the result of an improvement in working capital and a lower net loss 
the working capital improvement was primarily due to reductions in accounts receivable  inventory and deferred revenue 
investing activities for the year ended december   investing activities provided million in cash  an increase of million over the increase in cash provided in was the result of an increase in proceeds from the sales and maturities of short term investments compared over investment purchases 
for the year ended december   we used million in cash for investing activities  a decrease of million over the decrease in cash provided in represents a reduction in proceeds from the sales and maturities of short term investments partially offset by a reduction in capital expenditures 
financing activities for the year ended december   we used million in cash from financing activities  or million less than the reduction in cash used was primarily the result of lower principal payments on working capital loans and leases and higher proceeds from stock option exercises 
for the year ended december   we used million in cash from financing activities  an increase of million from the increase in cash used resulted from reduced proceeds from issuances of common stock 

table of contents contractual obligations our contractual obligations as of december  are as follows in thousands due in due in due in due total and and thereafter equipment and working capital loans operating lease obligations raw material components accrued severance related restructuring charges royalty obligations total outlook fourth quarter revenue of million marked a disappointing end to a challenging year 
while our cost management and cash flow improvement actions yielded improvements from to  we must drive significant  near term revenue growth 
although capital spending in the telecommunications industry has begun to recover  the market for network based ip services has continued to develop slowly 
we see evidence that a number of major carriers will move to a network based approach to ip services delivery 
this trend is reflected in the expansion plans of our existing customers  as well as those of prospective customers 
our research and interaction with our carrier customers indicates that enterprise customers large and small are increasingly demanding low cost  secure  communications capabilities  along with value added ip services such as ip sec and mpls vpn  firewall and dos shield 
carriers  at the same time  are looking for ways to provide and scale such capabilities to serve hundreds or thousands of geographically dispersed users in a profitable manner 
we believe that we have a strong  differentiated product that can deliver network based ip services at a lower cost than the competitive alternatives 
while we believe that the market for network based ip services represents a significant opportunity  we recognize the need to increase revenues and decrease cash consumption in the short term 
as of the filing date of this report  we believe that we cannot make further significant reductions in our operating expenses  and at the same time continue to win new business  support our existing customers and continue with the research and development necessary to compete effectively in our market 
therefore  we must achieve revenue growth in the near term by winning repeat business as our customers seek to expand their network based ip service offerings and capturing new customers as they begin to enter this market 
however  there can be no assurance that we will succeed in meeting these objectives 
our ability to achieve such revenue growth will depend  in part  on the rate of growth in enterprise adoption of the network based ip services delivery model 
our ability to pursue new customers is constrained by the relatively small size of our sales force and the long sales cycle involved in the purchase of our products 
accordingly  the establishment of strategic reseller relationships is an important part of our strategy for by establishing these relationships  we can leverage the sales and support capabilities of these partners and thereby expand our potential market 
in addition  we have evaluated a variety of different business scenarios and possible means for facilitating cosine s long term success 
we have explored  and will continue to explore  oem relationships  strategic partner relationships  mergers and acquisitions as possible ways to facilitate cosine s long term success and build shareholder value  and we use industry and financial experts to assist us in seeking and evaluating such opportunities 
recent accounting pronouncements in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities 
under that interpretation  certain entities known as variable interest entities vies must be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity 
the primary beneficiary is generally defined as having the majority of the risks and rewards arising from the vie 
for vies in which a significant but not majority variable interest is held  certain disclosures are required 
we have not entered 
table of contents into any arrangements or made any investments which qualify as a vie in the period after january  and therefore the initial implementation of fin had no impact on our financial statements 
for vies acquired before february   we are required to apply the accounting and disclosure rules set forth in fin in the first quarter of we have determined that the adoption of fin will not have any impact on our financial statements 
in december  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition 
sab revises or rescinds portions of the interpretive guidance included in topic of the codification of staff accounting bulletins in order to make this interpretive guidance consistent with current authoritative accounting and auditing guidance and sec rules and regulations 
the adoption of sab did not have a material effect on our financial statements for the period ending december  risk factors this report including the outlook section above contains forward looking statements 
we use words such as anticipate  believe  plan  expect  future  intend and similar expressions to identify forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those reflected in the forward looking statements 
factors that might cause such a difference include  but are not limited to  the continued downturn in the telecommunications industry and slow development of the market for network based ip services  failure to achieve revenue growth and profitability  product development  commercialization and technology difficulties  manufacturing costs  the impact of competitive products  pricing  changing customer requirements  timely availability and acceptance of new products  and changes in economic conditions in the various markets that we serve  all as are discussed in more detail below in this section  as well as the other risk factors discussed below 
readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which reflect management s opinions only as of the date hereof 
we undertake no obligation to revise or publicly release the results of any revision to these forward looking statements 
readers should carefully review the risk factors described in other documents that we file from time to time with the securities and exchange commission  including the quarterly reports on form q that we file in fiscal year the following discussion describes certain risk factors related to our business as well as to our industry in general 
we have a history of losses that we expect will continue  and if we do not achieve profitability we may cease operations 
at december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we have incurred net losses since our incorporation 
we cannot be certain that our revenue will grow or that we will generate sufficient revenue to become profitable 
if we do not achieve profitability and are unable to obtain additional financing  we may run out of cash and cease operations 
due to our losses  we could lose major opportunities with large service providers who are concerned with our long term financial viability 
many large telecommunications service providers purchase capital equipment from vendors with a history of successful operations including positive cash flow 
our history of losses and use of cash in operations may cause certain service providers to decide not to purchase equipment from us because of concerns regarding our long term financial viability and our ability to support their businesses 
unless we can generate positive cash flows by either increasing revenues or decreasing costs  concerns regarding our long term financial viability may cause some potential customers to purchase product from other larger  more established suppliers including cisco systems  lucent technologies  nortel networks  alcatel  ericsson  siemens  and juniper networks 

table of contents the market for managed network based ip services is still in the early stages of growth 
as a result  demand may fluctuate 
the market for managed network based ip services is still in the early stages of growth 
we believe that the market for these services will grow  but the timing of this growth is linked to the development of this market by service providers and the growth of enterprise demand 
until the market develops further  demand may not increase significantly and may continue to fluctuate 
if our quarterly or annual operating results do not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors  the trading price of our common stock could decline 
the outlook for capital spending in the telecommunications industry directly impacts our business 
our business depends on capital expenditures within the telecommunications industry  which has experienced a significant downturn since capital spending in the industry as a whole has slowed as a result of a lack of available capital for many emerging service providers and a generally cautious approach to capital spending within the industry 
while the industry in general appears to be recovering  the ultimate duration of this downturn is unknown 
due to reductions in capital spending plans by our customers and uncertainty within the telecommunications industry  we anticipate that this trend will continue to have a substantial  adverse effect on our revenue growth for at least the remainder of the current fiscal year 
no assurance can be given that the company s net revenue and operating results will not be further adversely affected by the current downturn or any future downturns 
the long sales cycle for our platform may cause our revenue and operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter  and the price of our stock to decline 
a customer s decision to purchase our ip service delivery platform involves a significant commitment of its resources and a lengthy evaluation  testing and product qualification process that may run from three to twelve months 
network service providers and other customers with complex networks usually expand their networks in increments on a periodic basis 
we may receive purchase orders for significant dollar amounts on an irregular and unpredictable basis 
these events may cause our revenue and operating results to vary significantly and unexpectedly from quarter to quarter  which could cause our stock price to decline 
we participate in a competitive marketplace  and our failure to compete successfully would limit our ability to increase our market share and harm our business 
competition in the network infrastructure market is intense  and we expect that competition in the market for ip networking services will also be intense 
if we are unable to compete effectively  our revenue and market share will be negatively affected 
we face competition from companies in the network infrastructure market  including cisco systems  lucent technologies  nortel networks  alcatel  ericsson  siemens  and juniper networks 
many of our competitors are larger companies with significantly greater resources than we have  and we expect to face increased competition from larger companies in the future 
some of these larger competitors have pre existing relationships involving a range of product lines with the network service providers who are the principal potential customers for our ip service delivery platform 
these competitors may offer vendor financing  which we generally do not offer  undercut our prices or use their pre existing relationships with our customers to induce them not to use our ip service delivery platform 
future consolidation in the telecommunications equipment industry may increase competition that could harm our business the markets in which we compete are characterized by increasing consolidation both within the data communications sector and by companies combining or acquiring data communications assets and assets for delivering voice related services 
we cannot predict with certainty how industry consolidation will affect our competitors 
we may not be able to compete successfully in an increasingly consolidated industry 
increased competition and consolidation in our industry could require that we reduce the prices of our products and result in our loss of market share  which would materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and 
table of contents results of operations 
because we may be dependent on certain strategic relationships with third parties in our industry  any additional consolidation involving these parties could reduce the demand for our products and otherwise harm our business prospects 
our ability to sustain or grow our business may be harmed if we are unable to develop and maintain certain strategic relationships with third parties to market and sell our products 
because we are a relatively small company with correspondingly small sales and support groups  our success will depend in part upon our ability to form and maintain distribution partnerships  including agreements under which we agree to sell our products to certain service provider customers through distribution partners 
we may not be able to establish sufficient reseller relationships to enable us to expand our potential market and achieve revenue growth 
the amount and timing of resources that our distribution partners devote to our business  if any  is not within our control 
our distribution partners may not perform their obligations as expected 
in some cases  agreements with our distribution partners may be relatively new  and we cannot be certain that we will be able to achieve expected revenues from such partners or sustain the level of revenue generated thus far under similar arrangements 
if any of our distribution partners chooses not to renew  breaches or terminates its agreement or fails to perform its obligations under its agreement  we may not be able to sustain or grow our business 
in the event that such relationships are terminated  we may not be able to continue to maintain or develop similar relationships or to replace distribution partners 
in addition  any such agreements we enter into in the future may not be successful 
if our customers are unable to generate sales of services using our products and to manage delivery of these services to their customers  we may be unable to sell our products 
our future success depends on network service providers  who are our customers  generating revenue from the sale of services delivered using our products 
sales of our products may decline or be delayed if our customers do not successfully introduce commercial services derived from our ip service delivery platform or if our customers do not generate revenue from these services sufficient to realize an attractive return on their investment in our ip service delivery platform 
in addition  the long cycle for service providers to introduce new services made possible by our platform may cause our revenue and operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
our ability to generate future revenue also depends on whether network service providers successfully forecast market trends and identify customer demand for the services and features that our products would enable network service providers to offer their customers 
if our ip service delivery platform does not achieve market acceptance  we may be unable to achieve profitability 
our products offer a new approach for delivering services by network service providers  who may perceive our products as being more expensive than the other technologies and products they purchase 
if network service providers do not accept our ip service delivery platform as a method for delivering services to their customers  our ability to increase our revenue  achieve profitability and continue operations would be harmed 
our ip service delivery platform is our only product line  and our future revenue depends on its commercial success 
our ip service delivery platform  which is comprised of hardware and software  is the only product line that we currently offer to our customers 
our future revenue depends on the commercial success of our ip service delivery platform 
if customers do not adopt  purchase and successfully implement our ip service delivery platform in large numbers  our revenue will not grow 
if our products contain defects  we may be subject to significant liability claims from our customers  distribution partners and the end users of our products and incur significant unexpected expenses and lost sales our products are technically complex and can be adequately tested only when put to full use in large and diverse networks with high amounts of traffic 
they have in the past contained  and may in the future contain  
table of contents undetected or unresolved errors or defects 
despite extensive testing  errors  defects or failures may be found in our current or future products or enhancements after commencement of commercial shipments 
if this happens  we may experience delay in or loss of market acceptance and sales  product returns  diversion of development resources  injury to our reputation  inability to attract new customers  or increased service and warranty costs  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
moreover  because our products are designed to provide critical communications services  we may receive significant liability claims 
we attempt to include in our agreements with customers and distribution partners provisions intended to limit our exposure to liability claims 
however  our customers and distribution partners may not be willing to agree to such provisions  and in any event such provisions may not be effective in any or all cases or under any or all scenarios  and they may not preclude all potential claims resulting from a defect in one of our products or from a defect related to the installation or operation of one of our products 
although we maintain product liability and errors and omissions insurance covering certain damages arising from implementation and use of our products  our insurance may not cover all claims sought against us 
liability claims could require us to spend significant time and money in litigation or to pay significant damages 
as a result  any such claims  whether or not successful  could seriously damage our reputation and our business 
if we fail to develop and market new products or features  we will have difficulty attracting customers 
based on our prior experience  we expect that our customers will require product features that our current ip service delivery platform does not have 
our products are technically complex  and the development of new products or features is an uncertain  time consuming and labor intensive process 
we may experience design  manufacturing or marketing problems with our new products 
if we fail to develop new or enhanced products that meet customer requirements  our ability to attract and retain customers will be hindered 
if we fail to introduce new products in a timely manner we may experience erratic revenue growth  which could negatively affect profitability and in turn have a negative impact on our stock price 
in addition  such a failure could result in additional costs such as excess inventory  customer conversion costs  higher than expected product costs and higher than expected operating expenses in research and development and in sales and marketing 
if our products do not work the way our customers expect  orders for our products may be cancelled and the market perception of our products could be harmed 
if our products do not work with our customers or their end users networks  the market perception of our products could be harmed and orders for our products could be cancelled 
in particular  if an actual or perceived breach of network security occurs in a customer s or its end user s network that uses our products  we may be subject to lawsuits for losses suffered by customers or their end users 
if we have to redesign or modify our products to make them compatible with a customer s or end user s network  our sales cycle could be extended  our research and development costs may increase and profit margins on our products may decline 
because the markets in which we compete are prone to rapid technological change and the adoption of standards different from those that we use  our products could become obsolete  and we could be required to incur substantial costs to modify our products to remain competitive 
the market for our ip service delivery platform is prone to rapid technological change  the adoption of new standards  frequent new product introductions and changes in customer and end user requirements 
we may be unable to respond quickly or effectively to these developments 
we may experience difficulties that could prevent our development of new products and features 
the introduction of new products or technologies by competitors  or the emergence of new industry standards  could render our products obsolete or could require us to incur costs to redesign our products 

table of contents we rely upon a limited number of customers  and any decrease in revenue from these customers or failure to increase our customer base could harm our operating results 
the loss of one or more of our customers  a reduction in purchases of our products by certain of our customers or the decline of a key customer s business may limit our revenue growth and harm our operating results 
our customers may reduce or discontinue purchases of our products at any time 
in  we generated percent of our revenue from two customers 
our future success will depend on attracting additional customers 
failure to increase our customer base would hinder our growth and harm our operating results 
a failure of our contract manufacturers or our sole source and limited source suppliers to meet our needs would seriously harm our ability to timely fill customer orders 
if any of our manufacturers terminates its relationship with us or is unable to produce sufficient quantities of our products in a timely manner and at satisfactory quality levels  our ability to fill customer orders on time  our reputation and our operating results will suffer 
our contract manufacturers do not have a long term obligation to supply products to us 
qualifying new contract manufacturers and starting volume production is expensive and time consuming and would disrupt our business 
we purchase several key components  including field programmable gate arrays  some integrated circuits and memory devices  and power supplies from a single source or a limited number of sources 
we do not have long term supply contracts for these components 
if our supply of these components is interrupted  we may be unable to locate an alternate source in a timely manner or at favorable prices 
interruption or delay in the supply of these components could cause us to lose sales to existing and potential customers 
if any of our significant suppliers were to terminate their relationships with us or compete against us  our revenue and market share would likely be reduced 
many of our suppliers also have significant development and marketing relationships with our competitors and have significantly greater financial and marketing resources than we do 
if they develop and market products in the future in competition with us  or form or strengthen arrangements with our competitors  our revenue and market share will likely be reduced 
if we fail to predict our manufacturing requirements accurately  we could incur additional costs or manufacturing delays 
we provide forecasts of our demand to our contract manufacturers up to twelve months before scheduled delivery of products to our customers 
if we overestimate our manufacturing requirements  we may have excess or obsolete inventory  which could harm our operating results 
if we underestimate our requirements  our contract manufacturers may have an insufficient inventory  which could interrupt manufacturing of our products and result in delays in shipments and revenue 
if we do not accurately anticipate lead times for components  we may experience component shortages 
if necessary licenses of third party technology are terminated or become unavailable or too expensive  our competitive position and our product offering will suffer 
we license from third party suppliers certain software applications incorporated in our ip service delivery platform 
also  we may need to license technology from other third party suppliers to enable us to develop new products or features 
our inability to renew or obtain any third party license that we need could require us to obtain substitute technology of lower quality or at greater cost 
these outcomes could seriously impair our ability to sell our products and could harm our operating results 
we rely on our intellectual property rights to be competitive  and if we are unable to protect these rights  we may never become profitable 
we rely on a combination of copyright  trademark  patent and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights 
monitoring unauthorized use of our products is difficult  and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent unauthorized use of our technology 
if we 
table of contents are unable to protect our intellectual property rights  our ability to supply our products as they have been designed could suffer  and our ability to become profitable could be harmed 
if we become involved in an intellectual property dispute  we could be subject to significant liability  the time and attention of our management could be diverted and we could be prevented from selling our products 
we may become a party to litigation in the future to protect our intellectual property or because others may allege infringement of their intellectual property 
these claims and any resulting lawsuit could subject us to significant liability for damages or invalidate our proprietary rights 
these lawsuits  regardless of their merits  likely would be time consuming and expensive to resolve and would divert management time and attention 
any potential intellectual property litigation alleging our infringement of a third party s intellectual property also could force us to stop selling products or services that use the challenged intellectual property  obtain from the owner of the infringed intellectual property right a license to sell the relevant technology  which license may not be available on reasonable terms  or at all  or redesign those products or services that use the infringed technology 
if we fail to retain key personnel  our operations could suffer and our stock price could be negatively impacted 
maintaining key personnel may be difficult for a number of reasons  including but not limited to market demand  stock price  growth opportunities  management philosophy  company performance and competitive activity 
if we lose key personnel we may find it difficult and costly to recruit new management and other personnel and this may have a negative affect on our performance and in turn on our stock price 
if we become subject to unfair hiring claims  we could be prevented from hiring needed personnel  or from pursuing or implementing our research  and could incur substantial liabilities or costs 
companies in our industry whose employees accept positions with competitors frequently claim that these competitors have engaged in unfair hiring practices or that the employment of these persons would involve the disclosure or use of trade secrets or information subject to an obligation of confidentiality 
we have been threatened with claims like these in the past and may receive claims of this kind in the future 
these claims could prevent us from hiring personnel or from using the knowledge and experience brought to us by the personnel whom we hire 
we could also incur substantial costs and damages in defending against these claims  regardless of their merits 
defending ourselves against such claims could divert the attention of our management away from our operations 
insiders continue to have substantial control over us and they could delay or prevent a change in our corporate control even if our other stockholders wanted it to occur 
our executive officers  directors and principal stockholders who hold or more of the outstanding common stock and their affiliates beneficially own a significant portion of our outstanding common stock 
these stockholders will be able to exercise significant control over all matters requiring stockholder approval  including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions 
this could delay or prevent an outside party from acquiring or merging with us even if our other stockholders wanted it to occur 
if we cannot obtain director and officer liability insurance in acceptable amounts for acceptable rates  we may have difficulty recruiting and retaining qualified directors and officers 
like most other public companies  we carry insurance protecting our officers and directors against claims relating to the conduct of our business 
this insurance covers  among other things  the costs incurred by companies and their management to defend against and resolve claims relating to management conduct and results of operations  such as securities class action claims 
these claims typically are expensive to defend against and resolve 
we pay significant premiums to acquire and maintain this insurance  which is provided by third party insurers  and we agree to underwrite a portion of such exposures under the terms of the insurance 
table of contents coverage 
one consequence of the current economic downturn and decline in stock prices has been a substantial increase in the number of securities class actions and similar claims brought against public corporations and their management  including our company and certain of our current and former officers and directors 
consequently  insurers providing director and officer liability insurance have in recent periods sharply increased the premiums they charge for this insurance  raised retentions that is  the amount of liability that a company is required to pay to defend and resolve a claim before any applicable insurance is provided  and limited the amount of insurance they will provide 
moreover  insurers typically provide only one year policies 
the insurance policies that may cover the current securities lawsuit against us have a  retention 
as a result  the costs we incur in defending this lawsuit will not be reimbursed until they exceed  the policies that would cover any future lawsuits may not provide any coverage to us and may cover the directors and officers only in the event we are unwilling or unable to cover their costs in defending against and resolving any future claims 
as a result  our costs in defending any future lawsuits could increase significantly 
particularly in the current economic environment  we cannot assure you that in the future we will be able to obtain sufficient director and officer liability insurance coverage at acceptable rates and with acceptable deductibles and other limitations 
failure to obtain such insurance could materially harm our financial condition in the event that we are required to defend against and resolve any future or existing securities class actions or other claims made against us or our management arising from the conduct of our operations 
further  the inability to obtain such insurance in adequate amounts may impair our future ability to retain and recruit qualified officers and directors 
fluctuations in demand can lead to impairment of the value of our long lived assets fluctuations in demand can also lead to the consideration of asset impairment charges 
the carrying value of property  plant and equipment is reviewed if the facts and circumstances suggest that property  plant and equipment may be impaired 
an impairment review requires management to make certain estimates and judgments regarding future cash flows that management expects to be generated by groups of assets 
we evaluate the carrying value of our long lived assets  consisting primarily of property  plant and equipment  whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
in assessing the recoverability of long lived assets  we compare the carrying value to the undiscounted future cash flows the assets are expected to generate 
if the total of the undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the assets  the assets will be written down to their estimated fair value 
significant judgments and assumptions are required in the forecast of future operating results used in the preparation of the estimated future cash flows  including long term forecasts of overall market conditions and our participation in the market 
for example  we recorded a write down of million in fiscal year changes in these estimates could have a material adverse effect on the assessment of the long lived assets  thereby requiring us to record further asset write downs in the future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity we do not currently use derivative financial instruments for speculative trading or hedging purposes 
in addition  we maintain our cash equivalents in government and agency securities  debt instruments of financial institutions and corporations and money market funds 
our exposure to market risks from changes in interest rates relates primarily to corporate debt securities 
we place our investments with high credit quality issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of the credit exposure to any one issuer 
our general policy is to limit the risk of principal loss and ensure the safety of invested funds by limiting market and credit risk 
all highly liquid investments with a maturity of less than three months at the date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents  and all investments with maturities of three months or greater are classified as available for sale and considered to be short term investments 
a sensitivity analysis was performed on our december  investment portfolio based on a modeling technique that measures hypothetical fair market value changes that would result from a parallel shift in the yield curve of plus basis points 
based on this analysis  a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would result in a  decrease in the fair value of our investments in debt securities as of december  
table of contents exchange rate sensitivity currently  all of our revenue and most of our expenses are denominated in us dollars 
however  since a portion of our operations sales and service activities are outside of the us  we have entered into transactions in other currencies 
we are primarily exposed to changes in exchange rates for the euro  japanese yen  and british pound 
because we transact expenses only in foreign currency  we are adversely affected by a weaker us dollar relative to major currencies worldwide 
additionally  because some of our obligations are denominated in foreign currencies  a weaker us dollar creates foreign exchange losses 
we have not engaged in any foreign exchange hedging activities to date
