item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for the years  and the following commentary presents a discussion and analysis of the corporation s financial condition and results of operations by its management management 
the review highlights the principal factors affecting earnings and the significant changes in balance sheet items for the years  and financial information for prior years is presented when appropriate 
the objective of this financial review is to enhance the reader s understanding of the accompanying tables and charts  the consolidated financial statements  notes to financial statements  and financial statistics appearing elsewhere in this report 
where applicable  this discussion also reflects management s insights of known events and trends that have or may reasonably be expected to have a material effect on the corporation s operations and financial condition 
all financial data has been restated to give effect to acquisitions accounted for on a pooling of interests basis and stock splits in previous periods

earnings summary the corporation recorded net income of million  or per diluted share  for the fiscal year 
this compares to million  or per diluted share  for fiscal year for the fourth quarter of  firstmerit reported net income of million  or per diluted share  compared to million  or per share  for the prior year quarter 
during the fourth quarter of  firstmerit completed several initiatives that reduced risk and strengthened the balance sheet 
these initiatives included the sale of the company s million portfolio of manufactured housing loans and prepayment of million in fhlb borrowings  as well as the sale of million of commercial loans 
as a result  after tax earnings for the full year and fourth quarter were reduced by a total of million  or per share  which includes an after tax charge of million  or per share  related to the sale of the manufactured housing portfolio and prepayment of fhlb borrowings  and a million  or per share  increase in the provision for loan losses relating to the sale of commercial loans 
results for also include an accounting charge of  after tax  or per share  representing the cumulative effect of application of fin  a new accounting interpretation that requires consolidation of the special purpose entity that holds firstmerit s headquarters building

for the fourth quarter  non interest income excluding securities transactions was million  a decline of million  or  from the prior year fourth quarter 
the decline reflects a lower level of mortgage banking activity and investment services  partially offset by higher levels of trust income and deposit service charges 
non interest expense totaled million for  compared to million for excluding the million pre tax charge associated with the sale of the company s manufactured housing portfolio and prepayment of million in fhlb borrowings  non interest expense totaled million  a increase over the prior year 
salary and benefits expense increased for the year and other non interest expenses were virtually unchanged from the prior year 
for the fourth quarter of  non interest expenses excluding the pre tax charge declined from the prior year quarter 
as previously stated  in the fourth quarter of  the company sold million of commercial loans and million of manufactured housing loans  contributing to a million decline in non performing assets 
year over year  nonperforming assets improved million and loans ninety days past due and still accruing interest improved million 
as a result of these steps  non performing assets were of period end loans plus ore at december   unchanged from the prior year end  but down from at the end of the third quarter 
net charge offs totaled million for the year  compared to million for  and of loans  respectively 
the company recorded million of loan loss provision in this compares with a provision of million taken in in the fourth quarter  the provision was million  which compares with a million provision taken in the fourth quarter of and million in the third quarter of the allowance for loan losses was reduced by million for reserves associated with the asset sales 
at year end  the allowance for loan losses was of loans  reflecting the higher level of loans and the lower level of risk inherent in the portfolio after disposition of the manufactured housing mh portfolio in as described under other income  compared to or excluding the mh portfolio at december  assets at december  totaled billion 
deposits totaled billion at december  a decline of over the last twelve months

the company s capital position remains strong  as tangible equity to assets was at quarter end 
the common dividend per share paid in was  a increase from the prior year 
net interest income net interest income  the corporation s principal source of earnings  is the difference between interest income generated by earning assets primarily loans and investment securities and interest paid on interest bearing funds namely customer deposits and wholesale borrowings 
net interest income is affected by market 
table of contents interest rates on both earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  the mix of funding between interest bearing liabilities  non interest bearing liabilities and equity  and the growth in earning assets 
net interest income for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the year ended december  the million decline in net interest income occurred because the million decline in interest expense was less than the million decline in interest income during the same period 
for the purpose of this remaining discussion  net interest income is presented on a fully tax equivalent fte basis  to provide a comparison among all types of interest earning assets 
that is  interest on tax free securities and tax exempt loans has been restated as if such interest were taxed at the statutory federal income tax rate of adjusted for the non deductible portion of interest expense incurred to acquire the tax free assets 
net interest income presented on a fte basis is a non gaap financial measure widely used by financial services corporations 
the fte adjustment for full year was million  compared with million in the following table shows the allocation to assets  the source of funding and their respective interest spreads

the average yield on earning assets dropped basis points from in to in higher outstanding balances on total average earning assets caused interest income to increase million from year ago levels 
average balances for investment securities were up from last year increasing interest income million  but lower rates earned on the securities lessened interest income by million 
average loan outstandings were down from last year  reducing interest income by million  while lower yields earned on the loans  decreased loan interest income by million 
the cost of funds for the year as a percentage of average earning assets decreased basis points from in to in the decline in interest expense was primarily rate driven as lower interest rates paid on customer deposits and wholesale borrowings accounted for million compared to as 
table of contents discussed in the deposits and wholesale borrowings section of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and operating results  the corporation placed less reliance on certificates of deposit cds to fund loans and operations in specifically  lower average outstandings for cds lessened interest expense by million

the net interest margin is calculated by dividing net interest income fte by average earning assets 
as with net interest income  the net interest margin is affected by the level and mix of earning assets  the proportion of earning assets funded by non interest bearing liabilities  and the interest rate spread 
in addition  the net interest margin is impacted by changes in federal income tax rates and regulations as they affect the tax equivalent adjustment 
the net interest margin for was  compared to in as discussed in the previous section  the decrease in the net interest margin during was primarily a result of lower yields earned on loans and securities outpacing reductions in lower interest rates paid on customer deposits and wholesale borrowings

at year end  the investment portfolio had a net unrealized loss of million  which compares to a gain of million at year end at year ends and  investment securities totaled billion and billion  respectively 
the increase in the total portfolio occurred primarily in the mortgage backed securities category 
the increase reflects the reinvestment of funds generated from higher levels of core deposits  the decrease in commercial loans

table of contents asset quality making a loan to earn an interest spread inherently includes taking the risk of not being repaid 
successful management of credit risk requires making good underwriting decisions  carefully administering the loan portfolio and diligently collecting delinquent accounts 
the corporation s credit policy division manages credit risk by establishing common credit policies for its subsidiaries  participating in approval of the largest loans  conducting reviews of loan portfolios  providing centralized consumer underwriting  collections and loan operations services  and overseeing loan workouts 
notes  and to the consolidated financial statements  provide detailed information regarding the corporation s credit policies and practices 
the corporation s objective is to minimize losses from its commercial lending activities and to maintain consumer losses at acceptable levels that are stable and consistent with growth and profitability objectives 
nonperforming assets are defined as follows nonaccrual loans on which interest is no longer accrued because its collection is doubtful

time until maturity amount in thousands under months to months over months interest rate sensitivity interest rate sensitivity measures the potential exposure of earnings and capital to changes in market interest rates 
the corporation has a policy that provides guidelines in the management of interest rate risk 
this policy is reviewed periodically to ensure it complies with trends in the financial markets and the industry 
the following analysis divides interest bearing assets and liabilities into maturity categories and measures the gap between maturing assets and liabilities in each category 
the corporation analyzes the historical sensitivity of its interest bearing transaction accounts to determine the portion that it classifies as interest rate sensitive versus the portion classified over one year 
the analysis shows that liabilities maturing within one year exceed assets maturing within the same period by million 
the corporation uses the gap analysis and 
table of contents other tools to monitor rate risk 
focusing on estimated repricing activity within one year  the corporation was in a slightly liability sensitive position as illustrated in the following table 
over days days days days days year total in thousands interest earning assets loans and leases investment securities total interest earning assets interest bearing liabilities demand interest bearing savings and money market accounts certificate and other time deposits wholesale borrowings total interest bearing liabilities total gap cumulative gap market risk market risk refers to potential losses arising from changes in interest rates  foreign exchange rates  equity prices and commodity prices  including the correlation among these factors and their volatility 
the corporation is primarily exposed to interest rate risk as a result of offering a wide array of financial products to its customers 
changes in market interest rates may result in changes in the fair market value of the corporation s financial instruments  cash flows  and net interest income 
the corporation seeks to achieve consistent growth in net interest income and capital while managing volatility arising from shifts in market interest rates 
the asset and liability committee alco oversees market risk management  establishing risk measures  limits  and policy guidelines for managing the amount of interest rate risk and its effect on net interest income and capital 
according to these policies  responsibility for measuring and the management of interest rate risk resides in the corporate treasury function 
interest rate risk on the corporation s balance sheets consists of reprice  option  and basis risks 
reprice risk results from differences in the maturity  or repricing  of asset and liability portfolios 
option risk arises from embedded options present in the investment portfolio and in many financial instruments  such as loan prepayment options  deposit early withdrawal options  and interest rate options 
these options allow customers opportunities to benefit when market interest rates change  which typically results in higher costs or lower revenue for the corporation 
basis risk refers to the potential for changes in the underlying relationship between market rates or indices  which subsequently result in a narrowing of profit spread on an earning asset or liability 
basis risk is also present in administered rate liabilities  such as interest bearing checking accounts  savings accounts and money market accounts where historical pricing relationships to market rates may change due to the level or directional change in market interest rates 
the interest rate risk position is measured and monitored using risk management tools  including earnings simulation modeling and economic value of equity sensitivity analysis  which capture both near term and long term interest rate risk exposures 
combining the results from these separate risk measurement processes allows a reasonably comprehensive view of short term and long term interest rate risk in the corporation 
earnings simulation involves forecasting net interest earnings under a variety of scenarios  including changes in the level of interest rates  the shape of the yield curve  and spreads between market interest rates 
the sensitivity of net interest income to changes in interest rates is measured using numerous interest rate scenarios 
table of contents including shocks  gradual ramps  curve flattening  curve steepening as well as forecasts of likely interest rate scenarios 
presented below is the corporation s interest rate risk profile as of december  immediate change in rates and resulting percentage increase decrease in net interest income basis basis basis basis points points points points december  n a december  modeling the sensitivity of net interest earnings to changes in market interest rates is highly dependent on numerous assumptions incorporated into the modeling process 
to the extent that actual performance is different than what was assumed  actual net interest earnings sensitivity may be different than projected 
the assumptions used in the models are management s best estimate based on studies conducted by alco 
alco uses a data warehouse to study interest rate risk at a transactional level and uses various ad hoc reports to refine assumptions continuously 
assumptions and methodologies regarding administered rate liabilities eg  savings  money market and interest bearing checking accounts  balance trends  and repricing relationships reflect management s best estimate of expected behavior and these assumptions are reviewed regularly 
the corporation also has longer term interest rate risk exposure  which may not be appropriately measured by earnings sensitivity analysis 
alco uses economic value of equity  or eve  sensitivity analysis to study the impact of long term cash flows on earnings and capital 
economic value of equity involves discounting present values of all cash flows of on balance sheet and off balance sheet items under different interest rate scenarios 
the discounted present value of all cash flows represents the corporation s economic value of equity 
the analysis requires modifying the expected cash flows in each interest rate scenario  which will impact the discounted present value 
the amount of base case measurement and its sensitivity to shifts in the yield curve allow management to measure longer term repricing and option risk in the balance sheet 
presented below is the corporation s eve profile as of december  immediate change in rates and resulting percentage increase decrease in eve basis basis basis basis points points points points december  n a december  capital resources financial institutions are subject to a strict uniform system of capital based regulation 
under this system  there are five different categories of capitalization  with prompt corrective actions and significant operational restrictions imposed on institutions that are capital deficient under the categories 
the five categories are well capitalized  adequately capitalized  capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized 
to be considered well capitalized an institution must have a total risk based capital ratio of at least  a leverage capital ratio of  and must not be subject to any order or directive requiring the institution to improve its capital level 
an adequately capitalized institution has a total risk based capital ratio of at least  a tier i capital ratio of at least and a leverage capital ratio of at least 
institutions with lower capital levels are deemed to be undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized  depending on their actual capital levels 
the appropriate federal regulatory agency may also downgrade an institution to the next lower capital category upon a determination that the institution is in an unsafe or unsound practice 
institutions are required to monitor closely their capital levels and to notify their appropriate regulatory agency of any basis

liquidity risk management liquidity risk is the possibility of the corporation being unable to meet current and future financial obligations in a timely manner 
liquidity is managed to ensure stable  reliable and cost effective sources of funds to satisfy demand for credit  deposit withdrawals and investment opportunities 
the corporation considers core earnings  strong capital ratios and credit quality essential for maintaining high credit ratings  which allow the corporation cost effective access to market based liquidity 
the corporation relies on a large  stable core deposit base and a diversified base of wholesale funding sources to manage liquidity risk 
the treasury group is responsible for identifying  measuring and monitoring the corporation s liquidity profile 
the position is evaluated daily  weekly and monthly by analyzing the composition of all funding sources  reviewing projected liquidity commitments by future month and identifying sources and uses of funds 
treasury group also prepares a contingency funding plan that details the potential erosion of funds in the event of a systemic financial market crisis or institution specific stress 
in addition  the overall management of the corporation s liquidity position is integrated into retail deposit pricing policies to ensure a stable core deposit base 
the corporation s primary source of liquidity is its core deposit base  raised through its retail branch system 
the corporation also has available unused wholesale sources of liquidity  including advances from the federal home loan bank of cincinnati  borrowings through the federal reserve bank of cleveland s discount window  debt issuance through dealers in the capital markets and access to certificates of deposit issued through 
table of contents brokers 
liquidity is also provided by unencumbered  or unpledged  investment securities that totaled million at year end

contractual obligations  commitments  contingent liabilities  and off balance sheet arrangements the corporation has various contractual obligations which are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements 
the following table summarizes the corporation s significant obligations at december  and the future periods in which such obligations are expected to be settled in cash

e the postretirement benefit payments represent actuarially determined future benefits to eligible plan participants 
sfas requires that the liability be recorded at net present value while the future payments contained in this table have not been discounted 
effects of inflation the assets and liabilities of the corporation are primarily monetary in nature and are more directly affected by the fluctuation in interest rates than inflation 
movement in interest rates is a result of the perceived changes in inflation as well as monetary and fiscal policies 
interest rates and inflation do not move with the same velocity or within the same time frame  therefore  a direct relationship to the inflation rate cannot be shown 
the financial information presented in this report  based on historical data  has a direct correlation to the influence of market levels of interest rates 
therefore  management believes that there is no material benefit in presenting a statement of financial data adjusted for inflationary changes 
critical accounting policies the corporation s most significant accounting policies are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
management has determined that accounting for the allowance for loan losses  income taxes and mortgage servicing rights are deemed critical because of the valuation techniques used  and the sensitivity of these financial statement amounts to the methods  assumptions and estimates underlying these balances 
accounting for these critical areas requires the most subjective and complex judgments that could be subject to revision as new information becomes available 
as explained in note and note to the consolidated financial statements  the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
this estimate is based on the current economy s impact on the timing and expected amounts of future cash flows on impaired loans  as well as historical loss experience associated with homogeneous pools of loans 
changes in economic conditions can result in significant changes to management s estimate of the allowance for loan losses 
the income tax amounts in note to the consolidated financial statements reflect the current period income tax expense for all periods shown  as well as future tax liabilities associated with differences in the timing of expenses and income recognition for book and tax accounting purposes 
the current income tax liability also includes management s estimate of potential adjustments by taxing authorities 
the income tax returns  which are usually filed nine months after year end  are subject to review and possible revision by the taxing authorities  until the statute of limitations has expired 
these statutes usually expire within three years from the time the respective tax returns are filed
