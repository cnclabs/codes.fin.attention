overview viisage delivers advanced technology identity solutions for governments  law enforcement agencies and businesses concerned with enhancing security  reducing identity theft  providing access control  and protecting personal privacy 
we focus on identity solutions for civil identification  criminal identification and border management applications that improve personal convenience and security  deter fraud  and reduce identification program costs 
by combining secure document and face recognition biometric technologies that quickly  reliably  and accurately identify individuals in both one to one and one to many situations  we create innovative identity solutions 
our goal is to help our customers solve three critical aspects of verifying and managing identities assurance that an identification document is authentic  confidence that the person holding the identification document is uniquely tied to and authorized to use the document  and verification of the privileges the document grants 
recent strategic initiatives the market for identity solutions has developed at a rapid pace over the past months 
in particular  new and enhanced biometric identification technologies and applications are being continually introduced  and consumers of identity solutions are demanding increased functionality  including the integration of secure credential and biometric technologies 
we have addressed these developments through  among other things  two important initiatives that we began in  including the acquisition zn vision technologies ag  a german provider of face recognition and computer vision products  which we completed in january  and which has resulted in a substantial enhancement to our biometrics technologies and research and development capabilities  and the creation of an applications group  consisting of engineering and product management personnel  which focuses on ensuring that we are able to provide offerings to our customers that integrate our secure credential and biometrics solutions 
in addition  we have focused our strategic efforts on enhancing our relationships with our core markets in the secure credentials marketplace 
to that end  in february we acquired trans digital technologies corporation  the sole source provider of us high technology solutions for the production of passports for the us department of state 
financial results for the year ended december   we recorded record revenue of million  of which million was attributable to our secure credentials segment and million was attributable to our biometrics segment 
our net loss for  after giving effect to the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle  was million 

table of contents change in accounting principle as discussed in greater detail below  in the third quarter of we adopted the provisions of emerging issues task force  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
this change resulted in a non cash charge of million in  reflecting the reversal of unbilled revenue  net of related costs  associated with our secure credentials contracts 
we had previously recognized revenue under such contracts using the percentage of completion methodology 
capital raising initiatives in september  we raised approximately million  after fees and related expenses  through the sale of approximately million shares of our common stock in a private sale to institutional investors 
in january  we sold approximately million additional shares of our common stock to the same investors for net proceeds of approximately million 
in addition  in may we entered into a loan agreement with lau technologies  the holder of approximately of our common stock  pursuant to which lau provided debt financing to us in a principal amount that may not exceed million at any time 
in february  we entered into a new loan agreement with a commercial lender with which we had a pre existing relationship  pursuant to which the lender provided us with an additional million of debt financing 
we expect our current capital resources to be adequate for our needs for at least the next months 
however  if we enter into a new drivers license contract or engage in a significant acquisition or other strategic transaction  we could be required to raise additional capital  either in the form of debt or equity 
litigation in july  following the institution of a law suit by one of our competitors  a georgia court issued a preliminary injunction which effectively prevents us from completing installation work on a drivers license system for the georgia department of motor vehicle safety 
the merits of the underlying lawsuit are the subject of ongoing court proceedings 
as discussed elsewhere in this report  if the lawsuit is successful and we lose the contract  we could lose up to million of revenue that we expected to recognize over the next five and one half years 
in addition  although we expect that the department of motor vehicle safety would be required to reimburse us for our costs incurred under the contract  if we are unable to obtain reimbursement of those costs  we could be required to recognize a loss of up to approximately million for costs incurred to date on the georgia contract 
recent accounting developments during the third quarter of  we adopted the provisions of emerging issues task force  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  or eitf  on a cumulative basis as of january  eitf governs how to identify whether goods or services  or both  that are to be delivered separately in a bundled sales arrangement should be accounted for separately 
our secure credentials contracts typically require us to customize  design  and install equipment and software at customer locations  as well as perform training  supply consumables  maintain the equipment and provide support services 
nonperformance of training  consumables management  maintenance and support services would prevent us from receiving payment for the costs incurred in the customization  design and installation of the system 
eitf limits the amount of revenue allocable to the customization  design and installation of the system to the amount that is not contingent upon the production of credentials 
revenue on our secure credentials contracts under eitf is earned based on  and is contingent upon  the production of secure credentials from the system 
due to the contingent performance of card production in our secure credentials contracts  we defer revenue recognition for the system design and installation phase of our contracts  including customized software and equipment  and recognize revenue as secure credentials are produced 

table of contents the adoption of eitf resulted in a non cash adjustment reported as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of million 
the cumulative effect adjustment reflects the reversal of unbilled revenue net of associated costs associated with our secure credentials contracts  which had been accounted for as a single unit using the percentage of completion method of revenue recognition 
historically  we applied the cost to cost method of measurement of revenue recognition for our secure credentials contracts 
we recognized revenue and associated costs during the implementation of the system based on direct labor costs to total labor costs 
the adjustment reflects the reversal of the gross margin recognized during the implementation of the system which will be recognized over the contract life under eitf due to the contingent performance of the training  consumables management  maintenance and support services 
under eitf  we capitalize both the hardware and software system assets as property assets and depreciate those assets on a straight line basis over the term of the contract beginning when the system goes into service 
we have determined that our secure credentials contracts involve the provision of multiple elements 
the first element consists of hardware  system design  implementation  training  consumables management  maintenance and support which is accounted for as equipment and related executory services under lease in accordance with financial accounting standards board statement no 
 or fasb the second element consists of customized software which is accounted for as a long term contract in accordance with aicpa statements of position  software revenue recognition  or sop  and  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts  or sop  on a units of delivery method of measurement 
the following table reflects selected pro forma financial data for and adjusted for the aforementioned accounting change effective january  exclusive of the associated cumulative effect of the change in accounting compared to operating results  as reported in thousands  except per share amounts for the years ended december  as reported pro forma operating results revenue cost of revenue gross margin operating expenses operating income loss other income expense provision for income taxes income loss before cumulative effect of accounting change per share data basic and diluted income loss per share applicable to common shareholders weighted average shares outstanding basic and diluted 
table of contents as reported december  january  december  financial position costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings property and equipment  net total assets accounts payable and accrued expenses shareholders equity total liabilities and shareholders equity segments our business involves two related segments secure credentials and biometrics 
for the year ended december  approximately million  or of our direct revenue was derived within the united states 
the remaining  or of revenue was derived in canada and the united arab emirates 
secure credentials segment our secure credentials segment accounted for approximately  and of our revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
our secure credentials solutions involve the design  development  marketing and implementation of integrated software and hardware solutions that produce identification credentials utilizing face recognition and other biometric technologies 
we provide customized systems utilizing proprietary products under service contracts that have five to seven year terms and several optional annual renewals after the initial contract term 
these contracts generally provide for a fixed price for each identification credential produced 
contract prices vary depending on  among other things  design and integration complexities  the nature and number of workstations and sites  the projected number of secure credentials to be produced  the size of the database  the level of post installation support and the competitive environment 
our secure credentials segment also includes the contracts we assumed as part of our acquisition of trans digital technologies in february under these contracts  we provide high security technology and services to the us department of state for the production of us passports  as well as similar services to the us departments of defense and homeland security 
the contracts we assumed in connection with the tdt acquisition are not reflected in the financial statements appearing in this report and will not have an effect on our financial statements until the completion of the first quarter of in civil identification applications  such as drivers licenses and passports  the sales cycle generally includes a formal request for proposal  or rfp  bidding process 
in these public sector cases  our sales and marketing personnel regularly conduct visits and attend industry trade shows to identify bid opportunities and particular customer preferences  and to establish and cultivate relationships in advance of any bid 
once an rfp is issued  a comprehensive proposal is developed and usually followed by an on site customer demonstration 
the process from the issuance of an rfp to the ultimate award can take up to six months 
following the bid award a six to twelve month implementation and installation process usually ensues 
we believe that long sales cycles in our public sector markets are endemic to the market and will continue 
further  customers may seek to modify the system either during or after the implementation of the system 
while our long sales and implementation cycle requires the commitment of marketing resources and investments of working capital  we believe that it also serves as a barrier to entry for smaller companies and as an early indicator of potential competitors for particular projects 
for existing customers  a considerably shorter sales and implementation cycle may be involved 

table of contents biometrics segment our biometrics segment accounted for approximately  and of our revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the focus of our biometric technology solutions is primarily on applications designed to deter criminal and terrorist activities  including government research and development contracts 
these initiatives generated of this segment s revenue for the year ended december   the remaining was generated from sales in the gaming industry 
within our biometrics segment  our contracts typically provide for the development  customization and installation of face recognition systems for government agencies  law enforcement agencies and businesses 
these contracts are generally fixed price  and include milestones and acceptance criteria for the various deliverables under the contract 
contract prices vary depending on  among other things  design and integration complexities  the nature and number of workstations and sites  the size of the database  the level of post installation support and the competitive environment 
in certain cases  we provide licenses of off the shelf versions of our face recognition software on a per user basis 
for identity solutions that primarily require our advanced face recognition technology  such as criminal identification booking and investigation applications  the sales cycle tends to be shorter and the solution consists primarily of software products 
dependence on significant customers we believe for the near future that we will continue to derive a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of large contracts 
for the years ended december  secure credentials segment customers which accounted for more than of revenues in a given year are as follows for  two customers accounted for an aggregate of  for  two customers accounted for an aggregate of  and for  four customers accounted for an aggregate of 
no single biometrics segment customer accounted for over of total revenue in any one year 
critical accounting policies and significant estimates we prepare our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  or us gaap 
consistent with us gaap  we have adopted accounting policies that we believe are most appropriate given the facts and circumstances of our business 
the application of these policies has a significant impact on our reported results 
in addition  some of these policies require management to make estimates 
these estimates  which are based on historical experience and analysis of current conditions  have a significant impact on our reported results and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
if actual results differ significantly from these estimates  there could be a material effect on our financial statements 
valuation of goodwill and other long lived and intangible assets our long lived assets include property  plant and equipment and other intangible assets 
as of december   the balances of property  plant and equipment and other intangible assets  net of accumulated depreciation and amortization  were million and million  respectively 
where we believe that property  plant and equipment and intangible assets have finite lives  we depreciate and amortize those assets over their estimated useful lives 
for purposes of determining whether there are any impairment losses  as further discussed below  our management has examined the carrying value of our 
table of contents identifiable long lived tangible and intangible assets  including their useful lives where we believe such assets have finite lives  when indicators of impairment are present 
for all long lived tangible and intangible assets  if an impairment loss were identified based on the fair value of the asset  as compared to the carrying value of the asset  such loss would be charged to expense in the period we identify the impairment 
furthermore  if our review of the carrying values of the long lived tangible and intangible assets with finite lives indicates impairment of such assets  we may determine that shorter estimated useful lives are more appropriate 
in that event  we will be required to record additional depreciation and amortization in future periods  which will reduce our earnings 
factors we generally consider important which could trigger an impairment review on the carrying value of other long lived tangible and intangible assets include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  underutilization of our tangible assets  discontinuance of product lines by ourselves or our customers  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  significant decline in our market capitalization relative to net book value 
although we believe that the carrying value of our long lived tangible and intangible assets was realizable as of december   future events could cause us to conclude otherwise 
due to our two acquisitions subsequent to december   goodwill and other intangible assets may be created as a result of the allocation of the purchase price of the business acquisitions 
the values we may record for goodwill and other intangible assets will represent fair values calculated by independent third party appraisers 
such valuations require us to provide significant estimates and assumptions  which are derived from information obtained from the management of the acquired businesses  and our business plans for the acquired businesses or intellectual property 
critical estimates and assumptions used in the initial valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets include  but are not limited to i future expected cash flows from product sales  customer contracts and acquired developed technologies and patents  ii expected costs to complete any in process research and development projects and commercialize viable products and estimated cash flows from sales of such products  iii the acquired companies brand awareness and market position  iv assumptions about the period of time over which we will continue to use the acquired brand  and v discount rates 
these estimates and assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate because unanticipated events and circumstances may occur 
if estimates and assumptions used to initially value goodwill and intangible assets prove to be inaccurate  ongoing reviews of the carrying values of such goodwill and intangible assets may indicate impairment which will require us to record an impairment charge in the period in which we identify the impairment 
as of december   we do not have any goodwill recorded 
we will perform annual impairment reviews on the carrying values of goodwill  if any  arising from the aforementioned acquisitions using the discounted cash flows approach 
because future cash flows and operating results used in the impairment review will be based on management s projections and assumptions  future events could cause such projections to differ from those used to originally value the acquisitions  which could lead to significant impairment charges of goodwill in the future 
secure credentials revenue and cost recognition during the third quarter of  we adopted the provisions of emerging issues task force  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  or eitf  on a cumulative basis as of january  eitf governs how to identify whether goods or services  or both  to be delivered separately in a bundled sales arrangement should be accounted for separately 
we have determined that our secure credentials contracts involve the provision of multiple elements 
the first element consists of hardware  system design  implementation  training  consumables management  maintenance and support which is accounted for as equipment and related executory services under lease in accordance with financial accounting standards board statement no 
 or fasb the second element 
table of contents consists of customized software which is accounted for as a long term contract in accordance with aicpa statement of position  software revenue recognition  or sop  and statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts  or sop  on a units of delivery method of measurement 
costs related to the hardware element of our secure credentials contracts are capitalized on the balance sheet and are depreciated over the contract term beginning when the system goes into service 
our secure credentials contracts typically require us to customize  design  and install equipment and software at customer locations  as well as perform training  supply consumables  maintain the equipment and provide support services 
nonperformance of training  consumables management  maintenance and support services would prevent us from receiving payment for the costs incurred in the customization  design and installation of the system 
eitf limits the amount of revenue allocable to the customization  design and installation of the system to the amount that is not contingent upon the production of credentials 
revenue on these contracts under eitf is earned based on  and is contingent upon  the production of credentials from the system 
due to the contingent performance of credential production in our secure credentials contracts  we defer revenue recognition for the system design and installation phase of our contracts  including customized software and equipment and recognize revenue as credentials are produced 
costs related to the customized software element of our secure credentials contracts are capitalized on the balance sheet during the period in which we are designing and installing the system and are amortized over the contract term beginning when the system goes into service 
costs related to this element of our secure credentials contracts incurred after the system is in service are expensed as incurred 
revenue related to this element of our secure credentials contracts is recorded as credentials are produced by the system 
our secure credentials contracts typically provide that the state department of transportation  or similar agency  will pay a fixed price per credential produced utilizing a system we design  implement and support 
our fixed pricing includes charges for the use of the system  materials and the data that is stored on the credentials 
prices under these contracts vary depending on  among other things design and integration complexities  nature and number of workstations and sites installed  projected number of secure credentials to be produced  size of the database  level of post installation involvement that will be required of us  and competitive environment prior to the adoption of eitf  we recognized revenue and costs associated with our secure credentials contracts as a single accounting element using the percentage of completion methodology 
biometrics segment revenue and cost recognition within our biometrics segment  our contracts typically provide for the development  customization and installation of face recognition systems for government agencies  law enforcement agencies and businesses 
these contracts are generally fixed price  and include milestones and acceptance criteria for the various deliverables under the contract 
contract prices vary depending on  among other things  design and integration complexities  the nature and number of workstations and sites  the size of the database  the level of post installation support and the competitive environment 
in certain cases  we provide licenses of off the shelf versions of our face recognition software on a per user basis 

table of contents we recognize revenue under these contracts using the percentage of completion methodology in accordance with sop we use the percentage of completion methodology to account for revenue under these contracts because a high level of certainty exists regarding expected cash flows from these contracts  and a reliable basis exists for determining the percentage of the contract that will be completed at the end of the accounting period we measure the percentage complete as costs are incurred or for contracts based on milestones  revenue is recognized when scheduled performance milestones and customer acceptance criteria have been achieved 
these milestones are specific events or deliverables clearly identified in the contract 
we recognize revenue based on the total milestone billable to the customer less revenue related to any future maintenance requirements 
billings occur under these contracts when the milestone is delivered and accepted by the customer 
milestones can include customized systems  installation and services as defined by the contract 
we record costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings under these contracts as current assets 
we record billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings and accrued contract costs as current liabilities 
revenue related to software licenses of off the shelf face recognition software is recognized in accordance with sop for these software licenses we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed and determinable  collection is probable  and there are no post delivery obligations 
we adopted eitf on a cumulative basis as of january  based on our evaluation of biometrics contracts and the application of the new guidance  the adoption of eitf did not have an impact on the accounting for revenue from biometrics systems under long term contracts 
results of operations year ended december  and revenue our business involves two related segments secure credentials and biometrics 
revenue from our secure credentials segment is derived principally from multi year contracts for systems design and implementation  card production and related services 
revenue from our biometrics segment is derived principally from sales to law enforcement agencies  the federal government  and the gaming industry 
revenue for the year ended december  increased to million from million in after adjusting the results on a pro forma basis for the impact of the accounting change 
the increase in revenue of approximately million resulted from increases of million and million in the secure credentials and biometrics segments  respectively  after adjusting the results on a pro forma basis for the impact of the accounting change 
the increase in the secure credentials segment revenue was the result of credential volume increases in five states generating additional revenue in those states of approximately million 
volume increases in two states resulted from the addition of new types of credentials or from normal fluctuations in credential issuances 
volume increases in the other three states resulted from a full year of card production in in two states and the commencement of card production in the third in in addition to the volume increases  revenue under our contract with another state increased million in due to a full year of delivery on that contract 
we also experienced an increase in revenue of approximately  due to net price per credential increases on 
table of contents contract extensions signed in the increase in revenue in the secure credentials segment was offset by volume decreases under driver s license contracts in two states  which resulted in a decrease in revenue of approximately  the increase in secure credentials revenue for was also offset by decreases in revenue of approximately  under our contracts with two states as a result of the expiration of those contracts in the increase in revenue in the biometrics segment related to an increase in federal government contracts of approximately  and an increase in law enforcement contracts of approximately  we also delivered face recognition solutions to the united arab emirates for the dubai international airport and to alberta  canada in mid  which contributed approximately  of additional revenue combined 
gross margin gross margins increased to for the year ended december  compared to for after adjusting the results on a pro forma basis for the impact of accounting changes 
we expect gross margins on our secure credentials contracts to fluctuate based on changes in period cost of sales as a result of our adoption of eitf due to the fact that in and in the future we will effectively recognize revenue on a fixed price per credential produced by our customers 
if we successfully achieve cost saving measures in the delivery process  we will realize higher gross margins in those periods where the cost savings measures are achieved 
alternatively  in periods where our delivery costs are higher due to service and maintenance requirements  we expect gross margins to decrease for those periods 
the overall increase in gross margin in compared to  after adjusting the results on a pro forma basis for the impact of the accounting change  is due to margin increases in both the secure credentials and biometrics segments 
in the secure credentials segment  gross margins increased to in from in after adjusting the results on a pro forma basis for the impact of the accounting change 
we achieved margin increases on of our active secure credentials contracts in those contracts represented approximately of the total revenue in that segment for the year 
the margin increases were attributable to our commitment to minimize period costs during the card production phase on all of our secure credentials contracts 
we were able to achieve some of these costs savings by minimizing overtime labor charges through better resource management of field service technicians 
in addition  we installed inventory management software in multiple states in  which allows us to better control consumables scrap thus reducing our materials costs 
in addition to these cost savings initiatives  we signed contract extensions in five states and began card production in two additional states during  both of which resulted in margin increases for those states 
these increases were offset by gross margin decreases in other states due primarily to decreases in credential volume during the year 
the secure credentials business is a highly competitive  bid based business  which results in pricing pressure for those systems 
in addition  the price of a system is dictated by the customer s specifications for the solution and its functionality 
some of these customer specifications include hardware  customized software  credential volume  number and type of security features on the credentials  and biometric identification on the credentials 
all of these inputs are evaluated in our estimate of the cost of the system and ultimately influence the pricing for the system to be delivered 
we are also aware of the customer s budget situation since this affects how much the customer can spend on the system 
after all of these factors are considered  we price the contract and determine the gross margin for the system to be delivered 
the price and margin fluctuate by customer due to the number of locations  volume of credentials  requirements and complexity of the system and competitive environment 
although prices remain fixed for products and services on a contract by contract basis  fluctuations in gross margin are attributable to changes in the customer mix  change orders and contract extensions received 
gross margins in our biometrics segment increased to in from in due to our improved efficiency in delivering biometrics solutions in the current year  as well as margin adjustments on selected projects in as we enhance our biometrics solutions  systems and delivery process  we expect that our internal processes around production and sourcing of hardware coupled with improved efficiency in the delivery of the solution should result in improving margins 
we realized some of this efficiency in 
table of contents we expect that gross margins in the future will include non cash amortization expenses related to the portion of the purchase price of zn and tdt that is allocated to the intangible assets resulting from revenue and cash flow generated by acquired development and contracts 
we are in the process of valuing the zn and tdt transactions and will assign a portion of the purchase price to these intangible assets based on the outcome of those valuations 
the intangible assets recorded will be amortized through cost of sales over the useful lives of these assets and may have a significant impact on our gross margins throughout that period 
sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses decreased approximately  to million for the year ended december  from million in as a percentage of revenue  sales and marketing expenses decreased to in from in after adjusting the results on a pro forma basis for the impact of accounting changes 
the decrease is primarily due to a decrease in the number of driver s license contracts coming up for bid in within the secure credentials segment as a result of delays within certain states due to budgetary constraints 
the bid and proposal process related to the secure credentials contracts for state driver s license contracts generally requires the involvement of our technology personnel as we devise the system architecture during this phase that satisfies the states requirements in the proposal 
as proposal volume was down in  there was increased focus of these resources in other areas  specifically on the delivery of the systems that were contracted in we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars and decrease as a percentage of revenue in this increase will result from of our acquisitions of sales and marketing resources at zn and tdt 
in addition  we will continue our investment in increasing the awareness and demand for identity solutions  support our growth strategy in the federal marketplace and continue our focus on the civil and criminal identification opportunities 
research and development expenses research and development expenses decreased approximately  to million for the year ended december  from million in as a percentage of revenue  research and development expenses decreased to from in after adjusting the results on a pro forma basis for the impact of accounting changes 
these decreases are the result of a restructuring and workforce reduction in the fourth quarter of  as well as a decrease in our internal investment in research and development during anticipating the contribution that the zn acquisition will bring to our research and development initiatives in the future 
development costs that benefited specific projects were recorded as cost of revenues and costs that did not benefit specific projects were recorded as research and development expenses 
software development costs we have capitalized subsequent to achieving technological feasibility have not been material 
we expect research and development expenses to decrease in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue in these decreases will result from an increase in funded research projects to leverage our research and development initiatives in the united states and abroad 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses remained relatively flat at million for the years ended december  and  increasing by approximately  as a percentage of revenue  general and administrative expenses decreased to in from in after adjusting results on a pro forma basis for the impact of accounting changes 
the slight increase in general and administrative expenses was due to the logistical support required to grow our business through acquisitions while continuing to meet the financing requirements created by our expanding operations 
the benefits that we experienced related to the restructuring in and other cost savings initiatives were offset by additional expenses related to new strategic actions taken in additional general and administrative expenses related to these actions included  of expense related to new strategic hires   of expenses related to additional employee terminations in   of expenses related to pursuing new financing opportunities and  of additional professional fees related to our contract in georgia 
we expect general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars and decrease as a percentage of revenue in primarily due to our acquisitions of zn and tdt 
in addition to the additional headcount in we expect additional overhead expenses related to facilities  human resources  administration and reporting 

table of contents interest expense interest expense  net of approximately  and  of interest income in and  respectively  increased approximately  for the year ended december  to  from  in the increase in interest expense reflects the additional debt financing required to support contract delivery in other income for the year ended december  we had other income of  related to a gain on the sale of certain card printer assets 
there was no other income recognized for the year ended december  income taxes no provision for federal income taxes has been made for the years ended december  and due to the net loss in both periods 
for the year ended december   the provision for state income taxes was approximately  there was no provision for state income taxes for the year ended december  cumulative effect of change in accounting principle for the year ended december   we incurred a non cash charge of million representing the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle related to our adoption of eitf on a cumulative basis as of january  year ended december  and revenue revenue increased to million for the year ended december  from million in revenue in the secure credentials segment increased by million  or  as a result of winning new drivers license contracts 
revenue in the biometrics segment increased by million  or  due to revenue generated from acquisitions and the continued organic growth of that business 
the revenue generated from biometrics solutions in both segments increased by million  or  from million in to million in  which was a result of an increase in the use of biometrics technology by some states in the production of drivers licenses and other credentials 
after adjusting the and results on a pro forma basis for the impact of accounting changes  revenue increased to million in from million in revenue in the secure credentials segment increased by million  or as a result of increased credential volumes from recently implemented drivers license contracts beginning card production in revenue in the biometrics segment does not change on a pro forma basis 
gross margin gross margins decreased to for the year ended december  from in the decline in gross margin reflects a change in product mix and contracts that included product development as well as delays in contract awards expected in the biometrics segment 
this is evidenced by the improvement in gross margins from the first quarter of of to in the forth quarter of that year 
in  new contracts in the secure credentials segment accounted for of our revenue and had a combined gross margin of 
in  new contracts accounted for of our revenue and had a combined gross margin of 
the gross margin excluding new contracts would have been for  as compared to in after adjusting the and results on a pro forma basis for the impact of accounting changes  gross margins decreased to for the year ended december  from in the decline in gross margin reflects a change in product mix reducing the percentage of revenue recognized on secure credentials contracts and included a higher percentage of biometrics contracts that yielded lower margins in the biometrics segment in total averaged margins of in compared to in 
table of contents sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses increased by approximately million for the year ended december  from the prior year 
this represents an increase to from of revenue 
the increase was due to our investment in pursuing biometrics opportunities following the events of september  and the pursuit of significant opportunities in the secure credentials marketplace 
our expenses resulted from our increased presence and sponsorship at security related trade shows  additional resource allocation to pursue opportunities in the federal government sector and an increase in sales and marketing personnel 
the expenses associated with these activities included million of compensation expenses for new hires  million for the reallocation of resources for sales support  million associated with lobbyists and marketing consultants and an increase of million in travel expenses to support lobbying and marketing activities 
the result of this investment can be seen in the increase to our revenue  backlog  and customer base 
research and development expenses research and development expenses increased by approximately million for the year ended december  from the prior year 
this represents an increase to from of revenue 
the increase is due to our continued investment in face recognition technologies and new product development 
this included enhancing existing products with the intellectual property that was acquired through the recent acquisitions 
our expenses included million of compensation expenses for new hires   for outside research consultants and  for additional leased office space for new hires 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased by approximately million for the year ended december  from the prior year 
this represents an increase to from of revenue 
this increase was due to additional rental costs of approximately  arising from additional leased office space and an increased rental rate on previously occupied space  million in compensation expenses including placement fees for new hires   for outside consultants and a write down of a contract receivable of  as a result of the acquisitions in  and to facilitate the growth of the business  we also increased investment in infrastructure and personnel 
restructuring charge we incurred a one time restructuring charge of  in the fourth quarter of this consisted of approximately  associated with a workforce reduction of individuals  or approximately of the employee base 
in addition  we took a charge for non cancelable lease costs and capital equipment of approximately  and  respectively 
annualized savings associated with the workforce reduction are expected to total approximately million 
interest expense interest expense decreased approximately  for the year ended december  from the prior year 
this represents a decrease to from of revenue 
this decrease reflects the impact of our continuing efforts to reduce our overall debt and related interest expense  as well as the ability to pay down a  operating line of credit with the proceeds of the million private placement of common stock in december income taxes we did not record any income tax for fiscal years and due to the net loss in each year 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents were approximately million at december   which consisted entirely of cash 
this amount excludes approximately million  which is restricted under our term loan agreements and project financing 
cash and cash equivalents at december  were approximately million  which consisted entirely of cash 
this number excludes approximately million  which was restricted under our term loan agreements and project financing 

table of contents for the year ended december   cash provided by operating activities was approximately million  after the impact of the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle  which stems from our net loss of approximately million  offset by non cash charges for depreciation and amortization of approximately million  the non cash charge for the change in accounting principle of million  and cash provided by the net change in operating assets and liabilities of approximately million 
accounts receivable decreased approximately from approximately million at december  to approximately million at december  due to the timing of billings and our continued efforts to collect accounts receivable in a timely manner to minimize our days sales outstanding 
costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings decreased from million at january   the balance after recording the change in accounting principle  to million at december  this decrease primarily related to an increase of amounts billed on our milestone payment contracts 
accounts payable and accrued expenses increased by approximately from million at january   the balance after recording the change in accounting principle  to million at december  due to the timing of payables 
in may we entered into a loan agreement with lau  which provided for four term notes aggregating million  but not to exceed an outstanding principal balance of million at any time 
two of these term notes  in the amounts of approximately million and  replaced existing system finance lease obligations we had with a commercial leasing organization 
these finance lease obligations were paid in full with the proceeds of the two new term notes 
the remaining two new term notes totaling million and million  are additional financing related to two new state contracts 
all four new term notes bear interest at a rate of 
we believe that the terms of this loan agreement are the same as the terms that would have been provided to us by an unaffiliated lender 
the financial covenants under this loan agreement are the same as the financial covenants under our loan agreement with our primary bank lender 
we draw funding on these notes as needed to meet our obligations for equipment purchases on the related state contracts 
as of december   we had approximately million outstanding under this loan agreement  leaving approximately million available for future needs 
in may  we entered into a new loan agreement with commerce bank and trust company commerce that superseded the original loan agreement for our existing term loans 
the following table lists the approximate term note information for the bank and lau as of the dates indicated in thousands lender original loan amount monthly payment provision date of loan due date interest rate outstanding principal balance december  commerce commerce commerce commerce commerce lau lau lau lau in accordance with the new loan agreements  all of our term notes are collateralized by certain of our assets and the related contract assets 
we are required to maintain the following financial covenants under the agreements in effect at december  in every fiscal year after january   our secure identification segment must have positive net income  excluding income taxes  
table of contents in at least three quarters of each of our fiscal years after january   our secure identification segment must have positive net income  excluding income taxes  if the secure identification segment has a net loss  that net loss may not exceed  our net loss for the last three fiscal quarters of  excluding income taxes  may not exceed   and  respectively  our net loss for the first three fiscal quarters of  excluding income taxes  may not exceed   and  respectively  our net income for the last fiscal quarter of must be at least  excluding income taxes  we must have positive net income  excluding income taxes  beginning with the year ending december  and continuing for each year thereafter  we must have tangible net worth as defined in the loan agreements of at least million at the end of each fiscal quarter beginning with the second fiscal quarter of  the ratio of our indebtedness as defined in the loan agreements to our tangible net worth as defined must not exceed to  at the end of each fiscal quarter  the ratio of our secure identification segment s operating cash flow as defined in the loan agreements for the four most recent fiscal quarters to our debt service liability as defined in the loan agreements shall be at least to  and our capital expenditures in any fiscal year cannot exceed  and no single capital expenditure can exceed  without the lender s prior written approval 
additionally  in accordance with the new agreement  we must maintain million of cash on deposit with commerce bank and trust company 
this amount is recorded as restricted cash in long term assets 
as of december  we had an additional million of restricted cash at commerce related to our loan agreements with lau 
we also have one capital lease arrangement where we are also required to maintain the same financial ratios and minimum levels of tangible capital funds  as stated above 
pursuant to this arrangement  the lessor purchases certain of our digital identification systems and leases them back to us for deployment with identified and contracted customers approved by the lessor 
the lessor retains title to systems and has an assignment of our rights under the related customer contracts  including rights to use the software and technology underlying the related systems 
under these arrangements  the lessor bears the credit risk associated with payments by our customers  but we bear performance and appropriation risk and are generally required to repurchase a system in the event of a termination by a customer for any reason except credit default 
these project lease arrangements are accounted for as capital leases 
at december  and  we had approximately  and million outstanding under these lease financing arrangements respectively 
we are in compliance with our lender covenants at december  while we believe that we will remain in compliance with all debt covenants in future periods  compliance with such covenants is dependent on achieving our business plan 
if we do not remain in compliance with our covenants  the banks and the lessor could require immediate repayment of outstanding amounts 
in april we entered into an arrangement for approximately million of equipment financing with three of our suppliers 
these project lease arrangements are accounted for as capital leases 
there are no financial covenants associated with these leasing arrangements 
as of december  we have outstanding  under these arrangements 
the interest rates on these capital leases are between and and are fixed 
the terms of these leases range from months to months 
in august we entered into an arrangement for financing of database licenses with another vendor 
as of december  we have outstanding  under this arrangement 

table of contents on september   we sold an aggregate of  shares of our common stock  at a purchase price of per share  in a private sale to institutional investors 
the gross proceeds were approximately million before investment fees and related expenses of approximately million 
in addition  on january  we sold an additional  shares of our common stock at per share in a private sale to the same institutional investors following the closing of the zn acquisition 
the acquisition of zn was funded by the issuance of new shares of our common stock 
on february   we funded the acquisition of tdt with million of available cash and executed a related party note for an additional million in addition to the issuance of new shares of our common stock 
on february   we entered into a loan agreement for an additional million of debt financing under a new loan agreement with commerce that superseded the prior loan agreement for our existing term loans 
we also negotiated a reduction of the required restricted cash balance from million to million under this new loan agreement 
we believe that our existing cash balances and anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our operating requirements for at least the next months 
however  if we cannot achieve our operating goals in or if we win additional secure credential contracts in  we may be required to seek additional financing 
there can be no assurance that such financing will be available on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
our ability to meet our business forecast is dependent on a number of factors  including those described in the section of this report entitled factors that may affect future results 
contractual obligations the following table sets forth our contractual obligations as of december  in thousands total less than year to years to years more than years long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations our principal contractual commitments involve payments under capital leases  term notes and operating leases 
the table above does not include the related party note for million executed in conjunction with our acquisition of tdt in february this note is payable in three equal installments of principal and interest on december   may  and december  the interest rate on the note is

recent accounting pronouncements in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
which amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities under sfas no 
in particular  sfas no 
clarifies under what circumstances a contract with an initial net investment meets the characteristic of a derivative discussed in sfas no 
 clarifies when a derivative contains a financing component  amends the definition of an underlying as initially defined in sfas no 
to conform it to language used in fin no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  and amends certain other 
table of contents existing pronouncements 
sfas no 
is effective for all contracts entered into or modified after june   subject to certain exceptions 
the adoption of this statement did not have an impact on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity  which establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas no 
requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability or an asset in some circumstances  while many of such instruments were previously classified as equity or mezzanine equity 
the statement also requires that income statement treatment be consistent with the balance sheet classification 
that is  if the instrument is classified as a liability  payments to the holders are interest expense  not dividends  and changes in value are recorded in earnings 
the statement relates to three specific categories of instruments mandatorily redeemable shares  freestanding written put options and forward contracts that obligate an entity to purchase its own shares  and freestanding contracts that obligate an entity to pay with its own shares in amounts that are either unrelated  or inversely related  to the price of the shares 
sfas no 
is effective immediately for financial instruments entered into or modified after may  and otherwise is effective in the first interim period beginning after june  the adoption of this statement did not have an impact on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
in january   the fasb issued financial interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  or fin  which requires the consolidation of certain variable interest entities 
in december  the fasb issued a revision to fin the revised fin  which replaces the original fin issued in january  clarifies the application of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements  to certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support 
while this interpretation exempts certain entities from its requirements  it also expands the definition of a variable interest entity vie to a broader group of entities than those previously considered special purpose entities spe s and specifies the criteria under which it is appropriate for an investor to consolidate vie s 
application of the revised fin is required in financial statements of public entities that have interest in structures that are commonly referred to as spe s for periods ending after december  for all other types of vie s  application of the revised fin by public entities is required for periods ending after march  the application of this interpretation with respect to structures commonly referred to as spe s did not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
we currently do not expect the application of this interpretation with respect to other types of vie s to have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
in december  the securities and exchange commission published sab no 
 revenue recognition 
sab no 
was effective upon issuance and supersedes sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  and rescinds the accounting guidance contained in sab no 
related to multiple element revenue arrangements that was superseded by eitf issue no 
accordingly  sab no 
rescinds portions of the interpretive guidance included in topic of the codification of staff accounting bulletins 
while the wording of sab no 
has changed to reflect the guidance of eitf  the revenue recognition principles of sab no 
have remained largely unchanged 
the adoption of sab no 
did not have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
subsequent events on january  we acquired all outstanding shares of zn vision technologies ag in exchange for an aggregate of  newly issued shares of our common stock and in cash 
in addition  we agreed to assume zn s employee share option plan  and accordingly have reserved  shares of our common stock for issuance to the plan participants 
the aggregate consideration for the acquisition was million  based on 
table of contents the per share price of our common stock of per share on the date on which the acquisition was completed 
this amount does not represent the value of the acquisition for financial accounting purposes 
zn is a leading german provider of face recognition and computer vision products and services 
zn  now known as viisage technology ag  is a wholly owned subsidiary of viisage and serves as the base of our european operations 
on january   we sold  shares of our common stock at per share in a private sale to certain institutional investors which had purchased shares from us in a private sale in september on february  we acquired all outstanding shares of trans digital technologies corporation tdt for million in cash and stock 
this amount does not represent the value of the acquisition for financial accounting purposes 
the purchase price consisted of  newly issued shares of our common stock  which were valued at based upon the average of the closing price for trading days prior to the closing date  plus notes and cash valued at million 
tdt is the sole source provider of high security technology and services to the us department of state for the production of us passports 
tdt is a wholly owned subsidiary of viisage 
on february   we entered into a new loan agreement with commerce that superseded the may loan agreement 
under this new agreement  we borrowed an additional million and reduced the required restricted cash balance with commerce by million 
we also negotiated a reduction of million of restricted cash with lau concurrent with the execution of the new loan agreement with commerce 
we are restructuring our bank covenants to account for the impact of the closing of our transactions with zn and tdt in january and february  respectively 
while we believe that we will remain in compliance with all debt covenants in future periods  compliance with such covenants is dependent on achieving our business plan 
if we do not remain in compliance with our covenants  the banks and the lessors could require immediate repayment of outstanding amounts 
factors that may affect future results the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks and uncertainties  including those not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial  may also impair our business 
we may be unable to obtain additional capital required to fund our operations and finance our growth 
the installation of our secure identification systems requires significant capital expenditures 
in addition  the further development of our biometric and other advanced technologies will require additional capital 
although we completed a million private placement of our common stock in september and january and a new loan agreement with a bank in february and have been successful in the past in obtaining financing for working capital and capital expenditures  we will have ongoing capital needs as we expand our business 
we may be unable to obtain additional funds in a timely manner or on acceptable terms  which would render us unable to fund our operations or expand our business 
if we are unable to obtain capital when needed  we may have to restructure our business or delay or abandon our development and expansion plans 
our leverage creates financial and operating risks that could limit the growth of our business 
we have a significant amount of indebtedness 
as of december   we had approximately million in short and long term debt and lease financing 
in connection with our acquisition of trans digital technologies  we incurred additional indebtedness of million in long term debt in february our leverage could have important consequences to our business including limiting our ability to obtain necessary financing for future working capital  limiting our ability to finance the acquisition of equipment needed to meet customer requirements  
table of contents limiting our ability to finance the development of new technologies  requiring that we use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations for debt service and not other operating purposes  and requiring that we comply with financial and operating covenants  which could cause an event of default under our debt instruments 
our ability to make principal and interest payments under long term indebtedness and bank loans will be dependent upon our future performance  which is subject to financial  economic and other factors affecting us  some of which are beyond our control 
we derive over of our revenue from government contracts  which are often non standard  involve competitive bidding  may be subject to cancellation with or without penalty and may produce volatility in earnings and revenue 
more than of our business involves providing products and services under contracts with us federal  state  local and foreign government agencies 
obtaining contracts from government agencies is challenging  and government contracts often include provisions that are not standard in private commercial transactions 
for example  government contracts may include provisions that allow the government agency to terminate the contract without penalty under some circumstances  be subject to purchasing decisions of agencies that are subject to political influence  contain onerous procurement procedures  and be subject to cancellation if government funding become unavailable 
foreign government contracts generally include comparable provisions relating to termination for the convenience of the relevant foreign government 
securing government contracts can be a protracted process involving competitive bidding 
in many cases  unsuccessful bidders may challenge contract awards  which can lead to increased costs  delays and possible loss of the contract for the winning bidder 
we derive a significant portion of our revenue from a few customers  the loss of which could have an adverse effect on our revenues 
for the year ended december   two customers  pennsylvania department of transportation and illinois secretary of state  each accounted for over of our revenues and an aggregate of of our revenue 
in december  the us department of justice issued an indictment against former governor of illinois george ryan and an updated indictment against former lobbyist lawrence e 
warner on bribery and related federal racketeering charges 
viisage had a formal consultative relationship with mr 
warner s firm pursuant to which viisage paid that firm fees of approximately  upon learning of the initial indictment of mr 
warner in  viisage immediately terminated its contract and relationship with mr 
warner and his firm 
there has been no assertion of any impropriety on the part of viisage 
for  two customers  connecticut department of information technology and mississippi department of information technology services  each accounted for over of our revenues and an aggregate of of our revenue 
for  four customers  illinois secretary of state  unisys corporation florida department of safety and motor vehicles  kentucky transportation cabinet and pennsylvania department of transportation  each accounted for over of our revenue and an aggregate of of our revenue 
since a small number of customers under our drivers license contracts account for a substantial portion of our revenues  the loss of any of our significant customers would cause revenue to decline and could have a material adverse effect on our business 

table of contents litigation involving our contract with georgia could result in the cancellation of that contract which could cause us to lose million in revenues over the next years and could result in a loss of up to million 
in july  a georgia court issued a preliminary injunction prohibiting georgia s department of motor vehicle safety from continuing to work with us to install the state s new driver s license system 
the injunction is the result of a lawsuit filed in march by one of our competitors alleging that that the department of motor vehicle safety did not comply with its own bid process when it selected a vendor for its digital drivers license program 
the merits of the lawsuit are to be addressed in further court proceedings 
the department of motor vehicle safety has confirmed that its contract with us remains in place 
however  if the lawsuit is successful and viisage loses the contract  we could lose up to million in revenue that we expected to recognize over the next years 
in addition  although viisage expects that the department of motor vehicle safety would be required to reimburse viisage for its costs incurred under the contract  if viisage is unable to obtain reimbursement of those costs  viisage could recognize a loss of up to approximately million for costs incurred to date on the georgia contract 
the adoption of eitf resulted in a non cash adjustment of million and may have an adverse effect on our results of operations in the near term  which may depress the market price of our common stock 
during the third quarter of  we adopted the provisions of emerging issues task force  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  or eitf  on a cumulative basis as of january  after discussions with the securities and exchange commission staff regarding the effect of eitf on revenue recognition on our secure credentials contracts  we decided to adopt eitf via cumulative catch up as of january  rather than prospectively as reflected in the previously filed form q for the quarter ended september  the adoption of eitf resulted in a non cash adjustment reported as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of million 
the adoption of eitf affects the timing of revenue recognition under our secure credentials contracts and as a result we may report reduced revenue and an increased net loss for one or more of our fiscal quarters in this effect on our results of operations could cause our stock price to decline 
our strategy of expanding our face recognition business could adversely affect our business operations and financial condition 
part of our strategy is to enhance our leadership in face recognition technology and to expand our operations within our facial recognition business segment 
pursuing this strategy involves risks 
for instance  to date  face recognition security solutions have not gained widespread commercial acceptance 
some of the obstacles to widespread acceptance of face recognition security solutions include a perceived loss of privacy and public perceptions as to the usefulness of face recognition technologies 
whether the market for face recognition security solutions will expand will be dependent upon factors such as the success of our marketing efforts and publicity campaigns and those of our competitors  and customer satisfaction with our products and services  as well as those of our competitors 
we do not know when  if ever  face recognition security solutions will gain widespread commercial acceptance 
in addition  our face recognition business segment has not achieved profitability  and it may never achieve profitability 
we face intense competition  which could result in lower revenues and higher research and development expenditures and could adversely affect our results of operations 
the events of september  have heightened interest in the use of biometric security solutions  and we expect competition in this field  which is already substantial  to intensify 
competitors are developing and bringing to market biometric security solutions that use face recognition as well as eye  fingerprint and other 
table of contents forms of biometric verification 
our products also will compete with non biometric technologies such as certificate authorities and traditional keys  cards  surveillance systems and passwords 
widespread adoption of one or more of these technologies or approaches in the markets we intend to target could significantly reduce the potential market for our systems and products 
many of our competitors have significantly more cash and resources than we have 
our competitors may introduce products that are competitively priced  have increased performance or functionality or incorporate technological advances that we have not yet developed or implemented 
to remain competitive  we must continue to develop  market and sell new and enhanced systems and products at competitive prices  which will require significant research and development expenditures 
if we do not develop new and enhanced products or if we are not able to invest adequately in our research and development activities  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted 
unless we keep pace with changing technologies  we could lose customers and fail to win new customers 
our future success will depend upon our ability to develop and introduce a variety of new products and services and enhancements to these new products and services in order to address the changing needs of the marketplace 
we may not be able to accurately predict which technologies customers will support 
if we do not introduce new products  services and enhancements in a timely manner  if we fail to choose correctly among technical alternatives or if we fail to offer innovative products and services at competitive prices  customers may forego purchases of our products and services and purchase those of our competitors 
uncertainties in global economic markets could cause delays in customer purchases 
many customers and potential customers have delayed purchase intentions as a result of uncertainties in global economic markets 
government budgets  particularly at state and regional levels  have been or are expected to be reduced notably 
government contracts result from purchasing decisions made by public sector agencies that are particularly sensitive to budget changes and cutbacks during economic downturns  and variations in appropriations cycles 
many us state customers are facing budget cuts  and some international customers are facing debt crises  introducing added uncertainty 
any shift in the government procurement process  which is outside of our control and may not be predictable  could impact the predictability of our quarterly results and may potentially have a material negative effect on our financial position  results of operation or cash flows 
if we do not successfully expand our direct sales and services organizations and partnering arrangements  we may not be able to increase our sales or support our customers 
in the fiscal years ended december  and  we sold substantially all of our services and licensed substantially all of our products through our direct sales organization 
our future success depends on substantially increasing the size and scope of our direct sales force and partnering arrangements  both domestically and internationally 
we will face intense competition for personnel  and we cannot guarantee that we will be able to attract  assimilate or retain additional qualified sales personnel on a timely basis 
moreover  given the large scale deployment required by some of our customers  we will need to hire and retain a number of highly trained customer service and support personnel 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to increase the size of our customer service and support organization on a timely basis to provide the high quality of support required by our customers 
failure to add additional sales and customer service representatives could result in our inability to increase our sales and support our customers 
integration of zn s business may be difficult and will consume significant financial and managerial resources  which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
on january   we completed the acquisition of zn vision technologies ag  or zn  a leading german provider of face recognition and computer vision products and services 
the integration of zn s products and services with ours will be challenging and will consume significant financial and managerial resources 
the challenges involved with this integration include  among others 
table of contents challenges related to technology integration  possible difficulty implementing uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies  and possible loss of key employees 
in addition  the differences between us and german business cultures and the geographic distance between the companies could present significant obstacles to the timely  cost effective integration of the companies 
the significant direct and indirect costs of our acquisition and integration of zn and trans digital technologies could adversely affect our financial performance 
we incurred approximately million of costs in connection with the acquisitions of zn and trans digital technologies or tdt  including costs associated with integrating our business with zn and tdt  financial advisory fees  and costs and expenses for services provided by our lawyers and accountants 
the transaction costs and expenses attributable to financial advisory  legal and accounting services that we incurred will be capitalized as a component of the purchase price 
goodwill associated with the acquisition will be required to be tested at least annually for impairment  and we will be required to record a charge to earnings if there is an impairment in the value of such goodwill at a later date 
other intangible assets acquired in connection with the acquisition will be amortized over their estimated useful lives 
the acquisitions of zn and tdt could result in future impairment charges which could adversely affect our results of operations 
as a result of our acquisitions of zn and tdt subsequent to december   goodwill and other intangible assets may be created 
the values we may record for goodwill and other intangible assets will represent fair values calculated by independent third party appraisers 
such valuations require us to provide significant estimates and assumptions  which are derived from information obtained from the management of the acquired businesses and our business plans for the acquired businesses or intellectual property 
if estimates and assumptions used to initially value goodwill and intangible assets prove to be inaccurate  ongoing reviews of the carrying values of such goodwill and intangible assets may indicate impairments which will require us to record an impairment charge in the period in which we identify the impairments 
if we do not achieve the expected benefits of our acquisitions of zn and tdt  the price of our common stock could decline 
we expect that the acquisition of zn will enhance our leadership in face recognition technology through the combination of our technologies with those of zn 
although the results of the initial tests of our combined technologies have been positive  the combination of such technologies might not meet the demands of the marketplace 
if our technologies fail to meet such demand  customer acceptance of our face recognition solutions could decline  which would have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  we expect that the acquisition of zn will enable us to market our systems and products on a global scale 
our face recognition customers are primarily located in the united states  and zn s customers are primarily located in europe 
we might not be able to market successfully our products and services to zn s customers or zn s products and services to our customers 
we expect that the acquisition of tdt will enhance our position in the market for secure credentials  particularly the us government 
if our product offerings and services fail to meet the demands of this marketplace  our results of operations and financial condition could be 
table of contents adversely affected 
there is also a risk that we will not achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions as rapidly as  or to the extent  anticipated by financial or industry analysts  or that such analysts will not perceive the same benefits to the acquisitions as we do 
if these risks materialize  our stock price could be adversely affected 
the success of our strategic plan to grow sales and develop relationships in europe may be limited by risks related to conducting business in european markets 
although zn has experience marketing and distributing its products and developing strategic relationships in europe  part of our strategy will be to increase sales and build additional relationships in european markets 
risks inherent in marketing  selling and developing relationships in european markets include those associated with  economic conditions in european markets  including fluctuations in the relative values of the us dollar and the euro  taxes and fees imposed by european governments that may increase the cost of products and services  and laws and regulations imposed by individual countries and by the european union 
in addition  european intellectual property laws are different than us intellectual property laws and we will have to ensure that our intellectual property is adequately protected in foreign jurisdictions and that zn s intellectual property is adequately protected in the united states 
if we do not adequately protect our intellectual property rights  competitors could use our proprietary technologies in non protected jurisdictions and put us at a competitive disadvantage 
our business may be impacted by changes in the local marketplace of our foreign operations and fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
our international operations and transactions are subject to risks typical of international operations  including  but not limited to  differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions  and foreign currency exchange rate volatility 
accordingly  our future results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in these or other factors 
if our systems and products do not perform as promised  we could experience increased costs  lower margins  liquidated damage payment obligations and harm to our reputation 
we will be required to provide complex systems that will be required to operate on an as needed basis 
although we will deploy back up systems  the failure of our products to perform as promised could result in increased costs  lower margins  liquidated damage payment obligations and harm to our reputation 
this could result in contract terminations and have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 
misappropriation of our intellectual property could harm our reputation  affect our competitive position and cost us money 
we believe that our intellectual property  including our methodologies  will be critical to our success and competitive position 
if we are unable to protect this intellectual property against unauthorized use by third parties  our reputation among existing and potential customers could be damaged and our competitive position adversely affected 
our strategies to deter misappropriation could be undermined if the proprietary nature or protection of our methodologies is not recognized in the united states or foreign countries  
table of contents third parties misappropriate our proprietary methodologies and such misappropriation is not detected  and competitors create applications similar to ours but which do not technically infringe on our legally protected rights 
if these risks materialize  we could be required to spend significant amounts to defend our rights and divert critical managerial resources 
in addition  our proprietary methodologies may decline in value or our rights to them may become unenforceable 
others could claim that we are infringing on their intellectual property rights  which could result in substantial costs  diversion of managerial resources and harm to our reputation 
although we believe that our products and services do not infringe the intellectual property rights of others  we might not be able to defend successfully against a third party infringement claim 
a successful infringement claim against us could subject us to liability for damages and litigation costs  including attorneys fees  lawsuits that prevent us from further use of the intellectual property  having to license the intellectual property from a third party  which could include significant licensing fees  having to develop a non infringing alternative  which could be costly and delay projects  and having to indemnify clients with respect to losses they incurred as a result of the alleged infringement 
even if we are not found liable in a claim for intellectual property infringement  such a claim could result in substantial costs  diversion of resources and management attention  termination of customer contracts and harm to our reputation 
if we fail to adequately manage our resources  it could have a severe negative impact on our financial results or stock price 
we could be subject to fluctuations in technology spending by existing and potential customers 
accordingly  we will have to actively manage expenses in a rapidly changing economic environment 
this could require reducing costs during economic downturns and selectively growing in periods of economic expansion 
if we do not properly manage our resources in response to these conditions  our results of operations could be negatively impacted 
future acquisitions of companies or technologies may result in disruptions to our business 
beyond the acquisitions of zn and tdt  our growth strategy could include additional acquisitions of companies or technologies that complement ours 
future acquisitions could involve risks inherent in acquisitions  such as challenges associated with integrating acquired technologies and the business and operations of acquired companies  exposure to unknown liabilities  diversion of managerial resources from day to day operations  possible loss of key employees  customers and suppliers  
table of contents higher than expected transaction costs  and additional dilution to our existing stockholders if we use our common stock as consideration 
if we fail to manage these challenges adequately  our results of operations and stock price could be adversely affected 
the loss of key personnel could adversely affect our ability to remain competitive 
we believe that the continued service of our executive officers will be important to our future growth and competitiveness 
we have entered into employment agreements with bernard c 
bailey  our chief executive officer  william aulet  our chief financial officer  jack dillon  our senior vice president  government solutions  and james p 
ebzery  our senior vice president  sales and services 
these agreements are intended to provide the executives with incentives to remain employed by us 
however  we cannot assure you that they will remain employed by us 
in addition  we believe that the continued employment of key members of our technical and sales staff is important to us 
most of our employees are entitled to voluntarily terminate their relationship with us  typically without any  or with only minimal  advance notice 
the process of finding additional trained personnel to carry out our strategy could be lengthy  costly and disruptive 
we might not be able to retain the services of all of our key employees or a sufficient number of them to execute our plans 
in addition  we might not be able to continue to attract new employees as required 
our quarterly results could be volatile and may cause our stock price to fluctuate 
we have experienced fluctuations in quarterly operating results and we expect those fluctuations to continue 
we expect that our quarterly results will continue to be affected by  among other things  factors such as the size and timing of contract awards  the timing of our contract performance  variations in the mix of our products and services  and contract losses and changes in management estimates inherent in accounting for contracts 
we have a history of operating losses 
we have a history of operating losses 
our business operations began in and  except for fiscal years and  have resulted in net losses in each fiscal year 
at december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we will continue to invest in the development of our secure credential and biometric technologies 
accordingly  we cannot predict when or if we will ever achieve profitability 
certain of our stockholders have significant relationships with us  which could result in us taking actions that are not supported by unaffiliated stockholders 
lau technologies  or lau  and mr 
buddy beck beneficially own approximately and  respectively  of our outstanding common stock 
as a result  both lau and mr 
beck have a strong influence on matters requiring approval by our stockholders  including the election of directors and most corporate actions  including mergers and acquisitions
