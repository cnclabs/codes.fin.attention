item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations dollars in thousands 
during the year ended february   we continued to face challenges in the revenue area but we believe that the steps we are taking will improve this situation in the near term 
it is important to note that we have improved the company s earnings on a comparable quarter basis every quarter in fiscal despite the revenue pressures 
we believe that we have responded to the soft economy by diligently improving our operating efficiencies and strengthening our balance sheet to be better positioned for an up turn in our revenues 
as we look ahead to fiscal  we believe that the most critical factors facing us are improving same store revenue  implementing an effective marketing program  the resumption of new store growth and continued improvement in operational cost efficiencies 

table of contents overview our management monitors and analyzes a number of key performance indicators in order to manage our business and evaluate our financial and operating performance 
those indicators include revenues we derive revenues from food and beverage and amusement sales 
comparable store sales are a key performance indicator used within our industry and are indicative of acceptance of our initiatives as well as local economic and consumer trends 
the food component of our business represents approximately percent of our revenue with a gross margin revenues less cost of revenues of around percent 
we introduced our new menu in october with selected price adjustments and will continue to monitor the market for potential price adjustments 
in the beverage component  we offer fully licensed facilities  which means that we have full beverage service throughout the complex 
this component is approximately percent of our revenue with a gross margin of around percent 
we expanded the promotional activity around the beverage component resulting in positive same store beverage sales in we expect to continue to leverage this component 
the amusement component offers traditional games of skill such as billiards and shuffleboard and the million dollar midway features high energy technology games and classic redemption games that dispense tickets  which may be redeemed for prizes 
this component represents approximately percent of our revenue with a gross margin of around percent 
the amusements component of our business has been the softest component with same store revenues down percent in in  we invested in excess of million in new games and will continue to add the latest in new games as they become available and prove to be attractive to our guests 
special event business is a very important component in that we believe over percent of the guests attending a special event are in a dave buster s for the first time 
this is a very advantageous way to introduce the concept to new guests and we have been very successful in turning this component of our business to positive same store performance 
in  it represented over percent of total revenues 
cost of revenues costs of revenues includes the cost of food  beverages and winner s circle amusement items and averages approximately of revenues 
we strive to control our cost of revenues and thereby maintain or improve our gross margins 
our cost of revenues are driven by product mix and pricing movements from third party suppliers 
in  we expect to begin purchasing a number of our winner s circle items direct from asia  which should reduce our overall amusement costs 
operating payroll and benefits operating payroll and benefits were of revenue in operating payroll and benefits expenses consist of wages  employer taxes and benefits for our store personnel 
we continually review the opportunity for cost reductions principally through scheduling refinements 
other store operating expenses other store operating expenses consist of store related occupancy  restaurant expenses  utilities  repair and maintenance and marketing costs 
liquidity and cash flows our primary source of cash flow is from net income and availability under our revolving credit facility 
quarterly fluctuations  seasonality  and inflation as a result of the substantial revenues associated with each new complex  the timing of new complex openings will result in significant fluctuations in quarterly results 
we expect seasonality to be a factor in the operation or results of our business in the future with anticipated lower third quarter revenues due to the fall season and higher fourth quarter revenues associated with the year end holidays 
the effects of supplier price increases are expected to be partially offset by selected menu price increases 
we believe that low inflation rates in our market areas have contributed to stable food and labor costs in recent years 
however  there is no assurance that low inflation rates will continue or that the federal minimum wage rate will not increase

requires that goodwill no longer be amortized to earnings  but instead should be reviewed for impairment at least annually 
under sfas no 
 impairment is deemed to exist when the carrying value of goodwill is greater that it s implied fair value 
this methodology differs from our previous policy  as permitted under accounting standards existing before sfas no 
 of using undiscounted cash flows of the businesses acquired over its estimated life

on august  we closed a million private placement of percent convertible subordinated notes due and warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock at per share 
the investors may convert the notes into our common stock at any time prior to the scheduled maturity date of august  the conversion price is per share  which represents a percent premium over the closing price of our common stock on august  if fully converted  the notes will convert into  shares of our common stock 
after august   we have the right to redeem the notes and we may also force the exercise of the warrants if our common stock trades above a specified price during a specific period of time 
the fair value of the warrants of  was recorded as a discount on the notes  which is amortized over the term of the notes 
as a result  the effective annual interest rate on the notes is percent 
we used the net proceeds of the offering to reduce the outstanding balances of our term and revolving loans under our senior bank credit facility 
we agreed with the bank that up to  of the repaid balance could be borrowed to fund the purchase of the complex in toronto 
on october   we amended our senior bank credit facility 
the current facility includes a  revolving credit facility and a  term debt facility 
borrowings under the revolving credit facility bear interest at a floating rate based on the bank s prime interest rate percent at february  or the one month eurodollar percent at february   plus in each case a margin based on financial performance 
the interest rate on the revolving credit facility was percent at february  borrowings on the term debt facility bear interest at a floating rate based on the three month eurodollar percent at february   or at our option  the bank s prime interest rate percent at february   plus in each case a margin based on financial performance 
the interest rate on the term debt facility was percent at february  the amended facility is secured by all assets of the company 
the amended facility has certain financial covenants including a consolidated tangible net worth  a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio 
any outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility are due at maturity on april  borrowings under the term debt facility are repayable in consecutive quarterly payments of with the final payment due on april  at february    was available under the revolving credit facility 
the fair market value of our long term debt approximates its carrying value 
in  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement that expires in  to change a portion of our variable rate debt to fixed rate debt 
pursuant to the swap agreement  the interest rate on notional amounts aggregating  at february  is fixed at percent 
we are exposed to credit losses for periodic settlements of amounts due under the agreements if libor decreases 
as a result of the swap agreement  we recorded additional interest expense of   and in  and  respectively 

table of contents the market risks associated with the amended agreements are mitigated because increased interest payments under the agreement resulting from reductions in the eurodollar are partially offset by a reduction in interest expense under the debt obligation 
the previous credit facility restricted us from opening any new complexes in fiscal or in any fiscal year thereafter without meeting certain financial covenants as described in the previous amended facility 
we used the net proceeds of the october  offering to reduce the outstanding balances of our term and revolving loans under our senior bank credit facility 
we agreed with the bank that up to  of the repaid debt balance could be borrowed to fund the purchase of the dave buster s complex in toronto  canada  from our canadian licensee 
we plan to construct one new complex in and we will continue to reduce debt and strategically reinvest capital in our stores through game replacement and other projects  which we expect to yield benefits over the long term 
we believe that available cash and cash flow from operations  together with borrowings under the credit facility  will be sufficient to cover our working capital  capital expenditures and debt service needs in the foreseeable future 
our ability to make scheduled payments of principal or interest on  or to refinance  our indebtedness  or to fund planned capital expenditures  will depend on our future performance  which is subject to general economic conditions  competitive environment and other factors 
we may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations  realize anticipated revenue growth and operating improvements or obtain future capital in a sufficient amount or on acceptable terms  to enable us to service our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs 
sale leaseback transactions during the year ended february   the company completed the sale leaseback of two stores atlanta and houston and the corporate headquarters in dallas 
cash proceeds of  were received along with  in twenty year interest bearing notes receivable at percent

no revenue or profit was recorded at the time of the transaction 
upon execution of the sale leaseback transactions  property costs of  and accumulated depreciation of  were removed from the company s books resulting in a loss of that was recognized in and a gain of on one facility being amortized over the term of the operating lease 
future operating lease obligations under the sale leaseback agreements are as follows total thereafter future minimum note payments and interest income associated with the sale leasebacks at san diego  houston and atlanta are as follows total thereafter

management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
accounting policies depreciable lives expenditures for new facilities and those that substantially increase the useful lives of the property  including interest during construction  are capitalized along with equipment purchases at cost 
these costs are depreciated over various methods based on an estimate of the depreciable life  resulting in a charge to the operating results of the company 
the actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the depreciable lives are as follows property and equipment buildings years leasehold and building improvements shorter of years or lease term furniture  fixtures and equipment to years games years reviews are performed regularly to determine whether facts or circumstances exist that indicate the carrying values of our property and equipment are impaired 
we assess the recoverability of our property and equipment by comparing the projected future undiscounted net cash flows associated with these assets to their respective carrying amounts 
impairment  if any  is based on the excess of the carrying amount over the estimated fair market value of the assets 
debt covenants the company s credit facility requires compliance with certain financial covenants including a minimum consolidated tangible net worth level  maximum leverage ratio and minimum fixed charge coverage 
the company believes the results of operations for the fiscal year ending february  and thereafter would enable the company to remain in compliance with the existing covenants absent any material negative event affecting the us economy as a whole 
however  the company s expectations of future operating results and continued compliance with the debt covenants cannot be assured and the lenders actions are not controllable by the company 
if the projections of future operating results are not achieved and the debt is placed in default  the company would experience a material adverse impact on its reported financial position and results of operations
