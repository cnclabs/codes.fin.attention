item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion provides management s analysis of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of sterling financial corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries  bank of lancaster county  na  first national bank of north east  bank of hanover and trust company  hovb investment co  t c leasing  inc t c  pennbanks insurance company  spc  church capital management llc  bainbridge securities inc and sterling mortgage services  inc inactive 
the consolidated financial statements also include town country leasing  llc  sterling financial trust company and equipment finance  llc  all wholly owned subsidiaries of bank of lancaster county 
management s discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and footnotes appearing elsewhere in this report and is intended to assist in understanding and evaluating the major changes in the financial condition and results of operations of the company with a primary focus in sterling s performance 
critical accounting policies sterling s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and follow general practices within the industries in which it operates 
application of these principles require management to make estimates  assumptions  and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates  assumptions  and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements  accordingly  as this information changes  the financial statements could reflect different estimates  assumptions  and judgments 
certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates  assumptions  and judgments and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported 
estimates  assumptions  and judgments are necessary when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value  when a decline in the value of an asset not carried on the financial statements at fair value warrants an impairment write down or valuation reserve to be established  or when an asset or liability needs to be recorded contingent upon a future event 
carrying assets and liabilities at fair value inherently results in more financial statement volatility 
the fair values and the information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based either on quoted market prices or are provided by other third party sources  when available 
when third party information is not available  valuation adjustments are estimated in good faith by management primarily through the use of internal cash flow modeling techniques 
the most significant accounting policies followed by sterling are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
these policies  along with the disclosures presented in the other financial statement notes and in this financial review  provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined 
based on the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods  assumptions  and estimates underlying those amounts  management has identified the determination of the allowance for loan losses and the evaluation of goodwill impairment to be the accounting areas that require the most subjective or complex judgments  and as such could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available 
the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses is considered a critical accounting estimate because it requires significant judgment and the use of estimates related to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans  estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience  and consideration of current economic trends and conditions  all of which may be susceptible to significant change 
the loan portfolio also represents the largest asset type on the consolidated balance sheet 
note to the consolidated financial statements describes the methodology used to determine the allowance for loan losses 
with the adoption of sfas no 
on january   sterling is no longer required to amortize goodwill resulting from business acquisitions 
goodwill is now subject to impairment testing at least annually to determine whether write downs of the recorded balances are necessary 
sterling tests for impairment based on the goodwill maintained at each defined reporting unit 
an independent party using various market valuation methodologies determines a fair value 
if the fair values of the reporting units exceed their book values  no write downs of recorded goodwill are necessary 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its book value  an impairment expense may be required to be recorded to write down the related goodwill to the proper carrying value 
sterling completed its annual impairment testing and determined that no impairment write offs were necessary 
no assurance can be given that future impairment tests will not result in a charge to earnings 
any material effect on the financial statements related to these critical accounting areas is also discussed in this management discussion and analysis 
non gaap presentations this management s discussion and analysis refers to the efficiency ratio  that is a non gaap financial measure that we believe provides readers with important information regarding sterling s operational efficiency 
comparison of sterling s efficiency ratio with other companies may not be appropriate  as they may calculate their efficiency ratio in a different manner 
the efficiency ratio is computed by dividing noninterest expense  less depreciation on operating leases  by the sum of tax equivalent net interest income and noninterest income  less depreciation on operating leases 
sterling nets the depreciation on operating leases against related income  as it is consistent with utilizing net interest income presentation for comparable capital leases  which nets interest expense against interest income 
the efficiency ratio excludes unusual items  including gains losses on securities activities  interest collected on charged off loans  etc 
sterling  in referring to its net income  is referring to income determined in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
inflation and interest rates the majority of assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature and  therefore  differ greatly from most commercial and industrial companies that have significant investments in fixed assets or inventories 
however  inflation does have an important impact on the growth of total assets and on noninterest expenses  which tend to rise during periods of general inflation 
inflationary pressures over the last few years have been modest  although the potential for future inflationary pressure is always present given changing trends in the economy 
fluctuations in interest rates impact financial institutions far more than inflationary factors 
during the past two years  the federal reserve has lowered interest rates only twice  a basis point reduction in june and a basis point reduction in november the stability in interest rates throughout was in sharp contrast to  in which interest rates were cut eleven times  resulting in a reduction of the prime lending rate by bp management recognizes that asset liability management  including the effect of rate changes on interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  is of critical importance 
results of operations all dollar amounts presented within tables are in thousands  except per share data 
executive overview sterling s executive management team and board of directors have identified three performance measurements that they feel are key elements of enhancing shareholder value 
these include a increase in earnings per share  b return on realized equity  and c efficiency ratio 
the primary source of sterling s revenues  are net interest income derived from investments  which would include loans and investments  less their deposit and borrowing funding costs  as well as fees from financial services provided to customers  including rental income on operating leases 
revenues are influenced by general economic factors  including market interest rates  the economy of the markets served  stock market conditions  as well as competitive forces within the markets 
despite a low interest rate environment and overall decline in the financial services industry s net interest margin  sterling was able to improve its net interest margin  from and in and  to in the improvement was primarily the result of a shift in the composition of sterling s interest earning assets  away from lower yielding federal funds and securities to higher yielding loans  particularly commercial loans and finance receivables 
net interest income increased to  in  compared to  in and  in noninterest income  excluding securities gains and losses  has also benefited from the present market conditions as noted by the growth experience  and was   and  in  and as a result of the low interest rate environment  sterling experienced an unprecedented volume of mortgage loan originations which contributed to growth in mortgage banking income  including mortgage servicing income and the gain on sale of loans  to  in  compared to  in and  in in addition  improvement in the equity market supported growth in income from fiduciary activities and commissions and fees 
supplementing the improvement in the equity market was the acquisition of church capital management llc  a registered investment advisor  and bainbridge securities  inc  a nasd registered broker dealer in the fourth quarter of  which generated additional non margin related fees 
industry projections are that mortgage loan originations are projected to fall off during  which will adversely impact sterling s future mortgage banking revenues 
a full year of fees and commissions at church and bainbridge should partially offset the lost mortgage production revenues 
as a result of the growth sterling has experienced in its revenues over the past three years  noninterest expense has also increased to  in  compared to  in and  in the increase in revenues that sterling has experienced can be attributed to our relationship management model  which has resulted in new customer relationships  new financial services products being offered to meet their needs  and expansion of our market in to new geographic regions 
these efforts have resulted in increases in salaries and employee benefits  higher occupancy and equipment charges  and other noninterest expenses 
sterling s overall strategy is to enhance growth in existing markets and affiliates  and complement this with new products and services  through the leveraging of existing resources 
this has resulted in net income of  or per diluted share in  compared to  or per diluted share in  and  or per diluted share in this represents an increase in diluted earnings per diluted share in  over results  and a increase in over results 
sterling s efficiency ratio  which expresses noninterest expenses a percentage of tax equivalent net interest income and noninterest income  improved to in  compared to and in and as a result of the increased earnings levels and improved efficiency ratio  returns on average realized equity also demonstrated improvement  and were  and in  and a more thorough discussion of sterling s results of operations is included in the following pages 
net interest income the primary component of sterling s revenue is net interest income  which is the difference between interest income and fees on interest earning assets and interest expense on interest bearing funds 
earning assets include loans  securities and federal funds sold 
interest bearing funds include deposits and borrowed funds 
to compare the tax exempt yields to taxable yields  amounts are adjusted to pretax equivalents based on a federal corporate income tax rate 
net interest income is affected by changes in interest rates  volume of interest bearing assets and liabilities and the composition 
the interest rate spread and net interest margin are two common statistics related to changes in net interest income 
the interest rate spread represents the difference between the yields earned on interest earning assets and the rates paid for interest bearing liabilities 
the net interest margin is defined as the percentage of taxable equivalent net interest income to average earning assets 
due mainly to demand deposits and stockholders equity  the net interest margin exceeds the interest rate spread  as these funding sources are non interest bearing 
table presents net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis  interest rate spread and net interest margin for the years ending december    and table analyzes the changes in net interest income for the periods broken down by their rate and volume components 
net interest income  on a tax equivalent basis  totaled  in compared to  for excluding the interest recovery on a charged off loan and  in the increase in net interest income of  from to reflects both an increase in the average balance of interest earning assets as well as a shift in the mix of interest earning assets that led to a bp increase in net interest margin 
the increase in interest earning assets came primarily in the form of loans 
in fact  the growth in loans exceeded the growth in earning assets  reflecting the funding of a portion of the loan growth with securities portfolio cash flow and overnight fed funds over the past year 
strong growth in the commercial loan and finance receivable portfolios as well as consumer loans and leases contributed to the increase in total loans 
year over year  average loans increased million  increasing the percentage of loans to interest earning assets from in to in generally  loans carry a higher yield than alternative interest earning assets  primarily securities and other investments 
funding for the growth in assets came from deposits  borrowings  and earnings retained in stockholders equity 
strong growth was experienced in demand and savings deposits while the average balance of time deposits for the year increased at a relatively modest amount 
over the past year  sterling experienced a significant volume of maturing cds at high interest rates 
during that time  current cd rates were consciously held at the now lower market levels 
during  sterling issued  of trust preferred redeemable equity securities through sterling capital trust ii  which qualified as regulatory capital 
as a result  sterling could leverage the increased capital by borrowing  from the federal home loan bank to purchase investment securities and were used for maturities of other fhlb borrowings and the continued pay downs of third party borrowings that had been used to fund both finance receivables and operating leases 
the increase in net interest margin from to continued for the second consecutive year  a reversal of a declining trend from the previous years 
driving this improvement was both the improving mix of earning assets in the balance sheet to higher yielding assets as well as the positive impact of generally declining interest rates 
during the two and a half years from january to june of  the federal reserve bank lowered the federal funds rate thirteen times totaling 
this dramatic decrease in short term interest rates resulted in a significant decrease in the cost of funds for sterling

for yield calculation purposes  nonaccruing loans are included in the average loan balance 
the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities declined bp from to resulting from the reduction of rates paid on deposit accounts  the maturing of higher rate time deposits and borrowings  deposit growth and additional borrowings at relatively low rates of interest  and less reliance on third party borrowings to fund growth in both finance receivables and operating leases 
at the same time  the rate earned on interest earning assets declined only bp reflecting growth in the loan portfolio  shifting the mix of earning assets 
this growth also included the relatively higher margin finance receivables from efi  and a general lag in the effect of rapidly declining rates on loan and securities portfolio yields due to the proportion of fixed rates of interest in these portfolios 
during the second half of  the downward repricing of assets accelerated relative to the repricing of liabilities  resulting in a diminishing benefit from the prolonged decline in interest rates 
in addition  while the leveraging of the trust preferred proceeds increased net interest income  it reduced net interest margin 
the increase in net interest income of  from to reflects both a increase in the average balance of interest earning assets as well as a bp increase in net interest margin 
several factors had an impact on s results strong growth in the commercial loan portfolio  the acquisition of efi and subsequent growth in finance receivables  general decline in interest rates resulting in the reduction of rates paid on deposit accounts  and the maturing of higher rate deposits and borrowings 
table analysis of changes in net interest income the rate volume variance analysis set forth in the table below  which is computed on a taxable equivalent basis  compares changes in net interest income for the periods indicated by their rate and volume components

certain qualitative factors have also led to the increase in provision for loan losses  including our customer base  in which we have observed cash flows being negatively impacted by the national and local economic conditions  sterling s entry into new geographic markets resulting in the employment of new relationship managers  as well as turnover of experienced relationship managers

noninterest income details of noninterest income follow table noninterest income versus versus amount amount income from fiduciary activities service charges on deposit accounts other service charges  commissions and fees mortgage banking income rental income on operating property other operating income securities gains losses total income from fiduciary activities  which includes both institutional trust and personal wealth management services  grew to  for the year ended december   up from  or in and  in at december   sterling had total assets under administration of approximately billion compared to million at the end of and million at the end of these numbers include assets under management of million  million  and million at december    and the positive effects of new business development  which increased the number of trust customers and related fees  combined with favorable market conditions over the past year all contributed to the overall increase in fee based income 
management believes that wealth management business represents a continued growth opportunity for the corporation 
through the formation of a separate trust company  sterling financial trust company  along with the acquisition of church capital management llc and bainbridge securities inc in october  sterling believes it will be able to increase revenue generation opportunities  while increasing operating efficiencies 
other service charges  commissions and fees were  in  a increase over s total of  the acquisition of church capital management and bainbridge securities in october contributed  of fee revenue  and is the primary reason for the increase 
in addition  other service charges and fees have increased due to an increase in mutual fund and annuity commissions  as well as continued growth in customer debit card usage 
the increase in income noted during and resulted from an increase in mutual fund and annuity commissions as a result of a more concentrated sales effort combined with a more competitive commission fee structure 
mortgage banking income was  in  compared to  in and  in mortgage banking income has been favorably influenced by the trend noted in the financial services industry  which has seen an increased volume of mortgage loan originations refinancings during the past three years  as interest rates have dropped significantly to year lows 
as a result of the rate environment  mortgage banking income increased during the past two years  despite accelerated amortization of mortgage servicing rights  and related impairment charges that have resulted from faster prepayment speeds 
rental income on operating leases was  in  compared to  in  or a minor increase from year to year 
this follows an increase of in over results 
the trend in rental income is consistent with the number of units under operating leases  which were   and  as of december    and the decrease in the number of operating units during is primarily due to customers entering into more traditional financing arrangements such as commercial loans and finance leases  given the current interest rate environment combined with favorable tax treatment related to the depreciation of the assets leased purchased 
other operating income was  for the year ended december   an increase of  or over s other operating income of  the increase in other income is primarily the result of the continued growth in insurance related revenues  which increased  over  as well as increased handling charges on the lease portfolio 
the increase is the result of the continued growth in insurance related revenues  as well as increased handling charges on the lease portfolio 
securities gains and losses  all from the available for sale portfolio  are summarized as follows debt securities gains losses equity securities gains losses gains and losses on debt securities are realized as part of ongoing investment portfolio and balance sheet management strategies

net securities gains on equities were  for the year ended december  versus securities losses of  in and net gains of  in gains are taken as the result of ongoing asset liability management strategies  and capitalizing on appreciated values on certain equity security portfolio positions 
during  and sterling recorded approximately   and  in other than temporary impairment charges in the financial institution portfolio  which are included in losses above 
noninterest expense details of noninterest expense follow table noninterest expense versus versus amount amount salaries and employee benefits net occupancy furniture equipment professional services depreciation on operating lease assets other total the largest component of noninterest expense is salaries and employee benefits  which increased  or  to  in  after increasing  or in in order to better understand the change in this expense category  infrequent charges of  should be excluded from the prior year total of  the infrequent charges consist of  in severance packages   in the termination of the qualified non contributory pension plan  and  in compensation expense related to the modification of terms on stock options granted to severed employees 
excluding these infrequent charges  the increase in salaries and employee benefits for the year ended december  is  or 
the increase is attributable to the following factors normal merit increases to existing employees  coupled with replacing positions at higher wages than previously earned  increased number of employees  the result of branch expansion including the addition of pennsterling bank and delaware sterling bank  as well as the church bainbridge acquisition  a full year of efi salaries and benefits compared to ten months in additions to staff required to continue to serve our customers in light of the increased transaction volumes  higher incentive accruals resulting from the corporation s performance levels during exceeding that achieved in the  increase in salary and employee benefits in over was the result of normal merit increases  additional staffing needs for branch expansion  increases in employee benefit costs  and  of infrequent charges discussed above 
furniture and equipment charges were   and  for the years ended december   and the steady upward trend in furniture and equipment expense is the result of enhancements to the delivery channels available to deliver products to customers 
additionally  certain equipment charges are based on the number of accounts opened and their transaction volume 
as sterling s customer base continues to grow  these types of charges grow as well 
the increase in number of branch offices  and renovations made to existing branches also contributed to the increase in charges over the last two years 
professional service expense was  for the year ended december   which represented a  or  increase over s results 
this increase followed a  or increase  experienced in over s results 
increased professional service charges are due to increased auditor and attorney fees and expenses to ensure that sterling continues to meet the requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of in addition  professional service expenses have increased as a result of long term strategic planning efforts  including evaluating potential acquisition candidates  implementing tax planning strategies  and the evaluation of new market territories for bank affiliates 
depreciation on operating lease assets increased to  in  compared to  in and  in depreciation expense on leased property as a percent of related rental income has increased from in  to in and in the higher depreciation as a percent of rental income is the result of the declining interest rate environment in and a correlation exists between interest rates  and the rental income charged to customers 
in a lower interest rate environment  the rental income will decrease in order to compete with alternative financing sources ie finance leases  commercial loans  etc depreciation charges are more closely correlated to the unit s cost  which is not impacted as much by interest rates  but rather inflation 
other non interest expenses were  in  compared to  in and  in expenses in this category consist of marketing  advertising  promotions  taxes other than income  postage  lending related expenses and telephone expenses 
the largest fluctuation noted was in lending related expenses  as mortgage origination volumes during the past two years have increased the related expenses associated with this production 
additional reasons for the increase can be attributed to problem loan expense  particularly in  as sterling was able to decrease its non performing asset balances 
marketing and advertising expenditures have increased  as sterling entered new geographic markets and capitalized on the market disruption that occurred from larger bank mergers 
the remaining increase in other non interest expense is a function of sterling s overall growth  which results in higher expenses 
operating expenses levels are often measured by the efficiency ratio  which expresses noninterest expense  excluding merger related and restructuring charges  as a percentage of tax equivalent net interest income and other income 
in calculating its efficiency ratio  sterling nets depreciation on operating leases with the related rental income to more consistently present operating results with the banking industry 
sterling s efficiency ratio  excluding unusual items such as securities activities  restructuring charges  severance and other infrequent items  was   and for the years ended december   and the improvement noted in sterling s efficiency ratio is driven by the increase in net interest income experienced over the past two years 
s improvement over was further enhanced by the centralization of various operations functions  which allowed for the elimination of redundant costs associated with running the three bank affiliates on different operating systems 
the centralized operations functions allows for better utilization of fixed costs  such as premises and equipment  and variable costs  which includes employee resources 
income taxes sterling recognized income taxes of   and  for the years ended december   and the increase in income tax expense is consistent with the higher levels of pre tax income 
a more meaningful comparison is the effective tax rate  a measurement of income tax expense as a percent of pre tax income  which was  and for the years ended december    and sterling s effective tax rate is less than the federal statutory rate  primarily due to tax exempt loan and security income  and tax credits associated with low income housing projects  offset by certain non deductible expenses and state income taxes 
in order to understand the fluctuation  three events need to be considered 
in march  sterling acquired equipment finance inc efi  a pennsylvania c corporation subject to state income taxes until april   when it converted to a single member limited liability company  which significantly reduced their state income tax expense 
also  effective july   town and country leasing  a c corporation at the time  converted to a single member limited liability company which resulted in the reversal of a  deferred state tax liability 
excluding the  reversal  s effective tax rate would have been approximately  an increase over s effective tax rate of  reflective of the efi acquisition 
in  tax exempt income represented a smaller portion of pre tax income  and therefore resulted in a higher effective tax rate compared to this higher effective tax rate in occurred  despite the conversion of efi and town country to single member limited liability companies 
financial condition average assets were  in  representing growth compared to s average assets of  assets grew by from to loans experienced the most growth  as further outlined below 
growth in average deposits funded a significant portion of the loan growth  and increased to  in  compared to  in and  in as part of an overall strategy to increase the return on equity of the corporation  the remaining growth in assets and more specifically loans  was funded by a reduction in the average level of federal funds sold and the cash flows from the investment securities portfolio 
while investment securities on average increased from to by  this was the result of securities purchased through additional borrowed funds as part of a leveraging strategy to offset the incremental interest associated with trust preferred securities 
investment securities sterling utilizes investment securities as a primary tool for managing interest rate risk  to generate interest and dividend income and to provide liquidity to the parent company and affiliates 
during  the cash flows from investment securities were generally used to fund the strong loan growth generated by sterling 
proceeds from maturities  sales  and calls totaled  purchases of  included  related to the leveraging of trust preferred proceeds 
the  was funded by trust preferred proceeds and incremental borrowings from the federal home loan bank 
overall  this activity shifted the mix of the portfolio by increasing agency and municipal securities and decreasing mortgage backed and corporate securities 
this shift was a result of a number of factors  including the generally low interest rate environment  a continued effort to reduce the credit risk associated with corporate securities  and a need to maintain a sufficient level of securities that are qualified to serve as collateral for public fund and other deposits requiring pledged securities 
at december   the securities balance included net unrealized gains on available for sale securities of  versus net unrealized gains of  at december  the continued low level of interest rates led to maintaining or even increasing the unrealized gains on a majority of the holdings in the portfolio 
however  the relatively significant level of cash flow and reinvestment resulted in a greater portion of the portfolio carrying yields closer to the current level of market interest rates

loans loans outstanding increased  or in  compared to growth experienced in the overall growth in loans is consistent with a stable local economy  and continued demand for loans to support existing customers growth 
sterling experienced growth in every loan category except real estate mortgage  which is attributable to the following factors commercial and agricultural loans increased  or from december  sterling has experienced increased business loan demand during as customers capitalized on the low interest rate environment to fund their capital expenditures 
growth has also come from sterling s newer markets  including berks county  pennsylvania  and carroll county  maryland 
sterling expects to see continued growth in these two new markets  as it expands its geographic footprint 
commercial real estate loans have increased  or since december  the low interest rate environment  entrance to the new markets  and increased emphasis on commercial real estate lending has generated additional real estate lending opportunities 
loans to financial institutions totaled  at december   a  increase over december  this is a direct result of the correspondent services group  a division of bank of lancaster county  na started in the latter half of to serve the needs of financial institutions in the mid atlantic region 
consumer loans have also benefited from the low interest rate environment and reported a  increase 
customers are using home equity loans to make improvements to their homes  buy new vehicles  and make other discretionary purchases 
in addition  sterling has been utilizing advertising campaigns in target markets to increase its retail relationships 
despite the historic lows in mortgage rates and the resulting origination volume  sterling s real estate mortgage loan balance has decreased  or since december  as a result of the low interest rate environment  sterling has experienced higher levels of early payoffs  as customers are refinancing at lower interest rates 
finance receivables have increased  from december  to december   and lease financing receivables increased  during the same period 
this growth is the result of sterling s two specialty lending subsidiaries  equipment finance and town country leasing  which have generated a significant volume of new business 
a primary reason for equipment finance s decision to be affiliated with sterling was the funding that sterling could provide in order to increase its market share 
since sterling s acquisition in february  equipment finance has been able to capture new business and increase its finance receivables outstanding 
town country has also generated growth in its lease financings  as additions to the sales force have led to new business opportunities  and similar to the growth in commercial loans  customers have made capital expenditures to benefit from the low interest rate environment 
a portion of the growth experienced in lease financing receivables is the result of certain customers  who in the past would prefer an operating lease  now favoring finance leases to capitalize on bonus accelerated tax depreciation 
as a result  town country has experienced a decline in its operating lease balances on personal property

the remaining  in loans have fixed rates 
asset quality sterling s loan portfolios are subject to varying degrees of credit risk 
credit risk is mitigated through prudent underwriting standards  on going credit review  and monitoring and reporting asset quality measures 
additionally  loan portfolio diversification  limiting exposure to a single industry or borrower  and requiring collateral also reduces sterling s credit risk 
sterling s commercial  consumer and residential mortgage loans are principally to borrowers in south central pennsylvania  northern maryland  and northern delaware 
as the majority of sterling s loans are located in this area  a substantial portion of the debtor s ability to honor their obligations may be affected by the level of economic activity in the market area 
sterling s finance receivables are primarily to customers in the eastern part of the united states to finance forestry and land clearing equipment 
non performing assets include nonaccrual and restructured loans  accruing loans past due days or more and other foreclosed assets 
sterling s general policy has been to cease accruing interest on loans when management determines that a reasonable doubt exists as to the collectibility of additional interest 
when management places a loan on nonaccrual status  it reverses unpaid interest credited to income in the current year  and charges unpaid interest accrued in prior years to the allowance for loan losses 
sterling recognizes income on these loans only to the extent that it receives cash payments 
sterling typically returns nonaccrual loans to performing status when the borrower brings the loan current and performs in accordance with contractual terms for a reasonable period of time 
sterling categorizes a loan as restructured if it changes the terms of the loan such as interest rate  repayment schedule or both  to terms that it otherwise would not have granted originally 
table nonaccrual  past due and restructured loans the following table presents information concerning the aggregate amount of nonaccrual  past due and restructured loans december  nonaccrual loans accruing loans  past due days or more restructured loans total non performing loans foreclosed assets total non performing assets nonaccrual loans interest income that would have been recorded under original terms interest income recorded ratios non performing loans to total loans non performing assets to total loans and foreclosed assets non performing assets to total assets as of december   non performing assets were  a decrease of  or from december  restructured loans included in non performing loans  represented a series of loans to one borrower in the real estate business  which were fully secured with real estate collateral and were current as to modified contractual obligations 
in  these loans were removed from restructured status as they remained current and met contractual obligations as required by the loan agreements 
during  several favorable developments occurred  which contributed to the  reduction in nonaccrual loans 
these developments were as follows an agreement was reached with two large commercial relationships that were classified as nonaccrual loans at december   which resulted in the liquidation of business assets  foreclosure by sterling on certain remaining assets  and the charge off of the remaining principal balance 
as a result of these agreements   was transferred from loans to foreclosed assets   in business assets were liquidated by the borrower and used to reduce outstanding loan balances  and  was charged off on these loans 
subsequent to foreclosure   in real estate foreclosed in was sold to a third party with external financing sources 
the settlement of this transaction resulted in a minor gain on sale of real estate 
two large commercial relationships in nonaccrual status had substantial principal payments during the year  including a  relationship that was paid off in its entirety  and a reduction of  in nonaccrual loans on a second relationship 
potential problem loans are defined as performing loans  which have characteristics that cause management to have serious doubts as to the ability of the borrower to perform under present loan repayment terms and which may result in the reporting of these loans as nonperforming loans in the future 
total potential problem loans were approximately million at december  and million at december  additionally  outstanding letter of credit commitments totaling approximately million could result in potential problem loans  if drawn upon 
the majority of these loans are secured by a combination of business assets and or real estate with acceptable loan to value ratios 
allowance for loan losses sterling maintains the allowance for loan losses at a level that management believes adequate to absorb potential losses inherent in the loan portfolio and is established through a provision for loan losses charged to earnings 
additionally  when sterling acquires a company in a purchase business combination  the acquired allowance is combined with sterling s existing allowance 
quarterly  the company utilizes a defined methodology in determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
this methodology considers specific credit reviews  past loan loss historical experience  and qualitative factors 
management assigns internal risk ratings to all commercial relationships with aggregate borrowings or commitments to extend credit in excess of  using migration analysis for the previous eight quarters  management develops a loss factor test  which it then uses to estimate losses on impaired loans  potential problem loans and non classified loans 
when management finds loans with uncertain collectibility of principal and interest  it places those loans on the problem list  and evaluates them on a quarterly basis in order to estimate potential losses 
management s analysis considers adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay  estimated value of underlying collateral  and prevailing market conditions 
if management determines that a specific reserve allocation is not required  it assigns the general loss factor based on historical performance to determine the reserve 
for homogeneous loan types  such as consumer and residential mortgage loans  management bases specific allocations on the average loss ratio for the previous two years for each specific loan pool 
additionally  management adjusts projected loss ratios for other factors  including the following trends in delinquency levels  trends in non performing and potential problem loans  trends in composition  volume and terms of loans  effects in changes in lending policies or underwriting procedures  experience ability and depth of management  national and local economic conditions  concentrations in lending activities  and other factors as management may deem appropriate 
management determines the unallocated portion of the allowance for loan losses based on the following criteria risk of error in the specific and general reserve allocations  other potential exposure in the loan portfolio  variances in management s assessment of national and local economic conditions  and other internal or external factors that management believes appropriate at that time 
management believes this methodology accurately reflects losses inherent in the portfolio 
management charges actual loan losses to the allowance for loan losses 
management periodically updates this methodology  which reduces the difference between actual losses and estimated losses 
management bases the provision for loan losses on the overall analysis taking the methodology into account 
a summary of the activity in the allowance for loan losses is as follows table summary of loan loss experience years ended december  beginning balance allowance acquired in acquisition loans charged off during year commercial and agricultural commercial real estate financial real estate mortgage consumer lease financing finance receivables total charge offs recoveries commercial and agricultural commercial real estate financial real estate mortgage consumer lease financing finance receivables total recoveries net loans charged off provision for loan losses balance at end of year ratio of net loans charged off to average loans outstanding ending allowance for loan losses to net loans charged off x x x x x net loans charged off to provision for loan losses allowance for loan losses as a percent of total loans outstanding allowance for loan losses as a percent of non performing loans the allowance for loan losses increased  from  at december   to  at december  the allowance represents of loans outstanding at december   and continued a trend in lower reserve levels to outstanding loans 
despite the improvements in non performing assets  sterling increased its provision for loan losses to  for  as compared to  for the increase in the provision is consistent with the increase in net charge offs during the period  combined with the growth in the loan portfolio and the increase in potential problem loans 
certain qualitative factors have also led to the increase in provision for loan losses  including our customer base  in which we have observed cash flows being negatively impacted by the national and local economic conditions  sterling s entry into new geographic markets resulting in the employment of new relationship managers  as well as turnover of experienced relationship managers 
table allocation of allowance for loan losses years ended december  loans loans loans loans loans to to to to to total total total total total amount loans amount loans amount loans amount loans amount loans commercial  financial and agricultural real estate mortgage and construction consumer leases finance receivables unallocated total the allocation of the allowance for loan losses between the various loan portfolios has changed over the past few years  consistent with the historical net loss experience in each of the portfolios 
additionally  management enhanced the application of the allowance methodology in  which served to more appropriately reflect the risk associated with the factors and resulted in a more refined allocation methodology 
consequently  a portion of the unallocated reserve was reclassified to the allocated reserve  without an increase in probable loan losses 
the largest reserve allocation is to the commercial  financial and agricultural loan portfolio  which represents approximately of the reserve balance 
this reflects the increase in net charge offs  increases in loans  entering new markets with new lenders  and changes in other factors that impact the inherent risks in the portfolio 
this non homogeneous loan portfolio  along with leases  continues to represent the greatest risk exposure to sterling 
the loans  generally  are larger than the remainder of the portfolio and the related collateral is not as marketable 
additionally  other external factors  such as competition for high rated credits  is also considered in allocating this reserve balance 
during  sterling sold its credit card portfolio  which was included in the consumer loan category in determining the allocation of the allowance for loan losses 
as a result of the sale of this portfolio  sterling has seen an improvement in charge offs in consumer loans in through  which resulted in lower historical charge off percentages used in developing the quantitative portion of the reserve allocation 
as a result  the allocation of the allowance for loan losses to the consumer loan portfolio generally lowered from as a result of the recent downturn in the economy and management s approach in more aggressively charging off consumer loans  sterling has experienced a steady increase in net charge offs during the last three years 
this increase  which led to higher historical charge off percentages  combined with an increased qualitative adjustment  resulted in an increase in the consumer loan allocation in during  the reserve allocation related to the lease portfolio has increased consistent with the trends noted in lease charge offs during the last two years and continued uncertainty as to the impact of the economy on the slumping transportation industry and other factors that impact the inherent risks in the portfolio 
the unallocated portion of the allowance reflects estimated inherent losses within the portfolio that have not been detected 
the unallocated portion of the reserve results due to risk of error in the specific and general reserve allocations  other potential exposure in the loan portfolio  variances in management s assessment of national and local economic conditions  and other internal or external factors that management believes appropriate at the time 
while management believes sterling s allowance for loan losses is adequate based on information currently available  future adjustments to the reserve may be necessary due to changes in economic conditions  and management s assumptions as to future delinquencies or loss rates 
assets held for operating leases after several years of steady growth  sterling s assets held for operating leases portfolio experienced a decline during assets held for operating leases were  at december   compared to  at december   an decrease 
the decrease can be attributed to economic conditions  in which the low interest rate environment and bonus tax depreciation on personal property has resulted in a greater willingness of customers to enter into finance leases  or more traditional commercial lending arrangements 
operating leases have residual value risk associated with them 
operating lease terms  including monthly rental payment and length of the lease  are established based upon the residual value  or the estimate of fair value of the leased asset at the end of the lease term 
if  at the end of the lease term  the fair value of the leased property is less than the residual value calculated at lease origination  a loss on disposal could result 
sterling mitigates this risk through use of anticipated values published by various industries  and in some instances  discussions with industry experts 
further  the lease terms include provisions that the lessee shares the risk of loss on disposal of equipment  up to of the residual value 
deposits sterling continues to rely heavily on deposit growth as a primary source of funds for lending activities 
total deposits at december  were  compared to  at december   an increase of 
sterling has experienced growth in its demand deposit and savings accounts  while seeing a decline in its certificate of deposit portfolio 
during the past two years  the banking industry has seen customers migrate their investment funds from the equity market to safer and more liquid investments 
banks have benefited from this shift in consumer preference and have been able to grow their deposit base  particularly in the money market indexed funds 
the decrease in certificates of deposits from to is due to its reduced attractiveness in a low interest rate environment 
with the recent improvement in the equity market  management anticipates it will not be able to continue to generate the deposit growth it has seen in the past two years  as investors will migrate back to the equity market 
sterling will continue to explore new products to meet the needs of its customers in order to grow its deposit balances 
table average deposit balances and rates paid the following table summarizes the average amounts of deposits and rates paid for the years indicated years ended december  amount rate amount rate amount rate noninterest bearing demand deposits interest bearing demand deposits savings deposits time deposits total table deposit maturity the following table summarizes the maturities of time deposits of  or more as of the dates indicated december  three months or less over three through six months over six through twelve months over twelve months total short term borrowings short term borrowings are comprised primarily of securities sold under agreements to repurchase  us treasury demand notes  borrowings from other financial institutions and lines of credit 
as of december   short term borrowings were  an increase of  from the december  balance of  this increase is primarily attributable to sterling borrowing  under a line of credit to fund finance receivables  offset by a decrease of approximately  of securities sold under repurchase agreements 
long term debt long term debt totaled  at december   an increase of  over december  s balance of  in the third quarter of  sterling entered into a leveraging strategy  in which it borrowed  from the federal home loan bank of pittsburgh  and invested the proceeds in us agency and tax free securities 
the incremental borrowings have a weighted average rate of  and weighted average maturity of months 
prior to the leveraging strategy  sterling was meeting its scheduled maturities of long term debt obligations with funding obtained from deposit growth 
this reduction in third party borrowings offset the incremental borrowings that resulted from the leveraging strategy 
in addition  the prepayment of two fhlb advances totaling   occurred in december  and resulted in a prepayment fee of  subordinated notes payable in the third quarter of  sterling deconsolidated its investment in sterling financial statutory trusts i and ii in accordance with the provisions of fin as permitted by the provisions of fin  the december  balance sheet was restated as well for consistent presentation 
sterling financial statutory trusts i and ii are special purpose subsidiary trusts that issued trust preferred capital securities 
the proceeds from the trust preferred securities were invested in junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures of sterling  at terms consistent with the trust preferred capital securities 
prior to the third quarter  sterling presented company obligated mandatorily redeemable preferred securities of a subsidiary trust on its balance sheet  which was the trust preferred securities being consolidated in sterling s balance sheet 
with the adoption of fin  the subsidiary trusts are no longer consolidated  and as a result  the balance sheet now presents junior subordinated debt on its balance sheet 
in june  sterling entered into a  junior subordinated note payable with sterling financial statutory trust ii  at a fixed interest rate of 
this debenture was in addition to sterling s first junior subordinated debt with sterling financial statutory trust i  at a variable interest rate of month libor plus basis points 
the proceeds of the  junior subordinated notes were used to fund internal growth and other corporate matters  including the funding of the cash portions of the church capital management and bainbridge securities acquisitions 
derivative financial instruments sterling is a party to derivative instruments in the normal course of business to reduce its own exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and to meet the financing needs of its customers 
asset liability management sterling uses derivative instruments to assist in asset liability management to manage its exposure to earnings volatility caused by fluctuations in interest rates 
interest rate swaps are used to hedge cash flow variability related to floating rate liabilities  through the use of pay fixed instruments 
gains and losses on derivative instruments reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to current period earnings are included in the line item in which the hedged cash flows are recorded 
at december  other comprehensive income included a deferred after tax loss of  consisting of a loss on a pay fixed interest rate swap used to hedge future cash flows on floating rate liabilities  versus  at december  a portion of the amount in other comprehensive income is reclassified from other comprehensive income to interest expense as net settlements occur 
for the year end december   sterling recognized interest expense of  related to interest rate swaps accounted for as cash flow hedges  versus  for the year ended december  at december   the notional amount of the interest rate swap was  and had a negative gross carrying value of   the interest rate swap matures in interest rate options  which include caps  are contracts that transfer  modify  or reduce interest rate risk in exchange for the payment of a premium when the contract is initiated 
a premium is paid for the right  but not the obligation  to buy or sell a financial instrument at predetermined terms in the future 
at december   the notional amount of an interest rate cap purchased was  and its carrying value was reduced to zero 
in may  sterling entered into two equity put options as fair value hedges to protect the company from risk that the fair value of its slm corporation stock might be adversely impacted by changes in market price 
the two equity put options each cover  shares of slm s stock  one with a valuation date in may and the second with a valuation date of may if  at the valuation date  the stock price is below the reference price may  may  the counter party will pay the difference between the stock s price on the valuation date and its reference price to sterling 
sterling paid  for these put options  and as of december  their fair value was  the difference was charged to other noninterest expense and totaled  for the year ended december  at december   the trading price of the slm corporation stock was 
customer related in the third quarter of  sterling entered into interest rate contracts  including interest rate caps and interest rate swap agreements to facilitate customer transactions in order to meet their financing needs 
a summary of the customer related interest rate contracts at december  is as follows in thousands notional carrying amount value interest rate swap agreements pay fixed receiving floating interest rate swap agreements pay floating received fixed interest rate caps written interest rate caps purchased the interest rate contract portfolio is actively managed and hedged with offsetting contracts  with identical terms  with third party counterparties 
changes in the estimated fair value of customer related contracts and related interest settlements  net of the offsetting counterparty contracts  are recorded in noninterest income 
through december   net fees of  are included in other noninterest income 
sterling believes it has reduced market risk on its customer related derivative contracts  through offsetting contractual relationships with counterparties 
however  if a customer or counterparty fails to perform  credit risk is equal to the extent of the fair value gain in a derivative 
when the fair value of a derivative instrument contract is positive  this generally indicates that the counterparty or customer owes sterling  and results in credit risk to sterling 
when the fair value of a credit risk is negative  sterling owes the customer or counterparty  and therefore  has no credit risk 
sterling minimizes the credit risk in derivative instruments by including derivative credit risk in its credit underwriting procedures  and by entering into transactions with high quality counterparties that are reviewed periodically by sterling s treasury function 
capital the management of capital in a regulated financial services industry must properly balance return on equity to stockholders while maintaining sufficient capital levels and related risk based capital ratios to satisfy regulatory requirements 
additionally  capital management must also consider acquisition opportunities that may exist  and the resulting accounting treatment 
sterling s capital management strategies have been developed to provide attractive rates of returns to stockholders  while maintaining its well capitalized position at each of the banking subsidiaries 
one capital management strategy that sterling has employed is the use of trust preferred capital securities through its wholly owned special purpose subsidiary trusts  sterling financial statutory trust i and ii 
the proceeds from the preferred securities were invested in junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures of sterling  at terms consistent with the trust preferred capital securities 
sterling s treatment of the preferred capital securities is consistent with long term debt  and the related dividends being presented as interest expense 
sterling s obligations under the debentures and related documents  taken together  constitute a full and unconditional guarantee by sterling of the statutory trusts obligations under the preferred capital securities 
as of this writing  the preferred capital securities continue to qualify for tier capital treatment for sterling 
fin has been the subject of much debate among accounting professionals  regulators  financial accounting standards board and the sec staff 
while the primary intention of fin was to require consolidation of certain off balance sheet special purpose affiliates for generally accepted accounting principles  one consequence is to require deconsolidation of trust subsidiaries used for purposes of issuing trust preferred securities 
this deconsolidation could jeopardize tier capital treatment of the trust preferred securities in regulatory capital calculations  when final clarification of the guidance is issued 
in june  the board of governors of the federal reserve issued interim guidance  which instructs institutions with trust preferred securities to continue reporting in their tier capital for regulatory purposes 
sterling has  in trust preferred securities as of december   which has been included as tier capital in its regulatory capital calculations 
in the event of an unfavorable outcome  which would prohibit inclusion of the trust preferred securities as tier capital in the future  sterling s tier ratio would be negatively impacted 
however  sterling expects its tier and total capital ratios will remain above the well capitalized thresholds 
earnings retention  which represents net income less dividends declared  is a primary source of additional capital to sterling 
during  sterling retained  or  of its net income 
the acquisition of church and bainbridge has provided additional capital of during the second quarter of  sterling announced that its board of directors authorized a plan to purchase  in open market and privately negotiated transactions  up to  shares of its outstanding common stock 
this newly approved repurchase plan  when combined with  shares remaining to be purchased under sterling s repurchase plan announced in february  represents approximately of the outstanding shares of sterling s common stock 
through december    shares have been repurchased under this program at an average price of 
sterling and its banking subsidiaries are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal and state banking agencies 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that  if undertaken  could have a direct material effect on sterling and the subsidiary banks financial statements 
under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action  sterling and its banking subsidiaries must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of their assets  liabilities and certain off balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
the capital amounts and reclassifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components  risk weightings  and other factors 
prompt corrective action provisions are not applicable to bank holding companies 
quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require sterling and its banking subsidiaries to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of total and tier capital to average assets 
management believes  as of december  and that sterling and the subsidiary banks met all minimum capital adequacy requirements to which they are subject 
as of december   the most recent notification from the federal deposit insurance corporation categorized the banks as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action 
to be categorized as well capitalized institutions must maintain minimum total risk based  tier risk based and tier leverage ratios as set forth in the following tables 
there are no conditions or events since the notification that management believes have changed the banks category 
sterling s and the banks actual capital amounts and ratios as of december   and are also presented in the table 
table risked based capital sterling s actual capital amount and ratios are as follows minimum capital actual capital requirement amount ratio amount ratio december  total capital to risked weighted assets tier capital to risked weighted assets tier capital to average assets december  total capital to risked weighted assets tier capital to risked weighted assets tier capital to average assets the improvement in the capital ratios at december  from  are principally attributable to the  trust preferred securities  issued in june  which presently qualifies for tier capital treatment 
liquidity effective liquidity management ensures the cash flow requirements of depositors and borrowers  as well as the operating cash needs of sterling are met 
sterling s funds are available from a variety of sources  including assets that are readily convertible to cash federal funds sold  short term investments  securities portfolio  scheduled repayments of loans receivable  core deposit base  short term borrowing capacity with a number of correspondent banks and the federal home loan bank fhlb  and the ability to package residential mortgage loans originated for sale 
as of december   sterling has unused funding commitments from these financial institutions and the fhlb totaling  the liquidity of the parent company also represents an important aspect of liquidity management 
the parent company s net cash outflows consist principally of dividends to shareholders and unallocated corporate expenses 
the main source of funding for the parent company is the dividends it receives from its banking subsidiaries 
federal and state banking regulations place certain restrictions on dividends paid to the parent company from the subsidiary banks 
the total amount of dividends that may be paid from the subsidiary banks to sterling total  at december  sterling manages liquidity by monitoring projected cash inflows and outflows on a daily basis  and believes it has sufficient funding sources to maintain sufficient liquidity under varying degrees of business conditions 
contractual obligations  commitments and off balance sheet arrangements sterling enters into contractual obligations in its normal course of business to fund loan growth  for asset liability management purposes  to meet required capital needs and for other corporate purposes 
the following table presents significant fixed and determinable contractual obligations by payment date 
further discussion of the nature of each obligation is included in the referenced note to the consolidated financial statements 
payments due in total note amount one year or one to three to over five reference committed less three years five years years deposits without a stated maturity time deposits securities sold under repurchase agreements interest bearing demand notes issued to the us treasury lines of credit long term debt subordinated notes payable operating leases sterling is a party to derivative instruments in the normal course of business  to assist in asset liability management and reduce exposure in earnings volatility caused by fluctuations in interest and market conditions and to meet the financing needs of its customers 
derivative contracts are carried at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet with the fair value representing the net present value of the expected future cash receipts or payments based on market and interest rate conditions as of the balance sheet date 
the fair values of the contracts can change daily as market and interest rate conditions fluctuate 
these derivative contracts require monthly cash settlement 
as the derivative liabilities recorded on the balance sheet do not represent the amounts that will ultimately be paid under the contract  they are not included in the table of contractual obligations discussed above 
further discussion of derivative instruments is included in notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
a schedule of significant commitments at december  is as follows commitments to extend credit unused home equity lines of credit other commitments to extend credit standby letters of credit further discussion of these commitments to extend credit is included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in addition  sterling has commitments and obligations under employee benefit plans as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
sterling has no off balance sheet arrangements through the use of special purpose entities 
new financial accounting standards note to the consolidated financial statements discusses the expected impact on sterling s financial condition or results of operations for recently issued or proposed accounting standards that have not been adopted 
to the extent we anticipate a significant impact to sterling s financial condition or results of operations  appropriate discussion takes place in the applicable note to the consolidated financial statements 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk financial institutions can be exposed to several market risks that may impact the value or future earnings capacity of an organization 
these risks involve interest rate risk  foreign currency exchange risk  commodity price risk and equity market price risk 
sterling s primary market risk is interest rate risk 
interest rate risk is inherent because as a financial institution  sterling derives a significant amount of its operating revenue from purchasing funds customer deposits and borrowings at various terms and rates 
these funds are then invested into earning assets loans  leases  investments  etc 
at various terms and rates 
this risk is further discussed below 
equity market risk is not a significant risk to the corporation  as equity investments on a cost basis comprise less than of corporate assets 
sterling does not have any exposure to foreign currency exchange risk or commodity price risk 
interest rate risk interest rate risk is the exposure to fluctuations in the corporation s future earnings earnings at risk and value value at risk resulting from changes in interest rates 
this exposure results from differences between the amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities that reprice within a specified time period as a result of scheduled maturities and repayment  contractual interest rate changes  or the exercise of explicit or embedded options 
the primary objective of the corporation s asset liability management process is to maximize current and future net interest income within acceptable levels of interest rate risk while satisfying liquidity and capital requirements 
management recognizes that a certain amount of interest rate risk is inherent and appropriate yet is not essential to the corporation s profitability 
thus the goal of interest rate risk management is to maintain a balance between risk and reward such that net interest income is maximized while risk is maintained at a tolerable level 
management endeavors to control the exposures to changes in interest rates by understanding  reviewing and making decisions based on its risk position 
the corporate asset liability committee is responsible for these decisions 
the corporation primarily uses the securities portfolios and borrowings to manage its interest rate risk position 
additionally  pricing  promotion and product development activities are directed in an effort to emphasize the loan and deposit term or repricing characteristics that best meet current interest rate risk objectives 
at present  the use of off balance sheet instruments is not significant 
the committee operates under management policies defining guidelines and limits on the level of risk 
these policies are approved by the boards of directors 
the corporation uses simulation analysis to assess earnings at risk and net present value analysis to assess value at risk 
these methods allow management to regularly monitor both the direction and magnitude of the corporation s interest rate risk exposure 
these modeling techniques involve assumptions and estimates that inherently cannot be measured with complete precision 
key assumptions in the analyses include maturity and repricing characteristics of both assets and liabilities  prepayments on amortizing assets  other imbedded options  non maturity deposit sensitivity and loan and deposit pricing 
these assumptions are inherently uncertain due to the timing  magnitude and frequency of rate changes and changes in market conditions and management strategies  among other factors 
however  the analyses are useful in quantifying risk and provide a relative gauge of the corporation s interest rate risk position over time 
earnings at risk simulation analysis evaluates the effect of upward and downward changes in market interest rates on future net interest income 
the analysis involves changing the interest rates used in determining net interest income over the next twelve months 
the resulting percentage change in net interest income in various rate scenarios is an indication of the corporation s shorter term interest rate risk 
the analysis utilizes a static balance sheet approach 
the measurement date balance sheet composition or mix is maintained over the simulation time period  with maturing and repayment dollars being rolled back into like instruments for new terms at current market rates 
additional assumptions are applied to modify volumes and pricing under the various rate scenarios 
these include prepayment assumptions on mortgage assets  the sensitivity of non maturity deposit rates  and other factors deemed significant 
the simulation analysis results are presented in table a 
these results indicate that the corporation would expect net interest income to increase over the next twelve months by assuming an immediate upward shift in market interest rates of and to decrease by if rates shifted downward in the same manner 
this profile reflects an asset sensitive short term rate risk position and is within the guidelines set by policy 
at december   annual net interest income was expected to increase by in the upward scenario and to decrease by in the downward scenario 
the risk position has changed from the prior year end to a more asset sensitive position primarily due to an increase in the volume of variable commercial and consumer loans as well as fed funds sold 
value at risk the net present value analysis provides information on the risk inherent in the balance sheet that might not be taken into account in the simulation analysis due to the shorter time horizon used in that analysis 
the net present value of the balance sheet is defined as the discounted present value of expected asset cash flows minus the discounted present value of the expected liability cash flows 
the analysis involves changing the interest rates used in determining the expected cash flows and in discounting the cash flows 
the resulting percentage change in net present value in various rate scenarios is an indication of the longer term repricing risk and options embedded in the balance sheet 
the net present value analysis results are presented in table b 
these results indicate that the net present value would be unchanged assuming an immediate upward shift in market interest rates of and to decrease if rates shifted downward in the same manner 
the risk position of sterling is within the guidelines set by policy 
at december   the analysis indicated that the net present value would decrease assuming an immediate upward shift in market interest rates of and to decrease if rates shifted downward in the same manner
