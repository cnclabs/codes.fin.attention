item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
all statements  trend analysis and other information contained in the following discussion relative to markets for our products and trends in revenue  gross margins and anticipated expense levels  as well as other statements including words such as anticipate  believe  plan  estimate  expect  and intend and other similar expressions  constitute forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements are subject to business and economic risks and uncertainties  and our actual results of operations may differ materially from those contained in the forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed in cautionary statements as well as other risks and uncertainties referenced in this annual report on form k 
overview we research  develop  manufacture  market  sell and service lasers used to perform aesthetic and cosmetic procedures 
we sell our lasers principally to medical practitioners 
candela markets its products directly and through a network of distributors to end users 
our traditional customer base includes plastic and cosmetic surgeons and dermatologists 
more recently  we have expanded our sales to a broader group of practitioners consisting of general practitioners and certain specialists including obstetricians  gynecologists  and general and vascular surgeons 
we derive our revenue from the sale of lasers and other products  and the provision of product related services 
we sell products in the us through our direct sales force to our traditional customer base of dermatologists and cosmetic surgeons 
outside the us we sell our products in western europe  japan  latin and south america  the middle east  and the pacific rim through seven direct sales offices and more than independent distributors 
we typically assemble products in our wayland  massachusetts  facility in the quarter in which they are shipped  and backlog has not been significant 
we experience some seasonal reduction of our product sales in the quarter ending in september due to the summer holiday schedule of physicians and their patients 
all product shipments include a standard month parts and service warranty except for vbeam products that include a standard year warranty 
the anticipated cost associated with the warranty coverage is accrued at the time of shipment as a cost of sales charged to product related service costs 
any costs associated with product installation are also recognized as costs of product related service 
both such anticipated and actual costs have no associated revenue and therefore reduce the gross profit from product related service revenue 
product related service revenue consists of revenue from maintenance and repair services and the sale of spare parts and consumables 
we derive revenue from extended service contracts  which are typically for a or month period  and the revenue is initially deferred and recognized over the life of the service contract 
in addition  we provide on site service worldwide on a time and materials basis directly or through our distributors 
international revenue  consisting of sales from our subsidiaries in germany  france  spain  and japan  and sales shipped directly to international locations from the us  during the fiscal years ended july   june   and june  represented  and of total sales  respectively 
our fiscal year consists of the or week period ending on the saturday closest to june of each year 
the years ended july   june  and june  contained  and weeks  respectively 
discontinued operations in june  we began an effort to own and operate skin care centers offering cosmetic laser treatments utilizing our equipment  along with providing other cosmetic services traditionally offered by high end spas 
we pursued this strategy by purchasing an existing spa in boston in and by opening a new skin care center in scottsdale  arizona in march we subsequently decided to reduce our focus on our skin care center efforts and to renew our commitment to our core aesthetic and cosmetic laser business 
during fiscal  we closed the scottsdale facility 
during the quarters ended december  and june   the company recorded combined restructuring charges of  related to this closure and was subsequently able to reverse a substantial portion of this charge due to the company s ability to secured a sublease for the scottsdale facility 
per the sublease agreement  the sublessee will pay all costs associated with the facility through the end of the lease term ending june the sublessee commenced making payments to the landlord on behalf of the company on april  in september we initiated a plan to close our only remaining skin care center 
the closure was accounted for as a discontinued operation in accordance with apb reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions and sfas accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
as a result  in the fiscal quarter ended september  we recorded a  charge for the accrual of  of future occupancy costs and  of severance obligations and other related costs of closure  net of anticipated tax benefits of  in addition  all prior period financial statements have been restated to reflect skin care centers operations as discontinued 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  bad debts  inventories  warranty obligations  and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies and the related judgments and estimates affect the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
our policy is to recognize revenue upon shipment of our products to our customers and the fulfillment of all contractual terms and conditions  pursuant to the guidance provided by staff accounting bulletin sab no 
revenue recognition in financial statements  issued by the securities and exchange commission 
judgments are required in evaluating the credit worthiness of our customers 
credit is not extended to customers and revenue is not recognized until collectibility is reasonably assured 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
our policy is to maintain allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
credit limits are established through a process of reviewing the financial history and stability of each customer 
where appropriate  we obtain credit rating reports and financial statements of customers when determining or modifying their credit limits 
we regularly evaluate the collectibility of our trade receivable balances based on a combination of factors 
when a customer s account balance becomes past due  we initiate dialogue with the customer to determine the cause 
if it is determined that the customer will be unable to meet its financial obligation to us  such as in the case of a bankruptcy filing  deterioration in the customer s operating results or financial position or other material events impacting their business  we record a specific allowance to reduce the related receivable to the amount we expect to recover given all information presently available 
as of july   our accounts receivable balance of million is reported net of allowances for doubtful accounts of million 
we believe our reported allowances at july   are adequate 
if the financial conditions of those customers were to deteriorate  however  resulting in their inability to make payments  we may need to record additional allowances that would result in additional selling  general and administrative expenses being recorded for the period in which such determination was made 
inventory reserves 
as a designer and manufacturer of high technology equipment  we are exposed to a number of economic and industry factors that could result in portions of our inventory becoming either obsolete or in excess of anticipated usage 
these factors include  but are not limited to  technological changes in our markets  our ability to meet changing customer requirements  competitive pressures in products and prices  and the availability of key components from our suppliers 
our policy is to establish inventory reserves when conditions exist that suggest that our inventory may be in excess of anticipated demand or is obsolete based upon our assumptions about future demand for our products and market conditions 
we regularly evaluate the ability to realize the value of our inventory based on a combination of factors including the following historical usage rates  forecasted sales or usage  product end of life dates  estimated current and future market values and new product introductions 
purchasing requirements and alternative usage avenues are explored within these processes to mitigate inventory exposure 
when recorded  our reserves are intended to reduce the carrying value of our inventory to its net realizable value 
as of july   our inventory of million is stated net of inventory reserves of million 
if actual demand for our products deteriorates  or market conditions are less favorable than those that we project  additional inventory reserves may be required 
product warranties 
our products are sold with warranty provisions that require us to remedy deficiencies in quality or performance of our products over a specified period of time at no cost to our customers 
our policy is to establish warranty reserves at levels that represent our estimate of the costs that will be incurred to fulfill those warranty requirements at the time that revenue is recognized 
we believe that our recorded liability at july   is adequate to cover our future cost of materials  labor and overhead for the servicing of our products sold through that date 
if actual product failures or material or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  our warranty liability would need to be revised accordingly 
contingencies 
we are subject to proceedings  lawsuits and other claims 
we assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of reserves required  if any  for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each individual issue 
the required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters 
we record charges for the costs we anticipate incurring in connection with litigation and claims against us when we can reasonably estimate these costs 
as disclosed in legal proceedings  the company has moved to arbitrate the varying contract interpretations held by itself on the one hand and the regents of the university of california the regents on the other hand 
while a final decision of the arbitrator is pending  the company established an escrow fund into which it deposited approximately million in the fourth quarter of fiscal  and an additional million in the first quarter of fiscal  to resolve claims under the amended and restated license agreement the license between the company and the regents 
amounts paid into the escrow fund will be paid in whole or in part to the company or the regents as determined by the arbitrator 
if the arbitrator were to find in the regents favor on all matters  the company would need to pay an additional amount in excess of the total amount in the escrow fund which could amount to the payment of million or more and the company would also face increased royalty expense in future periods since a royalty would be due on products that the company currently believes are not subject to royalty payments 
the million deposited in the escrow fund in the fourth quarter of fiscal has been included in other assets on the accompanying balance sheet  and no expense has or will be recorded with respect to the escrow fund or any additional contingent liabilities while the matter is being arbitrated 
restructuring 
we record restructuring charges incurred in connection with consolidation or relocation of operations  exited business lines  or shutdowns of specific sites 
these restructuring charges  which reflect our commitment to a termination or exit plan that will begin within twelve months  are based on estimates of the expected costs associated with site closure  legal matters  contract terminations  or other costs directly related to the restructuring 
if the actual cost incurred exceeds the estimated cost  an additional charge to earnings will result 
if the actual cost is less than the estimated cost  a credit to earnings will be recognized 
taxes 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  we recognize deferred income taxes based on the expected future tax consequences of differences between the financial statement basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities  calculated using enacted tax rates for the year in which the differences are expected to be reflected in the tax return 
realization is dependent on the generation of sufficient taxable income in future years 
management continually evaluates the need for a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets based on the probability of realization determined by expectations for future taxable income and other factors 
although realization is not assured  based on available evidence  management believes it is more likely than not that the full amount of the net deferred tax asset will be realized 
however  the amount realizable could be reduced if estimates of future taxable income are reduced 
results of operations the following tables set forth selected financial data for the periods indicated  expressed as a percentage of total revenue 
for the year ended july  june  june  restated restated consolidated statement of operations data revenue mix lasers and other products product related service total revenue operating ratios gross profit lasers and other products product related service total gross profit operating expenses research and development selling  general administrative total operating expenses income loss from continuing operations total other income expense income loss from continuing operations before income taxes provision for benefit from income taxes net income loss from continuing operations fiscal year ended july  compared to fiscal year ended june  revenue 
total revenue increased million  or to million in fiscal from million in fiscal increases in unit sales and the growth in popularity of our yag and gentlelase systems accounted for the increase 
we sold approximately additional laser systems during fiscal as compared to with an average selling price roughly equivalent to that of the prior year 
international revenue  consisting of sales from our subsidiaries in germany  spain  france and japan  and sales shipped directly to international locations from the us  increased million over the prior year and accounted for of total revenue for fiscal in comparison to for fiscal of the million increase approximately million was related to favorable currency fluctuations 
product related service revenue increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase was consistent with the increase in systems sold over the past few years and the need for general maintenance and parts on these systems 
gross profit 
gross profit increased million to million or of revenue in fiscal from million or of revenue in fiscal as a direct result of the increase in sales 
gross profit on lasers and other products increased million or to million or of revenue in fiscal from million or of revenue in fiscal gross profit on product related services in fiscal decreased million to million or of revenue compared to million or of revenue for fiscal the decrease in gross profit on product related services is due primarily to an increase in products under warranty associated with vbeam and gentlelase product sales and a corresponding decrease in the number of systems on service contracts 
research and development expense 
research and development spending increased slightly for fiscal over fiscal due to more active projects ongoing 
this increase accounted for approximately million in additional expense  but as a percentage of total revenue this category decreased almost a full percentage point from the prior year 
selling  general and administrative expense 
selling  general and administrative expense increased to million or of revenue during fiscal compared to million or during fiscal the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses is due primarily to the payment of additional bonus and commission amounts due to overachievement of planned targets by our sales force coupled with the implementation of sarbanes oxley control and reporting requirements 
other income expense 
for the fiscal year ended july   total other income increased million to million  from million for the fiscal year ended june  interest income decreased million from the prior year to million primarily as a result of the absence during the current period of interest payments of million received from the pss settlement in the prior year  partially offset by higher cash balances invested throughout the fiscal year 
interest expense was negligible for due to the retirement of our long term debt in fiscal leading to a comparative gain of million over the prior year 
other income increased million in fiscal as compared to fiscal due primarily to an insurance reimbursement of approximately million for stolen merchandise at our german subsidiary  period gains on subsidiary transactions of approximately million  and the timing of an investment distribution 
income taxes 
the provision for income taxes results from a combination of activities of both the domestic and foreign subsidiaries of the company 
the company recorded a effective tax rate for the year ended july  compared to a effective tax rate for the year ended june  the provision for income taxes for the year ended july   includes a tax provision calculated for taxable income generated in japan and spain at rates in excess of the us statutory tax rate 
fiscal year ended june  compared to fiscal year ended june  revenue 
total revenue increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal international revenue  consisting of sales from our subsidiaries in germany  spain  france and japan  and sales shipped directly to international locations from the us  was of total revenue for fiscal in comparison to for fiscal laser and product revenue increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal increases in unit sales and the average selling price of the gentlelase  smoothbeam and vbeam products were responsible for the increase in laser and other product revenue from fiscal to product related service revenue decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal due primarily to an increase in the number of lasers covered by extended warranties and a corresponding decrease in the number of lasers covered by service contracts 
gross profit 
gross profit increased to million or of revenue in fiscal from million or of revenue in fiscal mainly as a result of the increase in sales of lasers and other products 
gross profit on lasers and other products increased to million or of revenue in fiscal from million or of revenue in fiscal gross profit on product related services in fiscal increased to million or of revenue compared to million or of revenue for fiscal the increase in gross profit on product related services is due primarily to a decrease in warranty costs associated with the vbeam products 
the decrease in vbeam warranty costs was largely due to the one time replacement of a component of the system during fiscal that did not reoccur in fiscal research and development expense 
research and development spending for fiscal decreased to million from million for fiscal selling  general and administrative expense 
selling  general and administrative expense decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses is due primarily to the reimbursement of legal expense relating to the pss dispute that was settled favorably in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses were of revenue in fiscal compared to for fiscal other income expense 
for the fiscal year ended june   total other income declined to million from million for the fiscal year ended june  interest income increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal due to interest payments of million received from the pss settlement offset by generally lower levels of cash invested at lower interest rates throughout the fiscal year 
interest expense decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal due primarily to the early retirement of our long term debt in fiscal other income expense decreased from million income in fiscal to a million expense in fiscal primarily as a result of charges resulting from the early retirement of our long term debt 
income taxes 
the provision for income taxes results from a combination of activities of both the domestic and foreign subsidiaries of the company 
the company recorded a effective tax rate for the year ended june  compared to a effective tax rate for the year ended june  the benefit from income taxes for the year ended june   includes a tax benefit for taxable losses in the us offset by a tax provision calculated for taxable income generated in japan and spain at rates in excess of the us statutory tax rate 
liquidity and capital resources cash provided by operating activities amounted to million for fiscal as compared to million for fiscal this decrease in cash provided by operating activities primarily reflects the timing of receivables collections and cash outlay for inventory during a strong sales cycle 
sales during the last days of the quarter exceeded those of the same period in the prior year by approximately million 
we expect the collection of receivables to have a positive impact on cash during the first quarter of fiscal cash used by investing activities remained relatively flat for the fiscal  as the company continued its conservative policy towards capital outlays for property  plant and equipment 
cash provided by financing activities amounted to million for the year ended july  in comparison to cash used of million for the prior year 
the increase reflects the proceeds from the issuance of common stock by the company  primarily to employees under the existing stock option plan  and the absence of prior year payments used to extinguish long term debt 
off balance sheet arrangements the company did not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the company s financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
the company did not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have  or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the company s financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
outstanding contractual obligations of the company are reflected in the following table in thousands total less than year years years after years restated operating leases total contractual cash obligations we maintain a renewable  revolving credit agreement with a major bank with interest at the bank s base rate or libor plus 
any borrowings outstanding under the line of credit are due on demand or according to a payment schedule established at the time funds are borrowed 
the line of credit is unsecured 
the agreement contains restrictive covenants limiting the establishment of new liens  and the purchase of margin stock 
no amounts were outstanding under the line of credit as of july  as discussed in note to the financial statements  on september   we closed our only remaining skin care center in boston  massachusetts 
as a result  in the fiscal quarter ended september  we recorded a  charge for the accrual of  of future occupancy costs and  of severance obligations and other related costs of closure  net of anticipated tax benefits of  we believe that cash balances will be sufficient to meet anticipated cash requirements 
however  we cannot be sure that we will not require additional capital beyond the amounts currently forecasted by us  nor that any such required additional capital will be available on reasonable terms  if at all  as it becomes required 
cautionary statements this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements including  without limitation  statements concerning the future of the industry  product development  business strategy including the possibility of future acquisitions  anticipated operational and capital expenditure levels  continued acceptance and growth of our products  and dependence on significant customers and suppliers 
this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements that we have made based on our current expectations  estimates and projections about our industry  operations  and prospects  not historical facts 
we have made these forward looking statements pursuant to the provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of these statements can be identified by the use of forward looking terminology such as may  will  believe  expect  anticipate  estimate  continue or other similar words 
these statements discuss future expectations  and may contain projections of results of operations or of financial condition or state other forward looking information 
when considering forward looking statements  you should keep in mind the cautionary statements in this annual report on form k 
the cautionary statements noted below and other factors noted throughout this annual report on form k could cause our actual results to differ significantly from those contained in any forward looking statement 
we may not update or publicly release the results of these forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof 
because we derive more than half of our revenue from international sales  including approximately of our revenue from japan and the asia pacific marketplace in fiscal  we are susceptible to currency fluctuations  negative economic changes taking place in japan and the asia pacific marketplace  and other risks associated with conducting business overseas 
we sell more than half of our products and services outside the us and canada 
international sales  consisting of sales from our subsidiaries in germany  spain  france and japan  and sales shipped directly to international locations from the us  accounted for of our revenue for fiscal year  and we expect that they will continue to be significant 
as a result  a major part of our revenues and operating results could be adversely affected by risks associated with international sales 
in particular  significant fluctuations in the exchange rates between the us dollar and foreign currencies could cause us to lower our prices and thus reduce our profitability  or could cause prospective customers to push out orders to later dates because of the increased relative cost of our products in the aftermath of a currency devaluation or currency fluctuation 
other risks associated with international sales that we currently face or have faced in the past include longer payment cycles common in foreign markets failure to obtain or significant delays in obtaining necessary import or foreign regulatory approvals for our products difficulties in staffing and managing our foreign operations 
the failure to obtain alexandrite rods for the gentlelase from our sole supplier would impair our ability to manufacture and sell gentlelase 
we use alexandrite rods to manufacture the gentlelase  which accounts for a significant portion of our total revenues 
we depend exclusively on northrup grumman to supply these rods  for which no alternative supplier meeting our quality standards exists 
we cannot be certain that northrup grumman will be able to meet our future requirements at current prices or at all 
to date  we have been able to obtain adequate supplies of alexandrite rods in a timely manner  but any extended interruption in our supplies could hurt our results 
disappointing quarterly revenue or operating results could cause the price of our common stock to fall 
our quarterly revenue and operating results are difficult to predict and may swing sharply from quarter to quarter 
historically  our first fiscal quarter has typically had the least amount of revenue in any quarter of our fiscal year 
the results of the first quarter are directly impacted by the seasonality of the purchasing cycle 
if our quarterly revenue or operating results fall below the expectations of investors or public market analysts  the price of our common stock could fall substantially 
our quarterly revenue is difficult to forecast for many reasons  some of which are outside of our control  including the following market supply and demand potential increases in the level and intensity of price competition between our competitors and us potential decrease in demand for our products possible delays in market acceptance of our new products 
customer behavior changes in or extensions of our customers budgeting and purchasing cycles changes in the timing of product sales in anticipation of new product introductions or enhancements by us or our competitors 
company operations absence of significant product backlogs our effectiveness in our manufacturing process unsatisfactory performance of our distribution channels  service providers  or customer support organizations timing of any acquisitions and related costs 
an adverse result in the arbitration proceeding pending against the regents of the university of california would result in additional expenditures and would negatively impact our operating results 
the company has moved to arbitrate the varying contract interpretations held by itself on the one hand and the regents of the university of california the regents on the other hand 
while a final decision of the arbitrator is pending  the company established an escrow fund into which it deposited approximately million in the fourth quarter of fiscal  and an additional million in the first quarter of fiscal  to resolve claims under the amended and restated license agreement the license between the company and the regents 
amounts paid into the escrow fund will be paid in whole or in part to the company or the regents as determined by the arbitrator 
if the arbitrator were to find in the regents favor on all matters  the company would need to pay an additional amount in excess of the total amount in the escrow fund which could amount to the payment of  or more and the company would also face increased royalty expense in future periods since a royalty would be due on products that the company currently believes are not subject to royalty payments 
the million deposited in the escrow fund in the fourth quarter of fiscal has been included in other assets on the accompanying balance sheet  and no expense has or will be recorded with respect to the escrow fund or any additional contingent liabilities while the matter is being arbitrated 
our failure to respond to rapid changes in technology and intense competition in the laser industry could make our lasers obsolete 
the aesthetic and cosmetic laser equipment industry is subject to rapid and substantial technological development and product innovations 
to be successful  we must be responsive to new developments in laser technology and new applications of existing technology 
our financial condition and operating results could be hurt if our products fail to compete favorably in response to such technological developments  or we are not agile in responding to competitors new product introductions or product price reductions 
in addition  we compete against numerous companies offering products similar to ours  some of which have greater financial  marketing  and technical resources than we do 
we cannot be sure that we will be able to compete successfully with these companies and our failure to do so could hurt our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
like other companies in our industry  we are subject to a regulatory review process and our failure to receive necessary government clearances or approvals could affect our ability to sell our products and remain competitive 
the types of medical devices that we seek to market in the us generally must receive either k clearance or pma approval in advance from the us food and drug administration fda pursuant to the federal food  drug  and cosmetic act 
the fda s k clearance process usually takes from four to twelve months  but it can last longer 
the process of obtaining pma approval is much more costly and uncertain and generally takes from one to three years or even longer 
to date  the fda has deemed our products eligible for the k clearance process 
we believe that most of our products in development will receive similar treatment 
however  we cannot be sure that the fda will not impose the more burdensome pma approval process upon one or more of our future products  nor can we be sure that k clearance or pma approval will ever be obtained for any product we propose to market 
many foreign countries in which we market or may market our products have regulatory bodies and restrictions similar to those of the fda 
particularly  for example  we are awaiting ministry of health approval in japan for the sale of the vbeam 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain or continue to obtain any such government approvals or successfully comply with any such foreign regulations in a timely and cost effective manner  if at all  and our failure to do so could adversely affect our ability to sell our products 
we have modified some of our products without fda clearance 
the fda could retroactively decide the modifications were improper and require us to cease marketing and or recall the modified products 
any modification to one of our k cleared devices that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness  or that would constitute a major change in its intended use  requires a new k clearance 
the fda requires every manufacturer to make this determination in the first instance  but the fda can review any such decision 
we have modified some of our marketed devices  but we believe that new k clearances are not required 
we cannot be certain that the fda would agree with any of our decisions not to seek k clearance 
if the fda requires us to seek k clearance for any modification  we also may be required to cease marketing and or recall the modified device until we obtain a new k clearance 
achieving complete compliance with fda regulations is difficult  and if we fail to comply  we could be subject to fda enforcement action 
we are subject to inspection and market surveillance by the fda to determine compliance with regulatory requirements 
the fda s regulatory scheme is complex  especially the quality system regulation qsr  which requires manufacturers to follow elaborate design  testing  control  documentation  and other quality assurance procedures 
this complexity makes complete compliance difficult to achieve 
also  the determination as to whether a qsr violation has occurred is often subjective 
if the fda finds that we have failed to comply with the qsr or other applicable requirements  the agency can institute a wide variety of enforcement actions  including a public warning letter or other stronger remedies  such as fines  injunctions  and civil penalties against us recall or seizure of our products operating restrictions  partial suspension  or total shutdown of our production refusing our requests for k clearance or pma approval of new products withdrawing product approvals already granted criminal prosecution claims by others that our products infringe their patents or other intellectual property rights could prevent us from manufacturing and selling some of our products or require us to incur substantial costs from litigation or development of non infringing technology 
our industry has been characterized by frequent litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
patent applications are maintained in secrecy in the us until such patents are issued and are maintained in secrecy for a period of time outside the us accordingly  we can conduct only limited searches to determine whether our technology infringes any patents or patent applications of others 
any claims of patent infringement would be time consuming and could result in costly litigation divert our technical and management personnel cause product shipment delays require us to develop non infringing technology require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
although patent and intellectual property disputes in the laser industry have often been settled through licensing or similar arrangements  costs associated with such arrangements may be substantial and often require the payment of ongoing royalties  which could hurt our gross margins 
in addition  we cannot be sure that the necessary licenses would be available to us on satisfactory terms  or that we could redesign our products or processes to avoid infringement  if necessary 
accordingly  an adverse determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding  or the failure to obtain necessary licenses  could prevent us from manufacturing and selling some of our products  which could hurt our business  results of operations  and financial condition 
on the other hand  we may have to start costly and time consuming litigation in order to enforce our patents  to protect trade secrets  and know how owned by us or to determine the enforceability  scope  and validity of the proprietary rights of others 
we could incur substantial costs as a result of product liability claims 
there are various risks of physical injury to the patient when using our lasers for aesthetic and cosmetic treatments 
injuries often result in product liability or other claims being brought against the practitioner utilizing the device and us 
the costs and management time we would have to spend in defending or settling any such claims  or the payment of any award in connection with such claims  could hurt our business  results of operations  and financial condition 
although we maintain product liability insurance  we cannot be certain that our policy will provide sufficient coverage for any claim or claims that may arise  or that we will be able to maintain such insurance coverage on favorable economic terms 
we may be unable to attract and retain management and other personnel we need to succeed 
the loss of any of our senior management or other key research  development  sales  and marketing personnel  particularly if lost to competitors  could hurt our future operating results 
our future success will depend in large part upon our ability to attract  retain  and motivate highly skilled employees 
we cannot be certain that we will attract  retain  and motivate sufficient numbers of such personnel 
our failure to manage future acquisitions and joint ventures effectively may divert management attention from our core business and cause us to incur additional debt  liabilities or costs 
we may acquire businesses  products  and technologies that complement or expand our business 
we may also consider joint ventures and other collaborative projects 
we may not be able to identify appropriate acquisition or joint venture candidates successfully negotiate  finance  or integrate any businesses  products  or technologies that we acquire successfully manage any joint ventures or collaborations 
furthermore  the integration of any acquisition or joint venture may divert management time and resources 
if we fail to manage these acquisitions or joint ventures effectively  we may incur debts or other liabilities or costs that could harm our operating results or financial condition 
while we from time to time evaluate potential acquisitions of businesses  products  and technologies  consider joint ventures and other collaborative projects  and anticipate continuing to make these evaluations  we have no present understandings  commitments  or agreements with respect to any acquisitions or joint ventures 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk revenue from outside the us  consisting of sales from our subsidiaries in germany  spain  france and japan and sales shipped directly from the us to international locations  constituted of our total revenue for fiscal our international subsidiaries transact business in both local and foreign currencies and therefore we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk resulting from fluctuations in foreign currencies 
this risk could adversely impact our results and financial condition 
from time to time  we may enter into foreign currency exchange and option contracts to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk and variability in operating results due to fluctuation in exchange rates underlying the value of current transactions and anticipated transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
these contracts obligate us to exchange predetermined amounts of specified foreign currencies at specified exchange rates on specified dates 
these contracts are denominated in the same currency in which the underlying transactions are denominated and bear a contract value and maturity date that approximate the value and expected settlement date  respectively  of the underlying transactions 
we do not engage in foreign currency speculation 
on july  the euro closed at euro to u 
s dollar compared to euro to us dollar on june  the japanese yen closed at yen to us dollar on july  compared to yen to us dollar on june  net gains resulting from foreign currency translations amounted to  for fiscal at july  and june   a hypothetical positive change in foreign exchange rates would result in translation gains of  and  respectively that would be recorded in the equity section of our balance sheet 
at july  and june   a hypothetical adverse change in foreign exchange rates would result in a net transaction loss of  and a net transaction gain of  respectively that would be recorded in current earnings
