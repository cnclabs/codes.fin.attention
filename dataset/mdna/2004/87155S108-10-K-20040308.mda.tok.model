the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our historical financial statements and the notes to those financial statements that are included in item of part ii of this annual report on form k 
overview we have been a public company for four years  and have built upon our broad technology platform to establish ourselves as a profitable company with several complementary operating businesses 
since our initial public offering in  our revenue has increased at a compounded average annual rate of  and we have been profitable since the first quarter of since our inception  we have invested heavily in establishing the technology  instrumentation and informatics necessary to pursue high throughput discovery of materials 
these materials include catalysts to manufacture commodity chemicals and polyolefins  polymers and phosphors for life science and industrial applications  and specialized materials for electronics applications 
we believe we are now well positioned to capitalize on this investment 
we believe that the drivers of our near term growth and profitability are already in place  namely the credibility and commitment afforded by our alliance with exxonmobil a visible improvement in industry spending levels the near term growth potential of our royalty income stream  and expansion of our software business 
our financial results were mixed 
on the positive side  the exxonmobil alliance provides a high level of committed revenue for a year period across all of our businesses 
we saw some growth in our collaborations business  through exxonmobil and the addition of bp  univation and undisclosed partners 
our revenue from licenses and royalties grew through a variety of intellectual property  technology and software licenses 
however  in discovery tools  we did not sell and deliver polymorph systems to pharmaceutical customers who were affected by reduced capital spending in the pharmaceutical industry in looking forward to  we will be delivering a polymorph system to pfizer in the first quarter  we believe that pharmaceutical capital spending is improving  and we have adopted a modular approach to selling discovery tools to facilitate more timely customer purchases 
our businesses combined to generate total revenue for the year of million  with operating income of million and diluted earnings per share of 
our earnings continue to be impacted by decreases in interest income and variability in our effective income tax rate 
for  we had an effective income tax rate of versus in resulting from the recognition in the fourth quarter of of just over million in benefits from 
table of contents certain of our deferred tax assets  which previously had been reserved 
based on our current forecast for  we anticipate an effective income tax rate of approximately 
during  we generated positive cash flow from operations and ended the year with million in cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities 
our total headcount increased from employees at the end of to employees at the end of to employees at the end of  to meet the mix and level of staffing promised to exxonmobil in particular 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was approximately million 
we may incur additional operating losses as we continue to expand staffing  equipment and facilities 
see risk factors 
we expect to continue to make significant investments in research and development to enhance our technologies  including for the development of new instruments and software 
in addition  our strategy is to expand our operations and to continue to build our research and development  business development and marketing efforts 
critical accounting policies symyx s financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
note to the consolidated financial statements included under item in this annual report on form k  describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
preparing financial statements and related disclosures requires management to exercise judgment in making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  and expenses 
these estimates and assumptions are affected by management s application of accounting policies 
estimates are used for  but not limited to  revenue recognition  establishing the warranty expense accrual  establishing slow moving  obsolete and excess inventory reserves  determining when technical feasibility for our software products has been achieved and accounting for income taxes 
the following critical accounting policies  among others  are impacted significantly by judgments  estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
source of revenue and revenue recognition policy we generate revenue from services provided under research collaborations  the sale of products  license of associated software  and provision of support and maintenance services and the license of intellectual property 
it is possible for our customers to work with us in multiple areas of our business and contracts may include multiple elements of service revenue  product revenue and license revenue 
in determining the basis for revenue recognition  we first determine the fair value of any extended warranty services and defer this revenue to be recognized over the service period 
for those contracts that involve multiple element deliverables  we identify all deliverables and allocate revenue between the units of accounting in accordance with the emerging issues task force consensus on issue  or eitf  multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
in multiple element arrangements  we use the residual method to allocate revenue to delivered elements once we have established fair value for all undelivered elements 
service revenue consists of research and development funding received from collaborative partners as well as support and maintenance or extended warranty agreements 
product revenue consists of payments from customers for discovery tools systems  comprising hardware  associated software and intellectual property licenses and consumables 
royalties and license fees include fees for licensing of our software  intellectual property  proprietary materials and technology license payments and royalties on laboratory instruments and software sold under license by third parties 
service revenue we recognize revenue from research collaboration agreements and support and maintenance agreements as earned upon performance of the services specified in the agreements 
payments received that are related to future performance are deferred and recognized as revenue as the performance requirements are fulfilled 
non refundable up front payments received in connection with research and development collaboration agreements  including technology access fees  are deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the relevant periods specified in the agreement  generally the research term 
revenue from milestone payments  which are substantially at risk until the milestones are completed  is recognized upon completion of these milestone events 
milestone payments to date have been immaterial 

table of contents product sales we recognize revenue from the sale of discovery tools  and all related costs of products sold are expensed  once delivery has occurred and customer acceptance has been achieved 
a warranty expense accrual is established at the time of customer acceptance 
if there are extended payment terms  we recognize product revenue as these payments become due 
we consider all arrangements with payment terms extending beyond months not to be fixed or determinable 
accordingly  the cost of products sold as a percentage of product revenue will fluctuate from one period to the next based on the timing of when extended payments are due as well as the mix of products sold 
payments received in advance under these arrangements are recorded as deferred revenue until earned 
software license fees for software licensed on an annual right to use basis  revenue is recognized straight line over the term of the license 
for revenue allocable to the software portion of a multiple element arrangement or licensed on a perpetual basis  we recognize revenue upon delivery of the software product to the end user and commencement of the license  unless we have ongoing obligations for which fair value cannot be established or the fee is not fixed or determinable or collectibility is not probable  in which case we recognize revenue only when each of these criteria has been met 
we consider all arrangements with payment terms longer than twelve months not to be fixed or determinable 
if the fee is not fixed or determinable  revenue is recognized as payments become due from the customer 
revenue allocable to support and maintenance is recognized on a straight line basis over the period the support and maintenance is provided 
our product related software licenses may provide for technical support  bug fixes and rights to unspecified upgrades on a when and if available basis for periods defined within the contract 
revenue related to this post contract customer support is deferred and recognized over the term of the contracted support 
intellectual property license fees and royalties we recognize license fee revenue for licenses to our intellectual property when earned under the terms of the agreements 
generally  revenue is recognized upon transfer of the license unless we have continuing obligations for which fair value cannot be established  in which case the revenue is recognized over the period of the obligation 
if there are extended payment terms  we recognize license fee revenue as these payments become due 
we consider all arrangements with payment terms extending beyond months not to be fixed or determinable 
in certain licensing arrangements there is provision for a variable fee as well as a non refundable minimum amount 
in such arrangements  the amount of the non refundable minimum guarantee is recognized upon transfer of the license unless we have continuing obligations for which fair value cannot be established and the amount of the variable fee in excess of the guaranteed minimum is recognized as revenue when it is fixed and determinable 
we recognize royalty revenue based on reported sales by third party licensees of products containing our materials  software and intellectual property 
if there are extended payment terms  royalty revenues are recognized as these payments become due 
non refundable royalties  for which there are no further performance obligations  are recognized when due under the terms of the agreements 
our sources of potential revenue for the next several years are likely to be payments under existing and possible future collaborative arrangements  royalties from our partners based on revenues received from any products commercialized under those agreements  sales of discovery tools  other instruments and associated services  and licensing of software and intellectual property 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of our revenue recognition policies 

table of contents warranty expense accrual a warranty expense accrual is established at the time of customer acceptance of a discovery tool system and is included as a cost of product sold 
management is required to exercise judgment in establishing the appropriate level of warranty expense accrual for each discovery tool system delivered and establishes the accrual based  in part  by reference to actual warranty costs incurred on similar systems 
the actual results with regard to warranty expenditures could have a material unfavorable impact on us if system failures or the costs to repair systems are greater than our estimates 
research and development costs we account for research and development costs in accordance with several accounting pronouncements  including sfas  accounting for research and development costs  and sfas  accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed 
sfas specifies that costs incurred internally in creating a computer software product should be charged to expense when incurred as research and development until technological feasibility has been established for the product 
once technological feasibility is established  all software costs should be capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers 
judgment is required in determining when the technological feasibility of a product is established 
symyx has determined that technological feasibility for its software products is reached shortly before the products are released to manufacturing 
costs incurred after technological feasibility is established are not material  and accordingly  we expense all research and development costs when incurred 
inventories we carry our inventories at the lower of cost or market  cost being determined on a specific identification basis 
we apply judgment in determining the provisions for slow moving  excess and obsolete inventories based on historical experience and anticipated product demand 
accounting for income taxes income taxes have been provided using the liability method 
our effective income tax rate for is based  in part  on the recognition of deferred tax assets that we expect will be realized in the next year and on our projections of future taxable income 
fluctuations in the actual outcome of these projections could materially impact our financial position or results of operations 
a deferred tax asset or liability is determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities as measured by the enacted tax rates that will be in effect when these differences reverse 
we provide a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets unless  based upon the available evidence  it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized 
establishing this valuation allowance involves significant judgment because we have a limited history of profitability and the period over which the potential future benefit from the deferred tax assets may be realized is quite long 
we review our need for a valuation allowance on a quarterly basis and adjust our estimated annual effective income tax rate at that time 
employee stock options we generally grant stock options to our employees for a fixed number of shares with an exercise price equal to the fair value of the shares on the date of grant 
as allowed under the statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas  we have elected to follow accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb and related interpretations in accounting for stock awards to employees 
accordingly  no compensation expense is recognized in our financial statements in connection with stock options granted to employees with exercise prices not less than fair value 
deferred compensation for options granted to employees is determined as the difference between the deemed fair market value of the company s common stock on the date options were granted and the exercise price 
stock based compensation deferred compensation for options granted to employees has been determined as the difference between the deemed fair market value of our common stock on the date options were granted and the exercise price 
deferred compensation for options granted to consultants has been determined in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
as the fair value of the equity instruments issued 
deferred compensation for options granted to consultants is periodically remeasured as the underlying options vest 

table of contents in connection with the grant of stock options to employees and consultants  prior to our initial public offering in we recorded deferred stock compensation of approximately million 
this amount was initially recorded as a component of stockholders equity and is being amortized by charges to operations over the vesting period of the underlying options using the graded vesting method 
we recorded amortization of deferred compensation of approximately  in   in  and  in in connection with options awarded to employees 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a breakdown between operating expense categories 
we also recorded compensation expense of approximately  in  in  and in for options granted to consultants 
results of operations comparison of years ended december  and revenue our total revenue in was million  a decrease of from million in this decrease was primarily due to the decrease in our product revenue caused by lower sales of discovery tools systems 
our service revenue from research collaborations increased from million in to million in including million from a related party in 
our revenue from license fees and royalties increased from million in to million in due to the expansion of our customer base in licensing of materials  software and technology  in particular exxonmobil 
exxonmobil  merck and an undisclosed partner accounted for   and  respectively  of total revenue for the year ended december  exxonmobil  merck and an undisclosed partner accounted for   and  respectively  of revenue for the same period in we segregate revenue by industry collaborations  discovery tools and intellectual property licensing in thousands 
years ended december  industry collaborations industry collaborations related party discovery tools intellectual property licensing total the reconciliation of segment revenue above to the revenue disclosed in the consolidated statement of operations is provided in note  segment disclosure  of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
industry collaboration revenue industry collaboration revenue increased from million in to million in the increase in industry collaboration revenue in was primarily attributable to the funding received under the new alliance agreement we entered into with exxonmobil effective april the increase in industry collaboration revenue from exxonmobil was partially offset by a decrease in the level of funding received from celanese 
we expect to receive over million in revenue from exxonmobil during the year term of the alliance  through our research collaborations  discovery tools  and license of software and intellectual property 
we believe this will greatly contribute to our expected growth in industry collaboration revenue in 
table of contents industry collaboration revenue related party in january  the company formed symyx therapeutics  inc sti as a wholly owned subsidiary 
in connection with the formation of sti  the company licensed to sti exclusive rights to certain of the company s intellectual property within a specific field with no cost basis to the company  while retaining the rights to use and commercialize certain data generated by sti outside its field 
from sti s inception through may   the operating results of sti were consolidated into the company s financial statements 
on may   sti completed a private financing with outside investors led by the sprout group and am ventures  raising an aggregate of million  which reduced the company s ownership position in sti to approximately of shares outstanding 
in november  sti completed a second closing of its series a financing  raising an additional  and diluting the company s ownership position in sti to approximately of shares outstanding 
the company accounts for its ownership interest in sti on the equity method as the company and its affiliates do not control the strategic  operating  investing and financing activities of sti 
as the company s investment in sti has no cost basis for accounting purposes under generally accepted accounting principles  the company has not recorded any proportionate share of sti s operating losses in its financial statements since the completion of sti s initial financing 
on may   the company also entered into an month collaborative research and license agreement with sti 
under the terms of this agreement  sti pays research funding to the company in consideration for direct costs incurred by the company specifically attributable to  or specifically used in furtherance of  the research program 
research funding payments are due to the company at the start of each month  with an adjustment at the end of each month for the difference between forecast and actual costs incurred 
revenue resulting from work performed under this research agreement during the year ended december  amounted to million  and has been classified as related party revenue 
discovery tools revenue the decrease in discovery tools revenue in was primarily due to there being no shipments of polymorph discovery tools systems in during year  we shipped discovery tools systems to merck  north dakota state university  battelle memorial institute and several other customers 
discovery tools revenue included  of product sales   of service revenue  and  of software license revenue for the year ended december  and  of product sales   of service revenue and  of software license revenue for the year ended december  in  we expect to ship a biocatalysis workflow to merck and a polymorph system to pfizer 
we are currently negotiating with other chemical and pharmaceutical companies for the sale of discovery tools systems 
we have also initiated separate software licensing discussions with other chemical and pharmaceutical companies 
we believe our expanding customer base will contribute to our expected growth of discovery tools revenue in intellectual property licensing revenue intellectual property licensing revenue increased from million in to million in the increase in licensing revenue in was primarily due to payments received from exxonmobil and hella kg 
we believe that the demonstrated acceptance of our high throughput experimentation technology by our customers will lead to the expected growth in our license fee revenue in in the final quarter of  we received our first royalty payments from agfa for the sale of our commercialized material 
cost of products sold cost of products sold was million  or of product sales revenue for the year ended december   compared to million  or of product sales revenue for the year ended december  the decrease in the cost of products sold was due to the change in the product mix shipped in the respective years 

table of contents we have had limited sales of discovery tools systems and consumables to date and the systems are often built to the customer specifications 
therefore  the cost of products sold is expected to fluctuate from period to period and will be driven by the variability of product mix and sales volumes in each period 
research and development expenses our research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnel related expenses  facility costs  supplies  and depreciation of facilities and laboratory equipment 
the table below indicates the major collaborative partners  defined as those contributing greater than of collaborative research revenue in  for whom symyx conducted research and development  together with the primary focus of the collaborations and the date upon which the current contract ends 
contracts may only be extended by mutual agreement between symyx and the collaborative partner 
current research partner contract ends primary focus of current collaborative efforts dow chemical catalysts for polyolefins exxonmobil catalysts for certain commodity chemicals including olefins undisclosed partner catalysts for automotive applications we do not track fully burdened research and development costs or capital expenditures by project 
however  we estimate based on full time equivalent fte effort  that approximately of research development efforts in were undertaken for collaborative projects funded by our partners  and approximately of research effort was on our own internally funded research including development costs related to our discovery tools business 
this compares with approximately of research development efforts being undertaken for collaborative projects funded by our partners  and approximately of research effort on our own internally funded research including development costs related to our discovery tools business during due to the nature of our research and our dependence on our collaborative partners to commercialize the results of the research  we cannot predict with any certainty whether any particular collaboration or research effort will ultimately result in a commercial product and therefore whether we will achieve future milestones or royalty payments under our various collaborations 
research and development expenses in were million  including million of direct costs of research services provided to a related party  compared with million in  an increase of  or 
the increase in was due primarily to increases in salary related expenses due to the hiring of additional scientific and technical staff to work on research and development projects for exxonmobil and our related party  sti 
research and development expenses represented of total revenues in and of total revenues in our core businesses are research to discover new materials  the sale of instruments and licensing of related software and licensing of intellectual property and materials discovered in our collaborative and internal research programs 
accordingly  we expect to continue to devote substantial resources to research and development  and we expect that research and development expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars 
sales  general and administrative expenses our sales  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for business development  legal  general management  finance and human resources  as well as payments of commissions to our sales agents and professional expenses  such as legal and accounting 
sales  general and administrative expenses in were million  compared with million in  an increase of  or 
the increase was primarily due to the addition of a number of business development staff and their associated costs to manage and support our growth 
sales  general and administrative expenses represented of total revenues in and of total revenues in we expect that our sales  general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollar amounts as we continue to expand our business development and administrative staff  support existing and expanded laboratory and engineering facilities  and incur escalating insurance and other administrative costs 

table of contents net interest income net interest income represents interest income earned on our cash  cash equivalent and available for sale securities 
interest income was million in  compared with million in this decrease was due to lower interest rates in interest expense was nil in  compared with  in provision for income taxes we recorded an income tax expense of million in and million in our effective income tax rate was for fiscal year and for fiscal year the decrease in our effective income tax rate in was due to the fact that we recognized approximately million of income tax benefits from certain of our deferred tax assets in  which had previously been reserved 
we do not have a sufficient history of profitability to fully benefit all of our deferred tax assets at this time 
the largest component of our unbenefited deferred tax assets arises because our depreciation expense for accounting purposes is substantially higher than our tax depreciation expense 
until we have a more established history of profitability  we will not be sufficiently confident of receiving the full benefit of these future income tax deductions 
as of december   we had net deferred tax assets of approximately million 
our net deferred tax assets primarily relate to revenue that has been recognized for income tax purposes but deferred for financial reporting purposes together with reserves and accruals that have been recognized for financial reporting purposes but not for income tax purposes  partially offset by accelerated income tax deductions for insurance and property tax 
at december   we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million  the majority of which were attributable to stock option deductions and whose benefit  if realized  will be recognized directly to equity 
the net operating loss carryforwards will start to expire in  if not utilized 
utilization of the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code of  as amended  and similar state provisions 
the annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards before utilization 
comparison of years ended december  and revenue our total revenue in was million  an increase of from million in this increase was due to the growth of product sales to million in  up from million in our service revenue from research collaborations decreased from million in to million in due mainly to the expiration of a number of technology access fees in and the expiration and non renewal of other contracts due largely to budget constraints being faced by our collaborative partners 
exxonmobil chemical company  eli lilly and the dow chemical company  accounted for   and  respectively  of total revenue for the year ended december  exxonmobil chemical company  the dow chemical company and bayer accounted for   and  respectively  of revenue for the same period in we segregate revenue by industry collaborations  discovery tools and intellectual property licensing in thousands

table of contents industry collaboration revenue the decrease in industry collaboration revenue in was largely attributable to the conclusion of the technology access fees paid under the bayer and dow collaboration contracts and recognized over the life of those contracts  a reduction in the level of funding received from dow and celanese in  the conclusion of the applied biosystems collaboration at december   the expiration of the basf and ici collaborations in and the conclusion of the funding received from merck under the polymorph systems development collaboration during these reductions in funding received were partially offset by the increase in funding received under the exxonmobil collaboration in  an increase in funding attributable to a research collaboration with an undisclosed partner and a number of new smaller collaborations 
discovery tools revenue the increase in discovery tools revenue in was attributable mainly to the shipment of discovery tools polymorph systems to merck and eli lilly and discovery tools solubility systems to merck  lilly and amgen during we also shipped discovery tools systems to north dakota state university  an unnamed customer and dow chemical company in discovery tools revenue included  of product sales   of service revenues  and  of software license revenue for the year ended december  and  of product sales and  of software license revenue for the year ended december  intellectual property licensing revenue the increase in intellectual property licensing revenue in was due to the licensing of patents to general electric  bayer and an undisclosed licensee  together with a fully paid up license fee received from argonaut technologies  inc licensing revenue for the year ended december  included advance royalty payments received under the abi collaboration that expired on december  cost of products sold cost of products sold was million  or of product sales revenue for the year ended december   compared to million  or of product sales revenue for the year ended december  the decrease in the cost of products sold was due to the change in the product mix shipped in the respective years

recent accounting pronouncements multiple deliverable revenue arrangements in november  the emerging issues task force reached a consensus on issue  multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
eitf addresses how to account for arrangements that may involve the delivery or performance of multiple products  services and or rights to use assets 
the consensus mandates how to identify whether goods or services or both which are to be delivered separately in a bundled sales arrangement should be accounted for separately because they are separate units of accounting 
the guidance can affect the timing of revenue recognition for such arrangements  even though it does not change rules governing the timing or patterns of revenue recognition of individual items accounted for separately 
the final consensus is applicable to agreements entered into in periods beginning after june  with early adoption permitted 
additionally  companies will be permitted to apply the consensus guidance to all existing arrangements as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no

fin applies immediately to variable interest entities created after january   and to variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date 
it applies in the first fiscal year or interim period ending after december   to variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that it acquired before february  in an entity known as a special purpose entity 
fin applies to public enterprises as of the beginning of the applicable interim or annual period ending after march  for all other variable interest entities 
there was no impact upon our financial condition or results from 
table of contents operations from the adoption of the initial provisions of fin and no impact is expected upon adoption of the remaining provisions in liquidity and capital resources this section discusses the effects of the changes in our balance sheets  cash flows  and commitments on our liquidity and capital resources 
balance sheet and cash flows we had positive cash flow from operating activities for the year ended december  and finished the year with cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities of approximately million  an increase of million from december  the million increase in cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities during  was influenced significantly by a million decrease in outstanding accounts receivable and a million increase in deferred revenue  both of which were attributable largely to the timing of payments for discovery tools systems 
as of december   symyx had no long term liabilities 
our operating activities provided million  million and million of cash in  and  respectively 
the sources of cash for the three years were primarily the receipt of research and development funding from collaborative partners and revenue from product sales and licensing  partially offset by operating expenses 
we expect that we will continue to generate positive cash flow from our operating activities in the near future 
net cash used in investing activities was million  million and million  respectively  in  and the fluctuations from period to period are due primarily to the timing of purchases  sales and maturity of our available for sale securities 
cash used in purchases of property and equipment was million  million and million  respectively  in  and we expect to continue to make significant investments in the purchase of property and equipment to support our expanding operations 
financing activities provided cash of million and million in and  respectively and used cash of million in these amounts are primarily the proceeds from the exercise of stock options and sale of stock under the employee share purchase plan in each of the three years  offset by partial repayments of equipment and leasehold improvement loan financing in the increase from to is due primarily to the fact that employees more actively exercised stock options as our stock price increased in current liabilities increased by approximately million at december  as compared to december  the increase was due primarily to a million increase in deferred revenue at december   attributable largely to advanced deposits on discovery tools systems to be delivered in backlog as of december   our customers have contractually committed to funding of approximately million for the purchase by customers of discovery tools systems  licenses to our intellectual property and for research and development with existing collaborative partners 
commitments as of december  and  our principal commitments were million and million  respectively 
principal commitments consisted of our obligations under operating leases and our commitments to purchase inventory 
we will satisfy these obligations as they become due over the next seven years 

table of contents future commitments under the operating leases for our facilities and purchase commitments for inventory as of december  are as follows in thousands total year years years more than years facility commitments purchase commitments total we believe that our current cash  available for sale securities balances and the cash flows generated by operations will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash needs for working capital  capital expenditures  investment requirements  stock repurchases and other liquidity requirements associated with our existing operations for at least the coming year 
nonetheless  we may raise additional funds through public or private financing  collaborative relationships or other arrangements 
we cannot assure you that additional funding  if sought  will be available on terms favorable to us 
further  any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders  and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
collaborative arrangements may require us to relinquish our rights to some of our technologies or products 
our failure to raise capital when needed may harm our business and operating results 
a portion of our cash may be used to acquire or invest in complementary businesses or products or to obtain the right to use complementary technologies 
from time to time  in the ordinary course of business  we may evaluate potential acquisitions of such businesses  products or technologies 
contingencies we are currently not a party to any legal proceedings that we believe to be material 
we may become subject to legal proceedings  claims  and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business 
although the outcome of these matters is currently not determinable  management does not expect that the ultimate costs to resolve these matters will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows
