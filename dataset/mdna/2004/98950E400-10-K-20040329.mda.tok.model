item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview through our divisions and subsidiaries  we engage in the business of designing  manufacturing and distributing medical devices 
our therapeutics division markets enteral nutrition delivery devices 
until its sale on december  our physical evaluation division marketed industry leading physical evaluation testing systems 
our applied technology division designs and manufactures advanced medical components and systems for original equipment manufacturers oem s 
please refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of our business segments 
we entered the enteral nutrition delivery segment of the home health care market in with the introduction of the enteralite r ambulatory enteral feeding pump  which continues to gain acceptance due to its superior mobility and state of the art features 
we believe that by improving the convenience of nutrition delivery  the enteralite r and future products we can contribute to better clinical outcomes and improved quality of life for enteral patients 
domestic sales of our enteralite r product line grew by in and in combining our international enteralite r revenue with domestic revenue  the total product line growth was in and in at the times of the acquisition of the nutrition medical line of stationary enteral feeding pumps and the acquisition of the nestle usa  inc enteral nutrition delivery business  we intended to aggressively expand into the long term care market for enteral feeding delivery products 
after several years of downward competitive pricing pressure in this market segment  our revenue has decreased by 
until december   we competed in the physical evaluation market through our sales of stand alone and computerized products that measure isolated muscle strength  joint ranges of motion and sensation 
we acquired the physical evaluation business in revenue has not grown substantially during the last several years  and in  revenue decreased compared to meanwhile  costs associated with this business segment have increased  including those associated with selling and marketing and research and development 
since  we have been a contract manufacturer providing design and manufacturing services to medical companies who sell our components and systems under private label  primarily incorporating our core technologies of ultrasound  fluid delivery and optoelectronics 
the rapid growth of the outsourced contract manufacturing services industry has slowed down over the past two years as a result of the generally weak us economy  and the impact of overcapacity and increased competition in the medical systems product area 
last year  in response to the changing marketplaces of our business segments  we evaluated our business opportunities and refocused on our core market offerings of ambulatory enteral feeding and our specialized core contract manufacturing services 
we established a lean manufacturing philosophy  including the transition from batch processing to continuous flow production  developed a business model with market development strategies designed to capitalize on profitable business opportunities  and sold the physical evaluation business in december 
on december   we completed the sale of our physical evaluation business 
the transaction was accomplished by the sale of all the issued and outstanding capital stock of jtech 
the transaction was effected by a stock purchase agreement dated december  by and between us and mr 
leonard c 
smith  a former employee  officer and director of zevex 
see discussion below results of operations as an aid to understanding our operating results  the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the relative percentages that certain items in the statement of operations bear to revenue 
year ended december statement of operations data percentage of revenue revenue gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses research and development expenses asset and goodwill impairment operating income loss on sale of business impairment loss on securities other income expense income loss before income taxes benefit provision for income taxes net loss income fiscal year compared to fiscal year on december   we completed the sale of our physical evaluation business 
the transaction was accomplished by the sale of all the issued and outstanding capital stock of jtech 
the transaction was effected by a stock purchase agreement dated december  by and between us and mr 
leonard c 
smith  a former employee  officer and director of the company  for a purchase price of million which was recorded as an other receivable at december  cash of  was received on january  jtech withheld  of the purchase price until we satisfied certain obligations to jtech as set forth in the stock purchase agreement 
such obligations include the requirement to deliver inventory  upon completion of production  and certain other equipment 
deferred revenue of  was recorded related to these obligations 
additionally  pursuant to the stock purchase agreement  we may receive additional payments from the purchaser based upon specifically identified jtech product sales in and a loss on the sale of business in the amount of  was recorded and is shown separately on the consolidated statement of operations 
such loss consists of the write off of goodwill and acquisition costs as well as the write off of certain other jtech assets totaling approximately  and the accrual of legal costs associated with the transaction 
during the fourth quarter of  we evaluated our business opportunities and modified our strategies to focus on our core market offerings of ambulatory enteral feeding and contract manufacturing services 
in conjunction with this refocus of our business  on december   we completed the sale of jtech  our physical evaluation business 
at the time of the sale  goodwill associated with jtech was stated at a net value of  on our balance sheet 
upon completion of the sale  the goodwill and the related accumulated amortization were removed from the balance sheet and the resulting loss is included in the consolidated statement of operations within the loss on sale of business 
also in conjunction with this refocus  we re evaluated as defined by sfas no 
our reporting units and determined that the therapeutics reporting unit  which had consisted of both our stationary and ambulatory enteral product lines  should be disaggregated such that the two product lines became separate reporting units because of the different market and sales practices of the stationary enteral product line and the change in focus 
therefore  in the fourth quarter of  due to declining sales and cash flows relating to the stationary enteral product line  we determined that indicators of impairment existed related to this reporting unit 
upon completion of impairment testing we determined that the fair value of the stationary enteral reporting unit was less than the carrying value including goodwill 
as such a goodwill impairment loss has been recognized in for this reporting unit in the amount of  this loss is included in asset and goodwill impairment on the consolidated statement of operations 
as noted above  we modified our future business strategies in the fourth quarter of in conjunction with our business refocus  we also evaluated our long lived assets to determine if indicators of impairment existed 
based upon our assessment of projected future cash flows related to our stationary enteral product line  we determined that impairment of the fixed asset value for our stationary enteral pumps existed 
we recorded an impairment charge of  as reflected in the consolidated statement of operations within asset and goodwill impairment 
revenue was  for the year ended december   compared to  for the prior year  a increase 
the increase in revenue over is largely due to an increase in domestic sales of enteralite r ambulatory enteral nutrition delivery pump and disposable set products and an increase of approximately  in international sales of our enteral pumps  within our therapeutics division 
in addition  in our applied technology division revenue from manufactured products and engineering services increased over 
this revenue growth was partially offset by a decline in orders for stationary enteral nutrition delivery pump disposable sets and weaker demand for physical evaluation products now discontinued that resulted in a decline in sales of approximately 
the percentage of revenue generated from our proprietary products decreased when compared to revenue from contract manufacturing 
in  of our revenue was derived from proprietary products marketed by us  in comparison to in sales of our therapeutics products accounted for approximately of total revenue for the year ended december   which is consistent with sales from our physical evaluation product line accounted for approximately of total revenue for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  forty percent of our revenue during was derived from products manufactured for and sold to our contract manufacturing customers  compared to in this shift in revenue sources from our proprietary products to contract manufacturing customers in was primarily related to the decrease in stationary pump disposable revenue and the physical evaluation products revenue 
during and  no single customer accounted for over of our revenue 
our gross profit as a percentage of sales was in  compared to in we attribute the decrease in gross profit percentage from to to the write off of discontinued products and miscellaneous obsolete inventory in our therapeutics division  downward pricing pressure related to some of our therapeutics products  non recurring manufacturing engineering costs associated with establishing new production lines in applied technology division  and the product mix delivered from our applied technology division during the years 
we expect that our gross profit will increase to approximately of gross revenue in  when taking into consideration our anticipated product revenue mix and the implementation of the lean manufacturing process 
selling  general  and administrative expenses decreased during to  of sales  as compared to  of sales in although we have reduced certain general and administrative costs  we continued to invest in building our domestic sales forces for the physical evaluation and therapeutics divisions 
overall  sales and marketing expenses increased to  for  from  in we expect that selling  general  and administrative expenses will decrease to approximately of gross revenue in  when taking into consideration the sale of the physical evaluation business on december  we combine the resources of our full time engineers with several independent contractors  to perform research and development projects 
we invested  in   in  and  in for research and development of new products 
in  research and development costs represented approximately of our annual revenue  compared to in and in we are continuing our efforts to develop and introduce new proprietary products for our therapeutics division and proprietary component technologies for our applied technology division 
we expect research and development costs to be approximately of revenue during depreciation and amortization expenses decreased to  in excluding impairment from  in as discussed above we recorded an impairment charge of  in see note of the financial statements under goodwill  and impairment of long lived assets for more information on the effect of the impairment 
goodwill held by us represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the tangible and other specifically identified intangible assets obtained in acquisitions by zevex 
the current value of goodwill included in the financial statements is  as of december  we had an income tax benefit of  in compared to income tax expense of  in the change from to is primarily due to the loss before income taxes as described below 
for  our effective tax rate differed from the statutory rate largely as a result of an increase in our valuation allowance see below  research and development tax credits  and permanent asset basis differences 
for  our effective tax rate differed from the statutory rate largely as a result of a reduction in our valuation allowance see below  research and development tax credits  and charitable contribution deductions 
at december   we had net current deferred tax assets of realization of our gross deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate taxable income in the year the assets are realized 
under fas accounting for income taxes  guidance has been issued relating to cumulative losses in recent years 
under this guidance  when there is a cumulative pretax loss for financial reporting for the current and two preceding years and a company does not have objective planning strategies designed to realize its deferred tax assets  no deferred tax asset should be recognized 
in following this guidance management has established a full valuation allowance for all deferred tax assets 
zevex  through the sale of the physical evaluation business in  generated a pre tax capital loss carryover of approximately  for federal and  for state purposes 
in addition  in  we had a pre tax net operating loss carryforward in the amount of  other net deferred tax assets at december  before the valuation allowance totaled  we evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets and assess the need for valuation allowances annually 
during we had an operating loss of  compared to operating income of  of revenue in we had a net loss of  compared to net income of  of revenue in the net loss during  as compared to the net income in  is due to a number of factors  including  i loss on the sale of our physical evaluation business in the amount of  ii the one time impairment expense on fixed assets and goodwill relating to the stationary enteral pumps and disposable business of  iii lower gross profit achieved in as our gross margin decreased from in to in  iv increased selling and marketing expenses  and v increased research and development costs 
our annual and quarterly operating results are affected by acceptance in the markets for our proprietary and contract manufactured products  including the volume and timing of customer orders  which vary due to i variation in demand for the customers products or services as a result of  among other things  product life cycles  competitive conditions  and general economic conditions  ii the customers attempt to balance their inventory  iii the customers need to adapt to changing regulatory conditions and requirements  and iv changes in the customers preferences or strategies 
technical difficulties and delays in the design and manufacturing processes may also affect such results 
the foregoing factors may cause fluctuations in revenue and variations in product mix  which could in turn cause fluctuations in our gross margin 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation 
revenue was  for the year ended december   compared to  for the prior year  a decrease 
the decrease in revenue was largely due to i the delay and decrease of several orders for contract manufactured products  including those related to a customer which had reorganized its corporate structure through a spin out from its parent  a customer which had been reducing inventory levels and safety stock  and a customer which delayed orders due to an issue not involving us  ii an overall decline in orders for stationary enteral nutrition delivery pump disposable sets  iii difficulty in maintaining a steady flow of contract manufacturing products upon completion of certain projects  and iv weaker demand for physical evaluation products  as clinicians were hesitant to make capital equipment purchases during a period of economic uncertainty 
we did experience  however  a number of developments that positively impacted revenue in during the second half of scheduled shipments of surgical handpieces and ultrasonic sensors increased compared to the first six months of through the last three quarters of  we continued our engineering on a time and materials development program for a mobile organ perfusion system 
further  during the fourth quarter of we experienced an increase in orders for private label enteral feeding pumps from a european customer 
during  revenue from the stationary enteral nutrition delivery pump disposable sets appeared to have stabilized  achieving sales of approximately million in each quarter 
revenue of our physical evaluation products were greatest during the fourth quarter of  when we achieved sales of million 
the percentage of revenue generated from the marketing of our proprietary products increased when compared to revenue from contract manufacturing 
in  of our revenue was derived from products marketed by us  in comparison to in sales of our therapeutics products accounted for approximately of total revenue for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  sales from our physical evaluation product line accounted for approximately of total revenue for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  thirty eight percent of our revenue during was derived from products manufactured for and sold to our contract manufacturing customers  compared to in this shift in revenue sources from our contract manufacturing customers to proprietary products over the last three years has the benefit of decreasing the percentage of our revenue generated by a small number of major customers 
during and  no single customer accounted for over of our revenue 
our gross profit as a percentage of sales was in  compared to in we attributed the increase in gross profit percentage from to to improvements in manufacturing and distribution efficiencies and the change in product mix delivered during the year 
selling  general  and administrative expenses decreased during to  of sales  as compared to  of sales in although we decreased certain general and administrative costs  we invested in building our domestic sales forces for the physical evaluation and therapeutics divisions 
general and administrative expenses decreased in  as included additional legal and professional costs incurred due to a record number of patent applications  and our response to the office of the inspector general s nationwide investigation into billing practices in the enteral device market 
also  expenses related to goodwill amortization were eliminated in with the adoption of sfas no 
as of january  see note of the financial statements for more information on the effect of this accounting change 
we combined the resources of our full time engineers with several independent contractors  to perform research and development projects during and we invested  in  and  in for research and development of new products 
in  research and development costs represented approximately of our annual revenue  compared to in depreciation and amortization expenses decreased to  in  from  in the decrease is due to the elimination of goodwill amortization  as of january   with the adoption of sfas no 
see note of the financial statements for more information on the effect of this accounting change 
goodwill held by us in represented the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the tangible and other specifically identified intangible assets obtained in acquisitions by zevex 
the value of goodwill included in the financial statements was  and represented approximately of total assets 
we had income tax expense of  in  compared to an income tax benefit of  for the change from to was primarily due to increased income before taxes as described above 
for  our effective tax rate differed from the statutory rate largely as a result of a reduction in our valuation allowance see below  research and development tax credits  and charitable contribution deductions 
for  our effective tax rate differed from the statutory rate largely as a result of nondeductible goodwill amortization 
at december   we had net current deferred tax assets of approximately  and net non current deferred tax liabilities of approximately  zevex  through our sale of the aborn corporate shell in  generated a capital loss carryover of approximately  in  a valuation allowance of  was established 
in   of the carryover was utilized and the valuation allowance was reduced 
because we had not determined that it is more likely than not that the remaining carryover would be realized prior to its expiration  a valuation allowance was established for the remaining amount 
during  we made a charitable contribution of certain patent rights to an institution of higher education with a fair market value of  during a tax benefit of  as determined based upon applicable federal rates  was recognized for the charitable contribution 
for income tax purposes  charitable contributions are only recognizable if a company has taxable income 
a valuation allowance of approximately  was provided for the contribution carryover of  which was generated from the patent donation because we did not consider it to be more likely than not that this carryover would be utilized 
we evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets and assess the need for valuation allowances annually 
operating income decreased to  of revenue in compared to  of revenue in we had net income of  of gross revenue in  compared to a net loss of  of revenue in the increase in net income during  as compared to  was due to a number of factors  including  i the one time impairment loss on marketable securities in the amount of  in the third quarter of  ii higher gross profit achieved in  iii a reduction in interest expense from  to  due to decreased debt and lower interest rates in  iv nonamortization of goodwill under sfas no 
 which was adopted as of january   and v the tax benefit derived from a capital loss  which  for state tax purposes  was treated as a net operating loss carryback for income tax purposes and resulted in a refund recognized in however  the impact of these changes was reduced by lower revenue during liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity have consisted of cash flow from operations  borrowings under our revolving line of credit  and the other financial arrangements described below 
in some prior years  we also increased working capital through the issuance of stock and may do so in the future 
cash flow provided from operating activities for was  compared to cash flow provided in of  in  cash flow provided by operating activities was primarily associated with the reduction of accounts receivable due to better collection procedures and reduction in inventories as we continued to stream line our purchasing process and implemented lean manufacturing processes 
cash flow used in investing activities during was  and relates primarily to the purchase of equipment used for manufacturing and additional capitalized patent expenses 
cash flow provided from operating activities for was  in  cash provided by operating activities was also primarily associated with the reduction of accounts receivable due to better collection procedures and reduction in inventories as we recognized the benefit of our manufacturing resource planning software 
cash flow used in investing activities during was  and relates primarily to the purchase of equipment used for manufacturing and offset largely as a result of the sale of securities held by us 
our working capital at december   was  compared to  at december  our decrease in working capital of  in was primarily due to the reduction of accounts receivable and inventories offset by an increase in the net other receivables related to the sale of the physical evaluation division and payment of current debt outstanding at december  the portion of working capital represented by cash and short term investments at such dates was  and respectively 
the ratio of current assets to current liabilities increased to to at december  from to at december  on december   we committed to pay up to  in cash and issued convertible debentures in the aggregate amount of  to vijay lumba and harry parmar as partial consideration for the acquisition of all issued and outstanding stock of aborn

we made a principal payment during of  in full payment of the debentures 
on december   we had a  open line of credit arrangement with a financial institution 
the line was reduced to  in march and matures on may  we do not anticipate the need for the line of credit to exceed million in the near future and expect that we will be able to renew our line of credit in may the line of credit is collateralized by accounts receivable and inventories  and bears interest at the financial institution s prime rate 
we owed  on the line of credit at december  and at december  as of march  we had paid off our line of credit 
in the fourth quarter of  we failed to meet certain financial covenants of our line credit 
we received a waiver for such covenants  and these covenants were modified for the first three quarters of  beginning with the quarter ending march  on march   we entered into a secured financing agreement with a bank in the amount of  the agreement is secured by our enteral feeding pumps  which were purchased from nestle and are now manufactured by us 
the proceeds from the agreement were used to reduce our line of credit balance 
the agreement had a month term  due on february   and bore interest at an annual rate of 
we paid off the financing agreement in march  primarily using cash flow from operations and proceeds from our line of credit in the amount of  on april   the company entered into a term loan agreement with a bank for the amount of  the agreement is secured by the company s manufacturing facility

other as part of a nationwide investigation into billing practices associated with enteral nutrition delivery products  particularly in regard to billing practices for pumps and disposable delivery sets  on july   the us office of inspector general oig  served a subpoena on the zevex  inc subsidiary 
according to published reports  the investigation involved most manufacturers  distributors and health care service providers in the united states enteral pump industry and similar subpoenas were served on many of those parties 
the subpoena requested documents relating to our enteral pump customers  marketing and billing practices 
we responded to the subpoena 
since october of we have not been contacted further by the oig  although we understand the investigation is proceeding and we intend to cooperate with the investigation when contacted again 
at this time we are uncertain as to any future impact this investigation will have on our operations or financial position 
inflation and changing prices we have not been  and in the near term are not expected to be  materially affected by inflation or changing prices 
critical accounting policies and estimates in response to the sec s release numbers cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies and  commission statement about management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  we have identified the following critical accounting policies that affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures 
our significant accounting policies are included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an on going basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
our experience and assumptions form the basis for our judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may vary from what we anticipate and different assumptions or estimates about the future could change our reported results 
we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical to us  in that they are material to the portrayal of our financial statements and they require our most difficult  subjective  or complex judgments in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements allowance for doubtful accounts as a general policy  collateral is not required for accounts receivable  however  we periodically monitor the need for an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon expected collections of accounts receivable  historical bad debt rates  and specific identification of uncollectible accounts 
based on these factors  we record an allowance to provide for accounts that we believe may not be ultimately collectable 
additionally  customers financial condition and credit worthiness are regularly evaluated 
historically losses on collections have not been material 
as of december   we have recorded an allowance for bad debts of  approximately of accounts receivable 
product and inventory obsolescence rapid change and technological innovation characterize the marketplace for medical products 
as a result  we and our customers are subject to the risk of product and inventory obsolescence  whether from prolonged development  government approval cycles  or the development of improved products or processes by competitors 
in addition  the marketplace could conclude that the task for which a customer s medical product was designed is no longer an element of a generally accepted diagnostic or treatment regimen 
accordingly  we write down inventory that we believe is in excess or obsolete 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  cost is determined using the first in  first out method 
as of december   we have reduced inventory by the amount of  which is approximately of gross inventories 
sales returns and warranty we record a provision for estimated sales returns and allowances and warranty reserve on products we have sold 
these estimates are based on historical sales returns and warranty expenses and other known factors 
if the historical data we use to calculate these estimates does not properly reflect future returns and warranty expenses  revenue could be overstated or understated and expenses could be understated or overstated 
we have recorded a sales return and warranty expense allowance in the amount of  as of december  revenue recognition we recognize revenue from products sold directly to end customers when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed and determinable  shipment is made and title has passed  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
if such criteria are not met  revenue is deferred 
contracts to perform engineering design and product development services are generally performed on a time and materials basis 
revenue generally is recognized as milestones are achieved 
we account for revenue from software transactions pursuant to sop no 
 software revenue recognition  as amended by sop no 
and sop no 
sop no 
requires that revenue recognized from software arrangements be allocated to each element of the arrangement based on the relative fair values of the elements  such as software products  upgrades  enhancements  post contract customer support  installation  or training 
under sop no 
 the determination of fair value is based on objective evidence  which is specific to the vendor 
if such evidence of fair value for each element of the arrangement does not exist  all revenue from the arrangement is deferred until such time that evidence of fair value does exist or until all elements of the arrangement are delivered 
as of december  we sold our physical evaluation business and no longer sell software or related services 
impairment we have made acquisitions in the past that included a significant amount of fixed assets  goodwill  and other intangible assets 
the cost of the acquired companies was allocated first to identifiable assets based  on estimated fair values 
intangible assets consist of goodwill  contracts  patents  and licenses 
effective in  goodwill is no longer amortized but is subject to an annual or  under certain circumstances  more frequent impairment test  based on its estimated fair value 
other intangible assets will generally continue to be amortized over their useful lives and also will be subject to an impairment test based on estimated fair value 
estimated fair value is typically less than values based on undiscounted operating earnings because fair value estimates include a discount factor in valuing future cash flows 
there are many assumptions and estimates underlying the determination of an impairment loss 
another estimate using different  but still reasonable  assumptions could produce a significantly different result 
therefore  impairment losses could be recorded in the future 
currently  we assess the impairment of fixed assets and identifiable intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include the following o a significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  o a significant change in the manner of how we use the acquired asset or the strategy for our overall business  o a significant negative industry or economic trend 
when we determine that one or more of the above indicators of impairment exist  we evaluate the carrying amounts of the affected assets 
the evaluation  which involves significant management judgment  is based on various analyses including cash flow and profitability projections 
to the extent such projections indicate that future undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover the carrying amounts of the related long lived assets  the carrying amount of the underlying assets will be reduced  with the reduction charged to expense  so that the carrying amount is equal to fair value  primarily determined based on future discounted cash flows  using a discount rate determined by management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
in accordance with sfas no 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets must be reviewed annually or more frequently under certain conditions for impairment in accordance with this statement 
this impairment test uses a fair value approach  rather than the undiscounted cash flows approach previously required 
we are annually required to complete step determining and comparing the fair value of our reporting units to their carrying values of the impairment test 
step is required to be completed if step indicates that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value  involves the calculation of the implied fair value of goodwill 
we completed step of the impairment assessment for each reporting unit at its annual impairment testing date 
at that time  based upon our valuation procedures  we determined that the fair value of the reporting units exceeded their carrying values 
as such  we were not required to complete step of the impairment test and no impairment loss was recognized at that time 
during the fourth quarter of  we evaluated our business opportunities and modified our strategies to focus on our core market offerings of ambulatory enteral feeding and contract manufacturing services 
in conjunction with this refocus  we re evaluated our reporting units and determined that the therapeutics reporting unit  which had consisted of both our stationary and ambulatory enteral product lines  should be disaggregated such that the two product lines became separate reporting units because of the different market and sales practices of the stationary enteral product line 
in the fourth quarter of  due to declining revenue and cash flows relating to the stationary enteral product line  we determined that indicators of impairment existed related to this reporting unit and again completed step of the impairment test 
upon completion of step  we determined that the fair value of the stationary enteral reporting unit was less than the carrying value including goodwill 
as such we completed step of the impairment assessment and a goodwill impairment loss has been recognized in for this reporting unit in the amount of  this loss is included in asset and goodwill impairment on the consolidated statement of operations 
due to the significant changes to our overall business strategies  we also performed an analysis in the fourth quarter of to determine if any indicators of impairment existed related to the applied technology reporting unit 
we determined that our impairment test performed as part of our annual impairment analysis continued to be appropriate and no impairment loss was required 
in the fourth quarter of we also evaluated our long lived assets to determine if indicators of impairment existed 
based upon our assessment of cash flows related to our stationary enteral product line  we determined that impairment of the fixed asset value for our stationary enteral pumps existed 
we recorded an impairment charge of  as reflected in the consolidated statement of operations within asset and goodwill impairment 
net intangible assets and goodwill amounted to approximately million as of december  net fixed assets amounted to approximately million as of december  income taxes income taxes are recorded based on the liability method  which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities measured using enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce our deferred tax asset to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized  as determined based on our analyses of projected taxable income  including tax strategies available to generate future taxable income 
our analyses of future taxable income are subject to a wide range of variables  many of which involve our estimates  and therefore our deferred tax asset may not be ultimately realized 
as of december  a full valuation has been recorded for all deferred tax assets 
new accounting pronouncements in june  sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities was issued 
this statement provides guidance on the recognition and measurement of liabilities associated with disposal activities and is effective for us on january  we adopted sfas no 
effective january  as expected  the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations of zevex 
in november of  the eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
this issue addresses certain aspects of accounting for arrangements whereby a vendor performs multiple revenue generating activities 
this issue addresses how to determine whether an arrangement involving multiple deliverables contains more than one unit of accounting and how the related revenue should be measured and allocated to the separate units of accounting

factors that may affect future results cautionary statements under the private securities litigation reform act of the disclosure and analysis set forth in this form k contain certain forward looking statements  particularly statements relating to future actions  performance or results of current and anticipated products  sales efforts  expenditures  and future financial results 
from time to time  we also provide forward looking statements in other publicly released materials  both written and oral 
these statements are statements that do not relate strictly to historical or current facts 
when used in this report or our other publicly released materials  the words such as plans  expects  will  estimates  believes  projects  anticipates and similar expressions  together with other discussion of future trends or results  are intended to identify forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
in all cases  a broad variety of risks and uncertainties  known and unknown  as well as inaccurate assumptions can affect the realization of the expectations or forecasts in those statements 
consequently  while such statements represent our current views  no forward looking statement can be guaranteed 
actual future results may vary materially 
we undertake no obligation to update any forward looking statements  but investors are advised to consult any further disclosures by us in our subsequent filings pursuant to the securities exchange act of  as amended 
furthermore  in accordance with the private securities litigation reform act of  we provide the following cautionary statements  identifying factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results 
it is not possible to foresee or identify all such factors 
consequently  this list should not be considered an exhaustive statement of all potential risks  uncertainties  and inaccurate assumptions 
additionally  the following factors should be reviewed for a full understanding of our business and considered in evaluating our prospects for future growth 
the occurrence of one or more of the following risks or uncertainties could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  and financial condition 
risk factors relating to our oem customers our success in contract manufacturing depends largely on the success of our customers and their need for our manufacturing services and on the devices designed and manufactured by us for those customers 
any unfavorable developments or adverse effects on the sales of those devices or such customers businesses  results of operations  or financial position could have a corresponding adverse effect on us 
in addition  we sell certain types of medical devices to multiple customers and  to the extent there is an unfavorable development affecting the sales of any such type of device generally  the adverse effect of such development on us would be more substantial than that presented by the decline in sales to a single customer for such type of device 
additionally  we believe that our design and manufacturing customers and their devices and ours indirectly are generally subject to the following risks competitive environment 
the medical device industry is highly competitive and subject to significant technological change 
participation in such industries requires ongoing investment to keep pace with technological developments and quality and regulatory requirements 
these industries consist of numerous companies  ranging from start up to well established companies 
many of our customers have a limited number of products  and some market only a single product 
as a result  any adverse development with respect to these customers products may have a material adverse effect on the business and financial condition of such customers  which may adversely affect those customers ability to purchase and pay for their products manufactured by us 
the competitors and potential competitors of our customers may succeed in developing or marketing technologies and products that will be preferred in the marketplace over the devices manufactured by us for our customers or that would render our customers technology and products obsolete or noncompetitive 
emerging technology companies 
a number of our customers are emerging medical technology companies that have competitors and potential competitors with substantially greater capital resources  research and development staff and facilities  and substantially greater experience in developing new products  obtaining regulatory approvals  and manufacturing and marketing medical products 
approximately three customers  representing of our revenues in fiscal year  were  in our opinion  emerging medical technology companies 
these customers may not be successful in launching and marketing their products  or may not respond to pricing  marketing  or other competitive pressures or the rapid technological innovation demanded by the marketplace 
as a result  these customers may experience a significant drop in product revenues  which may hamper their ability to continue as our customer or even pay for services and products that we have already delivered 
customer regulatory compliance 
the fda regulates many of the devices manufactured by us under the fdc act  which requires certain clearances from the fda before new medical products can be marketed 
there can be no assurance that our customers will obtain such clearances on a timely basis  if at all 
the process of obtaining a pma or a k clearance from the fda could delay the introduction of a product to market 
a customer s failure to comply with the fda s requirements can result in the delay or denial of its pma 
delays in obtaining a pma are frequent and could result our customers delaying or canceling orders to us 
many products never receive a pma 
similarly  k clearance may be delayed  and in some instances  k clearance is never obtained 
once a product is in commercial distribution  discovery of product problems or failure to comply with regulatory standards may result in restrictions on the product s future use or withdrawal of the product from the market despite prior governmental clearance 
there can be no assurance that product recalls  product defects  or modification or loss of necessary regulatory clearance will not occur in the future 
sales of our medical products outside the united states are subject to regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country 
the time required to obtain clearance for sale in foreign countries may be longer or shorter than that required for fda clearance  and the requirements may differ 
the fda also regulates the sale of exported medical devices  although to a lesser extent than devices sold in the united states 
in addition  our customers must comply with other laws generally applicable to foreign trade  including technology export restrictions  tariffs  and other regulatory barriers 
there can be no assurance that our customers will obtain all required clearances or approvals for exported products on a timely basis  if at all 
medical devices manufactured by us and marketed by our customers pursuant to fda or foreign clearances or approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the fda and certain state and foreign regulatory agencies 
fda enforcement policy prohibits the marketing of approved medical products for unapproved uses 
our customers control the marketing of their products  including representing to the market the approved uses of their products 
if a customer engages in prohibited marketing practices  the fda or another regulatory agency with applicable jurisdiction could intervene  possibly resulting in marketing restrictions  including prohibitions on further product sales  or civil or criminal penalties 
changes in existing laws and regulations or policies could adversely affect the ability of our customers to comply with regulatory requirements 
there can be no assurance that we or a customer of ours will not be required to incur significant costs to comply with laws and regulations in the future  or that such customer or we will be able to comply with such laws and regulations 
uncertain market acceptance of products 
there can be no assurance that the products that we design and manufacture for our customers will gain any significant market acceptance  even if required regulatory approvals are obtained 
some of our customers  especially emerging technology companies  have limited or no experience in marketing their products and have not made marketing or distribution arrangements for their products 
our customers may be unable to establish effective sales  marketing  and distribution channels to successfully commercialize their products 
product and inventory obsolescence 
rapid change and technological innovation characterize the marketplace for medical products 
as a result  zevex and our customers are subject to the risk of product and inventory obsolescence  whether from prolonged development  government approval cycles  or the development of improved products or processes by competitors 
in addition  the marketplace could conclude that the task for which a customer s medical product was designed is no longer an element of a generally accepted diagnostic or treatment regimen 
customers future capital requirements 
some of our customers  especially the emerging medical technology companies  are not profitable and may have little or no revenues  but they have significant working capital requirements 
such customers may be required to raise additional funds through public or private financings  including equity financings 
adequate funds for their operations may not be available when needed  if at all 
insufficient funds may require a customer to delay development of a product  clinical trials if required  or the commercial introduction of the product or may prevent such commercial introduction altogether 
uncertainty of third party reimbursement 
sales of many of the medical devices that are manufactured by us will be dependent in part on availability of adequate reimbursement for those devices from third party health care payers  such as government and private insurance plans  health maintenance organizations  and preferred provider organizations 
third party payers are increasingly challenging the pricing of medical products and services 
there can be no assurance that adequate levels of reimbursement will be available to enable our customers to achieve market acceptance of their products 
without adequate support from third party payers  the market for the products of our customers may be limited 
uncertainty of market acceptance of out sourcing manufacturing of medical devices we believe that acceptance in the marketplace for out sourcing of design and manufacturing of advanced medical products for medical technology companies varies from year to year and is still uncertain 
many of our potential customers have internal design and manufacturing facilities 
our engineering and manufacturing activities require that customers provide us with access to their proprietary technology and relinquish the control associated with internal engineering and manufacturing 
as a result  potential customers may decide that the risks of out sourcing engineering or manufacturing are too great or exceed the anticipated benefits of out sourcing 
in addition  medical technology companies that have previously made substantial investments to establish design and manufacturing capabilities may be reluctant to out source those functions 
if the medical technology industry generally  or any significant existing or potential customer  concludes that the disadvantages of out sourcing manufacturing outweigh the advantages  we could suffer a substantial reduction in the size of one or more of our current target markets  which could have a materially adverse effect on our business  results of operations  and financial condition 
competition in out sourcing manufacturing we face competition from design firms and other manufacturers that operate in the medical device industry 
many competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do 
also  manufacturers focusing in other industries may decide to enter into the industries served by us 
competition from any of the foregoing sources could place pressure on us to accept lower margins on our contracts or lose existing or potential business 
to remain competitive  we must continue to provide and develop technologically advanced manufacturing services  maintain quality  offer flexible delivery schedules  deliver finished products on a reliable basis  and compete favorably on the basis of price and the value that we provide 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete favorably with respect to these factors 
dependence on major customers no assurances can be given that our customers will continue to do business with us or that the volume of their orders for our contract manufactured devices and proprietary products will increase or remain constant 
the loss of several customers  or a significant reduction in the volume of their orders to us  could have a material adverse impact on our operations 
in addition  if one or more of these customers were to seek and obtain price discounts from us for our contract manufactured devices or proprietary products  the resulting lower gross margins on those devices and products could have a materially adverse effect on our overall results of operations 
if any customer with whom we do a substantial amount of business were to encounter financial distress  the customer s lateness  unwillingness  or inability to pay its obligations to us could result in a materially adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
early termination of agreements our agreements with major manufacturing customers generally permit the termination of the agreements before their expiration if certain events occur that are materially adverse to the design  development  manufacture  or sale of the product 
examples of such events include the failure to obtain or the withdrawal of regulatory clearance or an alteration of regulatory clearance that is materially adverse to the customer or which prohibits or interferes with the manufacture or sale of the products 
the performance of agreements with major customers may be suspended or excused if certain conditions  generally beyond the control of the customer or us so called force majeure events  cause the failure or delay of performance 
our pump usage agreements  under which enteral feeding pumps are placed with users in exchange for a commitment by the user to buy disposable products from us  generally require only monthly commitments  and users can terminate any purchase obligation by returning the pump 
thus  there is no assurance of continued revenue from pumps placed with such users 
risk factors in marketing our proprietary products in producing and marketing our own proprietary devices  we face many of the same risks that our contract manufacturing customers face 
as discussed above with respect to our customers  such risks include the medical products industry is highly competitive 
a significant number of our competitors have substantially greater capital resources  research and development staffs  facilities  and substantially greater experience in developing new products  obtaining regulatory approvals  and manufacturing and marketing medical products 
competitors may succeed in marketing products preferable to our products or rendering our products obsolete 
the medical products industry is subject to significant technological change and requires ongoing investment to keep pace with technological development  quality  and regulatory requirements 
in order to compete in this marketplace  we will be required to make ongoing investment in research and development with respect to our existing and future products 
we are subject to substantial risks involved in developing and marketing medical products that are regulated by the fda and comparable foreign agencies 
there can be no assurance that we will obtain the necessary fda or foreign clearances on a timely basis  if at all 
as discussed above  commercialized medical products are subject to further regulatory restrictions  which may adversely affect us 
changes in existing laws and regulations or policies could adversely affect our ability to comply with regulatory requirements 
there can be no assurance that our products will gain any significant market acceptance in their intended target markets  even if required regulatory approvals are obtained 
revenues for many of the medical devices manufactured by us may be dependent in part on availability of adequate reimbursement for those devices from third party health care payers  such as government and private insurance plans 
there is no assurance that the levels of reimbursements offered by third party payers will be sufficient to achieve market acceptance of our products 
regulatory compliance for manufacturing facilities we expend significant time  resources  and effort in the areas of training  production  and quality assurance to maintain compliance with applicable regulatory requirements 
there can be no assurance  however  that zevex manufacturing operations will be found to comply with gmp regulations  iso standards  or other applicable legal requirements or that we will not be required to incur substantial costs to maintain our compliance with existing or future manufacturing regulations  standards  or other requirements 
our failure to comply with gmp regulations or other applicable legal requirements can lead to warning letters  seizure of non compliant products  injunctive actions brought by the us government  and potential civil or criminal liability on the part of zevex and officers and employees who are responsible for the activities that lead to any violation 
in addition  the continued sale of any instruments manufactured by us may be halted or otherwise restricted 
product development our success will depend to a significant extent upon our ability to enhance and expand our current offering of proprietary products and to develop and introduce additional innovative products that gain market acceptance 
while we maintain research and development programs and have established various technical advisory boards to assist us  there is no assurance that we will be successful in selecting  developing  manufacturing  and marketing new products or enhancing our existing products on a timely or cost effective basis 
moreover  we may encounter technical problems in connection with our efforts to develop or introduce new products or product enhancements 
some of the devices currently being developed by us as well as devices of some of our customers will require significant additional development  pre clinical testing and clinical trials  and related investment prior to their commercialization 
there can be no assurance that such devices will be successfully developed  prove to be safe or efficacious in clinical trials  meet applicable regulatory standards  be capable of being produced in commercial quantities at reasonable costs  or be successfully marketed 
design and manufacturing process risks while we have substantial experience in designing and manufacturing devices  we may still experience technical difficulties and delays with the design and manufacturing of our or our customers products 
such difficulties could cause significant delays in our production of products 
in some instances  payment by a manufacturing customer is dependent on our ability to meet certain design and production milestones in a timely manner 
also  some major contracts can be canceled if purchase orders thereunder are not completed when due 
potential difficulties in the design and manufacturing process that could be experienced by us include difficulty in meeting required specifications  difficulty in achieving necessary manufacturing efficiencies  and difficulty in obtaining materials on a timely basis 
expansion of marketing  limited distribution we currently have a limited domestic direct sales force consisting of seventeen full time employees  complemented by a network of clinical support personnel 
we anticipate that we will need to increase our marketing and sales capability significantly to more fully penetrate our target markets  particularly as additional proprietary devices become commercially available 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively in attracting and retaining qualified sales personnel or independent manufacturer s representatives as needed or that such persons will be successful in marketing or selling our services and products 
product recalls if a device that is designed or manufactured by us is found to be defective  whether due to design or manufacturing defects  improper use of the product  or other reasons  the device may need to be recalled  possibly at our expense 
furthermore  the adverse effect of a product recall on us might not be limited to the cost of a recall 
for example  a product recall could cause a general investigation of zevex by applicable regulatory authorities  as well as cause other customers to review and potentially terminate their relationships with us 
recalls  especially if accompanied by unfavorable publicity or termination of customer contracts  could result in substantial costs  loss of revenues  and a diminution of our reputation 
risk of product liability the manufacture and sale of products  especially medical products  entails an inherent risk of product liability 
we maintain product liability insurance with limits of million per occurrence and million in the aggregate and an umbrella policy with a million limit 
there can be no assurance that such insurance is adequate to cover potential claims or that we will be able to obtain product liability insurance on acceptable terms in the future or that any product liability insurance subsequently obtained will provide adequate coverage against all potential claims 
such claims may be significant in the medical products area where product failure may result in loss of life or injury to persons 
additionally  we generally provide a design defect warranty and in some instances indemnification to customers for failure to conform to design specifications and against defects in materials and workmanship  which could subject us to a claim under such warranties or indemnification 
dependence upon management zevex is substantially dependent upon our key managerial  technical and engineering personnel  particularly our two executive officers  david mcnally  president and chief executive officer  and phillip mcstotts  chief financial officer and secretary treasurer 
zevex must also attract and retain highly qualified engineering  technical  and managerial personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense  the available pool of qualified candidates is limited  and there can be no assurance that we will attract and retain such personnel 
the loss of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  and financial condition 
none of our key personnel have employment agreements with zevex 
we carry key man life insurance on the lives of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer in the amount of  each 
no assurances can be given that such insurance would provide adequate compensation to zevex in the event of the death of either key employee 
patent protection as of december   we held eighteen us patents and fourteen international patents on devices developed by us  with fourteen additional us patents and twenty international patents pending 
such patents disclose certain aspects of our technologies and there can be no assurance that others will not design around the patent and develop similar technology 
we believe that our devices and other proprietary rights do not infringe on any proprietary rights of third parties 
there can be no assurance  however  that third parties will not assert infringement claims in the future 
control by management and certain major shareholders as of march   the current executive officers and directors of zevex  together with those persons who are the beneficial owners of more than of zevex common stock  beneficially own or have voting control over approximately of the outstanding common stock 
accordingly  these individuals have the ability to influence the election of zevex directors and most corporate actions 
this concentration of ownership  together with other provisions in zevex charter and applicable corporate law  may also have the effect of delaying  deterring  or preventing a change in control of zevex 
suppliers and shortages of component parts we rely on third party suppliers for many of the component parts used in manufacturing our own products and those of our customers 
although component parts are generally available from multiple suppliers  certain component parts may require long lead times  and we may have to delay the manufacture of devices from time to time due to the unavailability of certain component parts 
in addition  even if component parts are available from an alternative supplier  we could experience additional delays in obtaining component parts if the supplier has not met our vendor qualifications 
component shortages for a particular device may adversely affect our ability either to meet the production plans for our own devices or to satisfy customer orders for that device 
such shortages and extensions of production schedules may delay the recognition of revenue by us and may in some cases constitute a breach of a customer contract 
if shortages of component parts continue or if additional shortages should occur  we may be forced to pay higher prices for affected components or delay manufacturing and shipping particular devices  either of which could adversely affect subsequent customer demand for such devices 
customer conflicts the medical technology industry reflects vigorous competition among its participants 
as a result  our customers sometimes require us to enter into non competition agreements that prevent us from manufacturing instruments or components for our customers competitors in certain fields of use 
such restrictions generally apply during the term of the customer s manufacturing contract and  in some instances  for a period following termination of the contract 
if we enter into a non competition agreement  we may be adversely affected if our customer s product is not successful and we must forgo an opportunity to manufacture a successful product for such customer s competitor 
any conflicts among our customers could prevent or deter us from obtaining contracts to manufacture successful products 
future capital requirements we believe that our existing capital resources and amounts available under our existing bank line of credit  will satisfy our anticipated capital needs for the next year depending primarily on our growth rate and our results of operations 
the commercialization of proprietary products  which is an element of our growth strategy  would require increased investment in working capital and could therefore shorten this period 
thereafter  we may be required to raise additional capital or increase our borrowing capacity  or both 
there can be no assurance that alternative sources of equity or debt will be available in the future or  if available  will be on terms acceptable to us 
also  any additional equity financing would result in additional dilution to our shareholders 
reliance on efficiency of distribution and third parties we believe our financial performance is dependent in part on our ability to provide prompt  accurate  and complete services to our customers on a timely and competitive basis 
accordingly  delays in distribution in our day to day operations or material increases in the costs of procuring and delivering products could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
any failure of either our computer operating system or our telephone system could adversely affect our ability to receive and process customers orders and ship products on a timely basis 
strikes or other service interruptions affecting federal express corporation  united parcel service of america  inc  or other common carriers used by us to receive necessary components or other materials or to ship our products also could impair our ability to deliver products on a timely and cost effective basis 
volatility of revenue and product mix our annual and quarterly operating results are affected by volume and timing of customer orders  which vary due to i variation in demand for the customers products or services as a result of  among other things  product life cycles  competitive conditions  and general economic conditions  ii the customers attempt to balance their inventory  iii the customers need to adapt to changing regulatory conditions and requirements  and iv changes in the customers preference or strategies 
technical difficulties and delays in the design and manufacturing processes may also affect such results 
the foregoing factors may cause fluctuations in revenues and variations in product mix  which could in turn cause fluctuations in our gross margin 
under the terms of our contracts with many of our contract manufacturing customers  the customers have broad discretion to control the volume and timing of product deliveries 
further  the contracts with our customers typically have no minimum purchase requirements 
as a result  production may be reduced or discontinued at any time 
therefore  it is difficult for us to forecast the level of customer orders with certainty  making it difficult to schedule production and maximize manufacturing capacity 
other factors that may adversely affect our annual and quarterly results of operations include inexperience in manufacturing a particular product  inventory shortages or obsolescence  increasing labor costs or shortages  low gross margins on particular projects  an increase in lower margin product revenue as a percentage of total revenues  price competition  and regulatory requirements 
because our business organization and our related cost structure anticipate supporting a certain minimum level of revenues  our limited ability to adjust the short term cost structure would compound the adverse effect of any significant revenue reduction 
uncertain protection of intellectual property to maintain the secrecy of some of our proprietary information  we rely on a combination of trade secret laws and internal security procedures 
we typically require our employees  consultants  and advisors to execute confidentiality and assignment of inventions agreements 
there can be no assurance  however  that the common law  statutory  and contractual rights on which we rely to protect our intellectual property and confidential and proprietary information will provide us with adequate or meaningful protection 
third parties may independently develop products  techniques  or information that are substantially equivalent to the products  techniques  or information that we consider proprietary 
in addition  proprietary information regarding us could be disclosed in a manner against which we have no meaningful remedy 
disputes regarding our intellectual property could force us into expensive and protracted litigation or costly agreements with third parties 
an adverse determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding or failure to reach an agreement with a third party regarding intellectual property rights could prevent us from manufacturing and selling certain of our products 
limited market for common stock historically  the market for zevex common stock has been limited due to the relatively low trading volume and the small number of brokerage firms acting as market makers 
zevex common stock is listed on the nasdaq stock market 
no assurance can be given  however  that the market for the common stock will continue or increase or that the prices in such market will be maintained at their present levels 
possible volatility of stock price announcements of technological innovations for new commercial devices by us or our competitors  developments concerning our proprietary rights  or the public concern as to the safety of our devices may have a material adverse impact on our business and on the market price of our common stock  particularly as we expand our efforts to become a medical technology company that manufactures and markets its own proprietary devices 
the market price of zevex common stock may be volatile and may fluctuate based on a number of factors  including significant announcements by us and our competitors  quarterly fluctuations in our operating results  and general economic conditions and conditions in the medical device industry 
in addition  in recent years the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations  which have had a substantial effect on the market prices for many medical device companies and are often unrelated to the operating performance of such companies 
issuance of additional shares for acquisition or expansion any future major acquisition or expansion by us may include the issuance of additional common shares or other stocks or instruments that may be authorized without shareholder approval 
the issuance of subsequent securities may also result in substantial dilution in the percentage of the common stock held by existing shareholders at the time of any such transaction 
moreover  the shares or warrants issued in connection with any such transaction may be valued by our management based on factors other than the trading price on the nasdaq stock market 
impact of anti takeover measures  possible issuance of preferred stock  classified board certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and the delaware general corporation law may have the effect of preventing  discouraging  or delaying a change in the control of zevex and may maintain the incumbency of our board of directors and management 
such provisions could also limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of zevex common stock 
pursuant to our certificate of incorporation  the board of directors is authorized to fix the rights  preferences  privileges  and restrictions  including voting rights  of unissued shares of zevex preferred stock and to issue such stock without any further vote or action by our stockholders 
the rights of the holders of zevex common stock will be subject to and may be adversely affected by the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be created and issued in the future 
in addition  stockholders do not have the right to cumulative voting for the election of directors 
furthermore  our certificate and bylaws provide for a staggered board whereby only two to three of the total number of directors are replaced or re elected each year 
the certificate also provides that the provisions of the certificate relating to the number  vacancies  and classification of the board of directors may only be amended by a vote of at least of the shareholders 
finally  the bylaws provide that special meetings of the stockholders may only be called by the president or any director of zevex or pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of the board of directors 
zevex is subject to section of the delaware general corporation law section  which restricts certain transactions and business combinations between a corporation and an interested stockholder owning or more of the corporation s outstanding voting stock for a period of three years from the date the stockholder becomes an interested stockholder 
subject to certain exceptions  unless the transaction is approved in a prescribed manner  section prohibits significant business transactions such as a merger with  disposition of assets to  or receipt of disproportionate financial benefits by the interested stockholder  or any other transactions that would increase the interested stockholder s proportionate ownership of any class or series of the corporation s stock 
foreign exchange  currency  and political risk our international business is subject to risks customarily encountered in foreign operations  including changes in a specific country s or region s political or economic conditions  nationalization  trade protection measures  import or export licensing requirements  the overlap of different tax structures  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  or other restrictive government actions such as capital regulations 
we are also exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in our foreign sales commitments and anticipated foreign sales because the prices charged for our products are denominated in us dollars 
consequently  our foreign sales commitments and anticipated sales could be adversely affected by an appreciation of the us dollar relative to other currencies 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk in the form of fluctuations in interest rates and their potential impact upon our line of credit  currently with a balance of  and our industrial development bond of  principal payments of  are made annually on the industrial development bond  with the balance due october  the variable rate on the line of credit is the prime bank lending rate  and the variable rate on the industrial development bond is based on a weekly tax exempt floater rate 
the line of credit matures annually in may 
at december   the above debt represented of our total short term funded debt and of our total long term funded debt compared with short term funded debt and long term funded debt at december  for illustrative purposes only  the impact of market risk is estimated using a hypothetical increase in interest rates of one percentage point for both our variable rate debt and cash 
based on hypothetical assumption  we would have incurred an additional  in interest expense and received  in additional interest income for the year ended december   and an additional  in interest expense and received  in additional interest income for the year ended december  we are also exposed to market risk in the form of fluctuations in interest rates and their potential impact on our fixed rate debt  which includes our term loan agreement  with a balance of  as of december   which is due on may  and is being amortized over a thirteen year term at an interest rate of 
additionally  we held marketable equity securities with a fair value of  at december   consisting of stock of a public company in the small cap market 
we realized an other than temporary loss on available for sale marketable securities in the third quarter ending september  and the year ended december  of  gross unrealized gains on marketable equity securities were  for the year ended december  we did not hold any marketable securities at december  gross unrealized gains on marketable equity securities were  for the year ended december
