the weighted average domestic borrowing rate decreased from percent in to percent in in addition  the portion of our debt subject to variable rates of interest decreased from percent at june  to percent at june  interest expense was million in compared with million in this increase in interest expense was due to the greater average level of borrowings to fund the widia acquisition

additionally  interest income increased from million in to million in the benefits associated with the securitization program and increased interest income were offset by foreign exchange losses  which increased million during the year from income of million in to expense of million in income taxes the effective tax rate for was percent compared to an effective rate of percent for the decrease in the effective rate from to is due to the impact of the impairment charge for our electronics unit recorded in  lesser increases in the valuation allowances and changes in tax contingency reserves in versus our effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate due to international tax planning initiatives which resulted in a favorable impact to the effective tax rate 
in december  the german parliament adopted a substantial part of the government s tax package 
the major provisions of this tax law change are effective for kennametal s fiscal the law changes did not have a material impact on the company s global effective tax rate for these changes  without any action by the company  would have a material future impact on the company s global effective tax rate 
the company is currently evaluating a business strategy related to our international operations that  if executed  is expected to partially mitigate the effect of the tax law change 
execution of this business strategy may result in a release of valuation allowances in related to certain german net operating losses 
the potential valuation allowance release could be in excess of million  of which approximately million would be allocated to goodwill and the remainder allocated to income tax expense in there is no guarantee that this business strategy will be completely effective  if implemented 
the effective tax rate for was percent compared to an effective rate of percent for the effective rate 
table of contents included an percentage point negative impact related to the impairment charge for our electronics business unit

changes in accounting principles we adopted sfas no 
 effective july   which established new accounting and reporting requirements for goodwill and other intangible assets  including new measurement techniques for evaluating the recoverability of such assets 
under sfas no 
 all goodwill amortization ceased effective july  material amounts of recorded goodwill attributable to each of our reporting units in were tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value 
as a result of the adoption of this rule  we recorded a non cash pretax charge of million million and million specific to the amsg and mssg segments  respectively 
the fair values of these reporting units were determined using a combination of discounted cash flow analysis and market multiples based upon historical and projected financial information 
under sfas no 
 the impairment adjustment recognized at adoption of this standard was reflected as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle  effective july  net income we reported net income of million for compared to million for the increase is primarily attributable to organic sales growth  cost containment  a decrease in restructuring cost  favorable foreign currency translation effects  a decrease in interest expense and the widia acquisition  which included efficiencies derived from the integration with kennametal operations 
these improvements were offset  in part  by increased pricing pressure and unfavorable product mix shifts  higher raw material costs and increased employee benefit costs in we reported net income of million for compared with net loss of million in net income in included a million after tax charge associated with the electronics impairment 
the net loss reported in was due largely to the goodwill impairment charge  which was million 
the increase in net income in was due to a reduction in impairment charges from million in to million in  offset by an increase in operating expense related to the widia integration and a million increase in interest expense

liquidity and capital resources our cash flow from operations is the primary source of financing for capital expenditures and internal growth 
the most significant risks associated with our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations is the overall level of demand for our products 
however  we believe we can adequately control costs and manage our working capital to meet our cash flow needs  despite changes in the economic cycle 
in june  we entered into a three year  multi currency  million revolving bank credit facility with a group of financial institutions credit agreement 
following a review of anticipated borrowing requirements  in june  we notified the administrative agent of our decision to permanently reduce the credit agreement from million to million  resulting in lower facility fees for the remaining two years of the agreement 
the credit agreement allows for borrowings in us dollars  euro  canadian dollars  pound sterling or japanese yen 
the credit agreement contains various covenants with which we must be in compliance  including three financial covenants a maximum leverage ratio  a maximum fixed charge coverage ratio and a minimum consolidated net worth 
as of june  and  outstanding borrowings under this agreement were million and million  respectively 
as of june   million of the borrowings were denominated in us dollars  million were denominated in euro and there were no borrowings denominated in yen 
we had the ability to borrow under the agreement  or otherwise  additional debt of up to million and million as of june  and  respectively  and be in compliance with the maximum leverage ratio financial covenant 
the maximum leverage ratio financial covenant requires that we maintain at the end of each fiscal quarter a specified consolidated leverage ratio as that term is defined in the agreement 
at june   we were in compliance with all debt covenants 
the credit agreement expires in june given current favorable market conditions for syndicated bank facilities  the company intends to refinance the credit agreement prior to the end of calendar year we anticipate terms no less favorable than the terms of the current facility 
additionally  we generally obtain local financing through credit lines with commercial banks in the various countries in which we operate 
at june   these borrowings amounted to million for notes payable and million for term debt and capital leases 
we believe that cash flow from operations and the availability under our credit lines will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements over the next months 
based upon our debt structure at june  and  percent and percent  respectively  of our debt was exposed to floating rates of interest  which is consistent with our target range for floating versus fixed interest rate debt 
we periodically review the target range and the strategies designed to maintain the mix of floating to fixed interest rate debt within that range 
in the future  we may decide to adjust the target range or the strategies to achieve it 
following is a summary of our contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of june  in thousands less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt notes payable capital leases operating leases purchase obligations total long term debt includes interest obligations of million

during  we generated million in cash flow from operations  a decrease of million  or percent  compared to net income plus non cash items improved million to million in compared to million in this improvement was offset by a million reduction in cash flow from changes in operating working capital items due partially to higher income tax payments and increased cash expenditures for restructuring 
a million net increase in income tax payments was partially offset by a million reduction in interest payments 
income tax and interest 
table of contents payments in were million and million  respectively 
net cash used for investing activities was million in  a decrease of million from million in the change is due primarily to a million reduction in spending on acquisitions 
last year s total includes million related to the widia acquisition  while this year s total includes million related to the conforma clad acquisition 
the remaining change is due primarily to receiving million in proceeds from the sale of our investment in toshiba tungaloy and million from the sale of our mining and construction business in india  both of which occurred in capital expenditures increased million to million in compared to million in we have projected our capital expenditures for to be million to million  which will be used primarily to support new strategic initiatives  new products and to upgrade machinery and equipment 
we believe this level of capital spending is sufficient to maintain competitiveness and improve productivity 
net cash used for financing activities was million in compared to net cash provided by financing activities of million in this fluctuation was due to the borrowing required to finance the widia acquisition of million million  net of cash acquired and million received from the termination of the fair value interest rate swaps 
in addition  repayments on our lines of credit and notes were lower in off balance sheet arrangements since  we have had an agreement with a financial institution whereby we securitize  on a continuous basis  an undivided interest in a specific pool of our domestic trade accounts receivable 
we were permitted to securitize up to million of accounts receivable under this agreement 
in july  we entered into a new securitization program securitization program  which provides for a co purchase arrangement with falcon asset securitization and victory receivables corporation  whereby two financial institutions participate in the purchase of our accounts receivable up to million 
the securitization program was amended on september   permitting us to securitize up to million of accounts receivable 
pursuant to this agreement  we  and several of our domestic subsidiaries  sell our domestic accounts receivable to kennametal receivables corporation krc  a wholly owned  bankruptcy remote subsidiary 
a bankruptcy remote subsidiary is a company that has been structured to make it highly unlikely that it would be drawn into a bankruptcy of kennametal inc  or any of our other subsidiaries 
krc was formed to purchase these accounts receivable and sell participating interests in such accounts receivable to the financial institutions which  in turn  purchase and receive ownership and security interests in those assets 
as collections reduce the amount of accounts receivable included in the pool  we sell new accounts receivable to krc which  in turn  securitizes these new accounts receivable with the financial institutions 
the actual amount of accounts receivable securitized each month is a function of the net change new billings less collections in the specific pool of domestic accounts receivable  the impact of detailed eligibility requirements in the agreement eg  the aging  terms of payment  quality criteria and customer concentrations  and the application of various reserves which are typically in trade receivable securitization transactions 
a decrease in the amount of eligible accounts receivable could result in our inability to continue to securitize all or a portion of our accounts receivable 
it is not unusual  however  for the amount of our eligible accounts receivable to vary by up to million to million per month 
the financial institutions charge us fees based on the level of accounts receivable securitized under this agreement and the commercial paper market rates plus the financial institutions cost to administer the program 
the costs incurred under this program  million  million and million in  and  respectively  are accounted for as a component of other expense  net and represent attractive funding costs compared to existing bank and public debt transactions 
at june  and  we securitized accounts receivable of million and million  respectively  under this program 
our retained interests in accounts receivable available for securitization and recorded as a component of accounts receivable were million and million at june  and  respectively 
the securitization program is a three year program which contains certain provisions that require annual approval 
it is our intention to continuously obtain such approvals when required 
non renewal of this securitization program would result in our requirement to otherwise finance the amounts securitized 
we anticipate that the risk of non renewal of this securitization program with the current providers or some other providers is low 
in the event of a decrease of our eligible accounts receivable or non renewal or non annual approval of our securitization program  we would have to utilize alternative sources of capital to fund that portion of our working capital needs 
financial condition at june   total assets were  million  compared to  million at june  working capital was million at june   a decrease of percent from million for  primarily due to increases in current maturities of long term debt and capital leases  accounts payable and foreign currency exchange effects 
at june   other assets were million  an increase of million from million at june  the increase is primarily related to increases in goodwill and intangible assets of million and million  respectively  mainly as a result of the conforma clad acquisition  and increases in other of million 
the increase in other assets is primarily due to the increase in 
table of contents accrued pension benefit of million 
this increase is due to a reversal of certain additional minimum pension liabilities recorded in as the fair value of those plans assets exceeded the value of their accumulated benefit obligations at june  total liabilities decreased million from  million at june  to  million at june  this decrease is primarily attributable to reductions of long term debt partially offset by increases in accounts payable and deferred income taxes 
shareowners equity was million at june   an increase of million from the prior year 
the increase is primarily attributable to net income of million and the change in accumulated other comprehensive income loss of million 
the change in accumulated other comprehensive income loss was due to the reversal of the additional minimum pension liability discussed above and the related charge to equity of million  net of tax  that was recorded in acquisitions and divestitures the company acquired all of the outstanding common stock of conforma clad inc for million  including a post closing purchase price adjustment of million and direct acquisition costs of million  effective march  we acquired conforma clad to expand our product and solutions offerings in the area of extreme wear environments involving corrosion  erosion and abrasion 
we financed the acquisition with borrowings under our credit agreement 
conforma clad s operating results have been included in our consolidated results since march  during our fiscal third quarter ended march   we completed the sale of the mining and construction business of kennametal widia india limited  which was a part of the amsg segment  for approximately million  subject to a working capital adjustment 
the company received million in net proceeds related to the sale of this business 
the company is required to satisfy certain conditions related to the property sold for it to receive the remaining million due under the sale agreement 
the company expects to collect the remaining million prior to march  in accordance with the terms of the sale agreement  the parties have agreed to submit certain differences of opinion related to the working capital adjustment to binding arbitration for resolution 
the purchaser is claiming that a million reduction of the purchase price is required 
the company believes the purchaser s claims are without merit 
we continue to evaluate new opportunities that allow for the expansion of existing product lines into new market areas or new product lines into existing market areas  either directly or indirectly through joint ventures  where appropriate 
environmental matters we are involved in various environmental cleanup and remediation activities at several of our manufacturing facilities 
in addition  we are currently named as a potentially responsible party prp at the li tungsten superfund site in glen cove  new york 
in december  we recorded a remediation reserve of million with respect to our involvement in these matters  which was recorded as a component of operating expense 
this represents our best estimate of the undiscounted future obligation based on our evaluations and discussions with outside counsel and independent consultants  and the current facts and circumstances related to these matters 
we recorded this liability because certain events occurred  including the identification of other prps  an assessment of potential remediation solutions  and direction from the government for the remedial action plan  that clarified our level of involvement in these matters and our relationship to other prps 
this led us to conclude that it was probable that a liability had been incurred 
at june   we have an accrual of million recorded relative to this environmental issue 
in addition to the amount currently reserved  we may be subject to loss contingencies related to these matters estimated to be up to an additional million 
we believe that such losses are reasonably possible but are not currently considered to be probable of occurrence 
the reserved and unreserved liabilities for all environmental concerns could change substantially in the near term due to factors such as the nature and extent of contamination  changes in remedial requirements  technological changes  discovery of new information  the financial strength of other prps  the identification of new prps  and the involvement of and direction taken by the government on these matters 
additionally  we also maintain reserves for other potential environmental issues associated with our domestic operations and a location operated by our german subsidiary 
at june   the total of these accruals was million and represents anticipated costs associated with the remediation of these issues 
cash payments of million were made against this reserve during as a result of the widia acquisition  we established an environmental reserve of million 
this reserve is used for environmental cleanup and remediation activities at several widia manufacturing locations 
this liability represents our estimate of the future obligation based on our evaluations and discussions with independent consultants and the current facts and circumstances related to these matters 
at june   we had an accrual of million recorded relative to these environmental exposures 
cash payments of million were made against this reserve during we maintain a corporate environmental  health and safety eh s department  as well as an eh s policy committee  to ensure compliance with environmental regulations and to monitor and oversee remediation activities 
in addition  we have established an eh s administrator at each of our global manufacturing facilities 
our financial management team periodically meets with members of the corporate eh s department and the corporate legal department to review and evaluate the status of environmental projects 
table of contents and contingencies 
on a quarterly basis  we establish or adjust financial provisions and reserves for environmental contingencies in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
effects of inflation despite modest inflation in recent years  rising costs  in particular the cost of certain raw materials  continue to affect our operations throughout the world 
we strive to minimize the effects of inflation through cost containment  productivity improvements and price increases under highly competitive conditions 
discussion of critical accounting policies in preparing our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  we make judgments and estimates about the amounts reflected in our financial statements 
as part of our financial reporting process  our management collaborates to determine the necessary information on which to base our judgments and develops estimates used to prepare the financial statements 
we use historical experience and available information to make these judgments and estimates 
however  different amounts could be reported using different assumptions and in light of different facts and circumstances 
therefore  actual amounts could differ from the estimates reflected in our financial statements 
our significant accounting policies are described in note of our consolidated financial statements 
we believe that the following discussion addresses our critical accounting policies 
revenue recognition revenue from the sale of products is recognized when risk of loss  title and insurable risk have transferred to the customer  which in most cases coincides with shipment of the related products  in accordance with the provisions of staff accounting bulletin  revenue recognition 
we do not ship product unless we have documentation authorizing shipment to our customers 
historically  we have experienced very low levels of returned product and do not consider the effect of returned product to be material 
accounting for contingencies we accrue for contingencies in accordance with sfas no 
when it is probable that a liability or loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
contingencies by their nature relate to uncertainties that require our exercise of judgment both in assessing whether or not a liability or loss has been incurred and estimating the amount of probable loss 
the significant contingencies affecting our financial statements include environmental health and safety matters and litigation 
long lived assets as required under sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we evaluate the recoverability of property  plant and equipment and intangible assets other than goodwill that are amortized whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of any such assets may not be fully recoverable 
changes in circumstances include technological advances  changes in our business model  capital structure  economic conditions or operating performance 
our evaluation is based upon  among other things  our assumptions about the estimated future undiscounted cash flows these assets are expected to generate 
when the sum of the undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value  we will recognize an impairment loss 
we continually apply our best judgment when performing these evaluations to determine the timing of the testing  the undiscounted cash flows used to assess recoverability and the fair value of the asset 
goodwill and other intangible assets we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill and other intangibles of each of our reporting units as required under sfas no 
by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value 
the fair values of our reporting units are determined using a combination of a discounted cash flow analysis and market multiples based upon historical and projected financial information 
we apply our best judgment when assessing the reasonableness of the financial projections used to determine the fair value of each reporting unit 
pension and other postretirement and postemployment benefits we sponsor these types of benefit plans for a majority of our employees and retirees 
we account for these plans as required under sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  and sfas no 
 employers accounting for postemployment benefits 
accounting for the cost of these plans requires the estimation of the cost of the benefits to be provided well into the future and attributing that cost over the expected work life of employees participating in these plans 
this estimation requires our judgment about the discount rate used to determine these obligations  expected return on plan assets  rate of future compensation increases  rate of future health care costs  withdrawal and mortality rates and participant retirement age 
differences between our estimates and actual results may significantly affect the cost of our obligations under these plans 
restructuring activities we accrue the cost of our restructuring activities in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
we exercise our judgment in estimating the total costs of each of these activities 
as we implement these activities  the actual costs may differ from the estimated costs due to changes in the facts and circumstances that were not foreseen at the time of our initial cost accrual 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts we record allowances for estimated losses resulting from the liability of our customers to make required payments 
we assess the credit worthiness of our customers based on multiple sources of information and analyze such factors as our historical bad debt experiences  industry and geographic concentrations of credit risk  current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms 
this assessment requires significant judgment 
if the financial condition of our customers were to worsen  additional allowances may be required  resulting in future operating losses that are not included in the allowance for doubtful accounts at june  income taxes realization of our deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on future taxable income  the timing and amount of which are uncertain in part due to the expected profitability of certain foreign subsidiaries 
as of june   the deferred tax assets net of valuation allowances are primarily attributable to postretirement benefits  inventory reserves and net operating loss carryforwards 
in the event that we were to determine that we would not be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future  an increase in the valuation allowance would be required

 accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of fsp 
this act was signed into law by the president on december  and introduces a prescription drug benefit under medicare part d as well as a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to medicare part d 
fsp provides guidance on the accounting for the effects of the act for employers that sponsor postretirement health care plans that provide prescription drug benefits and requires those employers to provide certain disclosures regarding the effect of the federal subsidy provided by the act 
this fsp supersedes fsp  accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of issued in january fsp is effective for the first interim or annual period beginning after june  the net periodic postretirement benefit cost and liability included in the consolidated financial statements do not reflect the effects of this act 
the company is finalizing the impact of the adoption of this fsp on the consolidated financial statements 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk we are exposed to certain market risks arising from transactions that are entered into in the normal course of business 
as part of our financial risk management program  we use certain derivative financial instruments to manage these risks 
we do not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes and therefore hold no derivative instruments for trading purposes 
we use derivative financial instruments to dampen the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates on our consolidated results and to achieve our targeted mix of fixed and floating interest rates on outstanding debt 
our objective in managing foreign exchange exposures with derivative instruments is to reduce both earnings and cash flow volatility  allowing us to focus our attention on business operations 
with respect to interest rate management  these derivative instruments allow us to achieve our 
table of contents targeted fixed to floating interest rate mix as a separate decision from funding arrangements in the bank and public debt markets 
we measure hedge effectiveness by assessing the changes in the fair value or expected future cash flows of the hedged item 
the ineffective portions are recorded in other income or expense in the current period 
see notes and to our consolidated financial statements for additional information 
we are exposed to counterparty credit risk for nonperformance of derivative contracts and  in the event of nonperformance  to market risk for changes in interest and currency rates 
we manage exposure to counterparty credit risk through credit standards  diversification of counterparties and procedures to monitor concentrations of credit risk 
we do not anticipate nonperformance by any of the counterparties 
the following provides additional information on our use of derivative instruments 
included below is a sensitivity analysis that is based upon a hypothetical percent weakening or strengthening in the us dollar compared to the june  foreign currency rates  the effective interest rates under our current borrowing arrangements and the market value of our available for sale securities 
we compared the contractual derivative and borrowing arrangements in effect at june  to the hypothetical foreign exchange or interest rates in the sensitivity analysis to determine the effect on interest expense  pretax income  fair value of the available for sale securities or the accumulated other comprehensive loss 
our analysis takes into consideration the different types of derivative instruments and the applicability of hedge accounting 
cash flow hedges currency a portion of our operations consists of investments in foreign subsidiaries 
our exposure to market risk for changes in foreign exchange rates arises from these investments  intercompany loans utilized to finance these subsidiaries  trade receivables and payables  and firm commitments arising from international transactions 
we manage our foreign exchange transaction risk to reduce the volatility of cash flows caused by currency fluctuations through natural offsets where appropriate  and through foreign exchange contracts 
these contracts are designated as hedges of transactions that will settle in future periods  and otherwise would expose us to foreign currency risk 
our foreign exchange hedging program minimizes our exposure to foreign exchange rate movements 
this exposure arises largely from anticipated cash flows from cross border intercompany sales of products and services 
this program utilizes purchased options  range forwards and forward contracts primarily to sell foreign currency 
the notional amounts of the contracts translated into us dollars at june  and rates are million and million  respectively 
we would have received million at june  and paid million at june  to settle these contracts  which represents the fair value of these agreements 
at june  and  a hypothetical percent strengthening or weakening of the us dollar would change accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of tax  by million and million  respectively 
in addition  we may enter into forward contracts to hedge transaction exposures or significant cross border intercompany loans by either purchasing or selling specified amounts of foreign currency at a specified date 
at june  and  we had several outstanding forward contracts to purchase and sell foreign currency  with notional amounts  translated into us dollars at june  and rates  of million and million  respectively 
a hypothetical percent change in the applicable and year end exchange rates would result in an increase or decrease in pretax income of million and million  respectively  related to these positions 
interest rate our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our long term debt obligations 
we seek to manage our interest rate risk in order to balance our exposure between fixed and floating rates while attempting to minimize our borrowing costs 
to achieve these objectives  we primarily use interest rate swap agreements to manage exposure to interest rate changes related to these borrowings 
at june  and  we had interest rate swap agreements outstanding that effectively convert notional amounts of million and million  respectively  of debt from floating to fixed interest rates 
the outstanding agreements mature in june of we would have received million and paid million at june  and  respectively  to settle these interest rate swap agreements  which represents the fair value of these agreements 
fair value hedges interest rate as discussed above  our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our long term debt obligations 
we seek to manage this risk through the use of interest rate swap agreements 
at june  and  we had interest rate swap agreements outstanding that effectively convert a notional amount of million of the senior unsecured notes from fixed to floating interest rates 
these agreements mature in june but provide for a one time optional early termination for the bank counterparty in june at the then prevailing market value of the swap agreements 
debt and notes payable at june  and  we had million and million  respectively  of debt and notes payable outstanding 
effective interest rates as of june  and were percent and percent  respectively  including the effect of interest rate swaps 
a hypothetical change of percent in interest rates from year end and levels would increase or decrease interest expense by approximately million and million  respectively
