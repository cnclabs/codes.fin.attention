item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with the selected financial data and the financial statements and notes thereto included in this annual report on form k 
historical operating results are not necessarily indicative of results that may occur in future periods 
this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
the actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including  but not limited to  those presented under risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
we undertake no obligation to update any forward looking statement to reflect events after the date of this report 
overview we design and sell digital amplifiers based on our proprietary digital power processing dpp technology 
we currently supply amplifiers for audio electronics applications  and have begun offering amplifiers for dsl applications 
we were incorporated in july  began shipping products in the first quarter of and became a public reporting company in august accordingly  we have limited historical financial information and operating history for use in evaluating tripath and our future prospects 
we incurred net losses of approximately million in  million in before charge for beneficial conversion of million and million in we expect to continue to incur net losses in  and possibly beyond 
we sell our products to original equipment manufacturers and distributors 
we recognize revenue from product sales upon shipment to original equipment manufacturers  net of sales returns and allowances 
our sales to distributors are made under arrangements allowing for returns or credits under certain circumstances and we defer recognition on sales to distributors until products are resold by the distributor to the end user 
all of our sales are made in united states us dollars 
as a fabless semiconductor company  we contract with third party semiconductor fabricators to manufacture the silicon wafers based on our integrated circuit ic designs 
each wafer contains numerous die  which are cut from the wafer to create a chip for an ic 
we also contract with third party assembly and test houses to assemble and package our die and conduct final product testing 
cost of revenue includes the cost of purchasing finished silicon wafers and die manufactured by independent foundries  costs associated with assembly and final product testing  as well as salaries and overhead costs associated with employees engaged in activities related to manufacturing 
research and development expense consists primarily of salaries and related overhead costs associated with employees engaged in research  design and development activities  as well as the cost of wafers and other materials and related services used in the development process 
selling  general and administrative expense consists primarily of employee compensation and related overhead expenses and advertising and marketing expenses 
stock based compensation expense relates both to stock based employee and consultant compensation arrangements 
employee related stock based compensation expense is based on the difference between the estimated fair value of our common stock on the date of grant and the exercise price of options to purchase that stock and is being recognized on an accelerated basis over the vesting periods of the related options  usually four years  or in the case of fully vested options  in the period of grant 
consultant stock based compensation expense is based on the black scholes option pricing model 
future compensation charges will be reduced if any employee or consultant terminates employment or consultation prior to the expiration of the option vesting period 
critical accounting policies use of estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to product returns  warranty obligations  bad debts  inventory direct costing and valuation  accruals  valuation of stock options and warrants  income taxes including the valuation allowance for deferred taxes and restructuring costs 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from the other sources 
actual results may materially differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
material differences may occur in our results of operations for any period if we made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
we recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery of goods has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
the following policies apply to our major categories of revenue transactions 
sales to oem customers under our standard terms and conditions of sale  title and risk of loss transfer to the customer at the time product is delivered to the customer  fob shipping point  and revenue is recognized accordingly 
we accrue the estimated cost of post sale obligations  including basic product warranties or returns  based on historical experience 
we have experienced minimal warranty or other returns to date 
sales to distributors we provide our distributors certain incentives such as stock rotation  price protection  and other offerings 
as a result of these incentives  we defer recognition of revenue until such time that the distributor sells product to its customer 
allowance for doubtful accounts we provide an allowance for doubtful accounts to ensure trade receivables are not overstated due to uncollectibility 
the collectibility of our receivables is evaluated based on a variety of factors  including the length of time receivables are past due  customers indication of willingness to pay  significant one time events and historical experience 
an additional reserve for individual accounts is recorded when we become aware of a customer s inability to meet its financial obligations  such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or substantial deterioration in the customer s operating results or financial position 
if circumstances related to our customers change  estimates of the recoverability of receivables would be further adjusted 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
this policy requires us to make estimates regarding the market value of our inventory  including an assessment of excess or obsolete inventory 
we determine excess and obsolete inventory based on an estimate of the future demand and estimated selling prices for our products within a specified time horizon  generally months 
the estimates we use for expected demand are also used for near term capacity planning and inventory purchasing and are consistent with our revenue forecasts 
in addition to current inventory of million  we have inventory purchase commitments of approximately million 
our inventory and purchase commitments are based on expected demand and not necessarily built for firm purchase commitments for our customers 
because of the required delivery lead time  we need to carry a high level of inventory in comparison to past sales 
actual demand and market conditions may be different from those projected by our management 
if our unit demand forecast is less than our current inventory levels and purchase commitments  during the specified time horizon  or if the estimated selling price is less than our inventory value  we will be required to take additional excess inventory charges or write downs to net realizable value which will decrease our gross margin and net operating results in the future 
during the quarter ended march   we recorded a provision for excess inventory of approximately million related to excess inventory for our ta product as a result of a decrease in forecasted sales for this product 
results of operations years ended december   and revenue 
revenues for fiscal year were million  a decrease of million or from revenues of million for fiscal year the decrease in revenues was primarily due to decreases in sales of our ta  ta and tk products  reflecting lower sales of low margin home theater products in the china market and decreased demand from apple computer  partially offset by increases in sales of our tld and ta products reflecting increased sales of dsl line drivers and digital audio amplifier products in the flat panel tv and gaming vertical markets 
revenues for fiscal year increased by million or over revenues of million for fiscal year the increase in revenues resulted primarily from increased sales of our ta  ta and tk products  offset partially by decreased sales of our tab and ta products 
our top five end customers accounted for of revenue in versus and in and respectively 
our primary customers in were kyoshin technosonic co  ltd 
kts  samsung electronics co  ltd 
samsung and apple computer inc apple  representing  and of revenue  respectively 
in our primary customers were apple computer inc and apex digital inc  representing and of revenue  respectively 
sony corporation and apple computer inc were our top two customers in  representing and of revenue  respectively 
gross profit loss 
gross profit for fiscal year was million including stock based compensation expense of  compared to a gross loss of million including stock based compensation expense of  for fiscal year and a gross profit of million including stock based compensation benefit of  for fiscal year the increase in gross profit for fiscal year reflects ongoing product cost reduction efforts  increased unit volumes for a number of our products as well as sales of higher margin products 
the gross loss for fiscal year was primarily due to a reserve of million for excess inventory during the first quarter of the inventory charge  related to excess inventory for our ta product  was based on a decline in forecasted sales for this product 
research and development 
research and development r d expenses for fiscal year were million including stock based compensation expense of  a decrease of million or from r d expenses of million including stock based compensation expense of  for fiscal year the decrease in r d expenses was due to a decrease in personnel costs  as a result of reduced headcount and salary reductions  and a decrease in product development expenses  as well as lower rent and insurance expenses 
r d expenses for fiscal year totaled million including stock based compensation benefit of 
the decrease in r d expenses from to was due to lower personnel related costs and lower product development costs 
we anticipate that our r d expenses will increase in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative s  g a expenses for fiscal year were million including stock based compensation expense of  a decrease of million or from s  g a expenses of million including stock based compensation benefit of  in the decrease in s  g a expenses was primarily due to decreased headcount and related costs and lower expenses related to rent  insurance and bad debts 
s  g a expenses for fiscal year were million including stock based compensation expense of 
the decrease in s  g a expenses from to was primarily due to decreased headcount and related costs and lower professional services costs 
we anticipate that our s  g a expenses will increase in fiscal  including expenses for legal and financial compliance costs related to the sarbanes oxley act of and increased insurance costs 
restructuring and other charges 
on august   we announced a restructuring and cost reduction plan which included a workforce reduction and write off of abandoned assets 
as a result of the restructuring and cost reduction plan  we recorded restructuring and other charges of  during the quarter ended september  under the restructuring and cost reduction plan  we reduced our workforce by approximately employees across all functions and mostly located at our former headquarters facility in santa clara  california 
the workforce reduction resulted in a  charge relating primarily to severance and fringe benefits for terminated employees 
we also abandoned assets for a charge of  the restructuring was completed by december  a summary of the restructuring and other charges is as follows total charges non cash charges cash payments work force reduction write off of abandoned assets interest and other income  net 
interest income for was  a decrease of  or from interest income of  in interest income for decreased  or from interest income of  in the decreases in interest income in and resulted from decreases in our average cash equivalents and short term investment balances to fund operations  together with lower interest rates 
accretion on preferred stock 
accretion on preferred stock for was  the accretion was due to the financing transaction that was completed in january  in which we raised million in gross proceeds through a private placement of non voting series a preferred stock and warrants 
the accretion related to the beneficial conversion feature represents the difference between the accounting conversion price and the fair value of the common stock on the date of the transaction  after valuing the warrants issued in connection with the financing transaction 
income taxes 
we have incurred no income tax expense to date 
as of december   we had available federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million 
we also had research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately million for federal and state purposes 
the net operating loss and credit carryforwards will expire at various times through as of december   we had deferred tax assets of approximately million which consisted primarily of net operating loss carryforwards  research and development tax credit carryforwards and nondeductible reserves and accruals 
we have recorded a full valuation allowance against these deferred tax assets 
deferred tax assets will be recognized in future periods as any taxable income is realized and consistent profits are reported 
liquidity and capital resources since our inception  we have financed our operations through the private sale of our equity securities  primarily the sale of preferred stock  through our initial public offering on august  and through a private placement in january and subsequent stock warrant exercises 
net proceeds to us as a result of our initial public offering  our private placement and subsequent stock warrant exercises were approximately million  million and million  respectively 
net cash used by operating activities decreased by million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the decrease was mainly due to a decrease in net loss of million primarily as a result of lower operating expenses  partially offset by a decrease in the provision for excess inventory of million and an increase in accounts payable of million 
net cash used for operating activities during the year ended december  was million  the majority of which was used to fund the net loss of million and inventory purchases of million 
cash used in investing activities was  for the year ended december  compared with  for the year ended december  the change was primarily due to no cash being provided from the sale of short term investments during whereas million had been provided from the sale of short term investments during in our investing activities provided cash in the amount of million from the net sale of short term investments 
cash provided by financing activities decreased by million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the higher amount of cash provided by financing activities in was due to the additional financing  details of which are summarized below 
in  our financing activities provided cash in the amount of million  the majority of which was derived from proceeds from issuance of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan and through exercise of stock options 
on january   we completed a financing in which we raised million in gross proceeds through a private placement of non voting series a preferred stock and warrants  at per unit to a group of investors 
at a special meeting of stockholders held on march   our stockholders approved the issuance and sale of the series a preferred stock and warrants  which then automatically converted into  shares of common stock and warrants to purchase  shares of common stock 
this included unregistered warrants that were issued to the placement agent for the financing transaction to purchase  shares of our common stock 
the  registered warrants have a term of three years and an effective common stock exercise price of per share  whereas  of the  warrants issued to the placement agent have an effective common stock exercise price of per share 
the remainder of the warrants issued to the placement agent have an effective common stock exercise price of per share 
during the year ended december   warrants were exercised which resulted in the issuance of  shares of our common stock with proceeds totaling approximately million 
the warrants issued to the placement agent were exercised on a net issuance basis resulting in  shares of our common stock being issued to the placement agent 
the warrant agreement contained a provision for the mandatory exercise of the warrants if our common stock traded at or higher for out of trading days 
at the close of business on january  our common stock had traded at or higher for consecutive days and we were able to invoke the provision for the mandatory exercise of all outstanding warrants issued in connection with the january financing 
all outstanding warrants were exercised in january resulting in the issuance of an additional million shares of common stock 
we received proceeds of approximately million from the exercise of these warrants 
on july   we entered into a credit agreement with a financial institution that provided for a one year revolving credit facility in an amount of up to million  subject to certain restrictions in the borrowing base based on eligibility of receivables 
the credit agreement expired on june  and was not renewed 
the credit agreement was used to issue stand by letters of credit totaling million to collateralize our obligations to a third party for the purchase of inventory and to provide a security deposit for the lease of new office space 
upon the expiration of the credit agreement on june   we entered into a pledge and security agreement to provide a security interest in a money market account in the amount of million for the standby letters of credit  which totaled million at december  our total potential commitments on our operating and capital leases and inventory purchases as of december   were as follows in thousands year ending december  operating leases capital leases inventory purchase commitments totals and beyond less amount representing interest present value of minimum lease payments less current portion of capital lease obligations long term capital lease obligations we expect our future liquidity and capital requirements will fluctuate depending on numerous factors including market acceptance and demand for current and future products  the timing of new product introductions and enhancements to existing products  the success of on going efforts to reduce our manufacturing costs as well as operating expenses and need for working capital for such items as inventory and accounts receivable 
we have incurred substantial losses and have experienced negative cash flow since inception and have an accumulated deficit of million at december  beginning in august  we instituted programs to reduce expenses including reducing headcount from employees at the end of july to employees at the end of december and reducing employees salaries by 
in september we relocated our headquarters which reduced rent expense and canceled our d o policy which reduced insurance expense 
these actions resulted in significant cost savings in we reduced our cash used in operating activities from approximately million in to approximately million in during  warrants were exercised which resulted in us receiving proceeds totaling approximately million 
at december   we had working capital of million  including cash of million 
subsequent to december  we received proceeds of approximately million from the exercise of outstanding warrants 
we may need to raise additional funds to finance our activities through public or private equity or debt financings  the formation of strategic partnerships or alliances with other companies or through bank borrowings with existing or new banks 
we may not be able to obtain additional funds on terms that would be favorable to our stockholders and us  or at all 
in such instance  we will take measures to reduce our operating expenses  such as reducing headcount or canceling selected research and development projects 
without sufficient capital to fund our operations  we will no longer be able to continue as a going concern 
we believe  based on our current cash balance as well as our ability to implement the aforementioned measures  if needed  that we will have liquidity sufficient to meet our operating  working capital and financing needs for the next twelve months and perhaps beyond 
our long term prospects are dependent upon obtaining sufficient financing as needed to fund current working capital needs and future growth  and ultimately on achieving profitability 
recent accounting pronouncements in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
fin  which addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities vies either that do not have sufficient equity investment at risk to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support  or in which the equity investors lack an essential characteristic of a controlling financial interest 
in december  the fasb completed deliberations of proposed modifications to fin revised interpretations resulting in multiple effective dates based on the nature as well as the creation date of the vie 
vies created after january   but prior to january   may be accounted for either based on the original interpretation or the revised interpretations 
however  the revised interpretations must be applied no later than the first quarter of fiscal year vies created after january  must be accounted for under the revised interpretations 
there has been no material impact to our consolidated financial statements from potential vies entered into after january  and there is no expected impact from the adoption of the deferred provisions in the first quarter of fiscal year in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
sfas amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments and for hedging activities 
sfas is effective for contracts entered into or modified after june  we do not use derivative products and the adoption of this statement had no material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity sfas 
sfas establishes standards on the classification and measurement of certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
the provisions of sfas are effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may  and to all other instruments that exist as of the beginning of the first interim financial reporting period beginning after june  the adoption of sfas did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
in december  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab  which codifies  revises and rescinds certain sections of sab no 
 revenue recognition  in order to make this interpretive guidance consistent with current authoritative accounting and auditing guidance and sec rules and regulations 
the changes noted in sab did not have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations  consolidated financial position or consolidated cash flows 
risk factors set forth below and elsewhere in this annual report and in the other documents we file with the securities and exchange commission are risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward looking statements contained in this annual report 
prospective and existing investors are strongly urged to carefully consider the various cautionary statements and risks set forth in this annual report and our other public filings 
our limited operating history and dependence on new technologies make it difficult to evaluate our prospects and future products 
we were incorporated in july  began shipping products in and became a public reporting company in august accordingly  we have limited historical financial information and operating history upon which you may evaluate us and our products 
our prospects must be considered in the light of the risks  challenges and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in their early stage of development  particularly companies in intensely competitive and rapidly evolving markets such as the semiconductor industry 
we cannot be sure that we will be successful in addressing these risks and challenges 
we have a history of losses and may never achieve or sustain profitability 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we incurred net losses of approximately million in  million before accretion on preferred stock of million in and million in we may continue to incur net losses and these losses may be substantial 
furthermore  we may continue to generate significant negative cash flow in the future 
we will need to generate substantially higher revenue to achieve and sustain profitability and positive cash flow 
our ability to generate future revenue and achieve profitability will depend on a number of factors  many of which are described throughout this section 
if we are unable to achieve or maintain profitability  we will be unable to build a sustainable business 
in this event  our share price and the value of your investment would likely decline and we might be unable to continue as a going concern 
we may need to raise additional capital to continue to grow our business  which may not be available to us 
because we have had losses  we have funded our operating activities to date from the sale of securities  including our most recent financing in january as well as from the proceeds from the related exercise of warrants issued in connection with the financing 
however  to grow our business significantly  we will need additional capital 
we cannot be certain that any such financing will be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
moreover  additional equity financing  if available  would likely be dilutive to the holders of our common stock  and debt financing  if available  would likely involve restrictive covenants 
if we cannot raise sufficient additional capital  it would adversely affect our ability to achieve our business objectives and to continue as a going concern 
our quarterly operating results are likely to fluctuate significantly and may fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors  which may cause our share price to decline 
our quarterly operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and are likely to continue to do so in the future 
the many factors that could cause our quarterly results to fluctuate include  in part level of sales and recognition of revenue  mix of high and low margin products  availability and pricing of wafers  timing of introducing new products  including  but not limited to  the introduction of new products based on the lower cost godzilla architecture  lower cost versions of existing products  fluctuations in manufacturing yields and other problems or delays in the fabrication  assembly  testing or delivery of products  and rate of development of target markets 
a large portion of our operating expenses  including salaries  rent and capital lease expenses  are fixed 
if we experience a shortfall in revenues relative to our expenses  we may be unable to reduce our expenses quickly enough to offset the reduction in revenues during that accounting period  which would adversely affect our operating results 
fluctuations in our operating results may also result in fluctuations in our common stock price 
if the market price of our stock is adversely affected  we may experience difficulty in raising capital or making acquisitions 
in addition  we may become the object of securities class action litigation 
as a result  we do not believe that period to period comparisons of our revenues and operating results are necessarily meaningful 
one should not rely on the results of any one quarter as an indication of future performance 
our stock price may be subject to significant volatility 
the stock prices for many technology companies have recently experienced large fluctuations  which may or may not be directly related to the operating performance of the specific companies 
for example  for fiscal  our common stock had closing sales prices on nasdaq as low as and as high as per share 
broad market fluctuations as well as general economic conditions may cause our stock price to decline 
we believe that fluctuations of our stock price may continue to be caused by a variety of factors  including announcements of developments related to our business  fluctuations in our financial results  general conditions in the stock market or around the world  terrorism or developments in the semiconductor and capital equipment industry and the general economy  sales or purchases of our common stock in the marketplace  announcements of our technological innovations or new products or enhancements or those of our competitors  developments in patents or other intellectual property rights  developments in our relationships with customers and suppliers  a shortfall or changes in revenue  gross margins or earnings or other financial results from analysts expectations or an outbreak of hostilities or natural disasters  or acquisition or merger activity and the success in implementing such acquisitions 
our product shipment patterns make it difficult to predict our quarterly revenues 
as is common in our industry  we frequently ship more products in the third month of each quarter than in either of the first two months of the quarter  and shipments in the third month are higher at the end of that month 
we believe this pattern is likely to continue 
the concentration of sales in the last month of the quarter may cause our quarterly results of operations to be more difficult to predict 
moreover  if sufficient business does not materialize or a disruption in our production or shipping occurs near the end of a quarter  our revenues for that quarter could be materially reduced 
our customers may cancel or defer product orders  which could result in excess inventory 
our sales are generally made pursuant to individual purchase orders that may be canceled or deferred by customers on short notice without significant penalty 
thus  orders in backlog may not result in future revenue 
in the past  we have had cancellations and deferrals by customers 
any cancellation or deferral of product orders could result in us holding excess inventory  or result in obsolete inventory over time  which could seriously harm our profit margins and restrict our ability to fund our operations 
for example  during the quarter ended march   we recorded a provision for excess inventory of approximately million 
our inventory and purchase commitments are based on expected demand and not necessarily built for firm purchase commitments for our customers 
because of the required delivery lead time  we need to carry a high level of inventory in comparison to past sales 
we recognize revenue upon shipment of products to the end customer 
although we have not experienced customer refusals to accept shipped products or material difficulties in collecting accounts receivable  such refusals or collection difficulties are possible and could result in significant charges against income  which could seriously harm our revenues and our cash flow 
we rely on a small number of customers for most of our revenue and a decrease in revenue from these customers could seriously harm our business 
a relatively small number of customers have accounted for most of our revenues to date 
any reduction or delay in sales of our products to one or more of these key customers could seriously reduce our sales volume and revenue and adversely affect our operating results 
our top five end customers accounted for of revenue in versus and in and respectively 
our primary customers in were kyoshin technosonic co  ltd 
kts  samsung electronics co  ltd 
samsung  and apple computer inc apple representing  and of revenue  respectively 
in our primary customers were apple and apex digital inc  representing and of revenue  respectively 
sony corporation and apple were our top two customers in  representing and of revenue  respectively 
we expect that we will continue to rely on the success of our largest customers and on our success in selling our existing and future products to those customers in significant quantities 
however  we cannot be sure that we will retain our largest customers or that we will be able to obtain additional key customers or replace key customers we may lose or who may reduce their purchases 
we currently rely on sales of four products for a significant portion of our revenue  and the failure of these products to be successful in the future could substantially reduce our sales 
we currently rely on sales of our tab  ta  ta digital audio amplifier products and tld dsl line driver to generate a significant portion of our revenue 
sales of these products amounted to of our revenue for year ended december   of our revenue in and of our revenue in we have developed additional products and plan to introduce more products in the future  but there can be no assurance that these products will be commercially successful 
consequently  if our existing products are not successful  our sales could decline substantially 
our lengthy sales cycle makes it difficult for us to predict if or when a sale will be made  to forecast our revenue and to budget expenses  which may cause fluctuations in our quarterly results 
because of our lengthy sales cycles  we may continue to experience a delay between incurring expenses for research and development  sales and marketing and general and administrative efforts  as well as incurring investments in inventory  and the generation of revenue  if any  from such expenditures 
in addition  the delays inherent in such a lengthy sales cycle raise additional risks of customer decisions to cancel or change product plans  which could result in our loss of anticipated sales 
our new products are generally incorporated into our customers products or systems at the design stage 
to try and have our products selected for design into new products of current and potential customers  commonly referred to as design wins  often requires significant expenditures by us without any assurance of success 
once we have achieved a design win  our sales cycle will start with the test and evaluation of our products by the potential customer and design of the customer s equipment to incorporate our products 
generally  different parts have to be redesigned to incorporate our devices successfully into our customers products 
the sales cycle for the test and evaluation of our products can range from a minimum of three to six months  and it can take a minimum of an additional six to nine months before a customer commences volume production of equipment that incorporates our products 
achieving a design win provides no assurance that such customer will ultimately ship products incorporating our products or that such products will be commercially successful 
our revenue or prospective revenue would be reduced if a significant customer curtails  reduces or delays orders during our sales cycle  or chooses not to release products incorporating our products 
our ability to achieve revenue growth will be harmed if we are unable to persuade electronic systems manufacturers to adopt our new amplifier technology 
we face difficulties in persuading manufacturers to adopt our products using our new amplifier technology 
traditional amplifiers use design approaches developed in the s 
these approaches are still used in most amplifiers and engineers are familiar with these design approaches 
to adopt our products  manufacturers and engineers must understand and accept our new technology 
to take advantage of our products  manufacturers must redesign their systems  particularly components such as the power supply and heat sinks 
manufacturers must work with their suppliers to obtain modified components and they often must complete lengthy evaluation and testing 
in addition  our amplifiers are often more expensive as components than traditional amplifiers 
for these reasons  prospective customers may be reluctant to adopt our technology 
we currently depend on consumer electronics markets that are typically characterized by aggressive pricing  frequent new product introductions and intense competition 
a substantial portion of our current revenue is generated from sales of products that address the consumer electronics markets  including home theater  computer audio  flat panel tv  gaming  professional amplifiers  set top box  av receivers and the automotive audio markets 
these markets are characterized by frequent new product introductions  declining prices and intense competition 
pricing in these markets is aggressive  and we expect pricing pressure to continue 
in the computer audio segment  our success depends on consumer awareness and acceptance of existing and new products by our customers and consumers  in particular  the elimination of externally powered speakers 
in the automotive audio segment  we face pressure from our customers to deliver increasingly higher powered solutions under significant engineering limitations due to the size constraints in car dashboards 
in addition  our ability to obtain prices higher than the prices of traditional amplifiers will depend on our ability to educate manufacturers and their customers about the benefits of our products 
failure of our customers and consumers to accept our existing or new products will seriously harm our operating results 
the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry could create fluctuations in our operating results 
the semiconductor industry has historically been cyclical and characterized by wide fluctuations in product supply and demand 
from time to time  the industry has also experienced significant downturns  often in connection with  or in anticipation of  maturing product cycles and declines in general economic conditions 
industry downturns have been characterized by diminished product demand  production overcapacity and accelerated decline in average selling prices  and in some cases have lasted for more than a year 
the industry experienced a downturn of this type in and  and began experiencing a downturn again in in addition  we may determine to lower our prices of our products to increase or maintain market share  which would likely harm our operating results 
the semiconductor industry also periodically experiences increased demand and production capacity constraints 
as a result  we have experienced and may experience in the future substantial period to period fluctuations in our results of operations due to general semiconductor industry conditions  overall economic conditions or other factors  many of which are outside our control 
due to these risks  you should not rely on period to period comparisons to predict our future performance 
we may experience difficulties in the introduction of new or enhanced products  including but not limited to the new godzilla architecture products  that could result in significant  unexpected expenses or delay their launch  which would harm our business 
our failure or our customers failure to develop and introduce new products successfully and in a timely manner would seriously harm our ability to generate revenues 
consequently  our success depends on our ability to develop new products for existing and new markets  introduce such products in a timely and cost effective manner and to achieve design wins 
the development of these new devices is highly complex  and from time to time we have experienced delays in completing the development and introduction of new products 
the successful introduction of a new product may currently take up to months 
successful product development and introduction depends on a number of factors  including accurate prediction of market requirements and evolving standards  accurate new product definition  timely completion and introduction of new product designs  availability of foundry capacity  achieving acceptable manufacturing yields  market acceptance of our products and our customers products  and market competition 
we cannot guarantee success with regard to these factors 
we depend on three outside foundries for our semiconductor device manufacturing requirements 
we do not own or operate a fabrication facility  and substantially all of our semiconductor device requirements are currently supplied by three outside foundries  united microelectronics corporation  in taiwan  stmicroelectronics group in europe and renesas technology mitsubishi electric in japan 
although we primarily utilize these three outside foundries  most of our components are not manufactured at these foundries at the same time 
as a result  each foundry is a sole source for certain products 
there are significant risks associated with our reliance on outside foundries  including the lack of guaranteed wafer supply  limited control over delivery schedules  quality assurance and control  manufacturing yields and production costs  and the unavailability of or delays in obtaining access to key process technologies 
in addition  the manufacture of integrated circuits is a highly complex and technologically demanding process 
although we work closely with our foundries to minimize the likelihood of reduced manufacturing yields  our foundries have from time to time experienced lower than anticipated manufacturing yields  particularly in connection with the introduction of new products and the installation and start up of new process technologies 
we provide our foundries with continuous forecasts of our production requirements  however  the ability of each foundry to provide us with semiconductor devices is limited by the foundry s available capacity 
in many cases  we place our orders on a purchase order basis  and foundries may allocate capacity to the production of other companies products while reducing the deliveries to us on short notice 
in particular  foundry customers that are larger and better financed than us or that have long term agreements with our foundries may cause such foundries to reallocate capacity in a manner adverse to us 
while capacity at our foundries has been available during the last several years  the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry could result in capacity limitations in a cyclical upturn or otherwise 
if we use a new foundry  several months would be typically required to complete the qualification process before we can begin shipping products from the new foundry 
in the event any of our current foundries suffers any damage or destruction to their respective facilities  or in the event of any other disruption of foundry capacity  we may not be able to qualify alternative manufacturing sources for existing or new products in a timely manner 
even our current outside foundries would need to have certain manufacturing processes qualified in the event of disruption at another foundry  which we may not be able to accomplish in a timely enough manner to prevent an interruption in supply of the affected products 
if we encounter shortages or delays in obtaining semiconductor devices for our products in sufficient quantities when required  delivery of our products could be delayed  resulting in customer dissatisfaction and decreased revenues 
we depend on third party subcontractors for most of our semiconductor assembly and testing requirements and any unexpected interruption in their services could cause us to miss scheduled shipments to customers and to lose revenues 
semiconductor assembly and testing are complex processes  which involve significant technological expertise and specialized equipment 
as a result of our reliance on third party subcontractors for assembly and testing of our products  we cannot directly control product delivery schedules  which has in the past  and could in the future  result in product shortages or quality assurance problems that could increase the costs of manufacture  assembly or testing of our products 
almost all of our products are assembled and tested by one of seven subcontractors ambit microsystems corporation in china  amkor technology  inc in the philippines  ase in korea  malaysia and taiwan  lingsen in taiwan  stmicroelectronics group in malaysia  sts in china  and st assembly test services ltd 
in singapore 
we do not have long term agreements with any of these suppliers and retain their services on a per order basis 
the availability of assembly and testing services from these subcontractors could be adversely affected in the event a subcontractor suffers any damage or destruction to their respective facilities  or in the event of any other disruption of assembly and testing capacity 
due to the amount of time normally required to qualify assemblers and testers  if we are required to find alternative manufacturing assemblers or testers of our components  shipments could be delayed 
any problems associated with the delivery  quality or cost of our products could seriously harm our business 
failure to transition our products to more effective and or increasingly smaller semiconductor chip sizes and packaging could cause us to lose our competitive advantage and reduce our gross margins 
we evaluate the benefits  on a product by product basis  of migrating to smaller semiconductor process technologies in order to reduce costs and have commenced migration of some products to smaller semiconductor processes 
we believe that the transition of our products to increasingly smaller semiconductor processes will be important for us to reduce manufacturing costs and to remain competitive 
moreover  we are dependent on our relationships with our foundries to migrate to smaller semiconductor processes successfully 
we cannot be sure that our future process migrations will be achieved without difficulties  delays or increased expenses 
our gross margins would be seriously harmed if any such transition is substantially delayed or inefficiently implemented 
our international operations subject us to risks inherent in doing business on an international level that could harm our operating results 
we currently obtain almost all of our manufacturing  assembly and test services from suppliers located outside the united states and may expand our manufacturing activities abroad 
approximately of our total revenue for the year ended december   was derived from sales to end customers based outside the united states 
in and  and  respectively  of our total revenue was derived from sales to end customers based outside of the united states 
in addition  we often ship products to our domestic customers international manufacturing divisions and subcontractors 
accordingly  we are subject to risks inherent in international operations  which include political  social and economic instability  trade restrictions and tariffs  the imposition of governmental controls  exposure to different legal standards  particularly with respect to intellectual property  import and export license requirements  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  and difficulties in collecting receivables 
all of our international sales to date have been denominated in us dollars 
as a result  an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products less competitive in international markets 
conversely  a decrease in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies would increase the cost of our overseas manufacturing  which would reduce our gross margins 
if we are not successful in developing and marketing new and enhanced products for the dsl high speed communications markets that keep pace with technology and our customers needs  our operating results will suffer 
the market for our dsl products is new and emerging  and is characterized by rapid technological advances  intense competition and a relatively small number of potential customers 
this will likely result in price erosion on existing products and pressure for cost reduced future versions 
we recently started to ship our ta dsl line driver in volume and are in the sampling phase of our new dual channel line driver 
implementation of our products require manufacturers to accept our technology and redesign their products 
if potential customers do not accept our technology or experience problems implementing our devices in their products  our products could be rendered obsolete and our business would be harmed 
if we are unsuccessful in introducing future products with enhanced performance  our ability to achieve revenue growth will be seriously harmed 
we may experience difficulties in the development and introduction of a new amplifier product for use in the cellular phone market  which could result in significant expenses or delay in its launch 
we are currently developing an amplifier product for use in the cellular phone market 
we currently have no design wins or customers for this product 
we may not introduce our amplifier product for the cellular phone market on time  and this product may never achieve market acceptance 
furthermore  competition in this market is likely to result in price reductions  shorter product life cycles  reduced gross margins and longer sales cycles compared with what we have experienced to date with our other products 
intense competition in the semiconductor industry and in the consumer electronics and communications markets could prevent us from achieving or sustaining profitability 
the semiconductor industry and the consumer audio and communications markets are highly competitive 
we compete with a number of major domestic and international suppliers of semiconductors in the consumer electronics and communications markets 
we also may face competition from suppliers of products based on new or emerging technologies 
many of our competitors operate their own fabrication facilities and have longer operating histories and presence in key markets  greater name recognition  access to larger customer bases and significantly greater financial  sales and marketing  manufacturing  distribution  technical and other resources than us 
as a result  such competitors may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products than us 
current and potential competitors have established or may establish financial or strategic relationships among themselves or with existing or potential customers  resellers or other third parties 
accordingly  it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share 
in addition  existing or new competitors may in the future develop technologies that more effectively address the transmission of digital information through existing analog infrastructures at a lower cost or develop new technologies that may render our technology obsolete 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future against our existing or potential competitors  or that our business will not be harmed by increased competition 
our products are complex and may have errors and defects that are detected only after deployment in customers products  which may harm our business 
products such as those that we offer may contain errors and defects when first introduced or as new versions are released 
we have in the past experienced such errors and defects  in particular in the development stage of a new product 
delivery of products with production defects or reliability  quality or compatibility problems could significantly delay or hinder market acceptance of such products  which could damage our reputation and seriously harm our ability to retain our existing customers and to attract new customers and therefore impact our revenues 
moreover  such errors and defects could cause problems  interruptions  delays or a cessation of sales to our customers 
alleviating such problems may require substantial redesign  manufacturing and testing which would result in significant expenditures of capital and resources 
despite testing conducted by us  our suppliers and our customers  we cannot be sure that errors and defects will not be found in new products after commencement of commercial production 
such errors and defects could result in additional development costs  loss of  or delays in  market acceptance  diversion of technical and other resources from our other development efforts  product repair or replacement costs  claims by our customers or others against us or the loss of credibility with our current and prospective customers 
any such event could result in the delay or loss of market acceptance of our products and would likely harm our business 
if we are unable to retain key personnel  we may not be able to operate our business successfully 
we may not be successful in retaining executive officers and other key management and technical personnel 
a high level of technical expertise is required to support the implementation of our technology in our existing and new customers products 
in addition  the loss of the management and technical expertise of dr 
adya s 
tripathi  our founder  president and chief executive officer  could seriously harm us 
we do not have any employment contracts with our employees 
our intellectual property and proprietary rights may be insufficient to protect our competitive position 
our business depends  in part  on our ability to protect our intellectual property 
we rely primarily on patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws to protect our proprietary technologies 
we cannot be sure that such measures will provide meaningful protection for our proprietary technologies and processes 
as of december   we have issued united states patents  and additional united states patent applications which are pending 
in addition  we have international patents issued and an additional international patents pending 
we cannot be sure that any patent will issue as a result of these applications or future applications or  if issued  that any claims allowed will be sufficient to protect our technology 
in addition  we cannot be sure that any existing or future patents will not be challenged  invalidated or circumvented  or that any right granted thereunder would provide us meaningful protection 
the failure of any patents to provide protection to our technology would make it easier for our competitors to offer similar products 
in connection with our participation in the development of various industry standards  we may be required to agree to license certain of our patents to other parties  including our competitors  that develop products based upon the adopted standards 
we also generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and strategic partners  and generally control access to and distribution of our documentation and other proprietary information 
despite these precautions  it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products  services or technology without authorization  develop similar technology independently or design around our patents 
in addition  effective copyright  trademark and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in certain foreign countries 
some of our customers have entered into agreements with us pursuant to which such customers have the right to use our proprietary technology in the event we default in our contractual obligations  including product supply obligations  and fail to cure the default within a specified period of time 
we may be subject to intellectual property rights disputes that could divert management s attention and could be costly 
the semiconductor industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights 
from time to time  we may receive in the future notices of claims of infringement  misappropriation or misuse of other parties proprietary rights 
we cannot be sure that we will prevail in these actions  or that other actions alleging infringement by us of third party patents  misappropriation or misuse by us of third party trade secrets or the invalidity of one or more patents held by us will not be asserted or prosecuted against us  or that any assertions of infringement  misappropriation or misuse or prosecutions seeking to establish the invalidity of our patents will not seriously harm our business 
for example  in a patent or trade secret action  an injunction could be issued against us requiring that we withdraw particular products from the market or necessitating that specific products offered for sale or under development be redesigned 
we have also entered into certain indemnification obligations in favor of our customers and strategic partners that could be triggered upon an allegation or finding of our infringement  misappropriation or misuse of other parties proprietary rights 
irrespective of the validity or successful assertion of such claims  we would likely incur significant costs and diversion of our management and personnel resources with respect to the defense of such claims  which could also seriously harm our business 
if any claims or actions are asserted against us  we may seek to obtain a license under a third party s intellectual property rights 
we cannot be sure that under such circumstances a license would be available on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
moreover  we often incorporate the intellectual property of our strategic customers into our designs  and we have certain obligations with respect to the non use and non disclosure of such intellectual property 
we cannot be sure that the steps taken by us to prevent our  or our customers  misappropriation or infringement of intellectual property will be successful 
the facilities of several of our key manufacturers and the majority of our customers  are located in geographic regions with increased risks of natural disasters 
several key manufacturers and a majority of customers are located in the pacific rim region 
the risk of earthquakes in this region  particularly in taiwan  is significant due to the proximity of major earthquake fault lines 
earthquakes  fire  flooding and other natural disasters in the pacific rim region likely would result in the disruption of our foundry partners assembly and testing capacity and the ability of our customers to purchase our products 
labor strikes or political unrest in these regions would likely also disrupt operations of our foundries and customers 
any disruption resulting from such events could cause significant delays in shipments of our products until we are able to shift our manufacturing  assembly and testing from the affected contractor to another third party vendor 
we cannot be sure that such alternative capacity could be obtained on favorable terms  if at all 
moreover  any such disruptions could also cause significant decreases in our sales to these customers until our customers resume normal purchasing volumes 
terrorist attacks and threats  and government responses thereto  may negatively impact all aspects of our operations  revenues  costs and stock price 
the threat of terrorist attacks involving the united states  the instability in the middle east  a decline in consumer confidence and continued economic weakness and geo political instability have had a substantial adverse effect on the economy 
if consumer confidence does not recover  our revenues may be adversely affected for fiscal and beyond 
moreover  any further terrorist attacks involving the us  or any additional us military actions overseas may disrupt our operations or those of our customers and suppliers 
these events have had and may continue to have an adverse impact on the us and world economy in general and consumer confidence and spending in particular  which could harm our sales 
any of these events could increase volatility in the usand world financial markets which could harm our stock price and may limit the capital resources available to us and our customers or suppliers 
this could have a significant impact on our operating results  revenues and costs and may result in increased volatility in the market price of our common stock 
we are subject to anti takeover provisions that could delay or prevent an unfriendly acquisition of our company 
provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation  equity incentive plans  bylaws and delaware law may discourage transactions involving an unfriendly change in corporate control 
in addition to the foregoing  the stockholdings of our officers  directors and persons or entities that may be deemed affiliates and the ability of our board of directors to issue preferred stock without further stockholder approval could have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a third party from acquiring us and may adversely affect the voting and other rights of holders of our common stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk of loss 
some of the securities that we may acquire in the future may be subject to market risk for changes in interest rates 
to mitigate this risk  we plan to maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  which may include commercial paper  money market funds  government and non government debt securities 
we manage the sensitivity of our results of operations to these risks by maintaining a conservative portfolio  which is comprised solely of highly rated  short term investments 
we do not hold or issue derivative  derivative commodity instruments or other financial instruments for trading purposes 
currently we are exposed to minimal market risks 
due to the short term and liquid nature of our portfolio  if interest rates were to fluctuate by from rates at december  and december   our financial position and results of operations would not be materially affected
