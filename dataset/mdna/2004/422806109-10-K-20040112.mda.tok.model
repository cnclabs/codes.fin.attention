the company s results of operations during each of the past three fiscal years have been affected by a number of transactions 
this discussion of the company s financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included herein 
for further information regarding the acquisitions and strategic alliances discussed below  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the acquisitions have been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and are included in the company s results of operations from the effective dates of acquisition 
during fiscal  the company acquired analog modules  inc  aero design  inc  avitech engineering corporation  and aviation facilities  inc 
for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million 
in addition  the company acquired inertial airline services  inc for million in cash and million in heico class a common stock  shares paid at closing 
the company guaranteed that the resale value of such class a common stock would be at least million through august  both parties originally agreed to extend the guaranty to august  and then subsequently to august  in october  the seller sold  shares of the heico class a common stock and received net proceeds of million 
based on the closing market price of heico class a common stock on october  and the value of the remaining  shares  the company would have been required to pay the seller an additional amount of approximately million in cash  which would have been recorded as a reduction of shareholders equity 
concurrent with the purchase  the company loaned the seller million  which is due august  and was secured by the  shares of heico class a common stock 
the loan is reflected as a reduction in the equity section of the company s consolidated balance sheet as a note receivable secured by class a common stock 
the million of net proceeds was used to reduce the million loan 
during fiscal and fiscal  the company acquired jetseal  inc and niacc technology  inc  respectively 
the purchase price of each acquisition was not significant to the company s consolidated financial statements 
the purchase prices of these acquisitions were paid primarily by using proceeds from the company s credit facilities 
had the fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal acquisitions been made at the beginning of their respective fiscal years  the pro forma consolidated operating results would not have been materially different from the reported results 
in october  the company entered into a strategic alliance with lufthansa technik ag lufthansa  the technical services subsidiary of lufthansa german airlines  whereby lufthansa invested approximately million in heico aerospace  including million paid at closing pursuant to a stock purchase agreement and approximately million paid to heico aerospace pursuant to a research and development cooperation agreement  which has partially funded the accelerated development of additional faa approved replacement parts for jet engines and aircraft components 
the funds received as a result of the research and development cooperation agreement reduced research and development expenses in the periods such expenses were incurred 
in addition  lufthansa and heico aerospace have agreed to cooperate regarding technical services and marketing support for jet engine and aircraft component replacement parts on a worldwide basis 
in connection with subsequent acquisitions by heico aerospace  lufthansa invested additional amounts aggregating to approximately million pursuant to its option to maintain a equity interest 
in february  the company entered into a joint venture with amr corporation amr to develop  design and sell faa approved jet engine and aircraft component replacement parts through its subsidiary  heico aerospace 
as part of the joint venture  amr will reimburse heico aerospace a portion of new product research and development costs 
the funds received as a result of the new product research and development costs paid by amr generally reduce new product research and development expenses in the period such expenses are incurred 
the balance of the development costs are incurred by the joint venture  which is owned by amr 
in addition  amr and heico aerospace have agreed to cooperate regarding technical services and marketing support on a worldwide basis 
the company s board of directors declared in december a stock dividend on both its common stock and its class a common stock payable in shares of its class a common stock 
the dividend is payable on january  to shareholders of record as of january  all common share data and per share data has been adjusted retroactively to give effect to the stock dividend 
critical accounting policies the company believes that the following are its most critical accounting policies  some of which require management to make judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized on an accrual basis  primarily upon the shipment of products and the rendering of services 
revenue from certain fixed price contracts for which costs can be dependably estimated are recognized on the percentage of completion method  measured by the percentage of costs incurred to date to estimated total costs for each contract 
variations in actual labor performance  changes to estimated profitability and final contract settlements may result in revisions to the cost estimates 
revisions in cost estimates as contracts progress have the effect of increasing or decreasing profits in the period of revision 
for contracts in which costs cannot be dependably estimated  revenue is recognized on the completed contract method 
a contract is considered complete when all costs except insignificant items have been incurred or the item has been accepted by the customer 
the aggregate effects of changes in estimates relating to inventories and or long term contracts did not have a significant impact on net income and diluted net income per share in fiscal or fiscal changes in estimates increased net income and diluted net income per share by  or 
per share in fiscal as further explained in notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
valuation of accounts receivable the valuation of accounts receivable requires that the company set up an allowance for estimated uncollectible accounts and record a corresponding charge to bad debt expense 
the company estimates uncollectible receivables based on such factors as its prior experience  its appraisal of a customer s ability to pay  and economic conditions within and outside of the aerospace  defense and electronics industries 
actual bad debt expense could differ from estimates made 
valuation of inventories portions of the inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost being determined on the first in  first out or the average cost basis 
the remaining portions of the inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  on a per contract basis  with estimated total contract costs being allocated ratably to all units 
the effects of changes in estimated total contract costs are recognized in the period determined 
losses  if any  are recognized fully when identified 
the company periodically evaluates the carrying value of inventories  giving consideration to factors such as its physical condition  sales patterns  and expected future demand and estimates a reasonable amount to be provided for slow moving  obsolete or damaged inventory 
these estimates could vary significantly  either favorably or unfavorably  from actual requirements based upon future economic conditions  customer inventory levels or competitive factors that were not foreseen or did not exist when the valuation allowances were established 
valuation of goodwill pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 the company tests goodwill for impairment annually as of october or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be fully recoverable 
the test requires the company to compare the fair value of each of its reporting units to its carrying value to determine potential impairment 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the implied fair value of that reporting unit s goodwill is to be calculated and an impairment loss shall be recognized in the amount by which the carrying value of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  if any 
the determination of fair value requires the company to make a number of estimates  assumptions and judgments 
if there is a material change in such assumptions used by the company in determining fair value or if there is a material change in the conditions or circumstances influencing fair value  the company could be required to recognize a material impairment charge 
based on the annual goodwill test for impairment as of october   the company determined there is no impairment of its goodwill 
one of the company s reporting units has experienced a decline in sales to foreign military customers over the past fiscal year 
the reporting unit is actively developing various expanded capabilities  which are expected to result in sales and earnings beginning in the later half of fiscal that the company believes will eventually more than offset the decline in foreign military sales 
the timing of such sales and earnings are primarily based upon certain regulatory and sales matters 
using management s best estimates of these assumptions  the company determined that there is no impairment of the reporting unit s goodwill as of october  should the reporting unit incur a significant delay in developing the expanded capabilities and successfully selling and marketing them  the company could be required to recognize an impairment of all or a portion of the reporting unit s goodwill  which had a carrying value of million as of october  results of operations the following table sets forth the results of the company s operations  net sales and operating income by operating segment  and the percentage of net sales represented by the respective items in the company s consolidated statements of operations

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from changes in values of financial instruments  including interest rate risk and liquidity risk 
the company engages in transactions in the normal course of business that expose it to market risks 
the primary market risk to which the company has exposure is interest rate risk  mainly related to its revolving credit facility and industrial revenue bonds  which had an aggregate outstanding balance of million at october  interest rates on the revolving credit facility borrowings are based on libor plus a variable margin  while interest rates on the industrial development revenue bonds are based on variable rates 
interest rate risk associated with the company s variable rate debt is the potential increase in interest expense from an increase in interest rates 
based on the outstanding debt balance at october   a hypothetical increase in interest rates would increase the company s interest expense by approximately  in fiscal the company maintains a portion of its cash and cash equivalents in financial instruments with original maturities of three months or less 
these financial instruments are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if interest rates increase 
due to the short duration of these financial instruments  a hypothetical increase in interest rates as of october  would not have a material effect on the company s results of operations or financial position
