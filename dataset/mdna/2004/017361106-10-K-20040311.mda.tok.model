item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive summary first quarter liquidity event  below for additional information about the new loan facilities 
exiting from western energy markets allegheny worked through to accomplish ae supply s exit from the western united states power markets 
its positions based in the western united states had been a substantial source of earnings and cash flow volatility and risk  and trading in these markets does not fit with allegheny s current strategy 
renegotiation and sale of the cdwr contract 
in june  ae supply entered into a settlement agreement with the state of california to resolve the state s litigation regarding its power supply contract with the cdwr 
the terms of the settlement reduced the volume of power to be delivered from and reduced the sale price of off peak power to be delivered from  which in turn substantially reduced the value of the contract 
on september   ae supply and its subsidiary  allegheny trading finance company  llc atf sold the cdwr contract and associated hedge transactions  to j 
aron company  a subsidiary of the goldman sachs group  inc  for million 
allegheny applied million of the sale proceeds to required payments under agreements entered into to terminate tolling agreements with williams energy marketing trading company williams and las vegas cogeneration ii  llc lv cogen  a unit of black hills corporation  as described below 
the tolling agreements involving gas fired generation controlled by williams and lv cogen were originally intended to hedge the cdwr contract and other power supply obligations then existing in allegheny s book of western transactions 
allegheny will apply an additional million of the proceeds to make required payments in march and september of under the agreement with williams 
approximately million is being held in a pledged account for the benefit of ae supply s creditors 
this arrangement was intended to enhance ae supply s ability to refinance the borrowing facilities 
approximately million of the sale proceeds were placed in escrow for the benefit of j 
aron company  pending allegheny s fulfillment of certain post closing requirements  primarily ae supply providing a performance guarantee for atf 
on march   ae supply issued this guarantee and the funds were released from escrow 
approximately million of sale proceeds was used to partially offset certain of the hedges related to the cdwr contract and to pay fees and expenses associated with the transaction 
agreements to terminate tolling agreements 
in july  ae supply entered into a conditional agreement with williams to terminate its  mw tolling agreement 
under the agreement  ae supply made an initial payment to williams of approximately million to satisfy certain amounts under a related hedge agreement 
allegheny made a million payment to williams after the completion of the sale of the cdwr contract 
allegheny committed to make two payments of million each to williams in march and september the tolling agreement will terminate when the final million payment is made  unless otherwise terminated through mutual agreement of the parties 
in mid september  ae supply terminated its mw tolling agreement with lv cogen 
allegheny made a million termination payment to lv cogen after the completion of the sale of the cdwr contract 
allegheny s remaining trading exposures in the western power market were eliminated by the end of refocusing trading activities adoption of asset based trading strategy 
ae supply has reoriented its trading operations from high volume financial trading in national markets to asset optimization and hedging within markets near its generating facilities 
exiting the western power markets  together with terminating or selling speculative trading positions in other energy markets  has enabled ae supply to reduce the volatility associated with long term trading related cash outflows and collateral obligations 
since then  ae supply has focused its efforts in pjm  the midwest  and mid atlantic markets with the primary objective of locking in cash flows associated with ae supply s portfolio of core physical generating assets and load obligations 
relocation of trading operations 
ae supply moved its energy marketing operations from new york to monroeville  pennsylvania  on may  and reduced its staff in these operations 
ongoing operating cost saving and improvement in staff integration were achieved by the relocation 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  for additional information regarding charges incurred in connection with relocating the trading operations 
asset sales in  allegheny announced that it was considering selling assets as part of an overall strategy to address its liquidity requirements 
allegheny has achieved the sale of its most significant assets with a nexus to the western united states 
allegheny continues to consider the sale of additional assets  especially non core assets  including mountaineer 
asset sales during and include the following land sales 
effective february   west penn  through its subsidiary  the west virginia power transmission company  sold  acres of land in canaan valley  west virginia  to the us fish wildlife service for million 
effective december   it also sold a  acre tract of land for million and made a charitable contribution of a acre tract in canaan valley  west virginia to canaan valley institute 
in july  the subsidiary of west penn sold approximately  acres of land in preston county  west virginia to allegheny wood products  inc  which is not affiliated with allegheny  for a net sales price of million 
fellon mccord and alliance energy services  llc 
effective december   ae sold fellon mccord  its natural gas and electricity consulting and management services firm  and alliance energy services  llc alliance energy services  a provider of natural gas supply and transportation services  to constellation energy group for approximately million 
conemaugh generating station 
on june   ae supply completed the sale of its mw share of the coal fired conemaugh generating station  located near johnstown  pennsylvania  to a subsidiary of ugi corporation  for approximately million in cash and a contingent amount of million which was received on march  after satisfaction of certain post closing obligations 
restructuring and cost reduction initiatives allegheny has taken several actions to align its operations with its strategy and reduce its cost structure 
termination of non core construction activity 
in  ae supply ceased construction and planning of various merchant generation projects to attempt to conserve cash and other resources and focus on its core generating assets 
the mw combined cycle generating plant in springdale  pennsylvania that commenced commercial operations on july  was the final sustained active new facility construction project in ae supply s pipeline 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  for additional information regarding charges incurred for the termination of generating projects 
restructuring of operations 
in july  allegheny announced a restructuring plan intended to strengthen its financial performance by  among other things  reducing its workforce 
allegheny has achieved workforce reductions of more than percent through a voluntary early retirement option ero program and selected staff reductions 
during  approximately eligible employees accepted the ero program  resulting in a charge of million  before income taxes 
in addition  allegheny recorded a charge of million  before income taxes  in relating to approximately other employees whose positions had been eliminated 
allegheny substantially completed these planned workforce reductions in suspension of dividend 
the board of directors of ae did not declare a dividend on ae s common stock for the fourth quarter of covenants contained in allegheny s financing documents  as well as regulatory limitations under puhca  are expected to preclude ae from declaring or paying cash dividends for the foreseeable future 
elimination of preemptive rights 
on march   ae s common stockholders approved an amendment to ae s articles of incorporation eliminating common stockholders preemptive rights 
the elimination of preemptive rights removed an obstacle to ae s ability to privately place equity or convertible securities 
improving internal controls and reporting comprehensive accounting review 
commencing in the third quarter of  allegheny undertook a comprehensive and extended review of its financial information and internal controls and procedures 
this review included continuous efforts by allegheny s management and directors and extensive involvement of its independent auditors and other outside professional service firms 
as previously discussed under substantial senior management changes above  allegheny also hired a new corporate controller and other accounting professionals 
allegheny continues to address its controls environment and reporting procedures and expects to be in timely compliance with new requirements relating to internal controls mandated by the sarbanes oxley act of see item a 
controls and procedures and note to ae s consolidated financial statements  for a detailed discussion 
special note regarding forward looking statements in addition to historical information  this report contains a number of forward looking statements as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of words such as anticipate  expect  project  intend  plan  believe  and words and terms of similar substance used in connection with any discussion of future plans  actions  or events identify forward looking statements 
these include statements with respect to regulation and the status of retail generation service supply competition in states served by the distribution companies  the closing of various agreements  execution of restructuring activity and liquidity enhancement plans  results of litigation  financing plans  demand for energy and the cost and availability of inputs  demand for products and services  capacity purchase commitments  plr and power supply contracts  results of operations  capital expenditures  status and condition of plants and equipment  regulatory matters  internal controls and procedures  accounting issues  and stockholder rights plan 
forward looking statements involve estimates  expectations  and projections and  as a result  are subject to risks and uncertainties 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not materially differ from expectations 
actual results have varied materially and unpredictably from past expectations 
factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include  among others  the following execution of restructuring activity and liquidity enhancement plans  complications or other factors that render it difficult or impossible to obtain necessary lender consents or regulatory authorizations on a timely basis  general economic and business conditions  changes in access to capital markets  the continuing effects of global instability  terrorism  and war  changes in industry capacity  development  and other activities by allegheny s competitors  changes in the weather and other natural phenomena  changes in technology  changes in the price of power and fuel for electric generation  the results of regulatory proceedings  including proceedings related to rates  changes in the underlying inputs  including market conditions  and assumptions used to estimate the fair values of commodity contracts  changes in laws and regulations applicable to allegheny  its markets  or its activities  environmental regulations  the loss of any significant customers and suppliers  the effect of accounting policies issued periodically by accounting standard setting bodies  additional collateral calls  and changes in business strategy  operations  or development plans 
risk factors we are subject to a variety of significant risks in addition to the matters set forth under special note regarding forward looking statements above 
risks applicable to us include risks unique to us in our current circumstances  such as the risks described under risks related to our substantial indebtedness  risks related to our liquidity position and liquidity enhancement efforts  risks related to our internal controls and procedures and refocusing our business  risks associated with regulation  risks related to legal proceedings  and risks related to trading market exposures  risks that currently face us and similarly situated companies in light of recent events and trends  such as the risks described under risks associated with environmental regulation  risks associated with regulatory transition periods  other risks associated with our business and risks related to our reliance on other companies  and risks that generally affect us and similarly situated companies  such as the risks described under risks associated with the capital intensive nature of our business 
our susceptibility to certain risks could exacerbate other risks 
these risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our risk profile 
risks related to our substantial indebtedness our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our and our subsidiaries ability to operate successfully and meet contractual obligations 
allegheny is substantially leveraged 
one of our principal challenges is to manage our indebtedness while beginning the long term process of reducing the amount of debt 
at december   our consolidated indebtedness was approximately billion 
approximately billion of that indebtedness represented obligations of ae supply and agc  and the remainder constituted indebtedness of ae or one or more of the distribution companies 
see ae s management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  for a discussion of the principal components of our indebtedness 
our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences to allegheny 
for example  it could make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness  increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic  regulatory and industry conditions  require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness  thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital  capital expenditures  and other general corporate purposes  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business  regulatory environment  and the industry in which we operate  place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt  and limit our ability to borrow additional funds 
allegheny will have substantial debt service obligations for the foreseeable future and may need to engage in successive refinancing and capital raising transactions in order to manage obligations to pay interest and retire principal 
see ae s management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital requirements  for a schedule of allegheny s contractual payment obligations 
covenants contained in our principal financing agreements restrict our operating  financing  and investing activities 
the new loan facilities  the indenture governing the notes and the indenture governing the amended a notes and the amended b notes  issued in connection with the st 
joseph generating facility collectively  the amended notes  contain restrictive covenants that limit the ability of ae and its subsidiaries and ae supply and its subsidiaries to  among other things borrow funds  incur liens and guarantee indebtedness  enter into a merger or other change of control transaction  make investments  prepay indebtedness  amend contracts  and pay dividends and other distributions on equity securities 
agc s indenture also restricts secured borrowings by agc 
ae supply has pledged its assets to secure its obligations under the new loan facilities and the a notes 
the new loan facilities and the indentures governing the amended a notes and the notes limit our ability to make strategic decisions 
covenant restrictions limit our ability to access capital markets or sell assets without using the proceeds to reduce indebtedness 
these obligations could limit our ability to make capital expenditures  both for added capacity and existing facilities 
in addition  ae and ae supply are required to meet certain financial tests under the new loan facilities  including an interest coverage ratio and a leverage ratio 
a failure by ae or ae supply to comply with the covenants contained in the new loan facilities could result in an event of default which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition 
our substantial variable rate indebtedness exposes us to interest rate risk 
allegheny s indebtedness under the new loan facilities  monongahela credit facility and certain other indebtedness accrues interest at variable rates based on prevailing interest rates 
if interest rates rise  we will be required to meet higher debt service obligations 
if our operational cash flows do not increase with interest rate increases or are otherwise insufficient to cover our interest payment obligations  we may have difficulty meeting our debt service obligations 
our liquidity position adversely affects our operations 
our lack of liquidity may make it difficult for ae supply to derive the maximum value from energy it produces in excess of its plr obligations to the distribution companies under long term power supply contracts  thereby reducing revenues realizable from operations 
in addition  our liquidity position could adversely impact our ability to fund capital expenditures to maintain or improve plant reliability and to meet environmental and other governmental mandates 
risks associated with environmental regulation our costs to comply with environmental laws are significant  and the cost of compliance with future environmental laws could adversely affect our cash flow and profitability 
our operations are subject to extensive federal  state  and local environmental statutes  rules  and regulations relating to air quality  water quality  waste management  natural resources and site remediation 
compliance with these legal requirements may require us to commit significant capital toward environmental monitoring  installation of pollution control equipment  emission fees  and permits at all of our facilities 
our liquidity position could adversely affect our ability to meet capital expenditure requirements above budgeted estimates 
these expenditures have been significant in the past and we expect that they will increase in the future 
costs of compliance with environmental regulations  particularly air emission regulations  could have a material adverse effect on our industry  our business  our results of operations  and financial condition 
this is especially true if emission limits are tightened  more extensive permitting requirements are imposed  additional substances become regulated  or the number and types of assets we operate increase 
we plan to incur substantial costs to install new emissions control equipment  and may be required to upgrade existing equipment  purchase emissions allowances  or reduce operations 
if stricter requirements are imposed or if the costs ultimately incurred exceed amounts budgeted for such expenditures  our capital resources may be significantly pressured 
our projected capital expenditures are subject to significant increase due to factors beyond our control 
most of our contracts with customers do not permit us to automatically recover additional capital and other costs incurred to comply with new environmental regulations 
as a result  to the extent these costs are incurred prior to the expiration of these contracts  these costs could adversely affect our financial performance 
future regulations may also seek to reduce greenhouse gasses or other emissions  which would significantly affect the energy industry 
our compliance strategy  although reasonably based on the information available to us today  may not successfully address the relevant standards and interpretations of the future 
as a result  we may be required to materially increase our compliance expenditures or accelerate the timing of the capital portion of those expenditures 
the status of our facilities compliance with the clean air act is subject to uncertainty due to the epa s new source review initiatives 
applicable standards under the epa s new source review nsr initiatives are in flux 
under the clean air act of clean air act  major modification of certain existing emission sources rather than performance of routine maintenance could subject our existing facilities to the far more stringent nsr standards applicable to new facilities 
the epa has taken the view that many companies  including many energy producers  have been modifying emissions sources in connection with work believed by the companies to be routine maintenance under the statute and rules regulating emissions of nitrogen oxide nox and sulfur dioxide nox from coal burning plants 
the epa has requested information from ae in connection with this nsr initiative 
the future of nsr regulation and its effect on ongoing enforcement and investigations is not clear 
a recent judicial decision involving the epa s nsr initiative and a subsidiary of firstenergy corporation could adversely affect industry wide environmental compliance costs 
a recent settlement agreement between the epa and dominion resources  inc also has adverse implications under nsr for the compliance costs of energy industry participants  including allegheny 
however  the recent preliminary judicial decision in a case involving duke energy  and the final routine maintenance  repair and replacement rmrr rule recently released by the epa  are more consistent with the energy industry s historical compliance approach 
fourteen states and various other government and private groups have filed suit challenging the issuance of the rmrr 
on december   the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit issued an order to stay the rmrr 
the rule was scheduled to go into effect on december  the stay delays implementation of the rule until the case is decided 
no assurance can be given that the rmrr will be upheld by the courts or with respect to its effect on any ongoing enforcement and investigations under the old nsr regulations as interpreted by the epa 
risks inherent in the process of obtaining required environmental approvals could adversely affect our ability to operate our facilities 
energy companies such as allegheny are subject to the risk that it may be difficult or impracticable to obtain or maintain all required environmental regulatory approvals 
if there is a delay in obtaining or renewing any required environmental regulatory approval or if we fail to obtain or comply with any such approval  the affected facilities could be temporarily closed  or otherwise subjected to capacity limitations  or subjected to additional costs 
further  at some of our older facilities  it may be uneconomical for us to install mandated equipment  which may lead us to shut down or reduce the operations at certain individual generating units  resulting in a loss of capacity and possible significant environmental and other closure costs and write downs 
if we fail to comply with environmental laws and regulations  we may have to pay significant fines or incur significant capital expenditures 
our failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations  even if caused by factors beyond our control  may result in the assessment of civil or criminal liability  fines against us  and the need to expend significant  additional capital to comply 
recent lawsuits by the epa and various states highlight the environmental risks related to generating facilities  in general  and coal fired generating facilities  in particular 
for example  the attorneys general of new york and connecticut notified us in of their intent to commence civil actions against us for alleged violations of the clean air act or clean air act amendment of caaa 
if these actions are filed and ultimately resolved against us  substantial and expensive modifications of our existing coal fired power plants would be required 
similar actions may be commenced by other governmental authorities in the future 
in addition  a number of our coal fired facilities have been the subject of a formal request for information from the epa concerning nsr requirements under the clean air act 
similar requests to other companies have often been followed by enforcement actions 
if an enforcement proceeding or litigation in connection with this request or in connection with any proceeding for non compliance with environmental laws were commenced and resolved against us  we could be required to invest significantly in new emission control equipment  accelerate the timing of capital expenditures  pay penalties  and or halt operations 
moreover  our results of operations and financial position could suffer due to the consequent distraction of management and the expense of ongoing litigation 
other parties have settled similar actions against them  often under terms requiring significant new capital expenditures for additional pollution control equipment 
we could incur additional substantial liabilities for environmental remediation 
like other companies engaged in power generation  transmission and distribution  our operations involve the handling and use of hazardous materials and the generation of large volumes of waste 
a risk of environmental contamination is inherent in many of our activities  and we could be required to investigate and remediate properties in the event of a release to the environment or the discovery of contamination 
we are subject to certain environmental laws  such as the federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla  also known as the superfund law  that can impose liability for the entire cost of cleaning up a site  regardless of fault  upon any one of a number of statutorily defined parties 
these include current and former owners or operators of a contaminated site and companies that send wastes to a site that becomes contaminated 
many of our sites have been operated for a number of years and could require investigation and remediation in the future if contamination is discovered or if operations cease at a facility 
we may undertake future asset sales 
as part of any sale  we intend to transfer future environmental liability to the new owner 
however  prospective purchasers may refuse to assume all liabilities and it is also possible that if future contamination occurs at these sites or is discovered from prior years operations  we might be required to participate in remediation efforts 
risks associated with the capital intensive nature of our business our facilities are subject to unplanned outages and significant maintenance requirements 
the operation of power generation facilities involves many risks  including the risk of breakdown or failure of equipment  fuel interruption  and performance below expected levels of output  performance or efficiency 
if our facilities operate below expectations  we may lose revenues or have increased expenses  including replacement power costs 
see allegheny s sales and revenues electric facilities  for a discussion of recent outages at our facilities at hatfield s ferry  pennsylvania and pleasants  west virginia 
many of our facilities were originally constructed many years ago 
older equipment  even if maintained in accordance with good engineering practices  may require significant capital expenditures  above budgeted amounts  to keep operating at peak efficiency or availability and is likely to require periodic upgrades and improvement 
if we underestimate required maintenance expenditures  or are unable to meet required capital expenditure levels due to liquidity constraints  we may run the risk of incurring an increased frequency of unplanned forced outages  which could ultimately lead to higher maintenance expenditures  increased operation at higher cost of previously marginal sources of in house generation  or obligate us to purchase power from third parties to meet our supply obligations 
the capital intensive nature of our business exposes us to risks from accidents  natural catastrophes and terrorism 
much of the value of our business consists of our portfolio of unique power generation and transmission and distribution assets 
our ability to conduct our operations depends on the integrity of these assets 
although we have taken and will continue to take reasonable precautions to safeguard these assets  there can be no assurance that they will not face damage or disruptions due to accidents or natural disasters 
in addition  in the current geopolitical climate  there is an enhanced concern regarding the risks of terrorism throughout the economy 
insurance coverage may not cover or may inadequately cover risks of this nature 
risks related to our liquidity position and liquidity enhancement efforts as part of our plan to improve our liquidity  we may engage in further sales of assets and businesses  however  market conditions and other factors limit the feasibility of this strategy 
we may seek to sell additional assets and businesses in order to improve our liquidity 
sale prices for energy assets and businesses have been and could remain weak due to prevailing conditions in the market for these assets and businesses 
asset sales under such conditions could result in the incurrence of substantial losses 
buyers may also find it difficult to obtain financing to purchase salable assets 
several factors specific to us have rendered asset sales particularly challenging 
we are subject to constraints under the public utility holding company act of  as amended puhca  which have imposed delays and structuring complications on asset sale transactions 
potential buyers may be reluctant to enter into agreements to purchase assets from us if they believe that required consents and approvals will result in significant delays or uncertainties in the transaction process 
further asset sale activity would expose us to attendant risks and liabilities 
risks commonly encountered in connection with asset sale activity include incorrectly valuing assets  retaining liabilities  and diverting management and other resources to asset sale transactions and away from continuing operations 
we may be unable to timely engage in desired financing transactions 
our liquidity strategy may include periodic equity and other financing transactions in order to meet amortization obligations and to increase allegheny s equity ratios 
we may be unable to successfully access the capital markets for a variety of reasons including past delays in filing audited financial statements and in satisfying other sec reporting requirements  ineligibility to use the shelf registration process  equity ratios below the minimum levels required under key puhca financing authorizations  potential concerns regarding internal controls  capital market volatility due to geopolitical and economic factors  current credit ratings below investment grade  overall financial condition  and past violations of covenants in agreements governing indebtedness 
if we are unable to access the capital markets to meet our anticipated financing needs  we will need to raise funds through a combination of additional borrowings  asset sales and operations 
no assurance can be given that we will be able to generate sufficient funds to meet our projected liquidity needs on a timely basis  acceptable terms  or at all 
ae cannot pay dividends on its common stock for the foreseeable future 
covenants contained in the agreements governing the new loan facilities  the terms of the indenture entered into in connection with the issuance of convertible trust preferred securities  and regulatory limitations under puhca will preclude ae from paying dividends on its common stock for the foreseeable future 
certain institutions and other investors may not or do not purchase non dividend paying equity securities 
we will apply significant cash in future periods to satisfy estimated pension plan liabilities 
our under funded pension liabilities have increased in recent periods due to declining interest rates and financial market performance  and because of our implementation of early retirement initiatives to reduce headcount 
as of december   our current under funded pension liability was million  and our pension liabilities may increase if our assumptions regarding investment performance or prevailing interest rates change or if actual investments underperform expectations 
we intend to apply cash in future periods to reduce our outstanding under funded pension liability  and cash so applied will be unavailable for other uses 
we are engaging in ongoing restructuring and cost saving efforts  which expose us to attendant risks 
we have undertaken various restructuring and cost saving efforts  including workforce reductions  the wind down and relocation of our energy trading operations  and the suspension and discontinuation of generating facility construction 
in july  as part of our cost saving efforts  we announced our intent to reduce our consolidated workforce by approximately percent 
as part of this initiative  we achieved workforce reductions through a voluntary early retirement option program  selected staff reductions and a staffing reduction separation program  which collectively resulted in substantial charges to earnings 
the reorganization of our energy trading division included the relocation of the trading operations and resulted in a charge to earnings related to costs associated with the relocation 
we may undertake further efforts of this nature 
in pursuing this strategy  we have incurred and could incur in the future risks commonly encountered in connection with such a strategy 
risks related to trading market exposures our credit ratings and trading market liquidity render it difficult for us to hedge our physical power supply commitments and resource requirements 
our current credit ratings  together with a lack of market liquidity  particularly in long term electricity and natural gas markets  has rendered it difficult for us to retire unnecessary energy market positions entered into in connection with our prior business model 
market liquidity has significantly declined over the past two years 
absent a return to more liquid levels combined with an improvement in our credit ratings  it may not be possible for us to retire unnecessary positions 
our credit position has also rendered it difficult for us to hedge our power supply obligations and fuel requirements 
in the absence of effective hedges for these purposes  we must satisfy power and fuel shortfalls in the spot markets  which are volatile and can be more costly than expected 
our risk management  wholesale marketing  fuel procurement and energy trading activities  including our decisions to enter into power sales or purchase agreements  rely on models that depend on judgments and assumptions regarding factors such as the future market prices and demand for electricity and other energy related commodities 
even when our policies and procedures are followed and decisions are made based on these models  there may  nevertheless  be an adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations  if the judgments and assumptions underlying those models prove to be inaccurate 
our trading portfolio exposes us to counterparty credit risks 
our ability to use hedging instruments to protect us from price and demand volatility will only be effective to the extent that we can rely on the performance of our trading counterparties 
market participant credit quality has been a pervasive concern in the energy industry for some time 
we have been and continue to be exposed to counterparties that may not be willing or able to meet their contractual obligations 
risks related to our internal controls and procedures and refocusing our business our internal controls and procedures have been substantially deficient  and we remain in the process of correcting internal control weaknesses 
in august  ae and its independent auditors recognized that the internal controls and procedures of ae and its subsidiaries had material weaknesses 
the term material weakness refers to an organization s internal control deficiency in which the design or operation of a component of internal control does not reduce to a relatively low level the risk that a material misstatement may be contained in the organization s financial statements 
these material weaknesses and related accounting errors led to delays in the production of annual financial statements for and for quarterly periods of and these delays in turn led to delays in our filing of annual and quarterly reports under the exchange act and under agreements governing our indebtedness  which resulted in technical defaults under certain debt agreements 
as of january   we are current in our exchange act reporting obligations 
we have implemented measures to improve and augment our internal controls and procedures  including enhancement of systems  processes  policies  procedures and controls 
however  certain material weaknesses remain 
our auditors have advised us of material weaknesses noted during their audit of our financial statements 
see item a 
controls and procedures 
if we cannot rectify these material weaknesses through remedial measures and improvements to our systems and procedures  management may encounter difficulties in timely assessing business performance and identifying incipient strategic and oversight issues 
in some areas  adequate automated control systems are not in place  and we therefore will need to devote personnel resources to account verification and reconciliation 
the use of temporary augmented controls and procedures and the installation of new systems have resulted in significant additional costs 
management continues to focus on remedying internal control deficiencies  with a goal of correcting them by the end of we have applied substantial resources at all relevant managerial levels toward the task of improving our internal control environment 
these efforts  in which we have involved several external professional service firms  continue 
in addition  we need to hire additional employees and train existing employees to fill positions currently serviced by external professional service firms 
we cannot provide assurances as to the timing of the completion of these efforts or estimates of the prospective costs of these efforts  either in dollar terms or in the form of management attention 
if our efforts are not successful  we could experience further reporting deficiencies and be unable to comply on a timely basis with the requirements relating to internal controls set forth in the sarbanes oxley act of refocusing our business subjects us to risks and uncertainties 
commencing in the second half of and continuing through  management reassessed our position within the energy industry  the business environment  and our relative strengths and weaknesses 
as a result of this reassessment  management implemented significant changes to our operations as management reorients allegheny to function as an integrated utility company  to the extent practicable and permissible under relevant regulatory constraints 
for example  we have reoriented our trading operations  reduced the size of our workforce  sold assets  closed our positions in western energy markets and engaged in significant financing transactions  among other changes 
in addition  substantial changes have been made to our senior management 
our circumstances in represented a substantial transformation from our historical role as a component of an integrated utility business 
current and previous changes in our business model were prompted by internal decision making and by the changing regulatory and market environments 
we continue to be in a state of transition  and additional changes to our business are being and will be considered from time to time as management seeks to carry out our new strategy 
these transitions have been  and will be  unavoidably disruptive to our established organizational culture and systems 
in addition  consideration and planning of strategic changes diverts management attention from day to day operations 
there can be no assurance that we will ultimately be successful in transitioning our business model 
risks related to legal proceedings we are involved in several important litigation proceedings that could result  individually or in the aggregate  in the imposition of significant cash awards against us 
we are involved in several suits seeking substantial damage awards against us 
among these suits are suits by california ratepayers and taxpayers  and a suit brought by merrill lynch and affiliated parties alleging breach of contract 
we are also involved in defending against claims for damages against us due to our alleged misconduct 
we may also be subject in the future to litigation based on asserted or unasserted claims 
we cannot predict the outcome of any of these proceedings or other matters  or of future litigation against us based on asserted or unasserted claims 
adverse outcomes in these proceedings and other matters  or in future litigation based on asserted or unasserted claims  could result in the imposition of substantial cash damage awards against us 
further information regarding these legal proceedings  as well as other matters  is provided under item legal proceedings 
we are involved in shareholder suits and other litigation and are a subject of agency inquiries  including in connection with our energy trading business 
in addition to litigation with merrill lynch  we are involved in other actions related to the energy trading business 
we are the target of putative class action suits by shareholders and by participants in our employee benefit plans that assert claims against us relating to our involvement in the energy trading business and to statements made by us concerning our business 
we are involved in arbitrations against terminated employees who were active in the energy trading business 
we have responded to past subpoenas from the sec and commodity futures trading commission cftc directed to us 
the sec has recently requested that ae voluntarily produce certain documents in connection with an informal investigation of ae and its subsidiaries 
many of these documents were previously provided in response to subpoenas that ae received in ae is cooperating fully with the sec 
we cannot predict the ultimate outcome or effect of these matters 
see item legal proceedings 
our subsidiaries are and may become subject to legal claims arising from the presence of asbestos or other regulated substances at certain of our facilities 
the distribution companies have been named as defendants in pending asbestos litigation involving multiple plaintiffs and multiple defendants 
in addition  asbestos and other regulated substances are still present and may in the future continue to be located at allegheny owned facilities where suitable alternative materials are not available 
we believe  however  that any remaining asbestos at any given allegheny owned facility is contained 
allegheny believes that it uses and stores all hazardous substances in a safe and lawful manner 
however  asbestos and other hazardous substances are currently used and will continue to be used at allegheny owned facilities  which could result in actions being brought against allegheny that would claim exposure to asbestos or other hazardous substances 
other risks associated with our business seasonal fluctuations pressure our facilities and operating results 
our business faces a number of risks that are common to the electric utility industry 
electrical power generation is generally a seasonal business 
demand for electricity peaks during the summer and winter months and market prices also peak during these times in our markets 
during periods of peak demand  the capacity of our generating facilities may be inadequate  which could require us to purchase power at a time when the market price for power is very high 
also  our annual results and liquidity position may depend disproportionately on our performance during the winter and summer 
energy companies are subject to adverse publicity  which may render us vulnerable to negative regulatory and litigation outcomes 
the energy sector has been the subject of recent highly publicized allegations of misconduct 
adverse publicity of this nature may render legislatures  regulatory authorities  and tribunals less likely to view energy companies such as allegheny and its affiliates in a favorable light and may cause allegheny to be susceptible to adverse outcomes with respect to decisions by such bodies 
the power outages that affected the northeast and midwest united states and canada in august could exacerbate negative sentiment regarding the energy industry 
risks associated with regulation we are regulated under puhca  which constrains our ability to engage in financing transactions and asset sales  limits subsidiary dividends  and could impede ae from providing financial support to ae supply 
ae and its subsidiaries are subject to regulation under puhca 
puhca limits the dividends that subsidiaries may pay from undistributed surplus 
in addition  puhca requires that we obtain prior approval from the sec in order to incur indebtedness or issue equity  purchase or sell utility assets  or merge or consolidate with other companies 
puhca also constrains ae s ability to make equity contributions to ae supply and enter into financing transactions for ae supply s benefit 
these constraints could impede our ability to obtain financing in a timely manner  to obtain financing on favorable terms  or to pursue other business opportunities 
puhca also limits our range of business operations and ability to affiliate with other public utilities  such as by means of merger or acquisition 
shifting federal and state regulatory policies impose risks on our operating and capital structure 
we may be subject to conflicting regulatory policies that may adversely affect our ability to participate fully in competitive power markets 
moreover  these regulatory policies are continuing to evolve as a result of various legislative and regulatory initiatives regarding deregulation  regulation  or restructuring of the energy industry  including deregulation of the production and sales of electricity 
we may also see additional regulatory action taken by state or federal regulators as a result of the august  blackout 
any such new requirements could lead to increased operating expenses and capital expenditures  which cannot be predicted at this time 
one of the most significant risks we face is choosing the correct business strategy to respond to evolving state policies regarding retail rate regulation 
compulsory continuation of retail rate caps beyond the original scheduled end of transition periods could have adverse consequences for the distribution companies 
in the absence of a long term power supply contract with a power generator  the distribution companies power requirements must be purchased at negotiated or market prices  whether from ae supply or an alternative supplier 
if retail rates are capped below the level at which power can be procured on the market  the power will be sold at a loss 
legislators  regulators and consumer and other groups have sought to extend retail rate regulation in the states in which the distribution companies do business through a variety of mechanisms  including through the extension of the current rate cap regimes 
we cannot predict to what extent these efforts will be successful 
allegheny believes that the previously approved transfer of certain generating assets to ae supply  which is a ferc regulated company  establishes significant impediments to direct state re regulation of ae supply s generation assets 
for a further discussion  see regulatory framework affecting allegheny federal regulation 
delays  discontinuations  or reversals of electricity market restructurings in the markets in which we operate  or may operate in the future  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
for example  the virginia general assembly enacted legislation in precluding incumbent electric utility companies such as potomac edison from transferring ownership or control of  or responsibility to operate  any portion of a transmission system located in virginia prior to july  the effect on potomac edison  which has already joined pjm  is unclear 
however  the legislation is expected to slow the entry of american electric power aep and dominion virginia power into pjm  which will hinder the expansion of the pjm market 
at a minimum  virginia s actions and similar actions by other states raise uncertainty concerning the continued development of competitive power markets 
given allegheny s multi state operations and asset base  re regulation of restructured obligations could prove intricate and time consuming and could lead to complications within allegheny s capital structure 
we may be unable to take advantage of important financial incentives offered by regulators 
regulatory agencies sometimes provide utilities financial incentives to engage in favored activities and transactions 
for example  the ferc recently issued a proposed policy statement to provide financial incentives to utilities for the construction of new transmission facilities or to transfer control over their transmission systems to independent entities such as rtos 
although we believe that the distribution companies decision to transfer control over their transmission systems to pjm effective april  makes them eligible for the financial incentives adopted by the ferc  we cannot predict whether they will actually receive these incentives or other incentives that may become available 
moreover  if we do receive such incentives  they may not be fully recoverable due to state retail rate freezes  or other factors 
we may realize reduced margins on our transmission operations relative to historical results due to our participation in pjm 
in order to comply with the ferc requirements designed to open access to the transmission network  we turned over functional control of our transmission facilities to pjm  via the pjm west arrangement  on april  our historical transmission margins exceeded the margins we would realize if we derived transmission facility revenue solely from the base open access tariff rates that pjm charges 
we have obtained the ferc s approval to collect a surcharge to recover the difference in the near term  but it is possible that we may not fully recover our authorized surcharges for the duration of the transition period  or after the transition period 
for a further discussion of the financial impact of our participation in pjm  see allegheny s competitive actions the delivery and services segment distribution companies participation in rtos  below 
the ferc s efforts to create and expand large regional transmission organizations provide both risks and opportunities for our business 
the ferc has strongly encouraged public utilities to join large rtos like pjm and has encouraged these entities to expand and to reduce or eliminate barriers to the trade of electricity with other rtos 
as part of this effort  the ferc has favored the elimination of charges for transmission service through  or out of  an rto 
the purpose of this policy is to promote generation competition within and between rtos in certain regions 
there can be no assurance  however  that the trend of regionalizing power distribution across larger geographic areas will continue 
there has been an ongoing debate regarding whether large rtos improve or compromise grid reliability 
the power outages that affected the northeast and midwest in august have been cited by both sides in that debate 
the continued expansion of pjm presents the distribution companies with significant risks and opportunities 
incorporating new utilities like american electric power service corporation  dayton power and light company  and commonwealth edison company together  the new pjm companies into pjm may reduce the cost of regional transmission by eliminating the need to pay transmission charges to multiple utilities 
harmonizing scheduling practices and other tariff terms and conditions will reduce or eliminate non price barriers to competition across a broader region 
these changes may benefit the distribution companies by reducing the cost of buying power to serve their customers 
on the other hand  these changes may adversely affect the distribution companies recovery of their transmission cost of service due to the loss of their proportionate share of charges to export power from pjm 
effective when they joined pjm on april   the ferc allowed the distribution companies to recover the transmission revenues they lost through a transitional surcharge 
other parties that join pjm in the future may seek to alter  reduce  or eliminate this surcharge 
if they are successful  the distribution companies may be adversely affected 
for a further discussion  see allegheny s competitive actions the delivery and services segment distribution companies participation in rtos  below 
in addition  expanding pjm may increase opportunities for ae supply to sell its output in new markets 
conversely  other generation owners may more economically compete for power sales in ae supply s traditional markets 
we are unable to predict whether we will be able to compete effectively as rtos expand and evolve 
we do not know whether markets will continue to be accessible  especially if some states choose to delay or repeal retail access programs 
it is also possible that inefficiencies may emerge as markets expand that may impair our ability to compete 
for a further discussion  see regulatory framework affecting allegheny federal legislation  competition  and rtos  below 
further  the expansion of pjm to include new companies may affect the cost of transmission service that allegheny requires in ways that are difficult to predict 
pjm uses a locational marginal pricing lmp method to price both generation and end use customer demand at a particular time and location on the electricity transmission network 
lmp recognizes that the marginal price of electricity may be different at different locations on the system and at different times 
differences in prices between two locations in the region at the same time reflect physical limitations in the transmission lines to move power across the system 
these limits are referred to as transmission congestion 
in concept  when there is enough transmission capacity to get power from the cheapest source of generation to all potential buyers on the system  there is no congestion and there would be only one price throughout the region 
when there is congestion  such as may occur on a hot summer day  the most economical generators may not be able to reach all of their potential buyers 
allegheny may incur increased costs associated with such congestion if it cannot adequately hedge this exposure under the terms of pjm s ferc approved tariff 
expanding pjm to include new utilities will bring new transmission lines and generators into the pjm region 
as a result  consumers in pjm will have access to new suppliers that may be less expensive than generators currently serving them  and transmitting power from these generators may cause power flows across the transmission system to change  which in turn could cause congestion on individual transmission lines to change potentially significantly from congestion patterns observed in the past 
allegheny may incur increased costs associated with such congestion if it cannot adequately hedge this exposure under the terms of pjm s ferc approved tariff 
risks related to our reliance on other companies ae supply relies on power transmission facilities that it does not own or control 
if these facilities do not provide ae supply with adequate transmission capacity  it may not be able to deliver wholesale electric power to its customers 
ae supply depends on power transmission and distribution facilities owned and operated by utilities and power companies to deliver its electricity output 
certain of these facilities are owned by subsidiaries of ae and others are owned by third parties 
ae supply s dependence on these facilities and the companies that own them exposes it to a variety of risks 
if transmission is disrupted or transmission capacity is inadequate  ae supply may not be able to sell and deliver all of its output 
if ae supply fails to schedule the delivery of electric energy correctly  it may face substantial penalties under the transmission provider s tariff 
if a region s power transmission infrastructure is inadequate  ae supply s recovery of costs and profits may be limited 
the ferc has proposed pricing structures to encourage the expansion of transmission infrastructure 
implementation of the proposed incentives is not assured  and no assurance can be given that the proposed incentives would serve as an adequate incentive to trigger significant investment in transmission network expansion 
if regulators adopt restrictive transmission price regulation  transmission companies may not have sufficient incentives to invest in the expansion of transmission infrastructure 
conversely  ae supply may suffer a competitive disadvantage if regulatory policies favor transmission expansion over generation expansion to alleviate grid congestion 
the power outages that occurred in the northeast and midwest united states and canada in august could lead to further regulatory or legislative initiatives at the federal or state level regarding transmission and distribution reliability and expansion 
we are unable to predict the policies that may be pursued or the effect policy changes may have on the transmission of electricity 
risks associated with competition the terms of ae supply s power sale agreements with the distribution companies could require ae supply to sell power below its costs or prevailing market prices or require the distribution companies to purchase power at a price above which they can sell power 
in connection with regulations governing the transition to market competition  west penn  monongahela with respect to its ohio customers  and potomac edison together  the plr companies are required to provide electricity at capped rates to retail customers who do not choose an alternate electricity generation supplier and to those who return to utility service from alternate suppliers 
the plr companies capped rates may be below current wholesale market prices through the transition periods 
we have structured our operations so that ae supply owns the generating assets that were previously owned by the plr companies 
the capped rates reflect the historical costs of operating and maintaining ae supply s generating assets 
the plr companies satisfy their plr obligations by sourcing power from ae supply under long term power sales agreements 
those agreements provide for the supply of a significant portion of the plr companies energy needs at the mandated capped rates with a specified remaining portion priced on the basis of market prices 
the amount of supply priced at market rates increases over each contract term 
power to be supplied by ae supply under these agreements amounts to the majority of ae supply s normal operating capacity 
for a detailed discussion of retail restructuring under state laws  see item business  fuel  power and resource supply the delivery and services segment and regulatory framework affecting allegheny state legislation and regulatory developments  below 
these power supply agreements present risks for both ae supply and the distribution companies 
at times  ae supply may not be able to earn as much as it otherwise could by selling power otherwise priced at capped rates into competitive wholesale markets 
conversely  the plr companies may at times pay market prices for a portion of their supply that exceed the amount they can charge retail customers for the power 
also  the demand for power required to meet the plr contract obligations could exceed ae supply s available generation capacity  which may require ae supply to buy power at prices that are higher than the sale price in the plr contracts 
although ae supply believes it currently owns or controls sufficient capacity to meet aggregate plr contract demand  there may intermittently occur periods of peak demand that exceed ae supply s available capacity 
these periods of peak demand often occur when the market price for power is very high 
in addition  unscheduled outages at ae supply s generating facilities  such as the current outages at the hatfield s ferry and pleasants power stations could cause a shortage of available capacity 
see item business electric facilities  for a discussion of recent outages of our facilities at hatfield s ferry  pennsylvania and pleasants  west virginia 
should ae supply s cost of generation exceed the amounts to which it is entitled under the plr contracts  for example  due to fuel price increases or increased environmental compliance costs  ae supply would have to absorb the difference 
similarly  if ae supply is required to purchase power to meet its plr obligations  it may not receive its marginal costs from the distribution companies 
even if ae supply can charge the distribution companies prices reflecting higher market prices  those companies might not be able to pass the costs on to their retail customers while state retail rate freezes remain in effect
