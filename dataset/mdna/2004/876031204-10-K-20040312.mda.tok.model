item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis provides information that management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the results of operations of napro biotherapeutics  inc you should read this discussion in conjunction with the financial statements and notes included elsewhere in this report 
certain statements set forth below constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of  referred to as the reform act 
see special note regarding forward looking statements 
general we are a pharmaceutical company focused on research and development in two distinct areas novel anti cancer products  and novel genomic technologies  primarily in the area of gene editing for applications in human therapeutics and diagnostics 
we are in the preclinical stages of developing several types of compounds that we believe have promising activity as anti cancer agents 
we believe some of these agents function by novel mechanisms  which may increase their likelihood of success as new chemotherapeutics 
we are also actively engaged in evaluating the in licensing or purchase of potential new products and or technologies  whether or not those products or technologies are derived from natural products 
our evaluation of new products and technologies may involve the examination of individual molecules  classes of compounds  or platform technologies  in both cancer and other therapeutic areas 
acquisitions of new products or technologies may involve the purchase of such products or technologies  or the acquisition of  or merger with  other companies 
on december   we sold our worldwide generic injectable paclitaxel business to mayne pharma for million in cash minus an inventory adjustment of million to reflect the company s actual inventory as of the closing 
in addition  mayne pharma assumed certain liabilities associated with our paclitaxel business 
approximately million of the proceeds of the transaction were paid to abbott to retire all outstanding debt and payables we owed to abbott 
the remaining proceeds from the sale will be used to fund the development of products based on napro s proprietary oncology and gene editing platforms and for general corporate purposes 
the assets sold to mayne pharma included our paclitaxel manufacturing assets  yew plantations  domestic and international issued and pending paclitaxel patents  a worldwide registration dossier  worldwide development and supply agreements  inventories and settlement of accounts receivable 
napro retained all of its intellectual property not used in connection with the business sold and we retained intellectual property rights to research  develop  make  use and sell products other than those associated with the generic injectable paclitaxel business 
we also retained liabilities related to our ongoing business  including those relating to our employees  our contracts and license agreements unrelated to the paclitaxel business  and certain leases and purchase orders 
in addition  we retained other liabilities related to our manufacturing and sale of paclitaxel that arose prior to the closing of the asset sale 
upon closing of the asset sale  we exited the generic paclitaxel business  terminated the development agreements with abbott and mayne pharma  and transferred our other generic paclitaxel marketing agreements to mayne pharma 
we continue to incur substantial research and development expense related to the development of anti cancer agents  and the development of novel genomic technologies 
historically  we also incurred substantial research and development expense related to the improvement of our paclitaxel yield  the reduction of our long term cost of manufacturing paclitaxel and the development of our semisynthesis process 
accordingly  we have incurred significant losses  including losses from continuing operations of million  million  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
our accumulated deficit was million as of december  we anticipate that losses may continue until such time  if ever  as we are able to generate sufficient sales to support our development operations  including the research and development activity mentioned above 
our ability to generate sufficient sales to support our operations currently depends primarily upon the successful development and commercialization of products based on our proprietary oncology and gene editing platforms 
we are developing an oncology program  consisting of both targeted as well as non targeted chemical entities for the treatment of cancer 
our gene editing platform is used to develop therapeutics which primarily addresses hereditary diseases 
currently  we are engaged in developing therapeutic programs to treat sickle cell disease and huntington s disease 
all of our products and technologies are in the early development stages and we cannot assure you that our efforts will be successful 
under the investment company act of the act  companies such as mutual funds that engage in the investment business are subject to regulation by the sec as investment companies 
the act defines an investment company to include an issuer that i is engaged or proposes to engage in the business of investing  reinvesting  owning  holding or trading in securities  and ii owns or proposes to acquire investment securities having a value exceeding of the fair value of such issuer s total assets on an unconsolidated basis exclusive of cash and cash items 
investment securities are defined generally to include all securities other than those issued by majority owned subsidiaries of the issuer 
napro does not now  nor has it ever engaged or intended to engage in an investment company business 
nevertheless  following the sale of our paclitaxel business to mayne pharma  the composition of our assets is such that it is possible that we could be deemed to be an investment company 
napro has taken the steps necessary to give itself the benefit of an exemption under the act for certain companies engaged in research and development 
research and development our current business is focused on research and development of novel anti cancer products  and novel genomic technologies  primarily in the area of gene editing for applications in human therapeutics and diagnostics 
historically  we have also engaged in research and development related to our paclitaxel business 
during the last three fiscal years  we have incurred the following expenses related to research and development projects  including process improvements in our paclitaxel business  which is included in discontinued operations in thousands oncology    genomics    discontinued operations   research and development is expected to be the most significant expense of our business 
our research and development activity is subject to change as we develop a better understanding of our projects and their prospects 
we anticipate beginning clinical testing of two oncology products during our huntington s disease program is expected to begin clinical testing during  subject to the success of our preclinical activities 
however  we cannot be sure that we will be able to achieve the expected timing of these programs 
we also cannot estimate the cost of the effort necessary to complete the programs or the timing of commencement of material net cash inflows from these programs 
continued development of these programs is dependent upon raising additional capital 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain capital on acceptable terms 
we have included a number of the risks and uncertainties associated with completing our product development plans on schedule in the special note regarding forward looking statements  below 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  research and development expense 
research and development expense for was million  a decrease of million from genomics research and development expenditures decreased million from million in to million in  while oncology research and development expenditures decreased million from million in to million in oncology research and development expenditures relating to the paclitaxel business were approximately  and million in and  respectively  and are included in discontinued operations 
the decrease was primarily due to lower outside services million  decreased staffing million  lower legal costs associated with patent development  lower supplies  and lower travel  expenses 
during  a significant portion of our research and development expenditures were related to our semi synthesis paclitaxel program and cost involved in obtaining regulatory approvals in europe 
salaries and benefits declined in due to the sale of our analytical services group to chromadex and personnel reductions in our genomics and oncology programs 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense for was million  an increase of million from approximately million of our general and administrative expense in and  in was incurred in connection with our paclitaxel business and has been included in discontinued operations 
the million increase was primarily due to higher compensation expense million  costs associated with terminating a lease in one of our corporate facilities in boulder  colorado million and higher depreciation resulting from a shortened useful life of leasehold improvements at the boulder  colorado facility in which we terminated our lease early 
higher compensation was due to executive bonuses million and increased staffing at our genomics division partially offset by lower retirement plan contributions and reduced oncology staffing 
interest income 
interest income for decreased by  from the prior year 
the decrease was attributable to lower average balances of interest bearing investments  as well as lower interest rates 
interest expense 
interest expense for was  an increase of  from the prior year 
in each of the years and  million of interest expense was attributable to the abbott debt and is included in discontinued operations 
the increase was primarily attributable to the amortization of the discount associated with the conversion feature of the million in convertible debt issued in february discontinued operations 
income from discontinued operations was million in as compared with income of million in the prior year 
product sales decreased million during primarily attributable to lower shipments to abbott 
sales to abbott for the current year were million  a decrease of million from sales to mayne pharma for the current year were million  an increase of million from the prior year 
there were no sales to tzamal for the current year compared with sales of million in the prior year 
as a result of the sale of our paclitaxel business  we anticipate having no material sales revenue in cost of sales was million in  a decrease of million as compared with the prior year 
cost of sales decreased due to a decrease in volume produced  partially offset by higher unit production cost due to idle plant costs 
license fee income was million in  a decrease of million from the decrease was attributable to our receipt of a one time milestone payment of million from abbott upon commencement of commercial sales in the united states in in  we recorded a net gain from the sale of the paclitaxel business of million 
the provision for taxes  resulting primarily from application of the alternative minimum tax  was approximately  year ended december  compared to year ended december  research and development expense 
research and development expense for was million  an increase of million from genomics research and development increased million from  while oncology research and development decreased  from the prior year 
oncology expenditures relating to the paclitaxel business were million and million in and  respectively  and are included in discontinued operations 
the increase was primarily due to increased staffing million  legal costs associated with patent development  and occupancy costs associated with development facilities 
these amounts were partially offset by a reduction in supplies expenses  as well as a one time charge for development costs  which we incurred in general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense for was million  an increase of million from the increase was primarily due to general legal expenses million and increased staffing million 
these amounts were partially offset by reductions in a number of areas  including supplies and recruiting expenses 
higher legal expenses were partially due to a reclassification of patent related legal costs from general and administrative expense to research and development expense lowering the comparative expense 
approximately  and  in and  respectively  of our general and administrative expense was incurred in connection with our paclitaxel business and has been included in discontinued operations 
interest income 
interest income for was  a decrease of  from the prior year 
the decrease was attributable to lower average balances of interest bearing investments  as well as lower interest rates 
interest expense 
interest expense for was  an increase of approximately  from the prior year

the increase was primarily attributable to the issuance of million in convertible debt during the first quarter of  including amortization of the discount attributable to the conversion feature 
discontinued operations 
income from discontinued operations was million in compared with a loss of million in this increase in income of million was due to a higher gross margin and higher license fee income 
gross margin increased to in from a negative in the prior year 
product sales increased million from the prior year 
the increase in product sales during was primarily attributable to shipments to abbott as a result of our fda approval on may  sales to abbott during were million  an increase of million from sales to mayne pharma in were million  a decrease of  from cost of sales for was million  an increase of million from this increase in cost of sales was primarily attributable to an increase in volume  which was partially offset by a decrease in unit production cost due to improved yields and increased productivity 
license fee income for was million  an increase of million from the increase was attributable to our receipt of a one time milestone payment of million from abbott upon commencement of commercial sales in the united states 
liquidity and capital resources our capital requirements for research and development have been  and will continue to be  significant 
as of december   as a result of the sale of the paclitaxel business  we had a working capital balance of million compared to a working capital balance of million at december  to date  we have funded our capital requirements primarily with the net proceeds of public offerings of common stock of approximately million  with private placements of equity securities of approximately million  with the exercise of warrants and options of million and with borrowing of million 
on december   we sold our worldwide generic injectable paclitaxel business to mayne pharma for million in cash minus an inventory adjustment of million to reflect the company s actual inventory as of the closing 
mayne pharma assumed certain liabilities associated with our paclitaxel business 
proceeds from the sale will be used to fund the development of products based on napro s proprietary oncology and gene editing platforms and for general corporate purposes 
in addition  approximately million of the proceeds was paid to abbott laboratories to retire all outstanding debt and payables we owed to abbott 
in february  we sold privately million of common stock issued at per share and million principal of five year convertible subordinated debentures convertible into common stock at per share to tl ventures v  lp and one of its affiliated funds 
no placement agent was involved in the transaction 
the net proceeds were million 
as part of this transaction  we recorded a discount attributable to the conversion feature of the convertible debentures in the amount of million  which is being amortized over the term of the debentures 
during the first quarter of  we filed a registration statement with the securities and exchange commission to register the resale of the common stock  common stock issuable upon conversion of the debentures and common stock issuable in lieu of cash interest on the debentures under the securities act of in july  the registration statement was declared effective by the sec 
napro may pay the debenture interest in cash or common stock at its option 
the debentures automatically convert into common stock if the average price for trading days exceeds per share 
if we have insufficient funds to repay the debentures in full at maturity or upon acceleration  the holders of the debentures may elect to convert the outstanding principal balance and any unpaid accrued interest on the debentures into shares of common stock at a conversion price equal to the then current day average trading price of the common stock 
the conversion price of the common stock in such a circumstance could be materially below the price at which we otherwise would be willing to issue our common stock 
issuance of common stock at such a price could result in substantial dilution to our other stockholders and could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
pursuant to the debentures  if we incur indebtedness that is senior to the debentures  other than senior indebtedness approved by a majority in interest of the debenture holders  senior indebtedness issued to equipment or real property lessors and certain other exceptions  then the holders of the debentures have the right to require us to repurchase  out of our cash and equivalents  all or part of the debentures for a purchase price equal to the unpaid principal amount of the applicable debenture plus compounded interest at per year less all interest amounts previously paid on the debenture 
in connection with a required repurchase of debentures  the excess of the repurchase price over our cash and cash equivalents will convert into shares of our common stock at the average trading price of our common stock over the preceding days 
this provision of the debentures could limit our ability to obtain senior debt financing in the future 
tl ventures funds  one of our principal institutional investors  has advised us that it believes that the completion of the sale of our paclitaxel business to mayne pharma will entitle it to have its million of company convertible subordinated debentures redeemed 
we disputed this position and engaged in discussions with tl ventures funds regarding this matter 
on september   tl ventures funds reasserted its position and informed us that  if we could not resolve this issue promptly  it intended to pursue legal remedies 
on september   we filed a complaint in a case captioned napro biotherapeutics  inc v 
tl ventures v lp and tl ventures v interfund lp  case no 
cv  district court  boulder county  colorado 
in our complaint  we seek a declaratory judgment from the court that the asset sale to mayne pharma did not permit tl ventures to have the convertible subordinated debentures redeemed 
tl ventures has filed a motion to dismiss the suit  and has filed an action in a case captioned tl ventures v lp and tl ventures v interfund lp v 
napro biotherapeutics  inc  case no 
n  delaware court of chancery  alleging that tl ventures is entitled to redeem its convertible subordinated debentures 
one of our former directors  marc ostro  is a general partner in certain of the tl ventures funds 
dr 
ostro resigned from our board of directors effective march  in december  we acquired the genomics business of pangene corporation for million in cash and assumption of debt obligations totaling approximately  the acquisition consisted primarily of patents and intellectual property relating to pangene s homologous recombination technology and gene isolation and service business  physical assets  instrumentation  software  customer relationships and third party licenses 
the purchase price was allocated to intangible assets totaling  fixed assets and software of  and other current assets of  in process research and development of  was expensed at the time of the acquisition 
we will amortize intangible assets over to years  and fixed assets and software over years 
in connection with this agreement  we acquired additional patents in january in the amount of  in december  we made a decision to sell the gene isolation and service business  and accordingly  it is being accounted for as a discontinued operation 
in november  we entered into a year gene editing technology license with the university of delaware and thomas jefferson university relating to the use of proprietary oligonucleotides dna fragments designed to precisely alter genes in humans  animals  plants  viruses and microbes 
the license provides for research and patent funding commitments and payments in common stock 
as of december   we have issued  shares of common stock under the license to the university of delaware   shares to thomas jefferson university and  shares to the samuel roberts noble foundation  inc  each of which has an ownership interest in the licensed intellectual property 
assuming we do not cancel the license  we will issue an additional  shares in  share per year increments on the license anniversaries and or in  share increments upon the achievement of certain milestone events 
we may  at our option  accelerate the issuance dates 
the license is terminable at napro s option and  if it is terminated  no further shares would be issued 
we have committed to fund at least  in research under the license during unless we terminate the license  we are also committed to funding at least  per year in research at the university of delaware during and as well 
we filed an effective shelf registration statement with the sec covering the issuance of up to million shares of our common stock and million shares of our preferred stock 
this registration statement is intended to give us the flexibility to take advantage of financing opportunities from time to time when market conditions are favorable 
we may sell the stock covered by this registration statement in one or more transactions at prices and in a manner we determine from time to time  which may result in dilution to existing shareholders 
in addition  we filed an effective registration statement with the sec covering the issuance of up to  shares of our common stock upon the conversion of our convertible subordinated debentures and in the event we elect to pay interest on the convertible subordinated debentures in shares of our common stock in lieu of cash 
we believe existing capital and the conversion of current accounts receivable  will provide adequate capital to fund our operations and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
however  pharmaceutical development is a costly and time consuming process 
we may in license or purchase new products or technologies 
the cost of acquiring and developing such resources  and related capital expenditures  may be very large 
as a result  we may seek additional capital 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such capital on terms which are acceptable to us 
working capital and cash flow as a result of the sale of the paclitaxel business  cash and cash equivalents increased million to million for the year ended december  from million at december  during  net cash provided by operating activities and by investing activities was  and million  respectively 
the cash provided by investing activities was primarily due to the sale of the paclitaxel business 
net cash used in financing activities was million related to the repayment of the abbott note which took place in conjunction with the sale of the paclitaxel business 
in connection with the sale of the paclitaxel business  all related inventories were sold with the business 
the majority of our accounts receivable were settled with the sale of the paclitaxel business as were certain liabilities 
we anticipate that the level of our accounts receivable and inventories will remain low as we do not anticipate any material sales revenue during capital expenditures we spent million during for capital projects 
approximately  of this amount related to expenditures for the paclitaxel business  which was sold 
the amount and timing of future capital expenditures will depend upon numerous factors  including the development of new products and technologies  the acquisition of new products and technologies  the cost of manufacturing resources for new products and technologies the nature of our relationship with any strategic partners that we are able to attract  the progress of our research and development programs  changes in manufacturing processes  the magnitude and scope of these activities  competing technological and marketing developments  changes in facilities  and changes in staffing levels 
we anticipate a significant reduction of capital expenditures during the primary focus of capital spending during is expected to be in our research and development areas 
we may seek additional long term financing to fund capital expenditures 
we cannot assure that we will be able to obtain such financing on terms which are acceptable to us 
net operating loss carryforwards as of december   we had approximately million of net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income 
tax law provides limits on the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards if there has been a change of ownership as described in section of the internal revenue code 
such a change of ownership may limit our utilization of our net operating loss carryforwards  and could be triggered by sales of securities by us or our stockholders 
business development activities in the normal course of our business  we investigate  evaluate  and discuss licensing relationships  acquisitions  and other business combination opportunities in the pharmaceutical and genomics businesses 
in the event we enter into any such relationships or transactions  we may consider using available cash  issuing equity securities or increasing our debt 
such transactions could materially affect our capital structure 
critical accounting policies we have identified certain accounting policies as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
however  the majority of these policies may not be applicable to us in as a result of the sale of the paclitaxel business 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout this item where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
use of estimates policy the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
long lived assets policy in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets  we review the carrying amount of long lived assets when facts and circumstances suggest they may be impaired 
if this review indicates long lived assets will not be recoverable as determined based on the undiscounted cash flow estimated to be generated by these assets  we reduce the carrying amount of these long lived assets to estimated fair value or discounted cash flow  as appropriate 
future contractual obligations the table below summarizes our future contractual obligations in thousands total less than year years years after years notes payable convertible debentures   operating leases  total   special note regarding forward looking statements the statements in this report that are not historical facts are forward looking statements that represent management s beliefs and assumptions as of the date of this report  based on currently available information 
forward looking statements can be identified by the use of words such as believe  intend  estimate  may  will  should  anticipated  expected  trusts or comparable terminology or by discussions of strategy 
such forward looking statements may include  among others statements concerning our plans  objectives and future economic prospects  such as matters relative to developing new products  the availability of patent and other protection for our intellectual property  the completion of preclinical studies  clinical trials and regulatory filings  the prospects for  and timing of  regulatory approvals  the need and plans for  and availability of  additional capital  the amount and timing of capital expenditures  the timing of product introductions and sales  the availability of raw materials  the ability to outsource activities  the future acquisition of products or business entities  prospects for future operations  and other statements of expectations  beliefs  future plans and strategies  anticipated events or trends and similar expressions concerning matters that are not historical facts 
although we believe that the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are reasonable  we cannot assure you that these expectations will prove to be correct 
such forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors  which may cause our actual results  performance or achievements  or industry results  to be materially different from any future results  performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
such factors include  among other things  the following risks related to research and development our product candidates and technologies are in an early state of development and there is a high risk that they may never be commercialized either because of the costs of continuing development or because our research and development fails to produce any products of value 
our efforts in researching and developing a broad range of new potential products and technologies could adversely affect our financial position 
our potential products and technologies must undergo rigorous clinical testing and regulatory approvals  which could substantially delay or prevent us from marketing any products 
our oncology and gene editing technologies are still new and developing  very little data exists and new information may arise which may cause us delays in designing our protocols  submitting applications that satisfy all necessary regulatory review requirements  and ultimately initiating and completing the clinical trials of our products 
we may be required to obtain rights to proprietary technologies to further develop our business  which may not be available or may be costly 
adverse events in the field of targeted oncology and gene editing may negatively impact regulatory approval or public perception of our potential products and technologies resulting in decreased demand 
our ability to maintain our licenses is dependent on our ultimate success in our development programs 
we may be unable to attract and retain the qualified employees we need to be successful 
testing of our potential products and technologies relies heavily on the voluntary participation of both study centers and patients in our clinical trials  which is not within our control  and could substantially delay or prevent us from completing development of such products and technologies 
our operations may be impaired unless we can successfully manage our growth 
if we acquire any other products or business operations  we will incur a variety of costs  and we may never realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition 
we may not be successful in obtaining required foreign regulatory approvals  which would prevent us from marketing our products internationally 
we rely on third parties to perform certain services for us and any interruption or termination of these arrangements may adversely affect our business 
our use of hazardous materials exposes us to the risk of material environmental liabilities  and we may incur substantial additional costs to comply with environmental laws in connection with the operation of our research and manufacturing facilities 
risks related to the pharmaceutical business we may develop in the future acceptance of our products in the marketplace is uncertain  and failure to achieve market acceptance will limit our ability to generate revenue and become profitable 
we expect that we will face significant competition  which could limit our ability to become profitable 
technological change may make any products and technologies we develop less attractive or obsolete 
if we are unable or fail to adequately protect our proprietary technologies  third parties may be able to use our technology  which could impair our ability to commercialize our products  and to compete in the marketplace 
litigation or third party claims of intellectual property infringement could require us to spend substantial time and money and adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize future products 
we have no experience in manufacturing our potential therapeutic products  and no manufacturing facilities  which raises uncertainty about our ability to manufacture our potential therapeutic products cost effectively 
we have no experience in marketing or selling our potential therapeutic products and technologies  which raises uncertainty about our ability to commercialize our potential therapeutic products cost effectively 
we may be required to rely on strategic partners for the development  marketing and manufacturing of future products and technologies which may delay or impair our ability to generate significant revenue and may otherwise adversely affect our profitability 
in the event we receive regulatory approval for our product candidates  we will be subject to ongoing regulatory obligations 
legislative and regulatory proposals to reduce the cost of health care could adversely affect our business 
if product liability lawsuits are successfully brought against us  we may incur substantial liabilities and may be required to limit commercialization of our product candidates 
we may be unable to effectively price our products or obtain adequate reimbursement for sales of our products  which would prevent our products from becoming profitable 
risks related to financing our operations we have a history of net losses 
we expect to continue to incur net losses  and we may not achieve or maintain profitability 
if we fail to obtain the capital necessary to fund our operations when needed  we may be forced to reduce or discontinue our operations 
the outcome of our dispute with tl ventures funds regarding redemption of their debentures could reduce our available cash 
the recent sale of our paclitaxel business adversely affects our ability to achieve profitability 
risks related to our status as a public company our stock price may be volatile  and your investment in our stock could decline in value 
future sales and issuances of common stock may dilute our stockholders or cause our stock price to fall 
if we fail to continue to meet all applicable nasdaq smallcap requirements and nasdaq determines to delist our common stock  the delisting could adversely affect the market liquidity of our common stock and the market price of our common stock could decrease 
we have implemented anti takeover provisions that may reduce the market price of our common stock 
other risks related to our business the loss of our chairman and chief executive officer  leonard p 
shaykin or other key executives  could severely harm our business 
we may be unable to renew or extend the leases on our leased facilities 
these and other factors related to the company s business are described in more detail under the caption risk factors or special note regarding forward looking statements in the company s documents filed from time to time with the securities and exchange commission including the company s current report on form k  as amended  filed february  should one or more of these risks materialize or the consequences of such a development worsen  or should the underlying assumptions prove incorrect  actual results could differ materially from those forecasted or expected 
we undertake no obligation to update any of the forward looking statements after the date of this annual report on form k to conform such statements to actual results  except to the extent required by law 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk during and  we sold a significant amount of paclitaxel to mayne pharma 
under the mayne pharma agreement  mayne pharma paid us a fixed percentage of their sales price for paclitaxel 
each year  mayne pharma estimated the sales price it expected to receive in the upcoming year  and  based upon that estimate  we determined the price we would charge mayne pharma 
we recognized the corresponding sales at the time of shipment 
however  mayne pharma s actual selling price differed from that estimated 
pursuant to the agreement  mayne pharma provided us with their calculation of the actual sales price for sales made during the preceding year  and an adjustment was calculated that increased or decreased our sales of products to mayne pharma during that year 
mayne pharma s sales were made in the currencies of each of the countries in which it sold paclitaxel 
as a result  our sales were affected by fluctuations in the value of these various foreign currencies relative to the us dollar 
in the past  currency fluctuations were a significant factor in reductions in the price we charged mayne pharma
