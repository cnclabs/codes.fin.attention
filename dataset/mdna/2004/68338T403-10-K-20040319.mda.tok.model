critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of commitments and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ significantly from our estimates 
in addition  any significant unanticipated changes in any of our assumptions could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
we believe the following are our most critical accounting policies and estimates 
revenue recognition subscription revenues are generally prepaid at the beginning of the subscription term and we offer annual  quarterly and monthly payment options 
the subscription fee is recognized ratably over the term of the subscription 
we added the quarterly payment option in august and in october we discontinued our 
table of contents monthly payment option  however  we will continue to renew and service our existing monthly subscribers 
unearned revenue at december  consists of payments received for prepaid annual and quarterly subscriptions whose terms extend into prior to the closure of our business to business bb website  we also generated revenue from the sale of computer and office products 
product revenue was recognized upon receipt of product by the customer  including any shipping and handling billed to the customer 
we acted as principal in those transactions because orders were initiated directly on our website  we took title to the goods during shipment  and had economic risk related to collection  customer service and returns 
in conjunction with the product outsourcing agreement effective january   these risks were transferred to firstsource corp 
firstsource 
we closed the bb website later in revenues from licensing technology  exchange services and advertising were recognized when the transaction occurred  ratably over the duration of the placement  or over the term of the agreement  as appropriate 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required  and our ability to recognize sales to certain customers may be affected 
lease obligations in conjunction with the closure of our canadian operations and bb exchange and the elimination of our outside sales force  we recorded a charge during to accrue rental payments on our idle office space leases  and in we recorded an additional net reserve of million due to the continued weakness in the seattle real estate market 
on november  we reached an agreement to sublease approximately  square feet in a former corporate facility in seattle  washington 
the sublease runs through the end of our contractual obligation on the space in august the cumulative value to onvia over the term of the sublease is approximately million 
the rental rates in the sublease are below our contractually obligated rental rates  and the shortfall has been included in our idle lease accrual 
per the terms of the sublease  we established a letter of credit in the amount of approximately  which is included in other assets at december  on october  we signed an agreement with our landlord to remove from our lease obligation  square feet of our approximately  square feet of idle office space in bellevue  washington beginning august  this office space was acquired via our globe acquisition  and the lease expires in march on february  we reached an agreement to sublease the remaining  square feet in the bellevue office 
the sublease runs through the end of our contractual obligation on the space 
the cumulative value to onvia over the term of the sublease is approximately  the rental rates in the sublease are below our contractually obligated rental rates  and the shortfall has been included in our idle lease accrual 
although we were able to sublease the idle space in our former corporate headquarters  we have not seen as much interest as we had hoped for the idle space in our current building 
the commercial real estate market in seattle for space of our size continues to show weakness  therefore  we have come to the determination that it is not probable that we will be able to sublease this space by mid as we had previously estimated 
based on our most recent analysis  we now believe that it will take until the end of to find suitable tenants to sublease this space 
as a result  we recorded an additional reserve in the fourth quarter of of approximately million 
we anticipate that this additional accrual will cover our remaining contractual obligations  assuming that we will have the space sublet by the end of at estimated current market rates  which are below our contractually obligated rates  through the remainder of the lease obligations 

table of contents we currently have approximately  square feet of idle office space in the seattle area 
at december   the total accrual related to future lease payments and estimated broker fees on our idle and sublet office space was million

we currently plan to fund our operations with our existing cash and cash equivalents and from revenues generated from future operations  which we believe will be sufficient to satisfy our cash requirements under existing operating plans for the foreseeable future 
however  if we engage in merger or acquisition transactions or our overall operating plans change  we may require additional equity or debt financing to meet future working capital needs  which may have a dilutive effect on existing stockholders or may include securities that have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of the rights of our common stock 
we cannot make assurances that if additional financing is required  it will be available  or that such financing can be obtained on satisfactory terms 
per the terms of the original broadview agreement  which was terminated in february  certain business combinations  including a transaction which results in a change in control of either the acquired or acquiring company or a sale of all or substantially all of the company s assets with certain named parties within one year of the termination date would result in a completion fee of  becoming due to broadview

the distribution in the amount of million was paid on may  at december  there were  outstanding warrants for the purchase of common stock that would be eligible to receive the cash distribution if the warrants are exercised in the future 
the maximum future distribution upon exercise of these warrants is approximately  the weighted average exercise price of these warrants as of december  was

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates and equity prices 
interest rate risk we have assessed our susceptibility to certain market risks  including interest rate risk associated with financial instruments 
historically  our interest expense was not sensitive to the general level of us interest rates because all of our debt arrangements  which were paid in full as of december   were based on fixed interest rates 
we manage our interest rate risk by purchasing investment grade securities and diversifying our investment portfolio among issuers and maturities 
due to the short term nature of these investments and our investment policies  we have determined that the risk associated with interest rate fluctuations related to our investment portfolio is immaterial 
our investment portfolio consists of money market funds  commercial paper  municipal securities and corporate debt securities with maturities of thirteen months or less 
our primary investment objectives are preservation of principal  a high degree of liquidity and a maximum total return consistent with the investment objectives 
we invest primarily in us denominated only commercial paper issued by us corporations  direct obligations of the us government  municipal securities  auction rate securities issued by us financial institutions  bankers acceptances and or certificates of deposit  and money market funds fully invested in direct obligations of the us government 
us government and agency securities and money market funds investing in them are exempt from size limitations  all other securities are limited to of the portfolio at the time of purchase  per issuer 
in addition  the cumulative investments in an individual corporation  financial institution or financial institution s security are limited to million 
as of december   we consider the reported amounts of these investments to be reasonable approximations of their fair values 
foreign currency risk we expect our foreign currency risk exposure to be insignificant  since we disposed of our canadian operations in march equity price risk we do not own any significant equity instruments  therefore  we expect our equity price risk to be insignificant
