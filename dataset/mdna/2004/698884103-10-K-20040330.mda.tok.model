diluted net income per share  compared to net income of  and 
per diluted share for product revenues from the company s restaurant segment were million for the year ended december   an increase of from the million recorded in the primary reason for this increase was a or million growth in sales to yum brands  as a result of the company being recently selected as this customer s primary supplier of restaurant systems to kfc corporate stores 
yum brands includes five major restaurant chains 
sales to other major accounts including chick fil a  cke and loew s cineplex increased or million reflecting an improving hospitality market 
partially offsetting these increases was an or million decline in sales to mcdonald s due to delays in buying decisions experienced in the first half of as mcdonald s transitioned to a new strategy under its new management team 
the company anticipates growth in this account in customer service revenues are also generated by the company s restaurant segment 
the company s service offerings include installation  training  twenty four hour help desk support and various field and on site service options 
customer service revenues were million for the year ended december   an increase of from million in this increase was primarily due to a or  increase in call center revenue as the number of contracts increased relating to the growth in customer base 
all other service areas increased or  due to general business growth 
contract revenues from the company s government segment were million for the year ended december   an increase of when compared to the million recorded in the same period in this increase primarily resulted from a million or increase in information technology outsourcing revenue for contracts for facility operations at strategic us department of defense telecommunication sites across the globe 
these outsourcing operations provided by the company directly support us navy  army and air force operations as they seek to convert their military information technology communications facilities into contractor run operations 
also contributing to this growth was a million or increase in revenue from research contracts involving imagery information technology 
this was partially offset by a million or a decline in the company s logistic management program  due to reduced funding from the government 
this program involves the tracking of mobile chassis under the company s cargo mate tm contracts 
the company anticipates new funding for this project from the government in product margins for the year ended december  were  an increase from for the year ended december  in  margins benefited from higher software content in product sales when compared to software sales of the company s infusion and exalt products both contributed to this increase 
this was offset by lower absorption of fixed manufacturing costs due to reduced production volume experienced in the first half of customer service margins were for the year ended december  compared to for the same period in the decline is primarily the result of increased employee benefit costs and an increase in the provision for excess and obsolete service inventory in when compared to the increase in benefit costs relates primarily to the company s contribution to the defined profit sharing retirement plan and higher performance bonuses based on improved overall company results 
the increased inventory provision was necessary due to a voluntary termination of an unprofitable service contract 
this action is expected to improve service margins in the future 
contract margins were for the year ended december  versus for in  the company recognized additional profit on certain fixed price contracts that were completed in the period 
the company s fixed price contracts generally span multiple years  sometimes extending for as long as four to five years 
the company sometimes recognizes an additional profit on these fixed price contracts as the contracts near completion  when the company determines that its contract expenditures will be less than it had previously estimated 
in  the primary reason for cost under runs was lower than anticipated overhead rates 
in this instance  during  the company won several new contracts that resulted in an increase in the base of direct labor and a corresponding decline in the company s overhead rates 
the significant components of contract costs in were for labor and fringe benefits  for materials and supplies  and for subcontract costs 
for the same period in  these costs were   and  respectively of contract costs 
the balance of contract costs for and included consulting  facilities  communications and corporate overhead costs 
margins on the company s government contract business historically run between and 
selling  general and administrative expenses are virtually all related to the company s restaurant segment 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million  a decline of from the million expended in the decline was due to a reduction in selling expenses as a result of improved efficiencies and a reduced provision for doubtful accounts 
this was partially offset by increases in benefit costs and legal and accounting fees 
research and development expenses relate primarily to the company s restaurant segment 
however in  approximately of these expenses related to the company s logistic management program cargo mate tm 
research and development expenses were million for the year ended december   a decline of from the million recorded in this decline was primarily due to a small reduction in the development staff as a result of certain efficiency improvements 
this was partially offset by the company s investment in its cargo mate tm program 
the company is investing in this technology during a temporary funding hiatus from the us government

the variance from the federal statutory rate in was due to the extraterritorial income exclusion and the favorable resolution of certain tax matters with taxing authorities 
these items were offset by a  valuation allowance recorded in against certain foreign tax credits  due to the fact that the company anticipated that these foreign tax credits would expire prior to utilization 
for the year ended december   the company recorded an after tax loss of  compared to million in from the discontinued operation of its industrial segment 
in the company determined that they would not be able to sub lease the industrial business real estate operating leases and accordingly recorded a provision of  in  the company decided to close down its unprofitable industrial business unit  ausable solutions  inc  due to substantial continuing losses  an inability to penetrate the market and a long sales cycle 
the overall downturn in the global economy and specifically in the manufacturing and warehousing industries  coupled with the diminishing capital expenditures of the company s industrial customers  prevented the company from being profitable in this particular business segment 
as a result  the company concluded that it would be prudent to take decisive action and return the company s focus to its core businesses of hospitality technology and government services and research and development 
the company believes that the decision to exit the industrial segment will not have a negative impact on the company s continuing operations 
the company notes that its industrial business did not have common customers with its restaurant or government contract businesses 
results of operations compared to the company reported revenues from continuing operations of million for the year ended december   an increase of from the million reported in income from continuing operations was million in  a increase over the million earned in the company reported diluted net income per share from continuing operations of

sales to yum brands increased or million while mcdonald s sales increased or million 
also contributing to the revenue growth was an increase of or million in sales to several other new and existing accounts 
these accounts include carnival cruise lines  rare hospitality  cke restaurants and the pantry  inc these increased sales were due to several factors including the market demand for the company s newest product  the posxp tm  and customers requirements to replace or upgrade older systems at existing restaurants 
this increase was partially offset by a or million decline in sales to boston market 
the company acquired this account and completed the delivery of the customer s initial requirements in customer service revenues are also generated by the company s restaurant segment 
the company s service offerings include installation  training  twenty four hour help desk support and various field and on site service options 
customer service revenues were million in  an increase of from the million in the growth was due to a or million increase in installation revenue in this was the result of increased product sales during the year 
all other service areas accounted for the remaining increase 
contract revenues from the company s government segment were million in  an increase of when compared to the million recorded in the company received over million in new awards in more specifically  this increase resulted from a or million growth in the company s i t outsourcing contracts for facility operations at strategic us department of defense telecommunication sites across the globe

the company has become a recognized leader in the conversion of military i t communications facilities to contractor operations 
also contributing to the growth was a or  increase in a floodplain mapping contract with the new york state department of environment conservation 
additionally  contract revenues under the company s cargo mate tm contract grew or  in compared to product margins were for compared to in the product mix change as a result of the revenue growth discussed above had a small positive impact on margins 
however  this was offset by an increase in the provision for excess and obsolete inventory in when compared to this was primarily a result of a decline in the forecasted usage of certain inventory components as the company recently introduced newer products 
customer service margins were in compared to in this margin decline was the result of an investment by the company to increase the number of field service personnel in the first half of the year in order to support the installation and field service requirements of the boston market account which was acquired by the company in contract margins were in versus in this decline was due to slightly lower profit margins on certain fixed price contracts in when compared to margins in and were higher than anticipated due to additional profit recognized upon completion of certain contracts 
the company s fixed price contracts generally span multiple years  sometimes extending for as long as four to five years 
the company sometimes recognizes an additional profit on these fixed price contracts as the company nears completion of the contract when the company determines that its contract expenditures will be less than it had previously estimated 
in and  the primary reason for cost underruns was lower than anticipated overhead rates 
margins on the company s government contract business historically run between and 
for the year ended december   the significant components of contract costs were for labor and fringe benefits  for supplies  and for subcontract 
for  these costs were  and  respectively of contract costs 
the balance of contract costs for and included consulting  facilities  communications and corporate overhead costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses are virtually all related to the company s restaurant segment 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million in versus million in  an increase of 
this occurred primarily in sales and marketing expenses and is directly related to the growth in product revenue 
the company increased its worldwide sales force  increased related travel expenses and incurred general inflationary increases in wages and benefits 
research and development expenses are primarily from the company s restaurant segment 
research and development expenses were million in  a decrease of from the million recorded for the same period in this minor decrease was due to the completion of certain development projects in research and development costs attributable to government contracts are included in cost of contract revenues 
other income  net  was  in and includes rental income and foreign currency gains and losses 
there were no significant variations in compared to interest expense represents interest charged on the company s short term borrowing requirements from banks and from long term debt 
interest expense declined to  in primarily due to lower interest rates in compared to in  the company s effective tax rate was  compared to in the variance from the federal statutory rate was due to the extraterritorial income exclusion and the favorable resolution of certain tax matters with taxing authorities 
these items were partially offset by a  valuation allowance against certain foreign tax credits  due to the fact that the company anticipates these foreign tax credits would expire prior to utilization 
during  the company recorded an after tax loss of million or 
loss per diluted share resulting from the discontinuance of its industrial segment 
the company s decision to close down its unprofitable industrial business unit  ausable solutions  inc  followed a trend of continuous losses over the past three years  which resulted from an economic downturn in the it software market with corresponding delays of anticipated contracts 
this decision will allow the company to focus on its two core businesses  restaurant and government  which are both growing and profitable 
liquidity and capital resources the company s primary source of liquidity has been cash flow from operations and lines of credit with various banks 
cash provided by continuing operations was million in compared to million in in  cash flow was generated primarily by operating profits 
this was partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable due to the revenue growth experienced in the fourth quarter of in  cash flow benefited from the operating profits for the period and a reduction in accounts receivable 
the company was able to improve its ability to collect trade receivables by adding staff and by implementing more stringent collection procedures 
this was partially offset by an increase in customer service inventory requirements to support the company s current product line and expanded customer base 
in addition  there was an increase in finished goods inventory in anticipation of certain customer orders that were not delivered until the first quarter of cash used in investing activities was million for versus million for in  capital expenditures were  and were primarily for internal use software and upgrades to the company s customer service facility 
capitalized software costs relating to software development of restaurant products were  in for  capital expenditures were  and were primarily for the restaurant segment  including internal use software and a phone system upgrade and for improvements to the company s headquarters facility 
capitalized software costs were  in cash used in financing activities was million in and million in during  the company reduced its short term bank borrowings by million and received  from the exercise of employee stock options 
in  the company reduced its short term bank borrowings by million  and received  from the exercise of employee stock options 
the company also raised million on the sale of treasury stock in the company evaluates market conditions on an ongoing basis and may elect to repurchase shares of its common stock at times when the prevailing market conditions provide an opportunity for the company to buy back its stock at a discounted rate as compared to book value 
the company has an aggregate of  in bank lines of credit 
one line totaling  bears interest at the prime rate at december  and is subject to loan covenants 
these covenants include a debt to tangible net worth ratio of to  working capital of at least million  and a debt coverage ratio of to the availability of this facility is determined based on the amount of certain receivables and inventory 
specifically  the total amount of credit available under this facility at a given time is based on a of the company s accounts receivable under days outstanding attributable to the company s restaurant segment and of the company s inventory  excluding work in progress 
this line expires on april  the remaining line of  allows the company  at its option  to borrow funds at the libor rate plus the applicable interest rate spread at december  or at the bank s prime lending rate 
this facility contains certain loan covenants including a leverage ratio of not greater than to and a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than to this line expires on october  both lines are collateralized by certain accounts receivable and inventory 
the company was in compliance with all loan covenants as of december  at december   an aggregate of  was outstanding and an aggregate of  was available under these lines 
the company s has a million mortgage loan on certain real estate 
the company s future principal payments under this mortgage are as follows in s thereafter  the company s future minimum obligations under non cancelable operating leases are as follows in s thereafter over the next twelve months  the company anticipates that its capital requirements will be less than million 
the company does not usually enter into long term contracts with its major restaurant customers 
the company commits to purchasing inventory from its suppliers based on a combination of internal forecasts and the actual orders from customers 
this process  along with good relations with suppliers  minimizes the working capital investment required by the company 
while the company lists two major customers  mcdonald s and yum brands  it sells to hundreds of individual franchisees of these corporations  each of which is individually responsible for its own debts 
these broadly made sales substantially reduce the impact on the company s liquidity if one individual franchisee reduces the volume of its purchases from the company in a given year 
the company  based on internal forecasts  believes its existing cash  line of credit facilities and its anticipated operating cash flow will be sufficient to meet its cash requirements through at least the next twelve months 
however  the company may be required  or could elect  to seek additional funding prior to that time 
the company s future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including its rate of revenue growth  the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts  expansion of sales and marketing  the timing of introductions of new products and enhancements to existing products  and market acceptance of its products 
the company cannot assure that additional equity or debt financing will be available on acceptable terms or at all 
the company s sources of liquidity beyond twelve months  in management s opinion  will be its cash balances on hand at that time  funds provided by operations and whatever long term credit facilities it can arrange 
critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements are based on the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
gaap requires the use of estimates  assumptions  judgments and subjective interpretations of accounting principles that have an impact on the assets  liabilities  revenue and expense amounts reported 
the company believes its use of estimates and underlying accounting assumptions adhere to gaap and are consistently applied 
valuations based on estimates are reviewed for reasonableness and adequacy on a consistent basis throughout the company 
primary areas where financial information of the company is subject to the use of estimates  assumptions and the application of judgment include revenues  accounts receivable  inventories  intangible assets and taxes 
revenue recognition policy the company recognizes revenue generated by the restaurant segment using the guidance from sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition and the aicpa statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  and other applicable revenue recognition guidance and interpretations 
product revenue in the restaurant segment is generated from sales of the company s standard point of sale systems 
when the company installs its restaurant systems which primarily includes hardware or hardware and software on behalf of its customers  the company recognizes revenue from the sale of its restaurant systems upon delivery to the customer s site 
for restaurant systems that are self installed by the customer or an unrelated third party and for component sales or supplies  the company recognizes revenue at the time of shipment 
in addition to product sales  the company may provide installation and training services  and also offers maintenance contracts to its customers 
installation and training service revenues are recognized as the services are performed 
the company s other service revenues in the restaurant segment  consisting of support  field and depot repair  are provided to customers either on a time and materials basis or under its maintenance contracts 
services provided on a time and materials basis are recognized as the services are performed 
service revenues from maintenance contracts are deferred when billed and recognized ratably over the related contract period 
the company recognizes revenue in its government segment using the guidance from sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition 
the company s contract revenues generated by the government segment result primarily from contract services performed for the united states government under a variety of costs plus fee  time and material and fixed price contracts 
revenue on cost plus fixed fee contracts is recognized based on allowable costs for labor hours delivered  as well as other allowable costs plus the applicable fee 
revenue on time and material contracts is recognized by multiplying the number of direct labor hours delivered in the performance of the contract by the contract billing rates and adding other direct costs as incurred 
revenue for fixed price contracts is recognized primarily on a straight line basis over the life of the fixed price contract 
the company s obligation under these contracts is simply to provide labor hours to conduct research or to staff facilities with no other deliverables or performance obligations 
anticipated losses on all contracts are recorded in full when identified 
unbilled accounts receivable are stated in the company s financial statements at their estimated realizable value 
contract costs  including indirect expenses  are subject to audit and adjustment through negotiations between the company and government representatives 
accounts receivable allowances for doubtful accounts are based on estimates of probable losses related to accounts receivable balances 
the establishment of allowances requires the use of judgment and assumptions regarding probable losses on receivable balances 
inventories the company s inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
the company uses certain estimates and judgments and considers several factors including product demand and changes in technology to provide for excess and obsolescence reserves to properly value inventory 
capitalized software development costs the company capitalizes certain costs related to the development of computer software used in its restaurant products segment under the requirements of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed 
software development costs incurred prior to establishing technological feasibility are charged to operations and included in research and development costs 
software development costs incurred after establishing feasibility are capitalized and amortized on a product by product basis when the product is available for general release to customers 
goodwill in july  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  sfas 
the company adopted sfas effective january  under this standard  amortization of goodwill and certain intangible assets  including certain intangible assets recorded as a result of past business combinations  was discontinued upon the adoption of sfas instead  all goodwill is tested for impairment annually  or more frequently if circumstances indicate potential impairment  through a comparison of fair value to its carrying amount 
the company has elected to annually test for impairment at december there was no impairment of goodwill in or taxes the company has significant amounts of deferred tax assets that are reviewed for recoverability and valued accordingly 
these assets are evaluated by using estimates of future taxable income streams and the impact of tax planning strategies 
valuations related to tax accruals and assets can be impacted by changes to tax codes  changes in statutory tax rates and the company s estimates of its future taxable income levels 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk a decline in the volume of purchases made by any one of the company s major customers would materially adversely affect our business 
a small number of customers has historically accounted for a majority of our net revenues in any given fiscal period 
for the fiscal years ended december   and  aggregate sales to our top two restaurant segment customers  mcdonald s and yum brands  amounted to  and  respectively  of total revenues 
most customers are not obligated to make any minimum level of future purchases from us or to provide us with binding forecasts of product purchases for any future period 
in addition  major customers may elect to delay or otherwise change the timing of orders in a manner that could adversely affect quarterly and annual results of operations 
there can be no assurance that our current customers will continue to place orders with us  or that we will be able to obtain orders from new customers 
an inability to produce new products that keep pace with technological developments and changing market conditions could result in a loss of market share 
the products we sell are subject to rapid and continual technological change 
the products that are available from our competitors have increasingly offered a wider range of features and capabilities 
we believe that in order to compete effectively we must provide compatible systems incorporating new technologies at competitive prices 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue funding research and development at levels sufficient to enhance our current product offerings  or that the company will be able to develop and introduce on a timely basis new products that keep pace with technological developments and emerging industry standards and address the evolving needs of customers 
there can also be no assurance that we will not experience difficulties that will result in delaying or preventing the successful development  introduction and marketing of new products in our existing markets  or that our new products and product enhancements will adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace or achieve any significant degree of market acceptance 
likewise  there can be no assurance as to the acceptance of our products in new markets  nor can there be any assurance as to the success of our penetration of these markets  or to the revenue or profit margins with respect to these products 
if any of our competitors were to introduce superior software products at competitive prices  or if our software products no longer met the needs of the marketplace due to technological developments and emerging industry standards  our software products may no longer retain any significant market share 
if this were to occur  we could be required to record a charge against capitalized software costs  which amount to million as of december  we generate much of our revenue from the quick service restaurant industry and therefore are subject to decreased revenues in the event of a downturn either in that industry or in the economy as a whole 
for the years ended december   and  we derived  and  respectively  of our net revenues from the restaurant industry  primarily the quick service restaurant qsr industry 
consequently  our restaurant technology product sales are dependent in large part on the health of the qsr industry  which in turn is dependent on the domestic and international economy  as well as factors such as consumer buying preferences and weather conditions 
instabilities or downturns in the restaurant market could disproportionately impact our revenues  as clients may either exit the industry or delay  cancel or reduce planned expenditures for our products 
although we believe we can assist the qsr sector of the restaurant industry in a competitive environment  given the cyclical nature of that industry  there can be no assurance that our profitability and growth will continue 
we derive a portion of our revenue from government contracts  which contain provisions unique to public sector customers  including the government s right to modify or terminate these contracts at any time 
for the fiscal years ended december   and  we derived  and  respectively  of our net revenues from contracts to provide technical products and services to united states government agencies and defense contractors 
contracts with united states government agencies typically provide that such contracts are terminable at the convenience of the government 
if the government terminated a contract on this basis  we would be entitled to receive payment for our allowable costs and  in general  a proportionate share of our fee or profit for work actually performed 
most us government contracts are also subject to modification or termination in the event of changes in funding 
as such  we may perform work prior to formal authorization  or the contract prices may be adjusted for increased work scope or change orders 
termination or modification of a substantial number of our us government contracts could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we perform work for the united states government pursuant to firm fixed price  cost plus fixed fee and time and material  prime contracts and subcontracts 
the majority of our government contracts are either firm fixed price time and material  or cost plus fixed fee contracts 
approximately of the revenue that we derived from government contracts for the year ended december  came from firm fixed price or time and material contracts 
the balance of the revenue that we derived from government contracts in primarily came from cost plus fixed fee contracts 
most of our contracts are for one year to five year terms 
while firm fixed price contracts allow us to benefit from cost savings  they also expose us to the risk of cost overruns 
if the initial estimates we use for calculating the contract price are incorrect  we can incur losses on those contracts 
in addition  some of our governmental contracts have provisions relating to cost controls and audit rights and  if we fail to meet the terms specified in those contracts  then we may not realize their full benefits 
lower earnings caused by cost overruns would have an adverse effect on our financial results 
under time and materials contracts  we are paid for labor at negotiated hourly billing rates and for certain expenses 
under cost plus fixed fee contracts  we are reimbursed for allowable costs and paid a fixed fee 
however  if our costs under either type of contract exceed the contract ceiling or are not allowable under the provisions of the contract or applicable regulations  we may not be able to obtain reimbursement for all of our costs 
under each type of contract  if we are unable to control costs we incur in performing under the contract  our financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected 
cost over runs also may adversely affect our ability to sustain existing programs and obtain future contract awards 
we face extensive competition in the markets in which we operate  and our failure to compete effectively could result in price reductions and decreased demand for our products and services 
there are currently five major suppliers who offer restaurant management systems similar to ours 
some of these competitors are larger than par and have access to substantially greater financial and other resources and  consequently  may be able to obtain more favorable terms than we can for components and subassemblies incorporated into their restaurant technology products 
the rapid rate of technological change in the restaurant market makes it likely that we will face competition from new products designed by companies not currently competing with us 
such products may have features not currently available on our restaurant products 
we believe that our competitive ability depends on our total solution offering  our product development and systems integration capability  our direct sales force and our customer service organization 
there is no assurance  however  that we will be able to compete effectively in the restaurant technology market in the future 
our government contracting business has been focused on niche offerings  primarily signal and image processing  i t outsourcing and engineering services 
many of our competitors are  or are subsidiaries of  companies such as lockheed martin  raytheon  northrop grumman  bae  harris  boeing and saic 
these companies are larger and have substantially greater financial resources than we do 
we also compete with smaller companies that target particular segments of the government market 
these companies may be better positioned to obtain contracts through competitive proposals 
consequently  there are no assurances that we will continue to win government contracts as a prime contractor or subcontractor 
we may not be able to meet the unique operational  legal and financial challenges that relate to our international operations  which may limit the growth of our business 
for the years ended december   and  our net revenues from sales outside the united states were  and  respectively  of the company s net revenues 
we anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of sales 
we intend to continue to expand our operations outside the united states and to enter additional international markets  which will require significant management attention and financial resources 
our operating results are subject to the risks inherent in international sales  including  but not limited to  regulatory requirements  political and economic changes and disruptions  geopolitical disputes and war  transportation delays  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign sales operations  and potentially adverse tax consequences
