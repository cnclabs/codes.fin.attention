item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in item of part ii of this annual report on form k 
on may   com completed the sale of the commworks division and transferred certain assets and liabilities to utstarcom  inc pursuant to the terms of the asset purchase agreement 
as a result of the sale  com reported the commworks division as a discontinued operation beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal and restated all prior periods presented on a comparative basis 
accordingly  the consolidated financial statements reflect the commworks division as a discontined operation for all periods presented 
unless otherwise indicated  the following discussion relates to our continuing operations 
business overview com provides innovative  practical and high value data and voice networking products  services and solutions for enterprises of all sizes and public sector organizations 
we are a company with a global presence  strong brand identity  large intellectual property portfolio and strong balance sheet 
we believe that our relationships with strategic partners  broad product portfolio and significant distribution channels provide us with strong foundation for future growth 
we generally sell our products through a two tier distribution channel comprised of distributors and resellers 
distributors are the first tier of the channel providing global distribution  logistics  market development and other services 
distributors generally sell to the second tier of the channel  comprising value added resellers vars and other channel partners targeting the small and mid sized enterprise businesses 
although a majority of our product sales are made through our two tier distribution channel  we also work closely with systems integrators  major telecom service providers  and direct marketers 
we also maintain a field sales organization that works alongside our channel partners to assist them in achieving their sales goals 
a substantial portion of our sales has been derived from a limited number of distributors  the largest of which are ingram micro inc and tech data corporation 
we expect that these distributors will continue to represent a significant percentage of our sales for the foreseeable future 
the table below sets forth the percentage of sales derived from these major distributors for the years ended may   may  and may   respectively 
fiscal years ended may  may  may  ingram micro  inc tech data corporation total we have undergone significant changes in recent years  including exiting product lines that were not expected to yield a satisfactory return on investment  significant headcount reductions  outsourcing of information technology it and other functions  outsourcing of all manufacturing activity  selling excess facilities  and forming the huawei com joint venture h c 
we believe an overview of these significant recent events is helpful to an understanding of our operating results 
significant events in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we undertook several broad initiatives in an attempt to return com to profitability 
these initiatives included exiting certain product lines that were not expected to yield a satisfactory return on investment 
during fiscal  we continued to experience declining revenue 
in response to this decline  we undertook additional measures to further reduce costs  including headcount reductions  long term asset retirements  and outsourcing manufacturing operations 
in fiscal  as our revenue and overall financial performance continued to decline  we undertook several additional broad initiatives to achieve further cost savings 
the first of these actions included the integration of certain central functions of our business units in order to achieve cost savings 
this integration did not substantially change our management and operating structure 
other actions pursued in fiscal were headcount reductions  outsourcing of certain it functions  and continuing efforts to consolidate and sell excess facilities 
all of these actions generated restructuring charges  but also resulted in reductions of sales and marketing  research and development  and general and administrative expenses 
during fiscal  we undertook a number of actions  affecting both revenue and expenses  with the objective of restoring com to profitability 
we expanded our product portfolio to include more layer plus and higher end products  additional modular switches and routers  and a higher end voice over internet protocol voip offering 
we believe that such an expanded product portfolio will allow us to deliver converged data and voice networking solutions not only to our traditional customers but also to larger and multi site enterprises 
we consolidated our company s operations into a single integrated business organized along functional lines  and we relocated headquarters and key management positions and functions from our santa clara  california location to our marlborough  massachusetts location as a more effective way to run this simplified business model 
also  we consolidated our operations into fewer facilities  disposed of excess real estate  relocated transaction processing activities to lower cost locations  outsourced our dublin  ireland manufacturing operations to our contract manufacturers  and upgraded and modified our it infrastructure and systems to more cost effective alternatives 
in addition  during fiscal  we reduced our overall workforce by approximately forty percent 
on november   we formed and began operations of our joint venture  huawei com h c  which is domiciled in hong kong and has its principal operating centers in hangzhou and beijing  china 
we contributed million in cash  assets related to our operations in china and japan  and licenses to related intellectual property in exchange for percent ownership interest of the joint venture 
we expect this venture to provide three key benefits to com an expanded product line  access to low cost and highly effective engineering talent  and a significant presence in the china and japan markets 
summary of fiscal financial performance our revenue for fiscal was million  a decrease from fiscal revenue of million 
revenue from our enterprise networking products for fiscal was million  a decrease from fiscal revenue of million 
our gross margin decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal our operating expenses in fiscal were million  compared to million in fiscal  a net decrease of million 
operating expenses in fiscal and included restructuring charges of million and million  respectively 
our net loss in fiscal was million compared to a net loss in fiscal of million 
our balance sheet remains strong with cash and short term investment balances at the end of fiscal of  million  compared to cash and short term investment balances of  million at the end of fiscal business environment and future trends we believe that the actions that we have taken are consistent with our goals of increasing revenue and reducing expenses in order to achieve profitability over the longer term 
however  we expect that some of the steps that we are taking to improve our business over the longer term will result in ongoing downward pressure on profitability in the near term 
for example  as we complete the transition of our business in china and japan to h c  there could be continuing adverse impacts on volumes  as well as lower average selling prices since the pricing of products sold to h c under an original equipment manufacturer oem agreement is lower than the pricing of products sold through our distribution channels 
however  we believe that we have begun to see the positive impacts of some of our fiscal growth related and restructuring initiatives 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  total revenue and revenue from enterprise networking products increased five percent and percent  respectively  compared to the same period of fiscal year also  as a result of the aforementioned fiscal restructuring actions and related charges  and based on our current projections for revenue  costs and expenses  which are subject to significant uncertainty  we expect that operating expenses will be reduced by approximately million per quarter  from the amount reported for the fourth quarter of fiscal approximately million of this reduction is expected to be realized during the first quarter of fiscal  the full reduction is expected to be realized in the fourth quarter of fiscal during fiscal  we continue to face significant challenges with respect to revenue growth  gross margin and profitability 
future revenue growth for our company depends on increased sales of our enterprise networking products  and our largest growth opportunity continues to be linked to the expansion of our product lines targeting mid to large enterprise customers 
these product lines include modular switching and routing products sourced from h c  as well as products such as voip  wireless and security 
in order to achieve our revenue goals for fiscal  it is imperative that we continue to enhance the features and capabilities of these products in a timely manner in order to expand our distribution channels and compete more effectively in the market 
also  we expect a very competitive  difficult pricing environment for the foreseeable future  this will exert downward pressure on our revenue  gross margin and profitability 
based on our current projections for revenue and gross margin  which are subject to significant uncertainty  we believe that we must hold total operating expenses including restructuring charges to an amount less than million per quarter in order to achieve profitability 
our total operating expenses including restructuring charges were approximately million in the fourth quarter of fiscal our planned actions for fiscal are based on certain assumptions concerning the overall economic outlook for the markets in which we operate  the expected demand for enterprise networking products  our ability to compete effectively and gain market share  and the cost and expense structure of our business 
these assumptions could prove to be inaccurate 
if current economic conditions deteriorate  or if our planned actions are not successful in achieving our goals  there could be additional adverse impacts on our financial position  revenue  profitability or cash flows 
in that case  we might need to modify our strategic focus and restructure our business again to realign our resources and achieve additional cost and expense savings 
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are outlined in note to the consolidated financial statements  which appear in part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
some of those accounting policies require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported by us 
the following items require the most significant judgment and often involve complex estimation revenue recognition we recognize a sale when the product has been delivered and risk of loss has passed to the customer  collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  and the fee is fixed or determinable 
the assessment of whether the fee is fixed or determinable considers whether a significant portion of the fee is due after our normal payment terms 
if we determine that the fee is not fixed or determinable  we recognize revenue at the time the fee becomes due  provided that all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
also  sales arrangements may contain customer specific acceptance requirements for both products and services 
in such cases  revenue is deferred at the time of delivery of the product or service and is recognized upon receipt of customer acceptance 
for arrangements that involve multiple elements  such as sales of products that include maintenance or installation services  revenue is allocated to each respective element based on its relative fair value and recognized when revenue recognition criteria for each element have been met 
we use the residual method to recognize revenue when an arrangement includes one or more elements to be delivered at a future date and vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of all the undelivered elements exists 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is recognized as revenue 
if evidence of fair value of one or more undelivered elements does not exist  revenue is deferred and recognized when delivery of those elements occurs or when fair value can be established 
we assess collectibility based on a number of factors  including general economic and market conditions  past transaction history with the customer  and the creditworthiness of the customer 
if we determine that collection of the fee is not reasonably assured  then we defer the fee and recognize revenue upon receipt of payment 
we do not typically request collateral from our customers 
a significant portion of our sales is made to distributors and vars 
revenue is generally recognized when title and risk of loss pass to the customer  assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
sales to these customers are recorded net of appropriate allowances  including estimates for product returns  price protection  and excess channel inventory levels 
for sales of products that contain software that is marketed separately  we apply the provisions of aicpa statement of position  software revenue recognition as amended 
sales of services  including professional services  system integration  project management  and training  are recognized upon delivery and completion of performance 
other service revenue  such as that related to maintenance and support contracts  is recognized ratably over the contract term  provided that all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
royalty revenue from licensing is recognized as earned 
allowance for doubtful accounts we continuously monitor payments from our customers and maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
when we evaluate the adequacy of our allowances for doubtful accounts  we take into account various factors including our accounts receivable aging  customer creditworthiness  historical bad debts  and geographic and political risk 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances might be required 
as of may   our net accounts receivable balance was million 
inventory inventory is stated at the lower of standard cost  which approximates cost  or net realizable value 
cost is determined on a first in  first out basis 
we perform detailed reviews related to the net realizable value of inventory on an ongoing basis  for both inventory on hand and inventory that we are committed to purchase  giving consideration to deterioration  obsolescence  and other factors 
if actual market conditions differ from those projected by management and our estimates prove to be inaccurate  additional write downs or adjustments to cost of sales might be required  alternatively  we might realize benefits through cost of sales for sale or disposition of inventory that had been previously written off 
as of may   our inventory balance was million 
goodwill and intangible assets we review the value of our long lived assets  including goodwill  in accordance with the applicable accounting literature for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of these assets are no longer appropriate 
as of may   we had million of net intangible assets and million of goodwill remaining on the balance sheet  which we believe to be realizable based on the estimated future cash flows of the associated products and technology 
however  it is possible that the estimates and assumptions used in assessing the carrying value of these assets  such as future sales and expense levels  may need to be reevaluated in the case of continued market deterioration  which could result in further impairment of these assets 
equity securities and other investments as of may   we had million of equity securities and other investments  including million related to our investment in h c 
we account for non marketable equity securities and other investments at historical cost or  if we have the ability to exert significant influence over the investee  by the equity method 
investments accounted for by the equity method include investments in limited partnership venture capital funds and our investment in h c 
in accounting for these investments by the equity method  we record our proportionate share of the fund s net income or loss  or h c s net income or loss  based on the most recently available quarterly financial statements 
since h c has adopted a calendar year basis of reporting  we report our equity in h c s net income or loss based on h c s most recent quarterly financial statements  two months in arrears 
we review all of our investments for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment may not be fully recoverable 
the impairment review requires significant judgment to identify events or circumstances that would likely have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment 
investments identified as having an indication of impairment are subject to further analysis to determine if the impairment is other than temporary  in the event that the indicated impairment is other than temporary  we write the investment down to its impaired value 
restructuring charges over the last several years we have undertaken significant restructuring initiatives 
these initiatives have required us to record restructuring charges related to severance and outplacement costs  lease cancellations  accelerated depreciation and write downs of held for sale properties  write downs of other long term assets  and other restructuring costs 
given the significance of our restructuring activities and the time required for execution and completion of such activities  the process of estimating restructuring charges is complex and involves periodic reassessments of estimates made at the time the original decisions were made 
the accounting for restructuring costs and asset impairments requires us to record charges when we have taken actions or have the appropriate approval for taking action  and when a liability is incurred 
our policies require us to continually evaluate the adequacy of the remaining liabilities under our restructuring initiatives 
as we continue to evaluate the business  we might be required to record additional charges for new restructuring activities as well as changes in estimates to amounts previously recorded 
warranty a limited warranty is provided on our products for periods ranging from days to the lifetime of the product  depending upon the product  and allowances for estimated warranty costs are recorded during the period of sale 
the determination of such allowances requires us to make estimates of product return rates and expected costs to repair or replace the products under warranty 
if actual return rates and or repair and replacement costs differ significantly from our estimates  adjustments to recognize additional cost of sales might be required 
income taxes we are subject to income tax in a number of jurisdictions 
a certain degree of estimation is required in recording the assets and liabilities related to income taxes  and it is reasonably possible that such assets may not be recovered and that such liabilities may not be paid or that payments in excess of amounts initially estimated and accrued may be required 
we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from our future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance 
we consider historical taxable income  estimates of future taxable income  and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the amount of the valuation allowance 
based on various factors  including our recent losses  retained deficit  operating performance in fiscal  and estimates of future profitability  we have concluded that future taxable income will  more likely than not  be insufficient to recover our us net deferred tax assets as of may  accordingly  we have established an appropriate valuation allowance to offset such deferred tax assets 
adjustments could be required in the future if we determine that the amount to be realized is greater or less than the valuation allowance we have recorded 
restructuring activities during the past several fiscal years  we have undertaken several initiatives involving significant changes in our business strategy and cost structure 
restructuring charges related to these initiatives in fiscal   and were million  million  and million  respectively 
these restructuring initiatives and charges are discussed further in business overview and critical accounting policies above and in note to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
accrued liabilities related to restructuring activities are classified as current as of may  because we intend to satisfy such liabilities within the next months 
we expect to incur additional restructuring charges in the first half of fiscal related to our ongoing cost reduction efforts  however  based on actions taken or decided to date  such additional charges are not expected to be significant 
also  as of may   property and equipment classified as held for sale totaled approximately million  additional write downs could result from future changes in the net realizable values of those properties 
joint venture on november   we formed the huawei com joint venture h c with a subsidiary of huawei technologies  ltd 
huawei 
h c is domiciled in hong kong  and has its principal operating centers in hangzhou and beijing  china 
at the time of formation  we contributed cash of million  assets related to our operations in china and japan with a carrying value of million  and licenses related to certain intellectual property in exchange for a percent ownership interest in h c 
huawei contributed assets valued at million in exchange for a percent ownership interest  huawei s contributed assets included its enterprise networking business assets  including local area network lan switches and routers  engineering and sales and marketing resources and personnel  and licenses to its related intellectual property 
two years after formation of h c  we have the one time option to purchase an additional two percent ownership interest from huawei for an amount not to exceed million 
three years after formation of h c  both partners have the right to purchase all of the other partner s ownership interest through a bid process 
in china and japan  h c sells its own products  as well as products it purchases directly from huawei and us 
outside of china and japan  we resell h c s products under the com brand 
through this reseller agreement  we are expanding our product line to include router products and modular switching products 
the addition of these products to our product portfolio increases the size of the market opportunity for which we can compete 
we account for our investment in h c by the equity method 
under this method  we record our proportionate share of h c s net income or loss based on the most recently available quarterly financial statements of h c 
since h c has adopted a calendar year basis of reporting  we have reported our equity in h c s net loss for h c s fiscal period from the date of formation november  through march  in our results of operations for fiscal our proportionate share of the reported loss from operations for the period from the date of formation through march  was million  and is included in our results of operations for fiscal under the caption equity interest in loss of unconsolidated joint venture in our consolidated financial statements 
also  at the time of formation of h c  we recorded a charge of million representing our ownership share percent of the value attributed to in process technology contributed to h c by huawei that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use 
this charge also was included in our results of operations for fiscal under the caption equity interest in loss of unconsolidated joint venture 
in fiscal  our total reported loss related to h c was million 
prospectively  we will continue to report our equity in h c s net income or loss based on h c s most recent financial statements  two months in arrears 
we do not expect h c s results to significantly affect our results of operations in the near term 
for additional information concerning our investment in h c  see note to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
results of operations as mentioned above  effective for fiscal  we now manage and report our operations as a single  integrated business 
the following discussion reflects the results of operations of the business as it was organized and managed during fiscal the following table sets forth  for the fiscal years indicated  the percentage of total sales represented by the line items reflected in our consolidated statements of operations 
information related to the fiscal year ended may  has been restated to account for the commworks division as a discontinued operation

sales of enterprise networking products in fiscal were million  a decrease of percent from fiscal sales of million 
the decrease in revenue was driven by a reduction in average selling prices asps resulting from significant price competition  particularly for our mbps switching products as the industry migrates to gigabit switching solutions  and by an unfavorable shift in mix towards lower priced products 
although sales of enterprise networking products declined overall  sales of certain products in targeted high growth technology areas increased  such products included fixed configuration gigabit switches  wireless lan  and modular switches and routers sourced from h c 
increased sales of these products was largely due to higher unit volumes  resulting from both the industry shift towards gigabit switching solutions mentioned above  as well as enhanced sales and marketing efforts targeting enterprise customers 
enterprise networking products represented percent of total sales in fiscal compared to percent of total sales in fiscal sales of our desktop  mobile and server connectivity products in fiscal were million  a decrease of percent from fiscal sales of million 
the decrease in sales was due largely to lower volumes  with unit shipments decreasing percent compared to fiscal  as well as to lower overall asps 
we believe the lower volumes resulted from a continuing shift in technology from traditional network interface card nic  personal computer pc card  and mini peripheral component interconnect mini pci form factors to pc chipsets with embedded networking technology for which we have lower market share 
additionally  the decline in sales was partially attributable to the recognition in fiscal of million of royalty revenue from a paid up license resulting from settlement of patent litigation with xircom  inc sales of connectivity products represented percent of total sales in fiscal compared to percent of total sales in fiscal we expect sales from connectivity products to decline again in fiscal due to both reduced demand for our products and continued pricing pressures 
by geography 
us sales represented approximately percent of total sales in fiscal  compared to approximately percent in fiscal  and decreased percent when compared to fiscal the major factor contributing to the decrease in sales from year to year was lower sales of connectivity products as discussed above 
international sales in fiscal decreased percent when compared to fiscal the major factor contributing to this decrease was lower sales of connectivity products  other important factors contributing to the decrease were lower sales of our mbps switching products  as well as a decline in sales to customers in china and japan following h c s assumption of responsibility for sales of enterprise networking products into these countries 
gross margin gross margin as a percentage of sales declined percentage points from percent of sales in fiscal to percent of sales in fiscal significant components of the decrease in gross margins were as follows decrease in standard related margin volume related impacts transition related costs associated with closure of the dublin manufacturing facility duty refunds and proceeds from inventory previously written off impact of royalty revenue other total the decrease in standard related margin was primarily the result of lower asps  and  to a lesser extent  an unfavorable shift in product mix 
these unfavorable factors were partially offset by product cost reductions 
volume related impacts include higher post sale technical support costs  manufacturing overhead costs  and warranty costs as a percent of sales 
since a portion of these costs is not directly variable with sales  these costs did not decline at the same rate as sales 
we recorded charges related to manufacturing assets and other transition related costs in fiscal as a result of our decision to outsource our remaining manufacturing operations in dublin 
gross margin in fiscal did not benefit to any significant degree from duty refunds or proceeds from the sale of inventory that was previously written off 
however  gross margin in fiscal included benefits related to such items 
sales in fiscal included royalty revenue of million related to the settlement of litigation with xircom 
this revenue did not have any associated cost of sales 
operating expenses operating expenses in fiscal were million  compared to million in fiscal  a net decrease of million 
included in the net decrease in operating expenses were decreases in research and development expenses of approximately million  general and administrative expenses of million  amortization and write down of intangibles of million  restructuring charges of approximately million  and loss on land and facilities of million 
partially offsetting these decreases was an increase in sales and marketing expenses of million 
as a percent of sales  total operating expenses in fiscal were percent  compared to percent in fiscal in aggregate  sales and marketing  research and development  and general and administrative expenses were percent of sales in fiscal  compared to percent in fiscal  and decreased a net million in fiscal compared to fiscal to a significant degree  these expenses are controllable and discretionary over time  but they are not directly variable with sales levels within a particular period 
the most significant component of the decrease of million was a reduction of it related expenses 
we allocate and report both it and facilities related expenses as a component of cost of sales and operating expenses 
on an overall basis  total operating expenses in fiscal reflected a decrease of million in it related expenses compared to fiscal  largely as a result of employee reductions and asset write offs associated with our it outsourcing initiatives during fiscal partially offsetting the decrease in it related expenses was a net increase of million in facilities related expenses 
although our facilities consolidation efforts have resulted in lower gross facilities spending  these savings have been more than offset by a reduction in rental and sublease income received 
such rental and sublease income totaled million and million in fiscal and  respectively  and is recorded as an offset to the associated facilities related expenses 
a more detailed discussion of the factors affecting each major component of total operating expenses is provided below 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses in fiscal were relatively flat compared to fiscal  increasing million 
sales and marketing expenses as a percent of sales increased to percent in fiscal  compared to percent in fiscal the most significant factors in the increase were higher workforce related and travel and entertainment expenses and an increase in facilities related expenses 
largely offsetting these increases were reduced it expenses  as well as reduced marketing expenses as a result of a shift in spending towards more focused  product and channel specific programs 
research and development 
research and development expenses in fiscal decreased million  or percent  compared to fiscal research and development expenses as a percent of sales increased to percent in fiscal compared to percent in fiscal the most significant factors in the decrease were reduced it expenses  reduced workforce expenses as a result of restructuring activities and movement towards lower cost geographies  lower depreciation expense related to engineering assets reflecting write downs and disposals associated with our restructuring initiatives  and decreased spending for project tools and materials 
partially offsetting these reductions were increased use of third parties for development work  as well as an increase in facilities related expenses 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses in fiscal decreased million  or percent  from fiscal as a percent of sales  general and administrative expenses were relatively flat  increasing to percent in fiscal from percent in fiscal the most significant factors in the decrease were reduced workforce related expenses due to our restructuring initiatives  reduced legal and professional services costs related to the formation of h c  and reduced it expenses 
partially offsetting these reductions was the impact of sales tax refunds in fiscal that did not recur at the same level in fiscal  as well as lower credits in fiscal relating to bad debt expense 
amortization and write down of intangibles 
amortization and write down of intangibles were million and million for fiscal and  respectively  a decrease of million 
amortization and write down of intangibles decreased due to a lower base of intangible assets as a result of an impairment charge during the first quarter of fiscal  as well as reduced impairment charges 
in fiscal  we recorded an impairment charge of million related to developed and core technology associated with the acquisition of assets from alteon in fiscal additionally  there were impairment charges of million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively  related to developed and core technology associated with the fiscal acquisition of nbx 
restructuring charges 
restructuring charges in fiscal and fiscal were million and million  respectively 
restructuring charges in fiscal were composed primarily of charges for actions taken in fiscal  including facilities related charges of million  severance and outplacement costs of million  and long term asset write downs and other costs of million 
facilities related charges in fiscal included million for an impairment and accelerated depreciation of a santa clara facility due to our plan to vacate the facility and move to a smaller santa clara facility already owned  offset by a million gain on the sale of this vacated facility later in fiscal  million for an impairment and accelerated depreciation of our dublin manufacturing facility  an million impairment and million loss on sale of certain other santa clara properties  a loss of million related to the sale of our rolling meadows  illinois facility  charges of million related to fair value adjustments of properties classified as held for sale prior to fiscal  and million related to estimated lease termination costs 
restructuring charges for fiscal were the result of reductions in workforce  outsourcing of our remaining manufacturing operations in dublin  and continued efforts to consolidate and dispose of excess facilities 
additionally  in fiscal we incurred charges of million relating to the completion of restructuring activities initiated in fiscal years   and restructuring charges in fiscal were composed primarily of charges for actions taken in fiscal relating to accelerated depreciation and write downs of facilities of million  severance and outplacement costs of million  and long term asset write downs and other costs of million 
facilities charges in fiscal included million for write downs of facilities located in rolling meadows  santa clara  ireland  and the uk  accelerated depreciation of million on certain santa clara facilities  a million loss on the sale of our marlborough  massachusetts facility  and lease termination costs of million 
restructuring charges in fiscal were the result of the consolidation of our real estate portfolio  the integration of the support infrastructure of our former connectivity and enterprise networking segments  it outsourcing efforts  and continued cost reduction actions 
additionally  in fiscal we incurred charges of million relating to the completion of restructuring activities initiated in fiscal years and further actions may be taken if our business activity continues to decline and additional cost reduction efforts are necessary 
in addition  a number of our facilities are classified as held for sale as a result of our restructuring program 
although these properties are being carried at their estimated net realizable values  additional write downs could result from changes in such values 
as of may   the aggregate net realizable value of properties held for sale was million  and included properties located in ireland and the uk loss on investments  net during fiscal  net losses on investments were million  reflecting million of write downs of long term equity investments partially offset by a gain of million recognized upon the sale of an investment in a privately held company 
in fiscal  net losses on investments were million  including million of net losses recognized due to fair value adjustments of investments in limited partnership venture capital funds and write downs of investments in private companies for other than temporary declines in value and million of net losses realized on sales of publicly traded equity securities and investments in limited partnership venture capital funds 
interest and other income  net interest and other income  net  was million in fiscal  a decrease of million compared to million in fiscal a decline in interest income accounted for million of this decline  primarily driven by lower interest rates applicable to short tem investments and lower interest income relating to income tax refunds 
we collected million and million of interest income in fiscal and  respectively  relating to income tax refunds received in those years 
partially offsetting the decrease in interest income was lower interest expense that resulted from the repayment of borrowings  as well as lower charges related to warrants issued to broadcom corporation broadcom 
in fiscal  we recorded a charge of million in interest and other income  net  related to a one year extension of the expiration date for the broadcom warrants that was agreed in connection with our settlement of litigation with broadcom 
these warrants expired unexercised in december income tax provision benefit our income tax benefit was million in fiscal  compared to an income tax benefit of million in fiscal included in our fiscal income tax benefit was an million benefit of a foreign net operating loss carryback 
offsetting this benefit was a tax provision for tax in certain foreign and domestic state jurisdictions 
included in our fiscal income tax benefit was a million benefit of a net operating loss carryback made possible by the job creation and worker assistance act of  and a million benefit that was recorded to offset the net tax provision for discontinued operations 
offsetting these benefits was a tax provision for certain foreign and domestic state jurisdictions 
equity interest in loss of unconsolidated joint venture as described more fully above  we account for our investment in h c by the equity method 
in fiscal  we recorded a charge of million representing our share of the net loss from operations incurred by h c from the date of formation through march  in addition  at the time of formation of h c  we recorded a charge of million representing our ownership share percent of the value attributed to in process technology contributed to h c by huawei that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use 
in fiscal  our total reported loss related to h c was million 
discontinued operations discontinued operations in fiscal and fiscal related to our commworks division that was sold in the fourth quarter of fiscal we recorded a loss of million in fiscal due to adjustments to previous estimates of liabilities related to the sale of commworks 
discontinued operations in fiscal included a gain on the sale of commworks of million  which was offset by million of taxes 
also included in fiscal were losses from operations of million  which were offset by a million tax benefit 
comparison of fiscal years ended may  and may  sales fiscal sales totaled million  a decrease of percent from fiscal sales of  million 
sales of enterprise networking offerings in fiscal of million decreased percent from sales in fiscal of million 
the decrease resulted from a decline in sales of wireline data products  partially offset by moderate increases in sales of voice and wireless products 
within the wireline data product line  lan revenue decreased by million  due to lower sales of shared hubs due to competition from low priced switches  and lower sales of our fixed configuration switches which have matured 
also affecting the wireline data product line was a decline of million in sales of digital subscriber line dsl router products due to our withdrawal from this product line at the end of fiscal sales of voice products were up million due to the overall growth in the market 
sales of wireless products experienced growth of million due to an increased demand for home office products 
service revenue declined by million due to fewer maintenance contract renewals 
sales of desktop  mobile and server connectivity products in fiscal of million decreased percent compared to sales in fiscal of million 
the decline in sales as compared to the prior year was due largely to lower volumes  with unit shipments decreasing percent compared to fiscal  as well as to lower overall asps 
factors that reduced volumes were a shift in the market from network interface card  personal computer pc card  and mini peripheral component interconnect form factors to pc chipsets with embedded networking technology for which we have lower market share  as well as lower sales to our oem partners 
in addition to lower volumes  our overall asps decreased in fiscal declining asps resulted primarily from intense price competition  but were mitigated to some degree by a favorable product mix shift towards gigabit and security fiber products that carry higher asps  and a decrease in sales to oems  which normally have lower asps 
additionally  the decline in sales in fiscal was partially offset by the recognition of million of royalty revenue from a paid up license resulting from settlement of patent litigation with xircom  inc by geography us sales represented approximately percent of total sales in fiscal  compared to approximately percent in fiscal  and decreased percent when compared to fiscal international sales in fiscal decreased percent when compared to fiscal the decline in sales of enterprise networking products described above was experienced primarily in the us and in the europe  middle east  and africa region  whereas the decline in sales of connectivity products was experienced primarily in the us and in the asia pacific region 
gross margin gross margin as a percentage of sales increased percentage points from percent of sales in fiscal to percent of sales in fiscal significant components of the increase in gross margins were as follows increase in standard related margin volume related impacts duty refunds excess and obsolete inventory impact of royalty revenue other total the increase in standard related margin was due largely to reductions in materials costs resulting from design changes and component cost improvements  and a mix shift towards higher margin products 
included in the mix shift was an increase in sales of connectivity products through the distribution channel versus sales to oem customers  which generally have lower asps 
volume related impacts include lower manufacturing overhead costs due to reduced unutilized capacity and lower post sale technical support costs as a percent of sales 
year over year  gross margin in fiscal benefited from duty refunds of million 
gross margin in fiscal did not benefit from such items to any significant degree 
year over year  gross margin in fiscal benefited from sales of inventory that had been written off in prior periods million and from lower provisions for excess and obsolete inventory million 
these provisions in fiscal were due largely to reduced demand for and discontinuance of certain desktop  mobile and server connectivity products 
sales in fiscal included royalty revenue of million related to the settlement of litigation with xircom 
this revenue did not have any associated cost of sales 
operating expenses operating expenses in fiscal were million compared to million in fiscal  or a net decrease of million 
included in the net decrease in operating expenses were decreases in research and development expenses of million  amortization and write down of intangibles expenses of million  sales and marketing expenses of million  general and administrative expenses of million  and loss on land and facilities of million 
partially offsetting these declines was an increase in restructuring charges of million 
as a percent of sales  total operating expenses in fiscal were percent  compared to percent in fiscal in aggregate  sales and marketing  research and development  and general and administrative expenses were percent of sales in fiscal  compared to percent fiscal  and decreased by million  net in fiscal compared to fiscal to a significant degree  these expenses are controllable and discretionary over time  but they are not directly variable with sales levels within a particular period 
the most significant components of the decrease of million were reductions of million of direct employee and alternative workforce expenses  million of project and research related expenses such as project materials and depreciation on engineering assets  million of it related expenses  and million of spending on marketing and advertising 
these decreases were the result of cost reduction actions primarily related to our restructuring initiatives  which included headcount reductions  it outsourcing  long term asset write offs  a decline in the number of research projects  and general spending reductions 
offsetting these decreases was an increase of million for legal and professional services 
a more detailed discussion of the factors affecting each major component of total operating expenses is provided below 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses in fiscal decreased million  or percent  from fiscal sales and marketing expenses as a percent of sales increased to percent in fiscal compared to percent in fiscal the largest factor in the decrease was direct employee related expenses  and the second largest factor was it related expenses 
together  these two factors accounted for a majority of the reduction of sales and marketing expenses 
the reduction in spending on marketing and advertising noted above was the third most significant contributing factor to the decrease in expenses 
research and development 
research and development expenses in fiscal decreased million  or percent  compared to fiscal research and development expenses as a percent of sales decreased to percent in fiscal compared to percent in fiscal the largest factor in the decrease was lower project and research related expenses such as project materials and depreciation on engineering assets  and the second largest factor was a decline in direct employee related expenses 
together  these two factors accounted for a majority of the decrease in research and development expenses 
the third most significant factor contributing to the decrease was it related expenses 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses in fiscal decreased million  or percent  from fiscal as a percent of sales  general and administrative expenses increased to percent in fiscal compared to percent in fiscal a decline in direct employee related expenses was the primary factor contributing to the million decrease 
reductions in it related spending were offset by increases in expenditures for legal and professional services in connection with litigation that we settled during the year and start up activities related to h c 
amortization and write down of intangibles 
amortization and write down of intangibles were million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
charges in included a million write down for the impairment of intangible assets related to the nbx acquisition  and million for amortization 
charges in included million of write downs for impairments of intangibles relating to the goodwill and developed product technology associated with the acquisition of alteon  and million for amortization 
due to the adoption of statement of financial accounting standard sfas on june   we stopped amortizing goodwill in fiscal fiscal included amortization of million relating to continuing operations 
fiscal also included goodwill amortization of million that related to discontinued operations 
restructuring charges 
restructuring charges in fiscal and fiscal were million and million  respectively 
restructuring charges for fiscal were composed primarily of charges for actions taken in fiscal relating to accelerated depreciation and write downs of facilities of million  severance and outplacement costs of million  and long term asset write downs and other costs of million 
facilities charges in fiscal included million related to accelerated depreciation and impairments of facilities in santa clara  million relating to the impairment of our rolling meadows facility  a million loss on the sale of our marlborough facility  write downs of properties in ireland and the uk of million and million  respectively  and lease terminations of million 
restructuring charges for fiscal were the result of the consolidation of our real estate portfolio  the integration of the support infrastructure of our former connectivity and enterprise networking segments  it outsourcing efforts  and continued cost reduction actions 
additionally  in fiscal  we incurred charges of million relating to the completion of restructuring activities initiated in fiscal years and restructuring charges for fiscal included million for facility related charges  comprised of million in write downs of property held for sale  million for the loss on the sale of our singapore manufacturing facility  and million for other facility charges  million for severance and outplacement costs  million for long term asset write downs  and million for other restructuring charges 
these charges were the result of cost reduction actions we took to restructure our operations that were announced on december   as well as consolidation of our manufacturing facilities and the discontinuation of our consumer cable and dsl modem product lines as announced during june we also recorded a million benefit in fiscal relating to revisions of previous estimates of a restructuring initiative that had begun in the fourth quarter of fiscal loss on land and facilities  net 
the net loss on land and facilities in fiscal and fiscal was million and million  respectively 
the net loss in both periods represented write downs of our salt lake city  utah facility that was sold in the second quarter of fiscal this facility was classified as held for sale prior to the inception of our restructuring programs and  therefore  the related net losses were not the result of restructuring actions and were not recorded as a part of restructuring charges 
loss on investments  net during fiscal  net losses on investments were million  including million of net losses recognized due to fair value adjustments of investments in limited partnership venture capital funds and write downs of investments in private companies for other than temporary declines in value and million of net losses realized on sales of publicly traded equity securities and investments in limited partnership venture capital funds 
in fiscal  net losses on investments were million  composed of million of net losses recognized due to fair value adjustments of investments in limited partnership venture capital funds and write downs of investments in private companies for other than temporary declines in value  offset by million of net gains realized on sales of publicly traded equity securities 
interest and other income  net interest and other income  net  was million in fiscal  a decrease of million compared to million in fiscal a decline in interest income accounted for million of this decline  primarily driven by lower interest rates  and lower interest income relating to our fiscal income tax refund 
we collected million and million of interest income in fiscal and  respectively  relating to our fiscal income tax refund 
additionally  borrowing related costs increased million in fiscal due mainly to higher average outstanding balances on our term loan and revolving line of credit as well as higher amortization of deferred loan costs  which included accelerated amortization relating to the early repayment of the term loan 
also  in fiscal  we recorded a charge of million related to the one year extension of the expiration date for the warrants issued to broadcom 
income tax provision benefit our income tax benefit was million in fiscal  compared to an income tax provision of million in fiscal included in our fiscal income tax benefit was a million benefit of a net operating loss carryback made possible by the job creation and worker assistance act of  and a million benefit that was recorded to offset the net tax provision for discontinued operations 
offsetting these benefits was a tax provision for tax in certain foreign and domestic state jurisdictions 
the fiscal tax provision was the result of write downs of the domestic deferred tax asset that had been previously supported by the appreciation in our real estate portfolio  as well as a provision for income taxes in foreign and domestic state jurisdictions 
discontinued operations discontinued operations in fiscal and fiscal related to our commworks business 
discontinued operations in fiscal included a gain on the sale of commworks of million  which was offset by million of taxes 
also included in fiscal were losses from operations of million  which were offset by a million tax benefit 
the loss from operations in fiscal was million  net of taxes of million 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle as a result of our adoption of sfas  we conducted a transitional goodwill impairment evaluation of the million of goodwill recorded as of may  and wrote off goodwill totaling million relating to continuing operations as a change in accounting principle effective june  we also wrote off million of goodwill relating to the commworks business unit  which is included in discontinued operations 
liquidity and capital resources cash and equivalents and short term investments at may  were  million  a decrease of approximately million compared to the balance of  million at may  net cash used in operating activities was million for fiscal  primarily reflecting our loss from continuing operations of million 
we expect that cash flows from operating activities will continue to be negative during the first half of fiscal  and possibly longer  primarily due to continuing net losses 
there are no assurances that we can reduce our net losses and negative cash flow in the foreseeable future  or that we can raise capital as needed to fund our operations on an ongoing basis 
however  based on current business conditions and our current operating and financial plans  but subject to the discussion in business environment and industry trends below  we believe that our existing cash and equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash requirements for at least the next months 
as a result of the aforementioned fiscal restructuring actions and related charges  and based on our current projections for revenue  costs and expenses  which are subject to significant uncertainty  we expect net cash flow from operations to be improved by approximately million per quarter from the levels reported for the fourth quarter of fiscal this improvement excludes the impact of cash disbursements to be made in settlement of liabilities accrued as of may  significant commitments that will require the use of cash in future periods include obligations under lease  contract manufacturing  royalty and patent licensing  it outsourcing  and guarantee agreements  as shown in the following table in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than one year years years more than years operating leases      purchase commitments with contract manufacturers   royalty and patent licenses    it outsourcing agreements     guarantees   total      we have entered into purchase agreements with our contract manufacturers 
pursuant to these agreements  if our actual orders and purchases fall below forecasted levels  we may be required to purchase finished goods inventory manufactured to meet our requirements 
in addition  we may be required to purchase raw material and work in process inventory on hand that is unique to our products  and we may be required to compensate the contract manufacturers with respect to their non cancelable purchase orders for such inventory 
the amount shown in the table above represents our estimate of inventory held by contract manufacturers at may  that we could be required to purchase within the next months 
we do not expect any such required purchases to exceed our requirements for inventory to meet expected sales of our products to our customers 
under our it outsourcing agreements  we are subject to service level commitments providing for annual minimum payments that vary depending on the service levels we choose 
the amounts shown in the table above represent the amounts that would be payable  based on current service levels  through the expiration of the agreements 
however  the agreements may be terminated at any time upon days notice  subject to early termination penalties that decline over time 
if we were to terminate the agreements at the end of the first quarter of fiscal  such penalties would be approximately million 
we have several agreements whereby we have sold products to resellers who have  in turn  sold the products to end users  and we have guaranteed the payments of the end users to our customers 
since deferred revenue and accrued liabilities related to such sales approximate the guaranteed amounts  any payments resulting from end user defaults would not have a material impact on our results of operations 
net cash provided by investing activities was million for fiscal  including million of net proceeds related to sales  maturities and purchases of debt and equity securities  and million of net proceeds related to sales and purchases of fixed assets  partially offset by our million investment in h c 
for the fiscal years ended may  and may   we made investments totaling million and  million  respectively  in municipal and corporate bonds and government agency instruments  as well as investments totaling million and million  respectively  in equity securities 
for the fiscal years ended may  and may   proceeds from maturities and sales of municipal and corporate bonds and government agency instruments were  million and  million  respectively  and proceeds from the sales of equity investments totaled million and million  respectively 
our investments in equity securities include investments made by com ventures 
through com ventures  we selectively make strategic investments in privately held companies and in limited partnership venture capital funds  which in turn invest in privately held companies 
these investment activities are entered into with the intention of complementing our business strategies and research and development efforts  and may include a strategic commercial or technology relationship  such as a component supply agreement or technology license arrangement  with these privately held companies 
we made strategic investments of million in fiscal and have committed to make additional capital contributions to venture capital funds totaling million 
we are contractually obligated to provide funding upon calls for capital 
the expiration dates for such capital calls are generally five to eight years from the inception of the fund  and the amounts and timing of such calls during that period are at the discretion of the funds general partners 
based upon projections provided by the funds general partners  we estimate that we will pay approximately million over the next months as capital calls are made 
during fiscal  we collected million from sales of property and equipment  primarily relating to the sale of our rolling meadows facility and certain properties in santa clara 
also  during this same period  we made million in capital expenditures 
as of may   capital expenditure commitments outstanding were not material 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for fiscal  which included proceeds of million from the issuance of common stock and million from collection of the final installments due under a note receivable related to the sale of warrants to broadcom during fiscal  offset by million for payments due under capital leases 
during fiscal  there were no borrowings or repayments under our revolving line of credit 
as of may   total available borrowings under the revolving line of credit were million  net of bank issued standby letters of credit and guarantees that are supported by this credit arrangement 
as of may   such bank issued standby letters of credit and guarantees totaled million  including million relating to potential foreign tax  custom  and duty assessments 
during fiscal  we issued approximately million shares of our common stock in connection with our employee stock purchase and option plans 
as indicated above  total proceeds from such issuances were million 
as of may   our outstanding stock options as a percentage of outstanding shares were percent 
this potential dilution is mainly the result of our distribution of palm  inc common stock in the first quarter of fiscal as a result of the distribution  the number of shares of com common stock subject to option grants was adjusted to preserve the intrinsic value of the stock options  resulting in an increase of million options  and bringing the total option shares outstanding to million at the time of the distribution 
we have closely managed new options grants during recent fiscal years with the goal of reducing the potential dilution associated with outstanding stock options 
as a result of these efforts  as well as the effects of option exercises and cancellations  the total number of outstanding options has been reduced approximately percent since the palm distribution 
in addition  the total number of options available for future grants was reduced by million shares due to approval of a proposal submitted to our stockholders at our annual stockholder meeting in september our current stock repurchase authorization permits expenditures of up to million through march we did not repurchase shares of our common stock under this program in fiscal however  we began repurchasing shares of our common stock pursuant to this authorization in the first quarter of fiscal  and we may use cash to repurchase additional shares in future periods 
effects of recent accounting pronouncements in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation number fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin establishes accounting guidance for consolidation of a variable interest entity  formerly referred to as a special purpose entity 
in december  the fasb issued fin r  which deferred the effective date of fin for certain variable interest entities created before february  to the first interim or annual reporting period that ends after march  we determined that fin and fin r are not applicable to any of our investments 
business environment and industry trends industry trends and specific risks may affect our future business and results 
the matters discussed below could cause our future results to differ from past results or those described in forward looking statements and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and stock price 
we have incurred significant net losses in recent fiscal periods  including million  million and million in fiscal years  and  respectively  and we may not be able to return to profitability 
we incurred a net loss of million for fiscal  and net losses of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
although we are taking steps designed to improve our results of operations  we cannot assure you that we will return to profitability 
we have faced a number of challenges that have affected our operating results over the last several fiscal years 
specifically  we have experienced  and may continue to experience  the following declining revenue due to price competition and reduced incoming order rate  increased risk of excess and obsolete inventories  excess facilities  operating expenses that  as a percentage of revenue  have exceeded our desired financial model  and disruptions resulting from our workforce reductions and employee attrition 
we entered into a joint venture in china with huawei that  if not successful  could materially and adversely impact our business  business prospects and operating results 
in november  we announced the formation of a joint venture for enterprise networking products with huawei  a leading chinese company 
com currently has a percent minority interest in h c  which is domiciled in hong kong has its principal operations in hangzhou and beijing  china 
pursuant to the joint venture agreements  com has the right to market and support the h c products under the com brand in all countries except china and japan 
in china and japan  the joint venture will sell products sourced internally as well as from com and huawei under h c s brand as well as the com brand and the huawei brand 
h c commenced operations in november we began reflecting our share of the operating results of h c in our operating results in the third quarter of fiscal the business of h c is subject to all of the operational risks that normally arise for a technology company with global operations pertaining to research and development  manufacturing  sales  service  marketing  and corporate functions 
in addition  there could be disagreements between com and huawei with respect to important strategic and operational decisions 
a key factor in the success of h c is that product sourced from it remains competitive over time particularly with respect to features  performance  quality and cost 
for example  one factor that could affect cost competitiveness is future adverse exchange rate movements between h c s local currency of operations and the us dollar 
in addition  competition in the enterprise networking market will involve challenges from numerous  well established companies with substantial resources and significant market share 
our business  business prospects and operating results have dependencies upon the success of h c 
in particular  our product development activities will become increasingly interdependent with those of h c 
if h c and our transactions with it are not successful  we may not introduce new products needed to broaden our high end enterprise networks product line  which may adversely affect our revenue and overall results of operations 
even if h c is successful  there may be disruption to our existing distribution channels and conflicts with our current channel partners resulting from the establishment of h c s operations and distribution arrangements 
our competition with huawei in the enterprise networking market could have a material adverse affect on our revenue and our results of operations 
as huawei expands its international operations  there will be increasing instances where we compete directly with huawei in the enterprise networking market 
we expect to be able to compete effectively with huawei in this market as a result of our strengths in a number of areas including our brand identity  breadth of products and solutions offerings  and professional services capabilities 
we also are free to engineer derivative models of products sourced from h c that would not be available to huawei or other h c customers 
however  as a co owner and oem customer of h c  huawei will have access to many of h c s products just as we do  thereby enhancing huawei s current ability to compete directly with us in markets outside of china and japan 
if this occurs  we could lose a competitive advantage in those markets  which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and overall results of operations 
our strategy of outsourcing functions and operations may fail to reduce cost and may disrupt our operations 
we continue to look for ways to decrease cost and improve efficiency by contracting with other companies to perform functions or operations that we  in the past  have performed ourselves 
we rely on outside vendors to meet a significant portion of our it and manufacturing needs 
in the third quarter of fiscal  we completed the outsourcing of all manufacturing of our products 
to achieve more cost savings or operational benefits  we may expand our outsourcing activities where we believe a third party may be able to provide those services in a more efficient manner 
although we believe that outsourcing will result in lower costs and increased efficiencies  this may not be the case 
because these third parties may not be as responsive to our needs as we would be ourselves  outsourcing increases the risk of disruption to our operations 
in addition  our agreements with these third parties sometimes include substantial penalties for terminating such agreements early or failing to maintain minimum service levels 
because we cannot always predict how long we will need the services or how much of the services we will use  we may have to pay these penalties or incur costs that are no longer competitive if our business conditions change 
we may not be able to compensate for lower revenue or unexpected cash outlays with cost reductions sufficient to generate positive net income or cash flow 
although we have implemented strict cost and expense reductions  if we are unable to achieve our growth objectives  we will need to further reduce costs which may in turn reduce our revenue 
if we are not able to effectively reduce our costs and expenses commensurate with  and at the same pace as  any further deterioration in our revenue  we may not be able to generate positive net income or cash flow from operations 
if we continue to experience negative cash flow from operations over a prolonged period of time  our liquidity and ability to operate our business effectively could be adversely affected 
for example  our ability to raise financial capital may be hindered due to the possibility of continuing net losses and negative cash flow in the future 
an inability to raise financial capital would limit our operating flexibility 
we are unable to predict the exact amount of cost reductions required for us to generate positive net income or cash flow from operations because we cannot accurately predict the amount of our future revenue 
our future revenue depends  in part  on future economic and market conditions  which we are unable to forecast accurately 
although we cannot accurately predict the amount of our future revenue overall  we expect that revenue from sales of desktop  mobile and server connectivity products  which represented approximately percent of total revenue for fiscal  will decline further due to pricing pressures and technological changes and trends in the networking industry 
our increasing reliance on strategic relationships may negatively impact our business 
as discussed above  in november  we formed a joint venture in china for enterprise networking products 
in addition  we recently announced alliances with crossbeam systems  inc  electronic data systems corporation eds and aspect communications corporation 
we expect to evaluate other possible strategic relationships  including joint ventures and other types of arrangements  and we may increase our reliance on such strategic relationships to complement internal development of new technologies and enhancement of existing products and to exploit perceived market opportunities 
strategic relationships can present challenges since we often compete in some business areas with companies with which we  at the same time  have strategic alliances in other business areas 
if these companies fail to perform  or if these relationships fail to materialize as expected  we could suffer delays in product or market development or other operational difficulties 
strategic relationships may also lead to potential conflicts within our distribution channel 
furthermore  our financial position or results of operations could be adversely affected if we experience difficulties managing relationships with our partners or if projects with partners are unsuccessful 
in addition  if third parties acquire our strategic partners or if our competitors enter into successful strategic relationships  we may face increased competition 
efforts to reduce operating expenses could involve further workforce reductions and lead to reduced revenue and other disruptions in our business 
our operating expenses  particularly general and administrative expenses  as a percent of revenue have been higher than our desired long term financial model 
we have taken  and will continue to take  actions to reduce these expenses 
future actions could include further reductions in our workforce  relocation of functions and activities to lower cost locations  changes or modifications in it systems or applications  or process reengineering 
as a result of these actions  the employment of some employees with critical skills might be terminated  and other employees might leave our company voluntarily due to the uncertainties associated with our business environment and their job security 
in addition  reductions in overall staffing levels might make it more difficult for us to achieve our growth objectives  to adhere to our preferred business practices and to address all of our legal and regulatory obligations in an effective manner  which could  in turn  ultimately lead to missed business opportunities  higher operating costs or penalties 
we may not respond effectively to increased competition caused by industry volatility and consolidation 
our business could be seriously harmed if we do not compete effectively 
we face competitive challenges that are likely to arise from a number of factors  including industry volatility resulting from rapid product development cycles  increasing price competition due to maturation of basic networking technologies  industry consolidation resulting in competitors with greater financial  marketing  and technical resources  the presence of existing competitors with greater financial resources together with the potential emergence of new competitors with lower cost structures and more competitive offerings  and greater competition for fewer customers as a result of consolidation in the distribution and reseller channels 
our investment in technologies which are unproven or for which we have not yet demonstrated success in the marketplace may not produce the benefits we expect 
we are making significant investments in various new technologies and product lines 
these investments have included xrn expandable resilient networking technology  gigabit ethernet technology  internet protocol ip telephony  wireless lans  layer switching  network security technology such as our embedded firewall products  and network jack switches 
we expect new products and solutions based on these technologies to contribute to future growth in our revenue 
however  the markets for some of these products and solutions are still emerging and the market potential for our products and solutions based on these technologies remains unproven 
if customer demand for our products and solutions based on these technologies does not develop as we expect  or if our sales and marketing strategies for these technologies are not effective  our financial results could be adversely affected and we might need to change our business strategy 
we may not be successful at identifying and responding to new and emerging market and product opportunities  or at responding quickly enough to technologies or markets that are in decline 
the markets in which we compete are characterized by rapid technology transitions and short product life cycles 
therefore  our success depends on our ability to identify new market and product opportunities  predict which technologies and markets will see declining demand  develop and introduce new products and solutions in a timely manner  gain market acceptance of new products and solutions  particularly in the targeted emerging markets discussed above  and rapidly and efficiently transition our customers from older to newer enterprise networking technologies 
our financial position or results of operations could suffer if we are not successful in achieving these goals 
for example  our business would suffer if there is a delay in introducing new products  there are fewer customers interested in our products than we expected  our products do not satisfy customers in terms of features  functionality or quality  or our products cost more to produce than we expect 
our business would suffer if negative effects such as these were to occur in those product markets that we have identified as emerging high growth opportunities 
one factor that may cause greater difficulty for us in quickly and effectively introducing new products with the features  functionality  quality  and costs that are optimal for the market is our increased reliance on relationships with strategic partners  such as original design manufacturers odms 
because odms manufacture the products of other companies as well as ours  the timeliness of the availability of our products depends  in part  on their production schedules 
in addition  we are relying on odms to manufacture products that meet our specifications with regard to quality and cost 
we will continue to source other products from oems and from h c 
finally  since we rely on our strategic partners  we may not be able to independently identify current product and technology trends and to respond to such trends as well as if we were working independently 
we may pursue acquisitions of other companies that  if not successful  could adversely affect our business  financial position and results of operations 
the networking business is highly competitive 
as a result  our success is dependant  in part  on our ability to meet the needs of new customers and markets by enhancing existing products and solutions  and introducing new products and solutions  on a timely basis 
our efforts to enhance existing offerings and develop new offerings include internal research and development activities  the h c joint venture  and other strategic relationships 
in the future  we may pursue acquisitions of other companies with established market access and position or promising technology and products to enhance our existing capabilities 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  including the following potential difficulties related to integrating the technologies  products and operations of the acquired company  diverting management s attention from the normal daily operations of the business  potential difficulties in completing projects associated with purchased in process research and development  entering markets in which we have no or limited direct prior experience and where competitors in such markets have stronger market positions  potential loss of key employees of the acquired company  and an uncertain revenue and earnings stream from the acquired company  which may result in unexpected dilution to our earnings 
there can be no assurances that any acquisitions that we might pursue will be successful 
if we pursue an acquisition but are not successful in completing it  or if we complete an acquisition but are not successful in integrating the acquired company s technology  products or operations successfully  our business  financial position or results of operations could be adversely affected 
a significant portion of our revenue is derived from sales to a small number of partners 
if any of these partners reduces its business with us  our business could be seriously harmed 
we distribute many of our products through two tier distribution channels that include distributors  systems integrators and vars 
a significant portion of our revenue is concentrated among a few distributors  our two largest customers accounted for a combined percent of total sales for both fiscal and fiscal and a combined percent of total sales for fiscal consolidation in our distribution channels and among personal computer manufacturers is reducing the number of customers in our domestic and international markets 
in an effort to streamline our operations  we may increase the focus of our distribution sales resources on selected distribution channel customers 
we also sell to personal computer manufacturers and telecommunications service providers 
there has been a trend of decreased demand for connectivity products from our oem customers due to increased integration of networking connections with semiconductor components  and also to factors specific to our oem customers 
we depend on distributors who maintain inventories of our products 
if the distributors reduce their inventories of our products  our revenue could be adversely affected 
our distributors maintain inventories of our products 
we work closely with our distributors to monitor channel inventory levels and ensure that appropriate levels of products are available to resellers and end users 
we have improved certain of our supply chain processes so that deliveries to our channel partners can be done more rapidly  thereby enabling our channel partners to hold fewer weeks of supply of our products in their inventory 
our target range for channel inventory levels is between four and five weeks supply on hand at our distributors 
at the end of fiscal year  channel inventory levels were at approximately weeks supply 
we expect to operate our business with no greater than weeks of channel inventory for fiscal at this level of channel inventory  some of our channel partners will hold less than the average level of inventory  and others will be at a higher level 
partners with a below average inventory level may incur stock outs that would adversely impact our revenue 
if our channel partners further reduce their levels of inventory of our products  our revenue would be negatively impacted during the period of change 
we are in the process of making adjustments to the manner in which we sell our products and services 
if those adjustments are unsuccessful  our revenue may be negatively affected 
as part of our distribution strategy  we are targeting system integrators sis  service providers sps  and enterprise vars evars 
these resellers typically have expertise in network design and implementation  which is important when deploying end to end networking infrastructure solutions in larger enterprises 
in addition to specialized technical expertise  sis  sps and evars typically offer sophisticated services capabilities that are frequently desired by larger enterprise customers 
in order to expand our distribution channel to include resellers with such capabilities  we must be able to provide effective support to these resellers 
if our services  marketing  or sales organization does not provide effective support to such sis  sps  and evars  we may not be successful in expanding our distribution model and current si  sp  and evar partners may terminate their relationships with us  which would adversely impact our revenue and overall results of operations 
our strategies to outsource all of our manufacturing requirements to contract manufacturers  and for contract manufacturers to ship directly to our customers  may not result in meeting our cost  quality or performance standards 
the inability of any contract manufacturer to meet our cost  quality or performance standards could adversely affect our revenue and overall results from operations 
the cost  quality  performance  and availability of contract manufacturing operations are and will be essential to the successful production and sale of many of our products 
the inability of any contract manufacturer to meet our cost  quality  performance  and availability standards could adversely impact our revenue and overall results of operations 
we may not be able to provide contract manufacturers with product volumes that are high enough to achieve sufficient cost savings 
if shipments fall below forecasted levels  we may incur increased costs or be required to take ownership of inventory 
in addition  a significant component of maintaining cost competitiveness is the ability of our contract manufacturers to adjust their own costs and manufacturing infrastructure to compensate for possible adverse exchange rate movements 
to the extent that the contract manufacturers are unable to do so  and we are unable to procure alternative product supplies  then our own competitiveness and results of operations could be adversely impacted 
also  our ability to control the quality of products produced by contract manufacturers may be limited and quality issues may not be resolved in a timely manner  which could adversely impact our revenue and overall results of operations 
we have implemented a program with our manufacturing partners to ship products directly from regional shipping centers to customers 
through this program  we are relying on these partners to fill customer orders in a timely manner 
this program may not yield the efficiencies that we expect  which would negatively impact our results of operations 
any disruptions to on time delivery to customers would adversely impact our revenue and overall results of operations 
we may be unable to manage our supply chain successfully  which would adversely impact our revenue  gross margin  and profitability 
current business conditions and operational challenges in managing our supply chain affect our business in a number of ways in the past  some key components have had limited availability  there are a smaller number of suppliers and we have narrowed our supplier base  including  in some cases  the sole sourcing of specific components from a single supplier  as integration of networking features on a reduced number of computer chips continues  we are increasingly facing competition from parties who are our suppliers  our ability to accurately forecast demand is diminished  especially in light of general economic weakness and uncertainty following wars and terrorist events  our significantly increased reliance on  and long term arrangements with  third party manufacturers places much of the supply chain process out of our direct control and heightens the need for accurate forecasting and reduces our ability to transition quickly to alternative supply chain strategies  and we may experience disruptions to our logistics 
some of our suppliers are also our competitors 
we cannot be certain that in the future our suppliers  particularly those who are also in active competition with us  will be able or willing to meet our demand for components in a timely and cost effective manner 
increasingly  we have been sourcing a greater number of components from a smaller number of vendors 
also  there has recently been a trend toward consolidation of vendors of electronic components 
this greater reliance on a smaller number of vendors and the inability to quickly switch vendors increase the risk of logistics disruptions  unfavorable price fluctuations  or disruptions in supply  particularly in a supply constrained environment 
more recently  supplies of certain key components  such as memory  have become tighter as industry demand for such components has increased 
this is putting upward pressure on cost as well as increasing the time necessary to obtain these components 
if this persists  we may experience an adverse impact to gross margin as costs either increase or do not decline as fast as they had in the past 
operation of the supply chain requires accurate forecasting of demand  which has become more challenging 
if overall demand for our products or the mix of demand for our products is significantly different from our expectations  we may face inadequate or excess component supply or inadequate or excess manufacturing capacity 
this would result in orders for products that could not be manufactured in a timely manner  or a buildup of inventory that could not easily be sold 
either of these situations could adversely affect our market share  revenue  results of operations or financial position 
our past and possible future decisions to exit certain product lines may have unforeseen negative impacts to our business 
we previously exited or sold some of our businesses and product lines 
in some cases  we continue to be responsible pursuant to the original warranty obligations for these products 
our exiting of these businesses and product lines may have adversely affected our relationships with channel partners and end customers 
many of these channel partners and customers perceived our remaining products as not being part of a larger integrated or complementary solution  or questioned our commitment to their markets 
consequently  they chose to purchase products from alternative vendors 
we may consider exiting other businesses or product lines that do not meet our goal of delivering satisfactory financial returns 
future decisions to exit businesses or product lines could result in deterioration of our channel partner and customer relationships  increased employee costs such as severance  outplacement and other benefits  contract termination costs  and asset impairments 
our reliance on industry standards  a favorable regulatory environment  technological change in the marketplace  and new product initiatives may cause our revenue to fluctuate or decline 
the networking industry in which we compete is characterized by rapid changes in technology and customer requirements  evolving industry standards  and complex government regulation 
as a result  our success depends on the emergence of new technology or the convergence of technologies such as data and voice networking or ip telephony  our ability to develop new products to address changes in technologies and related customer requirements on a timely basis  the timely adoption and market acceptance of industry standards  and timely resolution of conflicting us and international industry standards  our ability to influence the development of emerging industry standards and to introduce new and enhanced products that are compatible with such standards  and a favorable regulatory environment 
slow market acceptance of new technologies  products  or industry standards could adversely affect our revenue or overall financial performance 
in addition  if our technology is not included in an industry standard on a timely basis or if we fail to achieve timely certification of compliance to industry standards for our products  our revenue from sales of such products or our overall financial performance could be adversely affected 
our customer order fulfillment capabilities fluctuate and may negatively impact our operating results 
the timing and amount of our sales depend on a number of factors that make estimating future operating results difficult 
throughout our business  we do not typically maintain a significant amount of backlog  and sales are partially dependent on our ability to appropriately forecast product demand 
in addition  our customers historically request fulfillment of orders in a short time period  resulting in limited visibility to sales trends and potential pricing pressures 
consequently  our operating results depend on the volume and timing of orders and our ability to fulfill orders in a timely manner 
historically  sales in the third month of the quarter have been higher than sales in each of the first two months of the quarter 
non linear sales patterns make business planning difficult  and increase the risk that our quarterly results will fluctuate due to disruptions in functions such as manufacturing  order management  information systems  and shipping 
we may not be able to defend ourselves successfully against claims that we are infringing the intellectual property rights of others 
many of our competitors  such as telecommunications  networking  and computer equipment manufacturers  have large intellectual property portfolios  including patents that may cover technologies that are relevant to our business 
in addition  many smaller companies  universities  and individual inventors have obtained or applied for patents in areas of technology that may relate to our business 
the industry is moving towards aggressive assertion  licensing  and litigation of patents and other intellectual property rights 
in the course of our business  we frequently receive claims of infringement or otherwise become aware of potentially relevant patents or other intellectual property rights held by other parties 
we evaluate the validity and applicability of these intellectual property rights  and determine in each case whether we must negotiate licenses or cross licenses to incorporate or use the proprietary technologies  protocols  or specifications in our products 
if we are unable to obtain and maintain licenses on favorable terms for intellectual property rights required for the manufacture  sale  and use of our products  particularly those that must comply with industry standard protocols and specifications to be commercially viable  our financial position or results of operations could be adversely affected 
in addition  if we are alleged to infringe the intellectual property rights of others  we could be required to seek licenses from others or be prevented from manufacturing or selling our products  which could cause disruptions to our operations or the markets in which we compete 
we may need to engage in complex and costly litigation in order to protect or maintain our intellectual property rights 
in addition to disputes relating to the validity or alleged infringement of other parties rights  we may become involved in disputes relating to our assertion of our intellectual property rights 
whether we are defending the assertion of intellectual property rights against us  or asserting our intellectual property rights against others  intellectual property litigation can be complex  costly  protracted  and highly disruptive to business operations by diverting the attention and energies of management and key technical personnel 
further  plaintiffs in intellectual property cases often seek injunctive relief and the measures of damages in intellectual property litigation are complex and often subjective or uncertain 
thus  the existence of this type of litigation  or any adverse determinations related to such litigation  could subject us to significant liabilities and costs 
if any of our oem  odm  or joint venture partners become involved in intellectual property disputes and are unable to hold us harmless  then we may incur liabilities or suffer temporary disruption of our business 
any one of these factors could adversely affect our revenue  gross margin  overall results of operations  cash flow or financial position 
our future quarterly operating results are subject to factors that can cause fluctuations in our stock price 
historically  our stock price has experienced substantial volatility 
we expect that our stock price may continue to experience volatility in the future due to a variety of potential factors such as fluctuations in our quarterly results of operations and cash flow  changes in our cash and short term investment balances  variations between our actual financial results and the published analysts expectations  and announcements by our competitors 
in addition  over the past several quarters  the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected the stock prices of many technology companies 
these factors  as well as general economic and political conditions or investors concerns regarding the credibility of corporate financial statements and the accounting profession  may have a material adverse affect on the market price of our stock in the future 
we focus primarily on enterprise networking  and our results of operations may fluctuate based on factors related entirely to conditions in this market 
in fiscal  we began operating in a single business segment focused primarily on enterprise networking 
this single enterprise networking business reflects a streamlined management and operating structure encompassing all of our operations  including our connectivity business that we previously operated and reported as a separate segment and which we expect will continue to diminish 
our focus on enterprise networking may cause increased risk or volatility associated with decreased diversification of our business 
there will be increased sensitivity to the business risks associated specifically with the enterprise networking market and our ability to execute successfully on our strategies to provide superior solutions for larger and multi site enterprise environments 
to be successful in the enterprise networking market  we will need to overcome negative perceptions of our company held by certain chief information officers of large enterprises  who may be skeptical of our long term commitment to the high end networking business as a result of our withdrawal from that business in fiscal also  expansion of sales to large enterprises may be disruptive in a variety of ways  such as adding larger systems integrators that may raise channel conflict issues with existing distributors  or a perception of any diminished focus on the small and medium enterprise market 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk disclosures 
the following discussion about our market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  and equity security price risk 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
interest rate sensitivity 
our short term investments consist mainly of fixed income securities with a weighted average maturity of less than one year 
these available for sale securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by ten percent from levels at may   the fair value of our short term investments would decline by an immaterial amount 
we currently have the ability and intention to hold our fixed income investments until maturity and  therefore  we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by a sudden change in market interest rates 
if necessary  we may sell short term investments prior to maturity to implement management strategies and meet our liquidity needs 
the current portion of long term lease obligations was million as of may  we had no long term lease obligations  or other long term debt as of may  or may  we do not hedge any interest rate exposures 
foreign currency exchange risk 
we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge certain balance sheet exposures and intercompany balances against future movements in foreign exchange rates 
we attempt to reduce the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on corporate financial results by hedging existing foreign currency exposures and anticipated foreign currency transactions expected to occur within one month 
anticipated foreign currency transaction exposures with a maturity profile in excess of one month may be selectively hedged 
translation exposures are not hedged 
gains and losses on the forward contracts are largely offset by gains and losses on the underlying exposure 
a hypothetical ten percent appreciation of the us dollar from may  market rates would increase the unrealized value of our forward contracts by million 
conversely  a hypothetical ten percent depreciation of the us dollar from may  market rates would decrease the unrealized value of our forward contracts by million 
the gains or losses on the forward contracts are largely offset by the gains or losses on the underlying transactions and consequently a sudden or significant change in foreign exchange rates would not have a material impact on future net income or cash flows 
equity security price risk 
we hold publicly traded equity securities that are subject to market price volatility 
equity security price fluctuations of plus or minus percent would not have had a material impact on the value of these securities held at may
