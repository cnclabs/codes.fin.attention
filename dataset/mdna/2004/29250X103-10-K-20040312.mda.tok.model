accounting for investment in enbridge energy partners  lp enbridge management uses the equity method of accounting for its ownership interest in the partnership s net income and comprehensive income because it exercises significant influence over the partnership 
enbridge management s share of earnings of the partnership is recorded in the period in which it is earned 
as of december  and  enbridge management owned approximately and in the partnership  respectively 
enbridge management s ownership percentage changes as i units are distributed 
changes in the calculation of the ownership percentage affect the net income and comprehensive income of enbridge management 
gain on issuance of units by enbridge energy partners  lp enbridge management recognizes a gain or loss when its ownership interest in the partnership is diluted 
this occurs when the partnership issues additional class a common units and enbridge management does not participate in the issuance 
to the extent the new issuance price per unit is greater than or less than enbridge management s average cost per unit  a gain loss is recognized 
off balance sheet arrangements enbridge management has no off balance sheet arrangements 
results of operations our results of operations consist of our share of earnings of the partnership attributable to the i units we own 
at december  and  through our ownership of i units  we owned an approximate and limited partner interest in the partnership  respectively 
as we manage the partnership on behalf of the general partner  we use the equity method of accounting for our investment and  therefore  we recorded earnings equal to our ownership percentage of the partnership s limited partners net income 
our percentage ownership in the partnership will change over time as the number of i units we own becomes a different percentage of the total units outstanding due to our ownership of additional i units and other issuances of additional common units by the partnership 
for the years ended december  and  the partnership reported net income of million and million  respectively 
our net income of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  represents equity in earnings attributable to the i units that we own  plus the dilution gain from the partnership s issuance of units  reduced by deferred income tax expense 
deferred income tax expense is calculated based on the difference between the accounting and tax values of our investment in the partnership and the federal income tax rate of of our share of the earnings of the partnership 
both basic and diluted earnings per share are calculated as our net income divided by our weighted average number of outstanding shares during the period 
there are no securities outstanding that may be converted into or exercised for shares 
liquidity and capital resources our authorized capital structure consists of two classes of membership interests our listed shares  which represent limited liability company interests with limited voting rights  and our voting shares 
at december   our issued capitalization consisted of cash contributed by the general partner in connection with our formation in exchange for its voting equity interest  and million associated with our  outstanding listed shares 
at december   our issued capitalization consisted of cash contributed by the general partner in connection with our formation in exchange for its voting equity interest and million associated with our  outstanding listed shares 
the number of our shares outstanding  including the voting shares owned by the general partner  will at all times equal the number of i units we own 
we used substantially all of the net proceeds from our initial public offering to purchase i units from the partnership and to compensate enbridge the ultimate parent company of the general partner for its purchase provisions and tax indemnities 
under the enbridge purchase provisions  which are a part of enbridge management s limited liability company agreement  enbridge has the right  under limited circumstances  to purchase enbridge management s outstanding shares 
in addition  enbridge generally agreed to indemnify enbridge management for any tax liability attributable to the formation of enbridge management  its management of the partnership or its ownership of the i units 
as well  enbridge generally agreed to indemnify enbridge management for any taxes arising from a transaction involving the i units to the extent the transaction does not generate sufficient cash to pay such taxes  in each case  other than any texas franchise taxes or any other foreign  state or local taxes that are required to be paid or reimbursed by the partnership under the delegation of control agreement 
the number of our shares outstanding  including the voting shares owned by the general partner  will at all times equal the number of i units in the partnership that we own 
typically  the general partner and owners of common units receive distributions from the partnership in cash 
instead of receiving cash distributions  however  the number of i units we own increases automatically under the partnership s partnership agreement 
the amount of this increase is calculated by dividing the distribution per unit by the closing price of one of our listed shares on the nyse as determined for a trading day period ending on the trading day immediately prior to the ex dividend date for our listed shares 
at the same time that the number of i units we own increases  we will make a distribution on our shares in the form of additional shares  with the result that the number of shares that are then outstanding will equal the number of i units that we own 
if we incur liabilities or other obligations in connection with the performance of our obligations under the delegation of control agreement  we are entitled to be reimbursed or to be indemnified by the partnership or the general partner 
thus  we expect that our expenditures associated with managing the business and affairs of the partnership and the reimbursement of these expenses that we receive will continue to be equal 
as stated above  we do not receive quarterly distributions of cash on the i units we hold 
therefore  we expect neither to generate nor to require significant amounts of cash in ongoing operations 
any net cash proceeds we receive from the sale of additional shares will immediately be used to purchase additional i units 
accordingly  we do not anticipate any other sources of or needs for additional liquidity 
we are not permitted to borrow money or incur debt other than with enbridge and its affiliates without the approval of holders owning at least a majority of our shares 
income taxes enbridge management is a limited liability company that has elected to be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for temporary differences between the basis of our assets and liabilities for financial reporting and tax purposes 
changes in tax legislation are included in the relevant computations for the period in which such changes are effective 
currently  our only temporary difference and associated deferred tax expense results from recording our equity in the earnings of the partnership 
the effective tax rate used in computing our income tax provision is  which represents the federal statutory rate 
we are a party to a tax indemnification agreement with enbridge 
pursuant to this tax indemnification agreement  enbridge agreed to indemnify us from any tax liability attributable to our formation or our management of the business and affairs of the partnership 
enbridge also agreed to indemnify us and from any taxes arising out of a transaction involving the i units we own to the extent the transaction does not generate sufficient cash to pay our taxes with respect to such transaction in each case  other than any texas franchise taxes or any other foreign  state or local taxes that are required to be paid or reimbursed by the partnership under the delegation of control agreement
