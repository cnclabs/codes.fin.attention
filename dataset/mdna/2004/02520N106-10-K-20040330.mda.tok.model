critical accounting policies the securities and exchange commission defines critical accounting policies as those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which we refer to as gaap  requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies  including making estimates and assumptions 
these judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different  it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied resulting in a different presentation of our financial statements 
below is a discussion of accounting policies  which we consider criti cal in that they may require complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters  which are inherently uncertain 
sales  profit recognition and cost capitalization community development land sales are recognized at closing only when sufficient down payments have been obtained  possession and other attributes of ownership have been transferred to the buyer  and acpt has no significant continuing involvement 
home sale revenues are recognized upon settlement with the homebuyers 
the costs of acquiring and developing land are allocated to our land assets and charged to cost of sales as the related inventories are sold 
the cost of acquiring the land and construction of the condominiums are allocated to these assets and charged to cost of sales as the condominiums are sold 
the cost of sales is determined by the relative sales value method  which relies on estimated costs and sales values 
residential and commercial land sales can be highly cyclical 
once development is undertaken  no assurances can be given that the company will be able to sell the various developed lots or condominiums in a timely manner 
failure to sell such homes and lots in a timely manner could result in significantly increased carrying costs and erosion or elimination of profit with respect to any development 
even though our cost estimates are based on outside engineers cost estimates  historical cost and actual development and construction costs can exceed estimates for various reasons  including but not limited to unknown site conditions  rising prices and changes in government regulations 
any estimates of such costs may differ substantially from the actual results of such costs and reduce or eliminate the future profits with respect to any development 
acpt s interest costs related to land assets are allocated to our land assets based on their development stage and relative book value 
the portion of interest allocated to land during the development and construction period is capitalized to the extent of qualifying assets 
remaining interest costs are expensed 
the interest incurred on the land acquisition and construction loan is capitalized to the extent of qualifying assets 
impairment of long lived assets in august  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas requires that one accounting model be used for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale and broadens the presentation of discontinued operations 
on a quarterly basis  acpt evaluates the carrying value of its long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
in cases where management is holding for sale particular properties  impairment is assessed on whether the net realizable value estimated sales price less costs of disposal of each individual property to be sold is less than the net book value 
otherwise  acpt assesses impairment of its real estate properties based on whether it is probable that undiscounted future cash flows from each individual property will be less than its net book value 
if a property is impaired  its basis is adjusted to its fair market value 
depreciation of investments in real estate we are required to make assessments as to the useful lives of our real estate assets for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation to reflect on our income statement on an annual basis 
our assessments  all of which are judgmental determinations  of our investments in our real estate assets are as follows buildings and improvements are depreciated over five to forty years using the straight line or double declining balance methods  furniture  fixtures and equipment over five to seven years using the straight line method deferred expenses are amortized over the period of estimated benefit using the straight line method 
income taxes the company s tax structure is a complex one that involves foreign source income  multiple entities that do not file a consolidated return and multiple entities with different tax structures 
due to the complex nature of our tax structure  our income tax expense and related balance sheet amounts involve significant management estimates and judgments 
contingencies the company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business 
these matters are frequently covered by insurance 
if it has been determined that a loss is probable to occur  the estimated amount of the loss is expensed in the financial statements 
while the resolution of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty  management believes the final outcome of such matters will not have a material adverse effect on the financial position or results of operations of the company 
results of operations the following discussion is based on the consolidated financial statements of the company 
it compares the results of operations for our us operations and our puerto rico operations for the three years ended december   and historically  the company s financial results have been significantly affected by the cyclical nature of the real estate industry 
accordingly  the company s historical financial statements may not be indicative of future results

land sales revenue in any one period is affected by the mix of lot sizes and  to a greater extent  the mix between residential and commercial sales 
residential lots are sold to homebuilders in bulk pursuant to the terms of options contracts that are secured by cash deposits or letters of credit 
sales are closed on a lot by lot basis at the time when the builder purchases the lot 
residential lots can vary in size and location resulting in pricing differences 
gross profit margins of residential lots are fairly consistent within any given village in st 
charles 
commercial land is typically sold by contract that allows for a study period and delayed settlement until the purchaser obtains the necessary permits for development 
the sales prices and gross margins for commercial parcels vary significantly depending on the location  size  extent of development and ultimate use 
commercial land sales are cyclical and usually have a noticeable positive effect on our earnings in the period they reach settlement 
compared to revenues community development land sales revenue decreased in to  from  in residential land sales during  we sold standard size single family lots for an average sales price of  compared to standard size single family lots which sold for an average sales price of  small single family lots for an average sales price of  and townhome lots for an average sales price of  during the same period of the decrease in residential lots sold during compared to is attributable to state mandated changes in storm water management regulations that forced us to reengineer our design plans  thus delaying the development and release of the next parcel of land in fairway village 
the sales price of the standard single family lot increased in pursuant to escalation provisions in the sales contracts and price increases 
at december  we had one single family lot in backlog  located inside the model park  at a base selling price of  we commenced development of the next parcel of land in fairway village that contains a total of lots 
t hese lots are expected to be developed and ready for sale by the second quarter of commercial land sales during  we sold acres of commercial land for sales prices that ranged from to per square foot compared to acres of commercial land for sales prices that ranged from to per square foot for the same period in our commercial land sales included the sale of a seven acre parcel for retail use for per square foot  we did not have a comparable sale in the average sales prices of these parcels differ due to their location  use and level of development 
as of december   acres for a total of  are in backlog 
future sales in november  we reached a joint venture agreement with the us home corporation to develop as many as units in an active adult community in the gleneagles neighborhood in fairway village 
we are currently in the engineering phase for infrastructure improvements and expect the joint venture to commence during second quarter of gross profit gross profit is defined as land sales revenue less cost of sales 
the combined gross profit of our community development operations for decreased to from s gross profit of 
the decrease was primarily attributable to the use and location of our commercial and industrial land sold during the respective periods 
the gross profit in was also negatively impacted by the reduced sales volume of our residential and commercial land as well as an additional  of costs incurred related to a parcel of land sold in a prior year 
the decrease was offset by price increases for our fairway residential lots resulting in gross profit margins of in as compared to in during  the gross profit margins on the commercial parcels sold ranged from to compared to to earned in in  we closed on a seven acre parcel for retail use  which produced a gross profit margin due to its higher selling price and limited site improvements with n o comparable sale in the period 
during  we sold six acres located in our industrial parks developed in the s and s 
since that time  the county and state development requirements have continued to change requiring additional development to deliver the lots for final use 
the increased carrying costs and additional development have eroded the profits resulting in a less than gross margin for those parcels 
compared to revenues community development land sales revenue decreased in to  from  in residential land sales during  we sold standard size single family lots which sold for an average sales price of  small single family lots for an average sales price of  and townhome lots for an average sales price of  compared to standard size single family lots for an average sales price of  small single family lots for an average sales price of  townhome lots for an average price of  the decrease in residential lots sold during compared to is attributable to the fact that during the last three years demand for lots in charles county has increased while the supply has decreased 
we incurred hurdles in obtaining permits from the county on a timely basis to deliver a steady supply of lots 
pursuant to a agreement with charles county  we will be able to obtain permits for residential lots per year through the sales prices of the standard single family lot increased a slight in commercial land sales during  we sold acres of commercial land for sales prices that ranged from to per square foot compared to acres of commercial land for sales prices that ranged from to per square foot for the same period in the average sales prices of these parcels differ due to their location  use and level of development 
gross profit the combined gross profit for was  a decrease from s gross profit of 
these variations are a result of the change in mix of sales between years and the quality of the commercial sales 
during  of the total sales revenue was generated by residential sales compared to in typically commercial sales outside of fairway village produce a greater gross profit margin than the residential lots 
the margins for the residential lots in fairway have increased from in to in these increases are primarily a result of the sales prices in fairway village escalating at a rate greater than the expected development costs 
during  the townhome lots in smallwood village were sold out 
these lots produced a gross profit margin during the last two years that ranged from to 
these margins were lower than our typical residential margins due to location and changes in the county s regulations 
the gross profit margin of the significant commercial s ale was  less than expected due to the unexpected costs of moving major utility lines from the purchaser s development path 
recent developments on march   we executed an agreement with a major homebuilder to purchase approximately  residential lots in fairway village 
pursuant to the terms of this agreement  the builder is required to purchase  at a minimum  residential lots developed by the company on a cumulative basis per year 
the price of the lots will be based on a formula using the base sales price of the homes sold by the builder 
based on lot sales per year  it is estimated that settlements will take place over the next ten years 
rental property revenues and operating results us operations certain of the apartment properties in which we hold an ownership interest qualify for the consolidation method of accounting 
as a result  the apartment property s entire revenue and expenses are reflected in our financial statements with the portion of net income attributable to outside owners reflected as minority interest 
ten properties were consolidated during compared to seven properties during and the consolidation of the three additional properties resulted from the acquisitions of controlling interests in bannister december  village lake january and coachman s january 
five of the properties are market rent properties  allowing us to determine the appropriate rental rates 
even though we can determine the rents  a portion of our units must be leased to tenants with low to moderate income 
hud subsidizes three of the properties and two properties are a mix of subsidized units and market rent units 
hud dictates the rents of the subsidized units 
the company s share of the consolidated housing partnerships net income rental property revenue net of operating expenses  interest expense  depreciation and amortization and minority interest increased to  in compared to  in and  in the overall increase in revenues and expenses in is primarily the result of the consolidation of the three additional properties as described above 
compared to on a comparable basis of properties between years  the net income generated from the consolidated apartment partnerships operations for was  as compared to  for the gross potential rent of the fair market properties in increased  on average  due to favorable market conditions while subsidized rents increased on average as allowed by hud 
the increases we experienced in our gross potential rents were partially offset by the increase in repairs and maintenance expenses incurred at our apartment property buildings during we also saw an increase in our bad debt expense along with additional interest expense and mortgage insurance expenses incurred related to the debt refinancing of one of our investment properties 
compared to in  market conditions allowed us to increase our market rate rents over s rents while the subsidized rents increased by 
operating expenses increased in and in the increase in operating expenses in compared to is primarily due to historic high increases in commercial insurance for rental properties and increased maintenance costs as we push to improve the value of the properties 
in  the increase in the subsidies did not cover the increased cost of insurance and operating cost 
in addition  during one property incurred a fire loss in excess of its insurance coverage of  equity in earnings from partnerships and sponsor and developer fees us operations the results of our share of earnings from the partnerships that do not qualify for the consolidated method of accounting are reflected in this section 
the affect on earnings varies from partnership to partnership  depending on our investment book basis in the property  where the partnership is in the earnings stream  whether or not the limited partners have recovered their capital contribution  the partnership s ability to distribute cash and the amortization of any sponsor and developer fees 
compared to equity in earnings from partnerships and sponsor and developer fees increased  during to  as compared to  for the same period in the increase in our earnings in the most recent fiscal year is primarily a result of distributions in excess of basis   that we recognized in in conjunction with the refinancing of one of our partnership s mortgage 
in  the effect of the refinancing was partially offset by the fact that all of our deferred developer fees were fully amortized into income in secondly  our prior year s earnings reflected our equity pick up from bannister  which at that time was not consolidated for accounting purposes 
the increases in the refinancing proceeds were also offset by increases in interest expense and mortgage insurance premiums from the refinancing of crossland as well as an overall increase in property rehab costs and hazard insurance premiums 
compared to in  we recognized a decrease in income from the apartment properties compared to primarily due to a fire loss in one subsidized property that exceeded the insurance coverage and one month s lost subsidy in another property during the conversion to market rents 
our share of this fire loss was  since the fire  we have switched insurance carriers and coverage limits to prevent this from recurring in the future 
occupancy rates remained stable in compared to in  one subsidized property received a retroactive increase in its subsidies and our share of cash flow from one property increased to from after the limited partners recovered their initial investment in the third quarter of on december   we purchased the limited partners interest in this property  refinanced the property and commenced a conversion from a hud interest subsidy to a market rate property 
the property was successfully converted to a market rate property and is now a par t of our consolidated investment portfolio 
during   of architect fees was written off when an updated product design was selected for our next apartment complex 
in  we evaluated a potential acquisition to our apartment investment portfolio 
the complex did not meet our acquisition requirements  resulting in the write off of the  incurred during this process 
management and other fees us operations we earn a revenue based monthly management fee from the apartment properties that we manage  including four properties owned by or an affiliate company of j 
michael wilson 
we receive an additional fee from these properties as well as the properties in puerto rico for their use of the property management computer system that we purchased at the end of and a fee for vehicles purchased by the company used on behalf of the properties 
the cost of the computer system and vehicles are reflected within depreciation expense 
this section includes only the fees earned from the properties that are not consolidated 
compared to management and other fees earned for the year ended december  were  a decrease compared to  of fees earned in the fiscal year s decrease is primarily the result of  of management fees from bannister  coachman s and village lake recognized in but eliminated upon consolidation in this decrease was offset in part by the following an increase in partnership rental revenue earned in two of the apartment properties that we manage recognition of a special management fee in conjunction with the refinancing of one of the partnership s mortgage in and an increase in computer service income since the new software was in service for a full year in as compared to a partial year in compared to management fees increased in compared to as a result of an increase in the monthly management fee from a wilson family owned property from to and increased rental revenues earned by the apartment properties 
general  administrative  selling and marketing expense us operations the costs associated with the oversight of our us operations  accounting  human resources  office management and technology  as well as corporate and other executive office costs are included in this section 
armc employs the centralized office management approach for its property management services for properties located in st 
charles  maryland and to a lessor extent the other managed properties 
the apartment properties reimburse armc for certain costs incurred at the central office that are attributable to the operations of those properties 
in accordance with eitf topic  income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred the cost and reimbursement of these costs are not included in general and administrative expenses  but rather they are reflected as separate line items on the consolidated income statement 
in  our company maintained a policy of allocating corporate overhead charges incurred at the executive office to the puerto rico operations 
effective january   we no longer allocate these expenses to the puerto rico operations for reporting and management purposes 
compared to general  administrative  selling and marketing costs incurred within our us operations increased in to  for the year ended december   compared to  for the same period of the year to date increase reflects additional compensation expense on incentive rights of approximately  as a result of the increases that we experienced in our share price this year  especially during the third and fourth quarters when the closing price ranged from to 
the increase is also the result of an additional  of bad debt expense that we recorded in the current year on accounts receivable balances in two of our properties 
during the most recent fiscal year we saw an increase in other administrative costs such as general liability insurance premiums  and directors officers insurance premiums as a result of the escalating prices imposed by the insurance industry 
the remainder of the increase is composed of a rise in audit and legal fees as well as additional staffing hired in related to the increased corporate governance regulations for public companies  as well as the absence in of a bad debt recovery compared to the  recovery in compared to general  administrative  selling and marketing costs incurred in the us remained relatively stable during  and despite rising prices 
during  certain related party transactions and staffing shortages in puerto rico required additional support from the us office 
the allocation of these costs to the puerto rico operations produced a cost reduction attributable to the us operations 
in  reductions in our share price resulted in a decrease in compensation expense compared to interest expense us operations the interest related to the us recourse debt  exclusive of debt related to the apartment properties  is allocated to the qualifying land inventory based on its book balance 
any excess interest  interest on capital leases and amortization of certain loan fees are reflected as interest expense 
compared to interest expense decreased approximately  to  for the year ended december   compared to  for the same period in as a result of a reduction in our interest expense recognized on the outstanding balances of our capital leases and vehicle notes offset by an increase in the amortization of loan fees in compared to in  interest expense decreased compared to overall interest expense declined during that period a result of the overall reduction in prime lending rate and debt refinanced at a reduced borrowing rate 
the increase in was primarily due to the recognition of  of unamortized loan fees and warrants when we refinanced a  term loan 
provision for income taxes us operations the effective tax rates for  and are  and respectively 
the federal and state statutory rate is 
the difference between the statutory rate and the effective rate for is related to the combined effect of permanent items while the difference for is related to an increase in the calculated tax benefit of certain investments in subsidiaries

debt guarantees and other obligations acpt and its subsidiaries typically provide guarantees for another subsidiary s loan or letters of credit 
in many cases more than one company guarantees the same debt 
all of these companies are consolidated and the debt or other financial commitment is included in acpt s consolidated financial statements 
these guarantees should not impair our ability to conduct our business through our subsidiaries or to pursue our development plans 
impact of inflation and changing prices inflation has been moderate in recent years 
in general  we attempt to minimize any inflationary effect by increasing our market rents  land prices and home prices 
however  in recent history  the increases in the hud subsidies have not offset the increase in the costs to insure  operate and maintain the properties having a negative impact on our cash flow 
intercompany dividend restrictions certain of our debt and regulatory agreements require us to abide by covenants which  among other things  limit the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or distributions 
the regulatory agreements governing the apartment properties limit the dividend to annual or semi annual distributions of no more than surplus cash 
in addition  the distributions of properties are limited to a specified annual cumulative rate of return ranging from to 
lender approval is required prior to lda or brisas making any cash distributions in excess of distributions to pay income taxes on lda s and brisas s generated taxable income  unless certain conditions exist that provide for adequate working capital for debt service and operations for the following twelve months 
these restrictions are not expected to impair our ability to conduct our business through our subsidiaries or to pursue our development plans 
insurance and risk of uninsured loss we carry various lines of insurance coverage for all of our investment properties  including property insurance and believe that we are adequately covered against normal risks 
these policies  and other insurance policies we carry  have policy specifications  insured limits and deductibles that we consider commercially reasonable 
we renewed our insurance coverage on may  for our puerto rico operations and october  for our us operations for one year policy terms 
although the insurance coverage provided for in the renewal policies did not materially change from the preceding year  our premium costs decreased by as compared to the prior term 
the deductible on our property insurance is  the deductibles for all other policies range from to  the deductible for the directors and officers d o liability policy is  for securities claims and  for all other claims 
in november  congress passed the terrorism risk insurance act tria which is designed to make terrorism insurance available

our general liability policy provides tria coverage subject to deductibles and insured limits for liability to third parties that result from terrorist acts at our properties 
mold growth may occur when excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials  particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time 
although the occurrence of mold at multifamily and other structures  and the need to remediate such mold  is not a new phenomenon  there has been increased awareness in recent years that certain molds may in some instances lead to adverse health effects  including allergic or other reactions 
to help limit mold growth  we educate residents about the importance of adequate ventilation and request or require that they notify us when they see mold or excessive moisture 
we have established procedures for promptly addressing and remediating mold or excessive moisture from apartment homes when we become aware of its presence regardless of whether we or the resident believe a health risk is present 
however  we cannot assure that mold or excessive moisture will be detected and remediated in a timely manner 
if a sig nificant mold problem arises at one of our properties  we could be required to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold from the affected community and could be exposed to other liabilities 
we cannot assure that we will have coverage under our existing policies for property damage or liability to third parties arising as a result of exposure to mold or a claim of exposure to mold at one of our apartment properties 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the use of financial instruments  such as debt instruments  subjects our company to market risks  which may affect our future earnings and cash flows as well as the fair value of our assets 
market risk generally refers to the risk of loss from changes in interest rates and market prices 
we are exposed to market risk primarily due to fluctuations in interest rates 
we utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt 
for fixed rate debt  changes in interest rates generally affect the fair market value of the debt instrument  but not our earnings or cash flow 
conversely  for variable rate debt  changes in interest rates generally do not impact the fair market value of the debt instrument but do affect our earnings and cash flow 
it is the company s policy to minimize the impact of variable rate debt to the greatest extent possible by pursuing equity and long term fixed rate financing and refinancings of current fixed rate debt at lower rates when favorable market conditions exist 
the fo llowing table provides information about the company s financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the table presents the company s debt obligations  principal repayments  related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates and fair values 
the company has no derivative financial instruments 
we believe that the change in the fair value of our financial instruments resulting from a foreseeable fluctuation in interest rates would be immaterial to our total assets and total liabilities
