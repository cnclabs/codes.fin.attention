item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview quovadx is a global software and services firm that helps more than  enterprise customers worldwide develop  extend and integrate applications based on open standards 
quovadx serves companies in healthcare  financial services  telecommunications  the public sector  manufacturing  and life sciences 
we believe that we have the opportunity to sell additional products into this large customer base 
we generate revenue from three segments software licenses  professional services  and recurring revenue 
the software license segment includes revenue from perpetual software license sales and from software subscriptions 
the professional services segment includes revenue generated from software implementation  development  and integration 
the recurring revenue segment includes revenue generated from hosting  maintenance  transaction  and other recurring services 
acquisitions have historically been part of our growth strategy and we completed two acquisitions in on september   quovadx acquired the outstanding stock of carescience  inc carescience 
carescience  inc 
is primarily a provider of care management services to hospitals and health systems 
carescience stockholders received a fixed exchange rate of cash and shares of quovadx s common stock for each share of carescience common stock they owned 
the total purchase price for this acquisition was million  including  shares of quovadx common stock  cash of million  net of cash acquired  and million in merger related costs 
on december   quovadx acquired the outstanding stock of rogue wave software  inc rogue wave 
rogue wave develops  markets and supports object oriented and infrastructure software technology 
the acquisition  structured as an exchange offer  resulted in quovadx acquiring all of the outstanding stock of rogue wave for in cash and of a share of quovadx common stock for each share of rogue wave common stock 
the total purchase price for this acquisition was million  including  shares of quovadx common stock  exchange of stock options valued at million  cash of million net of cash acquired and million in merger related costs 
on march   we issued a press release announcing material revisions to our previously announced unaudited financial results for the third and fourth quarters of these revisions concern shipments to infotech network group infotech  a consortium of indian information technology companies  in the third and fourth quarters of we believed at the time of the shipments that collection of the receivable was probable due to the establishment of a credit line by infotech that could be used for payment 
since the shipments of software product  however  we have encountered unanticipated delays in obtaining payment from infotech 
based on further analysis of infotech s ability to pay for the software purchased  the accounting for the revenue recognized has been revised from an accrual to a cash basis 
as a result  we have materially restated our previously announced financial results for the third and fourth quarters of by the deletion of all revenue and commissions that had been recorded related to infotech 
critical accounting policies and estimates the consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
the company relied on significant estimates in preparing the financial statements in allocating the purchase price of its acquisitions to the assets and liabilities acquired and to evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for bad 
table of contents debt  the percentage of completion of fixed priced professional service contracts  the recoverability of deferred tax assets and the recoverability of capitalized software costs 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the company believes that the following accounting policies involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
revenue the company recognizes revenue in accordance with the provisions of statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended  and sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
our license agreements generally provide that customers pay a license fee based on a specified number of instances of the software and the type of software modules licensed 
customers that purchase licenses generally enter into renewable one year maintenance agreements that entitle the customer to receive unspecified updates on the licensed software  error corrections and telephone support  generally for a fixed fee 
the methodology the company uses to recognize software license and related services revenue is dependent on whether the company has established vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value for the separate elements of a multiple element agreement 
if an agreement includes both license and service elements  the license fee is recognized on delivery of the software if the remaining services are not essential to the functionality of the software  the collection of the fees is probable  the fees are fixed and determinable  an agreement is signed and the company has established vsoe of fair value for the remaining services 
revenue from the related services is recognized as the services are provided 
when the related services are essential to the functionality of the base product  or when the company has not established vsoe of fair value for the remaining services  the software license fees are deferred and the entire contract is recognized as the services are provided 
utilizing the criteria provided in sop  we evaluate the vendor specific objective evidence for contracts to determine the fair value of elements delivered in situations where multiple element arrangements exist 
professional services revenue represents software development  implementation and consulting services 
when derived from a fixed price contract  and collection of fees is probable  the company recognizes professional services revenue using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
when derived from a time and materials contract  and the collection of fees is probable  the company recognizes professional services revenue as the services are provided 
when revenue is recognized using the percentage of completion basis of accounting  the company s management estimates the costs to complete the services to be provided under the contract 
because the percentage of completion method is an estimation process  it has risks and uncertainties 
the company may encounter budget and schedule overruns caused by external factors beyond our control such as the utilization and efficiency of our consultants and the complexity of our customers it environment 
adjustments to cost estimates are made in the period in which the facts requiring such revisions become known 
estimated losses  if any  are recorded in the period in which the current estimates of the costs to complete the services exceed the revenue to be recognized under the contract 
maintenance revenue is derived from agreements for providing unspecified software updates  error corrections and telephone support 
maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the maintenance period  which is generally months 
process management and services revenue represent application hosting  transaction processing and other services 
when the fees are fixed and determinable  and collection of the fees is probable  revenue is recognized over the service period 
when the fees are charged on a per transaction basis and collection of the fees is probable  revenue is recognized as the transactions are processed 
when collection of fees is not probable  revenue is recognized as cash is collected 
the company does not require collateral from its customers 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of certain customers to pay their accounts receivable balances 
the company assesses financial condition of its customers to determine if there is an impairment of their ability to make payments and additional allowances may be required if the financial condition of the company s customers deteriorates 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in order to determine the realization of our receivables  including assessing the likelihood of collection and the creditworthiness of each customer 
purchase accounting in connection with acquisitions  we assess the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
items such as accounts receivable  property and equipment  other intangible assets  certain accrued liabilities  and other reserves require a high degree of management judgment 
the company recorded million of goodwill resulting from its acquisitions 
effective january   sfas no 
requires that goodwill be tested annually for impairment and more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate assets might be impaired 
a significant decline in our stock price  projected revenue  projected earnings growth or projected cash flows are examples of such circumstances 
the impairment test involves the use of estimates related to the fair value of the reporting units with which the goodwill is associated 
the estimate of fair value requires significant judgment  including future cash flows and discount rates 
any loss resulting from an impairment test would be reflected in our statements of operations 
in connection with our acquisitions  we are required to recognize other intangible assets separate and apart from goodwill if such assets arise from contractual or other legal rights or if such assets are separable from the acquired businesses 
other intangible assets include  developed technology  customer related assets such as order backlog  and trade name 
determining a fair value for such items requires a high degree of judgment  assumptions  and estimates  including future cash flows generated from the assets and discount rates 
in certain situations  where deemed necessary  we may use third parties to assist us with such valuations 
in addition  these intangible assets are to be amortized over the best estimate of their useful life 
at december   we had intangible assets of  net of amortization 
we have estimated amounts for direct costs of our acquisitions  merger related expenses  and liabilities related to our business combinations in accordance with emerging issues task force issue  recognition of liabilities in connection with a purchase combination 
we also recorded significant acquisition related restructuring charges  in connection with our abandonment of certain leased facilities through our business combinations 
the lease abandonment costs were estimated to include remaining lease liabilities offset by an estimate of sublease income 
estimates related to sublease costs and income are based on the assumptions regarding the period required to sublease the facilities and the likely sublease rates 
materially different reported results would be likely if any of the stated costs or expenses were different from our estimations 
software development costs software development costs are required to be expensed until the point that technological feasibility of the product is established 
once technological feasibility is established  such costs are capitalized until the product has reached general availability 
the establishment of technological feasibility and continuing evaluation of the recoverability of the capitalized software development costs requires management s judgment with respect to the impact of external factors such as future revenue  estimated economic life and changes in software and hardware technologies 
capitalized software development costs are amortized on a straight line basis over an estimated life  which is generally three years 
the company capitalizes internal and external labor costs incurred in developing the software once technological feasibility is attained 
at december   the company had million of capitalized software development costs  net of amortization

interest income decreased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the prior year period 
the decrease in interest income is due to the decrease in the company s cash and short term investments balance used to fund operations  acquisitions  and a shift in the company s short term investments to investments with shorter maturities to have funds available for the acquisitions 
income tax benefit 
a provision for federal and state income taxes has not been recorded for the twelve months ended december  and  as we have incurred a net operating loss for and we believe that  based on the history of losses and other factors  the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that we will not be able to realize our deferred tax assets  and thus a full valuation allowance has been recorded against such assets as of december  and december

table of contents stock compensation expense 
during and through february   the effective date of the company s initial public offering  in connection with stock options granted to certain employees and a consultant under the stock plan  we have recorded unearned stock compensation representing the difference between the exercise price of the options and the deemed fair value of our common stock at the date of grant

the company performed a transitional impairment test upon the adoption of sfas no 
on january  and recorded no impairment as a result of this test 
the company had identified the fourth quarter as the period for its annual impairment test 
however  due to significant negative company  industry and economic trends affecting the market value of the company s common stock  the company performed an interim test of goodwill impairment in the third quarter of as a result of this interim test  the company recorded an impairment charge of million to reduce goodwill based on the amount that the carrying value of the goodwill exceeded its fair value

interest income  net 
interest income includes interest income on cash  cash equivalents and short term investment balances 
interest income decreased million  to million for the year ended december  from million for the prior year period 
the decrease in interest income is due to a decrease in interest rates from the prior comparable period and a decrease in cash  cash equivalents and short term investment balances to fund operations and acquisitions 
income tax benefit 
a provision for federal and state income taxes has not been recorded for the years ended december  and  because the company has incurred net operating losses for the year ended december  and we believe that  based on the history of losses and other factors  the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that we will not be able to realize our deferred tax assets  and thus a full valuation allowance has been recorded against such assets as of december  and liquidity and capital resources we have historically financed our operations through a combination of cash flows from operations  private sales of common and convertible preferred stock  issuances of convertible promissory notes and public sales of common stock 
since our ipo in february  we have financed our operations and acquisitions with the proceeds of that offering  cash flows from operations and cash obtained in acquisitions 
we expect to use our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments for general corporate purposes  working capital and capital expenditures  to fund our operations and to continue expanding our product offerings 
the amounts and timing of our actual expenditures will depend upon numerous factors  including the status of our product development efforts  marketing and sales activities and the amount of cash generated by our operations  and competition 
we may find it necessary or advisable to use portions of our cash and cash equivalents for other purposes 
a portion of our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments may also be used to acquire or invest in complementary businesses or products or to obtain the right to use synergistic technologies 
pending use of our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments for the above purposes  we intend to invest such funds in short term  interest bearing  investment grade securities 

table of contents net cash used in operating activities was million in  million in and million in the decrease in net cash used in operating activities in compared to is mainly due to an increase in the accounts payable balance from december  to december  the increase in net cash used in operating activities in compared to is primarily attributable to the increase in net losses

com line of credit 
commitments 
in august  the company established a line of credit with a commercial bank thereby allowing the company to borrow up to million 
the line of credit is secured by all of our assets except our intellectual property  and is guaranteed by two of our subsidiaries 
at december   the company had no outstanding borrowings under the revolving line of credit 
the line of credit is subject to financial covenants 
the company is currently in compliance with the covenants 
the following table highlights  as of december   our contractual obligations and commitments to make future payments by type and period total thereafter dollars in thousands operating leases royalty payments in connection with a software purchase in september  the company has minimum royalty payments of  over two years 
on december   the company had million in open purchase commitments 
we believe that our cash  cash equivalents and investment balances will be sufficient to meet our anticipated liquidity needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least months 
if we require additional capital resources for working capital to grow our business internally or to acquire complementary technologies and businesses at any time in the future  we may issue additional equity or expand our bank line of credit 
the sale of additional equity could result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
we cannot assure you that any financing arrangements will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us in the future 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
this interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements  addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities that possess certain characteristics 
fin requires that if a business enterprise has a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity vie  the assets  liabilities  and results of the activities of the variable interest entity must be included in the consolidated financial statements with those of the business enterprise 
the consolidation requirements of fin are effective immediately for vie s created after january  the consolidation requirements for older vie s are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods beginning after 
table of contents june   however in october of the fasb deferred the effective date of fin for older vie s to the end of the first interim or annual period ending after december  certain disclosure requirements are effective for all financial statements issued after january   regardless of when the vie was established 
we do not have any ownership in any variable interest entities as of december  we will apply the consolidation requirements of fin in future periods should an interest in a variable interest entity be acquired 
risk factors the following risk factors could materially and adversely affect our operating results and could cause actual events to differ materially from those predicted in any forward looking statements related to our business 
we have historically incurred losses and we may not be able to sustain profitability 
although we have had profitable quarters  we incurred losses for the years ended december   and as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
since our ipo in february of  we have funded our business primarily from the cash generated from the sale of our stock and cash flow from operations 
we expect to continue to incur significant sales and marketing  research and development and general and administrative expenses that may exceed our revenue 
as a result  we may experience losses and negative cash flows in the future 
failure to achieve and maintain profitability may cause our stock price to decline and impair our business and financial prospects 
we have recently restated our financial results for portions of on march   we announced that we were restating our third quarter financial results and revising previously announced fourth quarter and full year financial results 
these changes remove all revenue associated with infotech network group from our published financial reports  resulting in an million reduction in revenue from the total revenue previously announced for the restatement and revision of our financial results increases the risk that we may be subjected to shareholder lawsuits 
such lawsuits  if filed  could seriously harm our business and financial condition 
the continued defense of the lawsuits also could result in the diversion of our management s time and attention away from business operations  which could harm our business 
negative developments or publicity with respect to such lawsuits could cause our stock price to decline significantly 
in addition  amounts we might be required to pay in connection with the resolution of such lawsuits by settlement or otherwise could seriously harm our financial condition 
an informal inquiry being conducted by the sec with respect to certain matters unrelated to our restatement of financial results could be expanded to investigate the circumstances surrounding the restatement 
we have been cooperating with the sec with respect to an informal inquiry from the sec regarding certain transactions recorded as revenue for the third quarter of while we believe that the matters currently the subject of the sec s inquiry are not material and will not result in any revisions to previously published financial results  the sec may determine to expand its inquiry to investigate the circumstances surrounding our recently announced restatement 
if this were to occur  it would likely require significant management attention and accounting and legal resources  which could adversely affect our business  results of operations and cash flows 
in addition  negative developments or publicity with respect to such an investigation could cause our stock price to decline significantly 
our operating results are likely to fluctuate significantly and may fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors  causing our share price to decline 
our operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the future 
moreover  our operating results in some quarters may not meet the expectations of stock market analysts and 
table of contents investors 
in that event  our stock price would likely decline 
further declines in our stock price may impair our business prospects and our financial condition 
as a result of our limited history of profitable operations  our business strategy  and the evolving nature of the markets in which we compete  we may have difficulty accurately forecasting our revenue in any given period 
in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this section  a number of factors may cause our revenue to fall short of our expectations or cause fluctuations in our operating results  including delay in our introduction of new applications  services and products offerings and enhancements of our existing solutions  the capital and expense budgeting decisions of our existing and prospective customers  the loss of a major customer  the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures relating to the implementation of our business strategy  increased product development and engineering expenditures required to keep pace with technological changes  overall economic conditions of the us and the rest of the world  overall economic conditions in the software and information systems  telecommunications  financial services and defense industries  the size  type and timing of individual license transactions  the adoption of new technologies  our success in expanding our direct sales force and indirect distribution channels  levels of international sales  and obsolescence of our products or the programming languages that our products are designed to enhance 
we have embarked on a strategy to significantly increase software sales as our principal source of revenue 
if that strategy is not successful  our business may be harmed 
we have invested and continue to invest significant financial and management resources in reorganizing and enhancing our software sales effort 
in recent months  we have hired what we believe are top caliber sales talent  and we have reformulated our sales materials and our presentation strategy  all with a goal of generating an increased percentage of our revenue from sales of our software products 
these efforts have been expensive and they have required  and we expect will continue to require  considerable executive management time and oversight  thus diverting resources from other aspects of our business 
if for any reason this strategy is not successful  and we do not achieve increased software sales as anticipated  then our stock price will decline  and our business prospects and financial condition will be adversely affected 
we operate in an industry with rapidly changing technology and  if we do not successfully modify our products to incorporate new technologies or introduce new products  our sales will suffer 
the software market in which we compete is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent introductions of new products  changing customer needs and evolving industry standards 
to keep pace with technological developments  evolving industry standards and changing customer needs  we must support existing products and develop new products 
we have been aggressively investigating new product development opportunities  and we recently announced plans to create new products and enhancements to existing products that facilitate application development in a service based architecture 
we may not be successful in developing  marketing and releasing new products or new versions of our products that respond to technological developments  evolving industry standards or changing customer requirements 
we may also experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development  introduction and sale of these enhancements 
in addition  these new products or enhancements may not adequately meet the 
table of contents requirements of the marketplace and may not achieve any significant degree of market acceptance 
if release dates of any future products or enhancements are delayed  or if these products or enhancements fail to achieve market acceptance when released  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  new products or enhancements by our competitors may cause customers to defer or forgo purchases of our products  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the market for business process management and integration software may not grow as quickly as we anticipate  which would cause our revenue to fall below expectations 
the market for business process management and integration software is relatively new and evolving 
we earn a substantial portion of our revenue from sales of our business process management software  including application integration software  and related services 
we expect to earn substantially all of our revenue in the future from sales of these products and services 
our future financial performance will depend on continued growth in the number of organizations demanding software and services for business process management and integration  requiring information delivery  and seeking outside vendors to develop  manage and maintain this software for their critical applications 
many of our potential customers have made significant investments in internally developed systems and would incur significant costs in switching to our products  which may substantially inhibit the growth of our software 
if the market fails to grow  or grows more slowly than we expect  our sales will be adversely affected 
in addition  a weakening global economy may lead to longer sales cycle and slower sales growth 
our acquisition strategy could cause financial or operational problems 
our success depends on our ability to continually enhance and broaden our product offerings in response to changing technology  customer demands  and competitive pressures 
to this end  we may acquire new and complementary businesses  products  or technologies 
we do not know if we will be able to complete any acquisitions or that we will be able to successfully integrate any acquired businesses  operate them profitably  or retain their key employees 
integrating any newly acquired business  product or technology could be expensive and time consuming  could disrupt our ongoing business  and could distract our management 
we may face competition for acquisition targets from larger and more established companies with greater financial resources 
in addition  in order to finance any acquisitions  we might need to raise additional funds through public or private financings 
in that event  we could be forced to obtain equity or debt financing on terms that are not favorable to us and  in the case of equity financing  that results in dilution to our stockholders 
if we are unable to integrate any newly acquired entity  products or technology effectively  our business  financial condition and operating results would suffer 
in addition  the amortization of intangible assets or other charges resulting from the cost of acquisitions could harm our operating results 
if we cannot execute our strategy to establish and maintain our relationships with established healthcare industry participants  our applications  services and products may not achieve healthcare market acceptance 
the healthcare industry is our most important market 
relationships with established healthcare industry participants are critical to our success 
these relationships include customer  vendor  distributor and co marketer relationships 
to date  we have established a number of these relationships 
once we have set up a relationship with an established healthcare industry participant  we rely on that participant s ability to assist us in generating increased acceptance and use of our applications  services  and product offerings 
we have limited experience in maintaining relationships with healthcare industry participants 
additionally  the other parties to these relationships may not view these relationships with us as significant to their own business  and they may reassess their commitment to us or decide to compete directly with us in the future 
we generally do not have agreements that prohibit them from competing against us directly or from contracting with our competitors 
we cannot guarantee that any such party will perform its obligations as agreed or contemplated or that we would be able to specifically enforce any agreement with it 
our arrangements generally do not establish minimum performance requirements  but instead rely on the voluntary efforts of the other party 

table of contents therefore  we cannot guarantee that these relationships will be successful 
if we were to lose any of these relationships  or if the other parties were to fail to collaborate with us to pursue additional business relationships  we would not be able to execute our business plans and our business would suffer significantly 
moreover  we may not experience increased use of our applications  services and product offerings even if we establish and maintain these relationships 
if our transaction hosting services suffer interruptions  our business and reputation could be harmed 
in the past  our customers have experienced some interruptions with our transaction hosting services 
similar interruptions may continue to occur from time to time 
these interruptions could be due to hardware and operating system failures 
we currently process customer transactions and data at our facility in albuquerque  new mexico and philadelphia  pennsylvania as well as in a third party hosting facility in california 
although we have safeguards for emergencies in each location  we do not have fully operational procedures for information processing facilities if either primary facility is not functioning 
the occurrence of a major catastrophic event or other system failure at any of these facilities could interrupt data processing or result in the loss of stored data 
in addition  we depend on the efficient operation of internet connections from customers to our systems 
these connections  in turn  depend on the efficient operation of web browsers  internet service providers and internet backbone service providers  all of which have had periodic operational problems or experienced outages 
any system delays  failures  or loss of data  whatever the cause  could reduce customer satisfaction with our applications  services and product offerings 
we expect a significant portion of our revenue to be derived from customers who use our transaction hosting services 
as a result  our business will suffer if we experience frequent or long system interruptions that result in the unavailability or reduced performance of our hosting 
we expect to experience occasional temporary capacity constraints due to sharply increased traffic  which may cause unanticipated system disruptions  slower response times  impaired quality  and degradation in levels of customer service 
if this were to happen on more than an occasional and temporary basis  our business and reputation could be seriously harmed 
if security of our customer and patient information is compromised  patient care could suffer  we could be liable for damages and our reputation could decline 
we retain confidential customer and patient information in our processing centers 
therefore  it is critical that our facilities and infrastructure remain secure and that our facilities and infrastructure are perceived by the marketplace to be secure 
despite the implementation of security measures  our infrastructure may be vulnerable to physical break ins  computer viruses  programming errors  attacks by third parties or similar disruptive problems 
if we fail to meet our clients expectations  we could be liable for damages and our reputation could suffer 
in addition  patient care could suffer and we could be liable if our systems fail to deliver correct information in a timely manner 
our insurance may not protect us from this risk 
if we fail to meet performance standards we may experience a decline in revenue 
many of our transaction and hosting service agreements contain performance standards 
if we fail to meet these standards  our customers could terminate their agreements with us 
the loss of any of those service agreements would cause a decline in our revenue 
additionally  we may be unable to expand or adapt our transaction and hosting network infrastructure to meet new demands on a timely basis and at a commercially reasonable cost  or at all 
if compliance with government regulation of healthcare becomes costly and difficult for our customers  we may not be able to grow our business 
participants in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive and frequently changing regulation under numerous laws administered by governmental entities at the federal  state and local levels  some of which are  and others of which may be  applicable to our business 
furthermore  our healthcare service provider  payer 
table of contents and plan customers are also subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations that could affect the nature and scope of their relationships with us 
the healthcare market itself is highly regulated and subject to changing political  economic and regulatory influences 
these factors affect the purchasing practices and operations of healthcare organizations 
changes in current healthcare financing and reimbursement systems  such as modifications which may be required by the health insurance portability and accountability act of  may cause us to make unplanned enhancements of software applications or services  result in delays or cancellations of orders  or result in the revocation of endorsement of our applications and services by healthcare participants 
the effect of hipaa is difficult to predict and there can be no assurances that we will adequately address the business risks created by hipaa and its implementation or that we will be able to take advantage of any resulting business opportunities 
federal and state legislatures have periodically considered programs to reform or amend the us healthcare system at both the federal and state level 
these programs may contain proposals to increase governmental involvement in healthcare  lower reimbursement rates or otherwise change the environment in which healthcare market participants operate 
healthcare market participants may respond by reducing their investments or postponing investment decisions  including investments in our applications and services 
we do not know what effect any proposals would have on our business 
because we provide utilization review services  we may be liable for the denial of payments for medical claims or medical services 
one of the functions of our applications is automatic adjudication of whether a claim for payment or service should be denied or whether existing coverage should be continued based upon particular plans  contracts and industry standard  clinical support criteria 
our payer customers are ultimately responsible for deciding whether to deny claims for payment or medical services 
it is possible  however  that our customers may assert that we are liable for denying payment of covered medical claims or medical service 
the contractual protections included in our customer contracts and our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to protect us against such liability 
as we continue to build our international sales  we are subject to increased regulation and uncertainties in the international marketplace 
among other things  our core products contain strong encryption technology that is subject to export control regulation 
these regulations prohibit us from selling in certain countries and to certain persons 
our inadvertent failure to properly restrict our sales could subject us and our management to fines and other sanctions and impair our financial condition and our reputation 
additionally  in the international marketplace we face increased uncertainty of enforcement of contractual provisions and enforcement of judgments in our dealings with non us persons 
our inability to properly defend or enforce our contract rights could materially impair our business prospects and financial condition 
we may face product related liabilities that could force us to pay damages  which would hurt our reputation and financial condition 
although both we and our customers test our applications  services and product offerings  they may contain defects or result in system failures 
these defects or problems could result in the loss of or delay in generating revenue  loss of market share  failure to achieve market acceptance  diversion of development resources  injury to our reputation or increased insurance costs 
in particular  we market software products that are designed to assist our healthcare customers in meeting their hipaa compliance obligations 
failure of these products to perform as intended could cause our customers to incur significant fines and penalties for non compliance  which in turn could result in damages and claims against us 
our contracts generally limit our liability arising from our errors  however  these provisions may not be enforceable and may not protect us from liability 
while we have general liability insurance that we believe is adequate  including coverage for errors and omissions  we may not be able to maintain this insurance on reasonable terms in the future 
in 
table of contents addition  our insurance may not be sufficient to cover large claims and our insurer could disclaim coverage on claims 
if we are liable for an uninsured or underinsured claim or if our premiums increase significantly  our financial condition could be materially harmed 
if we do not establish and maintain our brand  our reputation could be adversely affected 
in order to increase our customer base and expand our online traffic  we must establish  maintain and strengthen our brand 
for us to be successful in establishing our brand  professionals in the healthcare and other targeted markets must perceive us as offering quality  cost effective  communications  information and administrative services 
our reputation and brand name could be harmed if we experience difficulties in introducing new applications  services and product offerings  if these applications  services and product offerings are not accepted by customers  if we are required to discontinue existing applications  services and product offerings or if our products and services do not function properly 
we are subjected to many risks because our business is dependent on our intellectual proprietary rights 
we are exposed to infringement risks 
our intellectual property is important to our business 
we may be subject to intellectual property infringement claims as the number of our competitors grows and the functionality of our applications overlaps with competitive offerings 
these claims  whether or not meritorious  could be expensive  divert our attention from operating our company  result in costly litigation  cause product shipment delays  or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements  any of which could seriously harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if we become liable to third parties for infringing on their intellectual property rights  we would be required to pay a substantial damage award and to develop non infringing technology  obtain a license or cease selling the applications that contain the infringing intellectual property 
we may be unable to develop non infringing technology or obtain a license on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
in the event an intellectual property claim against us was successful and we could not obtain a license on acceptable terms  license a substitute technology or redesign to avoid infringement  most of our contracts would require us to refund a portion of the software license fees  our business  financial condition and results of operations would be seriously harmed 
in addition  we may not be able to protect against misappropriation of our intellectual property 
third parties may infringe upon our intellectual property rights  we may not detect this unauthorized use and we may be unable to enforce our rights 
we rely on third parties for technology in our products 
we depend upon third party suppliers and licensors to provide software that is incorporated in certain of our products and the products that we distribute 
we have no control over the scheduling and quality of work of these third party software suppliers and licensors 
additionally  the third party software may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
our agreements to license certain third party software will terminate after specified dates unless they are renewed 
we expect to sell multiple products to the same customers and problems with the third party technology in one product may adversely affect sales of other products to the same customer 
our products may be affected by unknown software defects 
our products depend on complex software  both internally developed and licensed from third parties 
complex software often contains defects  particularly when first introduced or when enhancements or new versions are released 
although we conduct extensive testing  we may not discover software defects that affect our new or current products or enhancements until after they are deployed 
to date  we have not experienced any material software defects  however despite continued testing  defects may occur in our software 
these defects could cause performance interruptions  which could damage our reputation with existing or potential customers  increase our service costs  cause us to lose revenue  delay market acceptance or divert our development resources  any of which could cause our business to suffer 
legislative and regulatory actions may cause our operating expenses to increase 
the sarbanes oxley act of and newly proposed or enacted rules and regulations of the sec or nasdaq  impose duties on the company and its executives  directors  attorneys and auditors 
in order to comply with the sarbanes oxley act and any new rules promulgated by the sec or nasdaq  we may be 
table of contents required to hire additional personnel and use additional outside legal  accounting and advisory services in the future 
any of these developments could materially increase our operating expenses and  accordingly  reduce our net income 
benefits expected from our recent acquisitions may not be realized because of integration and other challenges 
the benefits of the merger may not be realized and could have a material adverse effect on the combined business and results of operations because of the following challenges incorporating technology and products into quovadx product offerings  preserving the acquired technical knowledge within the engineering organization  coordinating the efforts of the rogue wave and carescience sales organizations with quovadx sales organization  maintaining momentum in the sales growth of rogue wave s and carescience s product offerings  realizing anticipated cost savings in a timely manner  and incurring unanticipated expenses related to the integration of the acquisitions and quovadx 
expenses related to the recent acquisitions could adversely affect the company s combined financial results 
quovadx has incurred direct transaction costs in connection with the acquisitions of million 
if quovadx does not achieve the expected benefits of the merger  the combined company s financial results  including earnings per share  could be adversely affected 
the integration process may disrupt the company s business and internal resources 
the integration of acquisitions and quovadx will be complex  time consuming and expensive and may disrupt our business 
some of the suppliers  distributors  customers and licensors may be our competitors or may work with our competitors and as a result terminate the business relationships with the combined company as a result of the mergers 
in addition  the integration process may strain the combined company s financial and managerial controls and reporting systems and procedures 
this may result in the diversion of management and financial resources from the combined company s core business objectives 
there can be no assurance that acquisitions and quovadx will successfully integrate or that the combined company will realize any of the anticipated benefits of the merger 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk we currently develop and market our products primarily in the united states 
as a majority of sales are currently made in us dollars  a strengthening of the dollar could make our product less competitive in foreign markets 
our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates 
due to the short term term nature of our investments  we believe that there is no material interest risk exposure 
based on the foregoing  no quantitative disclosures have been provided
