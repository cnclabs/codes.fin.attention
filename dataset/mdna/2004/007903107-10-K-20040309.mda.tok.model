item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes as of december  and december   and for each of the three years in the period ended december   which are included in this annual report 
certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation 
overview we design  manufacture and market industry standard digital integrated circuits that are used in diverse product applications such as desktop and mobile pcs  workstations and servers  communications equipment  and automotive and consumer electronics 
our products include microprocessors  flash memory devices  and personal connectivity solutions products 
the semiconductor industry has recently shown signs of recovery from the downturn experienced during and  which contributed to an improvement in our operating results during compared to total net sales for of  million increased percent compared with net sales of  million for this increase was driven primarily by increased sales of microprocessors and flash memory products across all geographies as well as the consolidation of fasl llc s results of operations  which include sales by fasl llc to fujitsu 
in addition  the restructuring and cost cutting measures that we initiated in contributed to significant cost savings in these cost savings  combined with the increase in revenues  contributed to a percent decrease in net loss from a net loss of  million in to a net loss of million in during  we reached an agreement with fujitsu to form fasl llc 
the formation of fasl llc has allowed us to combine our and fujitsu s product manufacturing and technology development efforts to respond more quickly to the demands of our flash memory product customers 
as a result of the transaction  we began consolidating fasl llc s results of operations on june  however  as fasl llc did not exist prior to june   the results of operations for prior periods did not include the consolidation of fasl llc s operations 
accordingly  the segment operating information for our memory products segment for the year ended december   is not fully comparable to the segment information for all prior periods presented 
in addition  we introduced our bit microprocessor products during with the launch of our amd opteron processor for servers and workstations in april and our amd athlon processor for desktop and mobile pcs in september 
in november  we began construction of a new millimeter wafer fabrication facility in dresden  germany  which we expect to be in volume production in we believe the new capacity provided by this facility will allow us to satisfy anticipated demand for our bit microprocessors 
in addition to providing increased capacity  we believe that manufacturing our bit processors on millimeter silicon wafers  and employing advanced manufacturing process technologies  will allow us to reduce our manufacturing costs 
for  we believe critical success factors include increasing market acceptance of bit computing  our and fasl llc s ability to successfully develop and transition to the latest manufacturing process technologies  our ability to develop and introduce new products for the server and workstation markets on a timely basis and increasing our share of those markets  expanding our participation in emerging global markets  including china  latin america  india  and eastern europe  improving our share of the flash memory market  including enabling the increased adoption of mirrorbit technology  and maximizing the synergies of fasl llc 
we intend the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follows to provide information that will assist you in understanding our financial statements  the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year  the primary factors that resulted in those changes  and how certain accounting principles  policies and estimates affect our financial statements 

table of contents critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements 
we evaluate our estimates on an on going basis  including those related to our revenues  inventories  asset impairments  restructuring charges  income taxes and commitments and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
although actual results have historically been reasonably consistent with management s expectations  the actual results may differ from these estimates or our estimates may be affected by different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies are the most significant to the presentation of our financial statements and require the most difficult  subjective and complex judgments 
revenue reserves 
we record a provision for estimated sales returns and allowances on product sales and a provision for estimated future price reductions in the same period that the related revenues are recorded 
we base these estimates on management judgment while considering actual historical sales returns  historical price reductions  market activity  allowances  and other known or anticipated trends and factors 
actual provisions could be different from our estimates and current provisions  resulting in future adjustments to our revenues and operating results 
inventory valuation 
at each balance sheet date  we evaluate our ending inventories for excess quantities and obsolescence 
this evaluation includes analysis of sales levels by product and projections of future demand 
these projections assist us in determining the carrying value of our inventory and are also used for near term factory production planning 
inventories on hand in excess of forecasted demand of generally six months or less  are not valued 
in addition  we write off inventories that are considered obsolete 
among other factors  management considers forecasted demand in relation to the inventory on hand  competitiveness of product offerings  market conditions and product life cycles when determining obsolescence and net realizable value 
we adjust remaining inventory balances to approximate the lower of our standard manufacturing cost or market value 
if we anticipate future demand or market conditions to be less favorable than our projections as forecasted  additional inventory write downs may be required  and would be reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made 
this would have a negative impact on our gross margins in that period 
if in any period we are able to sell inventories that were not valued or that had been written off in a previous period  related revenues would be recorded without any offsetting charge to cost of sales  resulting in a net benefit to our gross margin in that period 
to the extent these factors materially affect our gross margins  we would disclose them 
impairment of long lived assets 
we consider no less frequently than quarterly whether indicators of impairment of long lived assets are present 
these indicators may include  but are not limited to  significant decreases in the market value of an asset and significant changes in the extent or manner in which an asset is used 
if these or other indicators are present  we determine whether the estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets in question are less than their carrying value 
if less  we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their respective fair values 
fair value is determined by discounted future cash flows  appraisals or other methods 
if the asset determined to be impaired is to be held and used  we recognize an impairment loss through a charge to our operating results to the extent the present value of anticipated net cash flows attributable to the asset is less than the asset s carrying value  which we depreciate over the remaining estimated useful life of the asset 
we may incur additional impairment losses in future periods if factors influencing our estimates of the undiscounted cash flows change 
restructuring charges 
we record and account for our restructuring activities following formally approved plans that identify the actions and timeline over which the restructuring activities will occur 
restructuring charges include estimates pertaining to employee severance and fringe benefit costs  facility exit 
table of contents costs  subleasing assumptions and facility and equipment decommissioning costs resulting from exiting certain facilities 
we review remaining restructuring accruals on a quarterly basis and adjust these accruals when changes in facts and circumstances suggest actual amounts will differ from our estimates 
although we do not anticipate significant changes  actual costs may be different than our original or revised estimates 
these changes in estimates can result in increases or decreases to our results of operations in future periods and would be presented on the restructuring and other special charges  net  line of our consolidated operating statements 
income taxes 
in determining taxable income for financial statement reporting purposes  we must make certain estimates and judgments 
these estimates and judgments are applied in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of deferred tax assets  which arise from temporary differences between the recognition of assets and liabilities for tax and financial statement reporting purposes 
we must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets 
if recovery is not likely  we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a charge to income tax expense  in the form of a valuation allowance  for the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable 
we consider past performance  future expected taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance 
in fiscal  we recorded a valuation allowance against all of our us deferred tax assets  net of deferred tax liabilities  based on past performance and the likelihood of realization of our deferred tax assets at the time 
in fiscal  we continued to provide a valuation allowance against all of our us deferred tax assets  net of deferred tax liabilities 
if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be realized  an appropriate amount of the previously provided valuation allowance will be reversed  resulting in a benefit to our earnings 
such benefits would be recorded on the income tax provision benefit line of our statement of operations 
in addition  the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax rules and the potential for future adjustment by the internal revenue service or other taxing jurisdiction 
if our estimates of these taxes are greater or less than actual results  an additional tax benefit or charge will result 
commitments and contingencies 
from time to time we are a defendant or plaintiff in various legal actions that arise in the normal course of business 
we are also a party to environmental matters  including local  regional  state and federal government cleanup activities at or near locations where we currently or have in the past conducted our business 
we are also a guarantor of various third party obligations and commitments 
we are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of reserves required for these commitments and contingencies  if any  that would be charged to earnings includes assessing the probability of adverse outcomes and estimating the amount of potential losses 
the required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in circumstances  such as a change in settlement strategy 
changes in required reserves could increase or decrease our earnings in the period the changes are made 
results of operations as discussed above in the section entitled  developments in  on page  effective june   we and fujitsu formed fasl llc 
as a result of the transaction  we began consolidating fasl llc s results of operations on june  prior to june   we accounted for our share of the manufacturing joint venture s operating results under the equity method 
as fasl llc did not exist prior to june   the results of our operations for periods prior to the third quarter of do not include the consolidation of fasl llc s results of operations 
accordingly  our operating results for the year ended december  are not fully comparable with our results for prior periods 
as we have a percent controlling interest in fasl llc  fujitsu s percent share in the net income loss of fasl llc is reflected as a minority interest adjustment to our consolidated financial statements 
this minority interest adjustment will not correspond to memory products segment operating income loss because memory products segment operating income loss includes operations incremental to those of fasl llc 
in addition  the minority interest calculation is based on fasl llc s net income loss rather than operating income loss 

table of contents we review and assess operating performance using segment revenues and operating income before interest  taxes and minority interest 
these performance measures include the allocation of expenses to the operating segments based on management judgment 
prior to the third quarter of  we had two reportable segments the core products and foundry services segments 
primarily as a result of the formation of fasl llc  we re evaluated our reportable segments 
beginning in the third quarter of  we changed our reportable segments to the computation products segment  which includes microprocessor products for desktop and mobile pcs  servers and workstations and chipset products  and the memory products segment  which includes flash memory products 
we believe that separate reporting of these operating segments  given our new focus on fasl llc as a separate operating company and its separate market brand spansion  provides more useful information to our stockholders 
in addition to our reportable segments  we also have the all other category that is not a reportable segment  but rather it includes other small operating segments that are neither individually nor in the aggregate greater than ten percent of our consolidated revenues or assets 
this category also includes certain operating expenses and credits that are not allocated to the operating segments 
prior period segment information has been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation 
however  as fasl llc did not exist prior to june   the results of operations for prior periods did not include the consolidation of fasl llc s operations 
accordingly  the segment operating information for the memory products segment for the year ended december   is not fully comparable to the reclassified segment information for all prior periods presented 
we use a to week fiscal year ending on the last sunday in december 
the years ended december   december   and december   each included weeks 
the following is a summary of our net sales for  and millions computation products memory products all other total net sales comparison for years ended december  and december  total net sales of  million in increased percent compared to net sales of  million in computation products net sales of  million in increased percent compared to net sales of  million in the increase in net sales was primarily due to a percent increase in microprocessor unit shipments due primarily to increased demand from our oem customers  partially offset by a decline of four percent in the average selling prices of our microprocessor products 
unit shipment growth was particularly strong in latin america and china  which accounted for percent of overall unit growth 
memory products net sales of  million in increased percent compared to net sales of million in the increase in net sales was primarily attributable to the effect of consolidating fasl llc s results of operations  which include fasl llc s sales to fujitsu  and increased demand for flash memory products 
further quantification of the breakdown in the increase in net sales is not practical due to the reorganization of geographical sales territories between amd and fujitsu 
all other net sales of million in decreased percent compared to net sales of million in and consisted primarily of net sales of our personal connectivity solutions products 
the decrease was due 
table of contents to a million decrease in revenue resulting from discontinued production of selected mature embedded processors and networking products and a million decrease in foundry services revenue  offset by a million increase in revenues from sales of amd geode and wireless products 
net sales comparison for years ended december  and december  total net sales of  million in decreased percent compared to net sales of  million in computation products net sales of  million in decreased percent compared to net sales of  million in this decrease was almost wholly due to a decrease in unit sales of percent  and a decrease in average selling prices of percent  reflecting industry wide weakness in pc sales  competitive pricing pressure  and the execution of our plan to align our microprocessor inventory in the supply chain with forecasted customer demand  which included our decision to limit shipments and accept receipt of product returns from certain customers 
memory products net sales of million in decreased percent compared to net sales of  million in the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in average selling prices of percent  reflecting continued weakness in the telecommunications and networking equipment industries 
all other net sales of million in decreased percent compared to net sales of million in the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in foundry services revenues of approximately million and a decrease in net sales of million from embedded processors and networking products as a result of sustained market declines in the communications and networking equipment industries 
comparison of gross margin percentage  expenses  interest income and other  net  and interest expense the following is a summary of gross margin percentage  expenses and interest income and other  net  and interest expense for  and millions except for gross margin percentage cost of sales gross margin percentage research and development marketing  general and administrative restructuring and other special charges  net interest income and other  net interest expense income tax provision benefit gross margin percentage increased to percent in compared to percent in the increase in gross margin was primarily due to an increase in net sales of percent  accompanied by an increase in cost of sales of only ten percent 
our cost of sales increased at a lower rate than net sales primarily due to cost reductions from the restructuring plan and other cost reduction initiatives 
in addition  microprocessor unit sales increased percent while average selling prices of microprocessor products decreased by four percent  and we realized million  or approximately two percentage points resulting from the sale of microprocessor products that had been previously written off 
further quantification of the improvement in gross margin percentage is not practical due to the consolidation of fasl llc s operating results on june  we amortize capital grants and allowances  interest subsidies and research and development subsidies that we receive from the state of saxony and the federal republic of germany for fab as they are earned 
the 
table of contents amortization of these grants and subsidies is recognized as credits to research and development expenses and cost of sales 
the credits to cost of sales totaled million in and million in gross margin percentage decreased to percent in compared to percent in this decrease was primarily due to a percent decrease in the combined sales of pc processors and flash memory products  as a result of lower unit demand and average selling prices due to weakened customer demand and industry wide excess inventory  partially offset by cost savings realized from the closure of certain facilities pursuant to the restructuring plan  which is discussed below 
research and development expenses of million in increased four percent from million in due primarily to an increase in expenses as a result of the fasl llc transaction  million in research and development efforts related to new microprocessors  and million in expenses related to amounts paid to ibm to jointly develop new logic process technologies for use in future high performance microprocessor products 
these increases were offset by a million reduction in internal research and development costs from to  primarily due to the reduction of research and development activities associated with our pcs products and the absence of the million charge representing amounts paid to ibm in in exchange for consulting services relating to optimizing the performance of our manufacturing processes 
we amortize capital grants and allowances  interest subsidies and research and development subsidies that we receive from the state of saxony and the federal republic of germany for fab as they are earned 
the amortization of these grants and subsidies is recognized as credits to research and development expenses and cost of sales 
the credits to research and development expenses totaled million in and million in research and development expenses of million in increased percent compared to million in this increase was primarily due to an overall increase in research and development efforts directed to our microprocessors 
in addition  research and development expenses in included a million charge for amounts paid to ibm in exchange for consulting services relating to optimizing the performance of our manufacturing processes in the fourth quarter of  as well as the reallocation of million from manufacturing resources  previously included in costs of goods sold  to research and development activities for microprocessors 
marketing  general and administrative expenses of million in decreased percent compared to million in the decrease was primarily due to decreased cooperative advertising and marketing expenses of million and cost reductions from the restructuring plan and other cost reduction initiatives 
marketing  general and administrative expenses of million in increased eight percent compared to million in primarily as a result of increased advertising and marketing expenses associated with the launch of our branding campaign 
in december  we began implementing a restructuring plan the restructuring plan to further align our cost structure to industry conditions resulting from weak customer demand and industry wide excess inventory 
as part of this plan  and as a result of our agreement with ibm to jointly develop future generations of our logic process technology  we ceased logic research and development in the sdc and eliminated most of those related resources  including the sale or abandonment of certain equipment used in the sdc 
the restructuring plan resulted in the consolidation of facilities  primarily at our sunnyvale  california site and at sales offices worldwide 
we vacated and are attempting to sublease certain facilities 
table of contents currently occupied under long term operating leases through we also terminated the implementation of certain partially completed enterprise resource planning erp software and other information technology implementation activities  resulting in the abandonment of certain software  hardware and capitalized development costs 
pursuant to the restructuring plan  we recorded restructuring costs and other special charges of million in the fourth quarter of  consisting primarily of million of anticipated severance and fringe benefit costs  an asset impairment charge of million relating to a license that has no future use because of its association with discontinued logic development activities  asset impairment charges of million resulting from the abandonment of equipment previously used in logic process development and manufacturing activities  anticipated exit costs of million almost wholly related to vacating and consolidating our facilities and a charge of million resulting from the abandonment of partially completed erp software and other information technology implementation activities 
during  management approved the sale of additional equipment  primarily equipment used in the sdc  that was identified as no longer useful in our operations 
as a result  we recorded approximately million of asset impairment charges in the first quarter of  including million of charges for decommission costs necessary to complete the sale of the equipment 
during  we revised our estimates of the number of positions to be eliminated pursuant to the restructuring plan from  to  in response to the additional resources required due to the fasl llc transaction 
as a result  we reversed million of the estimated severance and fringe benefit accrual 
as of december    employees had been terminated pursuant to the restructuring plan resulting in cumulative cash payments of million in severance and employee benefit costs 
the remaining accrual of million represents the severance benefits cost obligations for individuals whose employments terminated but who elected to defer receipt of severance benefits until and for employees who were pre notified in of their employment terminations  which will occur in with the exception of exit costs consisting primarily of remaining lease payments on abandoned facilities  net of estimated sublease income that are payable through  we have substantially completed the activities associated with the restructuring plan as of december  as a result of the restructuring plan  we realized overall cost reductions of approximately million in we also implemented other cost reduction initiatives incremental to the specific expense reductions resulting from the restructuring plan 
the following table summarizes activities under the restructuring plan through december  severance and employee benefits asset impairment exit costs other restructuring charges total thousands provision non cash charges cash charges accrual at december  provision cash charges non cash charges non cash adjustment accrual at december  in  we announced a restructuring plan the restructuring plan due to the continued slowdown in the semiconductor industry and a resulting decline in revenues 
we substantially completed our execution of the 
table of contents restructuring plan as of december  during  we reduced the estimated accrual of the facility and equipment decommission costs by million based on the most current information available 
during  we also realized a recovery of approximately million for the excess of the sale price over the estimated fair value of equipment that was determined to be impaired as a result of the restructuring plan 
both amounts were included in restructuring and other special charges  net 
as a result of the restructuring plan  we have realized overall cost reductions of million as of december  the following table summarizes activity under the restructuring plan through december  severance and employee benefits facility and equipment impairment facilities and equipment decommission costs other facilities exit costs total thousands provision cash charges non cash charges accrual at december  cash charges accrual at december  non cash adjustments cash charges accrual at december  interest income and other  net  of approximately million in decreased percent from million in the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in investment income of million caused by lower cash equivalents and short term investment balances and million in charges in for other than temporary declines in our equity investments 
this decrease was offset by a gain of approximately million based on the difference between the carrying value and fair value of assets contributed by us to fasl llc 
fujitsu now owns a percent interest in these assets 
the gain on the deemed sale of these assets to fasl llc was limited to the difference in carrying value of our interest in the assets following the completion of the transaction and the carrying value of the assets immediately prior to the transaction 
interest income and other  net  of million increased million or percent in compared to million in the increase was primarily due to million in charges for other than temporary declines in our equity investments as compared to million in charges in  offset by a decrease of million in interest income as a result of lower interest rates on our investment portfolio and lower cash equivalents and short term investment balances 
interest expense of million in increased percent compared to million in the increase was due primarily to the effect of our convertible senior notes due notes  issued in november  which resulted in annual interest charges of million  interest of million on million drawn at the end of september under our july loan agreement  and the fasl llc transaction  which resulted in additional interest expense of approximately million in in addition  in we capitalized interest of million on continued expansion and facilitization of fabs and compared to only million in interest expense of million in increased percent compared to million in the increase was due primarily to the effect of interest expense incurred on our convertible senior debentures due debentures  issued in january  which resulted in interest charges of million  partially offset by an increase in capitalized interest associated with conversion of fab to a flash memory facility  facilitization activities at fab  and a decrease of million in interest expense due to a partial repayment of the outstanding loans under the dresden loan agreements in 
table of contents we recorded an income tax provision of million in  an income tax provision of million in and an income tax benefit of million in the income tax provision in primarily reflected income tax expense generated in certain foreign tax jurisdictions  offset by a benefit of a us federal tax refund from a carryback claim we filed in no net tax benefit was recorded in on pre tax losses due to continuing operating losses 
our tax provision for does not reflect an increase in our net deferred tax liability of approximately million 
this net deferred tax liability was recognized by the japanese subsidiary of fasl llc  fasl japan  as tax expense in periods prior to our consolidation of fasl llc on june   and therefore has not been recorded as a component of our tax expense for the income tax provision was recorded primarily for taxes due on income generated in certain state and foreign tax jurisdictions 
no tax benefit was recorded in on pre tax losses due to the establishment of a valuation allowance against the remainder of our us deferred tax assets  net of us deferred tax liabilities in the fourth quarter  due to the incurrence of continuing substantial operating losses in the us the effective benefit rate of percent for was less than the statutory rate because of a lower than us statutory percent tax benefit rate on the restructuring charges  reflecting the allocation of the charges between the us and foreign lower taxed jurisdictions  and a provision for us taxes on certain previously undistributed earnings of lower taxed foreign subsidiaries 
other items international sales as a percent of net sales were percent in  compared to percent in and percent in during  approximately percent of our net sales were denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  primarily the japanese yen  as compared to one percent during the increase was primarily due to the consolidation of fasl llc s results of operations  which include sales by fasl llc to fujitsu  which are denominated in yen 
our foreign exchange risk exposure resulting from these sales is partially mitigated as a result of our yen denominated manufacturing costs 
in addition  we are subject to foreign currency risk related to our manufacturing costs in fab  which are denominated in euros 
we use foreign currency forward and option contracts to reduce our exposure to the euro  but future exchange rate fluctuations may cause increases or decreases to our fab manufacturing costs 
the impact on our operating results from changes in foreign currency rates individually and in the aggregate has not been material  principally as a result of our foreign currency hedging activities 
comparison of operating income loss the following is a summary of operating income loss for  and millions computation products memory products all other total computation products operating loss of million in improved by million compared to million in the improvement was primarily due to incremental net sales of million and a decrease in both manufacturing costs of million and marketing  general and administrative expenses of million  which resulted primarily from our cost reduction initiatives and the restructuring plan 
in addition  cooperative advertising and marketing expenses decreased by million from computation products operating loss of million in increased by million compared to million in primarily due to a decrease in net sales 
the decrease was primarily due to a decline in average selling prices of percent and a decline in unit sales of percent for microprocessors as a result of the sustained downturn in the pc industry 

table of contents memory products operating loss of million in increased million from further quantification of the changes is not practical due to the consolidation of fasl llc on june  memory products operating loss was million in compared to million of operating income in the change in the operating result was primarily due to decrease in net sales of million as a result of a percent decline in average selling prices due to continued weakness in the flash memory market 
our all other operating loss of million in improved by million compared to  primarily due to million of restructuring and other special charges included in the results  and a million credit adjustment to the restructuring charge in our all other operating loss of million in increased by million compared to the operating loss included million of restructuring and other special charges in compared to approximately million in the remaining increase of operating loss was primarily due to an increase in operating loss of personal connectivity solutions products  partially offset by approximately million of improvement of operating results in foundry services 
financial condition our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments at december  totaled billion  which included approximately million in cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments maintained by fasl llc 
fasl llc s operating agreement governs its ability to use this cash balance for operations or to distribute it to us and fujitsu 
pursuant to the operating agreement  and subject to restrictions contained in third party loan agreements  fasl llc must first distribute any cash balance to us and fujitsu in an amount sufficient to cover each party s estimated tax liability  if any  related to fasl llc s taxable income for each fiscal year 
any remaining cash balance after the tax liability distribution would be used by fasl llc to fund its operations in accordance with its budget 
if any cash remains  it must be used to repay fasl llc s outstanding debt to us and fujitsu 
any remaining cash after such distributions is distributed at the discretion of fasl llc s board of managers  to us and fujitsu  pro rata  based on each party s membership interest at the time of distribution  which currently is percent and percent 
net cash provided by operating activities was approximately million in although we had a net loss of million for the year  adjustments for non cash charges  which were primarily depreciation and amortization  resulted in a positive cash flow from operations 
the net changes in operating assets in as compared to included an increase in accounts receivable due to higher net sales and the consolidation of fasl llc s results of operations  which include fasl llc s sales to fujitsu  and an increase in net inventory due to the consolidation of fasl llc s results of operations 
at december   fujitsu accounted for approximately percent of our consolidated net accounts receivable and approximately percent of our consolidated net sales 
the net changes in payables and accrued liabilities included payments in of million for a technology license from ibm  approximately million of payments in under the restructuring plan and an accrual of million in december related to our license from ibm for technology and know how related to manufacturing products on millimeter silicon wafers 
net cash used in operating activities was million in  primarily as a result of our net loss of  million  adjusted by non cash related charges 
changes in operating assets and liabilities in as compared to were attributable to a decrease in accounts receivable due to a percent decrease in net sales 
at december   inventory increased as compared to december  due to an increase of products to support anticipated sales  a change in the mix of inventory  and the impact of flash memory production from fab following its conversion from logic manufacturing 

table of contents net cash provided by operating activities was million in although we had a net loss of million  adjustments for non cash charges resulted in a positive cash flow from operations 
these adjustments included million of depreciation and amortization expense  million of restructuring charges  million of impairment charges on equity investments and million of provision for doubtful accounts  offset by non cash credits of million from net charges in deferred income taxes and foreign grant and subsidy income  and other uses of cash in operating activities of approximately million due to net changes in operating assets and liabilities 
net cash provided by investing activities was million in  primarily as a result of net cash inflow of million from sales and purchases of available for sale securities  million of cash acquired from the fasl llc transaction and million in proceeds from sale of property  plant and equipment  offset by million used to purchase property  plant and equipment 
net cash used in investing activities was million in  including million used for purchases of property  plant and equipment primarily for fab and fab  million  net of cash acquired  to acquire alchemy semiconductor  inc  and million from net purchases of available for sale securities  offset by million of proceeds from the sale of property  plant and equipment 
net cash used in investing activities was million in  primarily due to million used for the purchases of property  plant  and equipment  primarily for fab and our assembly and test facilities in asia  and million for additional equity investments in the manufacturing joint venture  offset by million of net proceeds from sales and maturities of available for sale securities 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in  primarily due to million received from equipment sale and leaseback transactions completed by fasl llc  a million cash note to fasl llc from fujitsu as part of the fasl llc transaction  million of capital investment allowances received from the federal republic of germany as part of the fab project and million of proceeds from sale of stock under our employee stock purchase plan and employee stock option exercises  offset by million in payments on debt and capital lease obligations  and a million increase in a compensating cash balance 
the compensating cash balance represents the minimum cash balance that must be maintained by amd saxony in order to comply with the minimum liquidity covenant set forth in the dresden loan agreements 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in  primarily due to million in proceeds  net of million in debt issuance costs  from issuing our debentures  million in proceeds  net of million in debt issuance costs  from issuing our notes  million drawn pursuant to the september term loan agreement currently referred to as the july fasl term loan  net of million in debt issuance costs  million drawn pursuant to the loan and security agreement dated july  currently referred to as the july loan agreement  million in proceeds from equipment lease financing  million in proceeds from the sale of stock under our employee stock purchase plan and employee stock option exercises  and million of net capital investment allowances and interest subsidies received from the federal republic of germany and the state of saxony as part of the fab project

table of contents notes payable to banks on july   we amended and restated our loan and security agreement with a consortium of banks led by a domestic financial institution the july loan agreement 
we further amended the july loan agreement on october  the july loan agreement currently provides for a secured revolving line of credit of up to million that expires in july we can borrow  subject to amounts set aside by the lenders  up to percent of our eligible accounts receivable from oems and percent of our eligible accounts receivable from distributors 
as of december   no amount was outstanding under the july loan agreement

dresden term loan and dresden term loan guarantee amd saxony  our indirect  wholly owned german subsidiary  continues to facilitize fab  which began production in the second quarter of amd  the federal republic of germany  the state of saxony and a consortium of banks are providing financing for the project 
we currently estimate that the construction and facilitization costs of fab will be billion when it is fully equipped by the end of as of december   we had invested billion in amd saxony and we currently estimate that during we will invest approximately million 
in march  amd saxony entered into a loan agreement and other related agreements the dresden loan agreements with a consortium of banks led by dresdner bank ag  a german financial institution  in order to finance the project 
amd saxony has pledged substantially all of its property as security under the dresden loan agreements 
the dresden loan agreements were amended in february to accommodate the construction  facilitization  and operation of fab because most of the amounts under the dresden loan agreements are denominated in deutsche marks converted to euros  the dollar amounts are subject to change based on applicable exchange rates 
we used the exchange rate that was permanently fixed on january   of deutsche marks to one euro for the conversion of deutsche marks to euros  and then used exchange rate as of december   of euro to one us dollar to translate the amounts denominated in deutsche marks into us dollars 
the dresden loan agreements  as amended  provide for the funding of the construction and facilitization of fab the funding consists of equity contributions  subordinated and revolving loans and loan guarantees from  and full cost reimbursement through  amd  loans from a consortium of banks  and investment grants  investment allowances  interest subsidies  and loan guarantees from the federal republic of germany and the state of saxony 
the dresden loan agreements require that we partially fund fab project costs in the form of subordinated and revolving loans to  or equity investments in  amd saxony 
in accordance with the terms of the dresden loan agreements  as of december  we had provided million of subordinated loans and million of equity investments in amd saxony 
these amounts have been eliminated in our consolidated financial statements 
in addition to support from us  the consortium of banks referred to above made available million in loans to amd saxony to help fund fab project costs 
the loans have been fully drawn and a portion has been repaid 
amd saxony had million of such loans outstanding as of december   which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
finally  pursuant to a subsidy agreement  the federal republic of germany and the state of saxony are supporting the fab project  in accordance with the dresden loan agreements  in the form of guarantees equal to percent of amd saxony bank debt  or million  capital investment grants and allowances totaling up to approximately million  and interest subsidies totaling million 

table of contents of these amounts  amd saxony received approximately million in capital investment grants and allowances and million in interest subsidies 
in addition  amd saxony has received advance payments for interest subsidies amounting to million as of december  amd saxony also received million in research and development subsidies through december  amounts received under the subsidy agreement are recorded as a long term liability on our financial statements and are being amortized to operations ratably over the contractual life of the subsidy agreement as a reduction to operating expenses through december of historical exchange rates in effect at the time these investment grants and allowances and interest subsidies were received were used to translate amounts denominated in deutsche marks converted to euros into us dollars 
under the subsidy agreement  for the construction and financing of fab  amd saxony undertook to attain a certain employee headcount by december and to maintain such headcount until december noncompliance with the conditions of the grants  allowances and subsidies contained in the subsidy agreement could result in the forfeiture of all or a portion of the future amounts to be received  as well as the repayment of all or a portion of amounts received to date 
in december  amd saxony reduced its anticipated employment levels as a result of the restructuring plan 
consequently  as of december  headcount was below the level agreed to by amd saxony at which amd saxony would be entitled to receive the maximum amount of capital investment grants and allowances available 
however  the aggregate amount of grants and allowances actually received by amd saxony to date  calculated as a percentage of the maximum amount of grants and allowances available  does not exceed the actual headcount at amd saxony at december  calculated as a percentage of the headcount target undertaken in the subsidy agreement 
accordingly  amd saxony does not believe it has received grants and allowances in excess of its entitlement under the subsidy agreement 
however  we anticipate that the maximum amount of capital investment grants and allowances available under the subsidy agreement will be reduced from an originally anticipated amount of million to approximately million 
we adjusted the quarterly amortization of these amounts accordingly 
the dresden loan agreements  as amended  also require that we provide interim funding to amd saxony if either the remaining capital investment grants and allowances or the remaining interest subsidies are delayed  such funding to be repaid to amd  as amd saxony receives the investment grants and allowances or subsidies from the state of saxony and the federal republic of germany  fund shortfalls in government subsidies resulting from any default under the subsidy agreement caused by amd saxony or its affiliates  and guarantee of up to percent of amd saxony s obligations under the dresden loan agreements  which guarantee must not be less than million or more than million  until the bank loans are repaid in full 
as of december   the amount outstanding under the guarantee was million 
as amd saxony s obligations under the dresden loan agreements are included in our consolidated financial statements  no incremental liability is recorded under the dresden guarantee 
amd saxony would be in default under the dresden loan agreements if we  amd saxony or amd saxony holding gmbh amd holding fail to comply with certain obligations thereunder or upon the occurrence of certain events and if  after the occurrence of the event  the lenders determine that their legal or risk position is materially adversely affected 
circumstances that could result in a default include our failure to fund equity contributions or loans or otherwise comply with our obligations relating to the dresden loan agreements  the sale of shares in amd saxony or amd holding  the failure to pay material obligations  
table of contents the occurrence of a material adverse change or filings or proceedings in bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to us  amd saxony or amd holding  the occurrence of a default under the july loan agreement  and amd saxony s noncompliance with certain financial covenants  including minimum tangible net worth  minimum interest cover ratio  asset cover ratio and a minimum liquidity covenant 
generally  any default with respect to borrowings made or guaranteed by amd that results in recourse to us of more than million  and that is not cured by us  would result in a cross default under the dresden loan agreements 
as of december   we were in compliance with all conditions of the dresden loan agreements 
in the event we are unable to meet our obligations to amd saxony as required under the dresden loan agreements and the lenders determine that their legal or risk position is materially adversely affected  we will be in default under the dresden loan agreements  which would permit acceleration of the outstanding loans of approximately million 
the occurrence of a default under these agreements would likely result in a cross default under the indentures governing our debentures and notes 
we cannot assure that we would be able to obtain the funds necessary to fulfill these obligations 
any such failure would have a material adverse effect on us 
july fasl term loan and guarantee on july   we amended our september loan agreement and assigned it to fasl llc 
under the amended and restated term loan agreement the july fasl term loan  amounts borrowed bear interest at a variable rate of libor plus four percent  which was percent at december  repayment occurs in equal  consecutive  quarterly principal and interest installments ending in september as of december   million was outstanding under the july fasl term loan  of which percent is guaranteed by us and percent is guaranteed by fujitsu

fasl japan term loan and guarantee because most amounts under the fasl japan term loan are denominated in yen  the dollar amounts are subject to change based on applicable exchange rates 
we used the exchange rate as of december  of yen to one us dollar to translate the amounts denominated in yen into us dollars 
as a result of the fasl llc transaction  the manufacturing joint venture s third party loans were refinanced from the proceeds of a term loan in the aggregate principal amount of billion yen approximately million on december  entered into between fasl japan and a japanese financial institution 
under the agreement  the amounts borrowed bear an interest rate of tibor plus a spread that is determined by fujitsu s current debt rating and fasl japan s non consolidated net asset value as of the last day of its fiscal year

fujitsu cash note as a result of the fasl llc transaction  fujitsu also loaned million to fasl llc pursuant to a promissory note 
the note bears an interest rate of libor plus four percent  which was percent as of december   and has a term of three years 
the note is repayable in four equal payments  including interest  on september   december   march  and june  capital lease obligations on july   fasl japan entered into a sale leaseback transaction for certain equipment with a third party financial institution in the amount of billion yen approximately million on july  in cash proceeds 
upon execution of the agreement  the equipment had a net book value of approximately million 
as the term on the leaseback transaction is more than percent of the remaining economic lives of the equipment  we are accounting for the transaction as a capital lease 
we recognized an immediate loss of million on the transaction due to the fact that the fair market value of the equipment was less than its net book value at the time of the transaction 
we also recorded a deferred loss of approximately million which is being amortized over the term of the lease in proportion to the amortization of the underlying leased assets 
we guaranteed percent of the outstanding obligations  under the lease arrangement 
as of december   the outstanding lease obligations under this agreement were approximately million

table of contents guarantees of indebtedness not recorded on our consolidated balance sheets the following table summarizes the principal guarantees issued as of december  for which the related underlying liabilities are not recorded on our consolidated balance sheets as of december  and their expected expiration dates amounts of guarantee expiration per period amounts guaranteed and beyond in thousands fasl llc operating lease guarantees amtc payment guarantee amtc term loan guarantee amtc rental guarantee total guarantee amounts guaranteed represent the principal amount of the underlying obligations and are exclusive of obligations for interest  fees and expenses 
amounts outstanding will diminish until the expiration of the guarantee 
we have not recorded any liability in our consolidated financial statements associated with the guarantees because they were issued prior to the effective date of fin fasl llc operating lease guarantees we guaranteed certain operating leases entered into by fasl llc and its subsidiaries totaling approximately million as of december  the amounts guaranteed are reduced by the actual amount of lease payments paid by fasl llc over the lease terms 
amtc and bac guarantees the advanced mask technology center gmbh co 
kg amtc and maskhouse building administration gmbh co  kg bac are joint ventures formed by us  infineon technologies ag and dupont photomasks  inc for the purpose of constructing and operating a new advanced photomask facility in dresden  germany 
to finance the project  bac and amtc entered into a million revolving credit facility and a million term loan in december also in december  in order to occupy the photomask facility  amtc entered into a rental agreement with bac 
with regard to these commitments by bac and amtc  we guaranteed up to approximately million plus interest and expenses under the term loan  up to approximately million plus interest and expenses under the revolving loan  and up to approximately million  initially  under the rental agreement 
the obligations under the rental agreement guarantee diminish over time through as the term loan is repaid 
however  under certain circumstances of default by the other tenant of the photomask facility under its rental agreement with bac and certain circumstances of default by more than one joint venture partner under its rental agreement guarantee obligations  the maximum potential amount of our obligations under the rental agreement guarantee is approximately million 
as of december   million was drawn under the revolving credit facility  and million was drawn under the term loan 
these borrowings are subject to the aforementioned guarantees except that our guarantee obligations with respect to the term loan terminated in february because the amtc occupied the photomask facility under the rental agreement during and the rental guarantee replaced the term loan guarantee 
other financial matters fab a significant amount of the costs of the fab project are denominated in euro 
we used the exchange rate of euro to one us dollar as of december  to translate the amounts set forth below into us dollars 
we expect that over the next four years capital expenditures for fab will be approximately 
table of contents billion  of which approximately million will occur in in connection with the fab project  we expect to obtain external financing of approximately million in the form of loans from a consortium of banks  and up to approximately million in grants and allowances from the federal republic of germany and the state of saxony 
we also expect to obtain financing of approximately million from the state of saxony  through an investment entity  and a group of european investors led by the project engineer and general contractor  m w zander 
we will provide the balance of the funding to construct and facilitize fab in addition  upon the execution of final documentation  which we expect will occur in the first half of  we will be required to guarantee percent of the obligations of amd fab under the loan agreements with the banks and to fund any shortfalls in government grants and allowances 
as of december   we have invested approximately million in exchange for our equity interest in amd fab fasl llc 
during the four year period commencing on june   we are obligated to provide fasl llc with additional funding to finance operations shortfalls  if any 
generally  fasl llc is first required to seek any required financing from external sources 
however  if such third party financing is not available  we must provide funding to fasl llc equal to our pro rata ownership interest in fasl llc  which is currently percent 
at this time  we believe that fasl llc would be able to obtain such external financing when needed 
however  there is no assurance that this will happen and currently we cannot estimate the amount of such additional funding  if any  that we are required to provide during this four year period 
outlook in general  as we look ahead to  we are encouraged by a recovering economy and positive projections for the semiconductor industry 
during we expect to take advantage of additional cost efficiencies from our fasl llc integration and from fasl llc s conversion to nanometer manufacturing process technology on certain of its products and our conversion to nanometer manufacturing process technology for our microprocessor products 
during the first quarter of  for our computation products segment  we expect net sales to decline slightly in accordance with industry seasonal patterns 
for our memory products segment  notwithstanding typical seasonal patterns  we expect net sales to be approximately flat for the quarter due to our position in the market and improving average selling prices  which we expect will be driven by increased average bit densities in the products sold and increased shipments of products based on mirrorbit technology 
in the aggregate  we believe seasonal patterns will prevail and aggregate net sales will decline slightly in the first quarter of we expect our capital investments in to increase in comparison with we plan to make capital investments of approximately billion during  including fab construction and some equipment purchases  equipment purchases for fasl llc s wafer fabrication and assembly and test facilities and to complete the transition to nanometer manufacturing process technology at fab we expect depreciation and amortization expense to be approximately billion for we believe that we will be profitable for fiscal and that gross margins will improve in comparison to however  economic and industry conditions remain uncertain and continue to make it particularly difficult to forecast product demand 
if economic conditions do not continue to improve in the near term in accordance with our expectations  or if the semiconductor industry experiences a significant downturn  our revenues and profitability will be adversely affected 
we believe that cash flows from operations and current cash balances  together with external financing will be sufficient to fund operations and capital investments in the short term 
should additional funding be required such as to meet payment obligations of our long term debts when due  or to finance the construction and facilitization of fab  we may need to raise the required funds through borrowings or public or private sales of debt or equity securities 
such funding may be obtained through bank borrowings or from the issuance of additional debt or equity securities  which may be issued from time to time under an effective registration 
table of contents statement  through the issuance of securities in a transaction exempt from registration under the securities act of  or a combination of one or more of the foregoing 
we believe  that in the event of such requirements  we will be able to access the capital markets on terms and in amounts adequate to meet our objectives 
however  given the possibility of changes in market conditions or other occurrences  there can be no certainty that such funding will be available in quantities or on terms favorable to us

risk factors we must achieve further market acceptance for our amd opteron and amd athlon microprocessors  or we will be materially adversely affected 
we introduced our amd opteron processors in april  and we 
table of contents introduced our amd athlon processors in september we designed these processors to provide users with the ability to take advantage of bit applications while preserving their ability to run existing bit applications on servers and workstations and on desktop and mobile pcs 
the success of these processors is subject to risks and uncertainties including market acceptance of our new bit technology  amd  including the willingness of users to purchase products with bit capability prior to having transitioned to bit computing  our ability to produce these processors in a timely manner on new process technologies  including nanometer silicon on insulator technology  in the volume and with the performance and feature set required by customers  our ability to successfully transition to nanometer manufacturing process technology on a timely basis  the availability  performance and feature set of motherboards and chipsets designed for these processors  and the support of operating system and application program providers for our bit instruction set  including timely development of bit applications 
we cannot be certain that our substantial investments for research and development of process technologies will lead to timely improvements in technology and equipment used to fabricate our products or that we will have sufficient resources to invest in the level of research and development that is required to remain competitive 
we make substantial investments in research and development for process technologies in an effort to improve the technologies and equipment used to fabricate our products 
in december we executed an agreement with ibm to jointly develop new logic process technologies  particularly and nanometer technologies to be implemented on millimeter silicon wafers  for use in producing future high performance microprocessor products 
the successful and timely development and implementation of silicon on insulator technology and the achievement of other milestones set forth in this agreement are critical to our amd opteron and amd athlon microprocessors and to our ability to commence operations at fab in accordance with our planned schedule 
during and  we paid approximately million to ibm in connection with agreements and services related to research and development activities 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to develop  or obtain or successfully implement leading edge process technologies needed to fabricate future generations of our products profitably or on a timely basis 
furthermore  we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient resources to maintain the level of investment in research and development that is required for us to remain competitive or that our partnerships will be successful 
we have experienced substantial fluctuations in revenues since  and we may experience declines in revenues and increases in operating losses in the future 
our historical financial results have been  and our future financial results are anticipated to be  subject to substantial fluctuations 
our total revenues were  million for and  million for compared to  million for the decline from to was due primarily to a decrease in unit sales and in average selling prices for our computation products  resulting from the industry wide weakness in pc sales  and a decrease in average selling prices for our memory products  reflecting continued weakness in the telecommunications and networking equipment industries  and the execution of our plan to align our microprocessor inventory in the supply chain with forecasted demand  which included our decision  primarily in the third and fourth quarters of  to limit shipments and to accept receipt of product returns from certain customers 
we incurred a net loss of million for the fiscal year ended december   and billion for  compared to a net loss of million for if conditions do not continue to improve in the microprocessor or flash memory markets in accordance with our expectations we may experience declines in revenue and operating losses 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to return to profitability or that  if we do  we will be able to sustain it 
the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and has until recently been in a severe downturn that adversely affected  and may in the future adversely affect  our business 
the highly cyclical semiconductor industry has experienced significant downturns  often in connection with maturing product cycles  manufacturing overcapacity and declines in general economic conditions 
the most recent downturn  which began in the fourth 
table of contents quarter of  was severe and prolonged  and future downturns may also be severe and prolonged 
our financial performance has been negatively affected by these downturns  including the incurrence of substantial losses during the most recent downturn  as a result of the cyclical nature of the supply demand imbalances in the semiconductor industry  a decline in demand for end user products that incorporate our semiconductors  excess inventory levels in the channels of distribution  including our customers  excess production capacity  and accelerated declines in average selling prices 
if conditions do not continue to improve in the near term in accordance with our expectations  or if these conditions in the semiconductor industry occur in the future  as they likely will to a lesser or greater degree  our business will be adversely affected 
fluctuations in the personal computer market may continue to materially adversely affect us 
the computation products segment of our business is dependent upon the pc market 
industry wide fluctuations in the pc marketplace have materially adversely affected us in the past and may materially adversely affect us in the future 
depending on the growth rate of pcs sold  sales of our microprocessors may not grow and may even decrease 
if end user demand for pcs is below our expectations  we may be adversely affected 
in addition  current trends of consolidation within the personal computer industry  as evidenced by the hewlett packard compaq merger  as well as potential market share increases by customers who exclusively purchase microprocessors from intel corporation  such as dell  inc  could further materially adversely affect us 
we plan for significant capital expenditures in  and if we cannot generate the capital required for these capital expenditures and other ongoing operating expenses through operating cash flow and external financing activities  we may be materially adversely affected 
we plan for capital expenditures of approximately billion in our ability to fund these expenditures depends on generating sufficient cash flow from operations and the availability of external financing  including third party loans and investments for the fab project and third party financing for fasl llc s expansion plans 
our capital expenditures for include approximately million for the fab project and approximately million for the fab project 
in addition  fasl llc expects to spend approximately million in connection with its plans to increase the manufacturing capacity of its wafer fabrication and assembly and test facilities and for other research and development activities 
during the four year period commencing on june   we are also obligated to provide fasl llc with additional funding to finance operational cash flow needs 
generally  fasl llc is first required to seek any required financing from external sources 
however  if such third party financing is not available  we must provide funding to fasl llc equal to our pro rata ownership interest in fasl llc  which is currently percent 
in addition  a significant amount of the costs of the fab project are denominated in euro 
when we initially forecasted our budget for the fab project  we modeled certain financial assumptions  including that the foreign exchange rate  over time  would be one euro to one us dollar 
since our initial forecast  the us dollar has depreciated against the euro 
if the us dollar continues to depreciate against the euro  the costs of the fab project would be higher than we planned  which could have a material adverse effect on us 
these capital expenditures  together with ongoing operating expenses  will be a substantial drain on our cash flow and will decrease our cash balances 
the timing and amount of our capital requirements cannot be precisely determined at this time and will depend on a number of factors  including demand for products  product mix  changes in semiconductor industry conditions and competitive factors 
we regularly assess markets for external 
table of contents financing opportunities  including debt and equity 
additional debt or equity financing may not be available when needed or  if available  may not be available on satisfactory terms 
our inability to obtain needed debt and or equity financing or to generate sufficient cash from operations may require us to abandon planned projects or curtail capital expenditures 
if we abandon projects such as the fab project  we may have to write off related costs that we capitalized and we may be required to continue to make payments or otherwise be liable pursuant to then existing contracts that we cannot terminate at will or without significant penalties  which would have a material adverse effect on us 
we have a substantial amount of debt and debt service obligations  and may incur additional debt  which could adversely affect our financial position and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under the agreements governing our indebtedness 
we have a substantial amount of debt and we may incur additional debt in the future 
at december   our total debt was billion and stockholders equity was billion 
in addition  at december   we had up to million of availability under our july loan agreement subject to our borrowing base 
we had also guaranteed approximately million of debt  which is not reflected as debt on our balance sheet 
our high degree of leverage may limit our ability to use our cash flow or obtain additional financing for future working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions or other general corporate purposes  require a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make debt service payments  limit our flexibility to plan for  or react to  changes in our business and industry  place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our less leveraged competitors  and increase our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions 
our ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt or our guarantees of other parties debts will depend on our financial and operating performance  which may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial  business and other factors many of which are beyond our control 
we cannot assure you that we will continue to generate sufficient cash flow or that we will be able to borrow funds under our credit facilities in amounts sufficient to enable us to service our debt  or meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements 
if we are not able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or to borrow sufficient funds to service our debt  due to borrowing base restrictions or otherwise  we may be required to sell assets or equity  reduce capital expenditures  refinance all or a portion of our existing debt or obtain additional financing 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance our debt  sell assets or equity  or borrow more funds on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
if we are not successful in integrating the operations of fasl llc  we could be materially adversely affected 
effective june   we and fujitsu limited executed several agreements that resulted in the integration of our and fujitsu s flash memory operations 
we contributed flash memory inventory  fab in austin  texas  the sdc  and our flash memory assembly and test operations in thailand  malaysia and china 
fujitsu contributed its flash memory division  including related inventory  cash  and its flash memory assembly and test operations in malaysia 
in addition  both we and fujitsu contributed our respective investments in our previous manufacturing joint venture  fujitsu amd semiconductor limited  located in aizu wakamatsu  japan  which became a wholly owned subsidiary of fasl llc 
our anticipated benefits from this transaction are subject to  among other things  the following risks the possibility that fasl llc will not be successful because of problems integrating the operations and employees of the two companies or achieving the efficiencies and other advantages intended by the transaction  and 
table of contents the possibility that global business and economic conditions will worsen  resulting in lower than currently expected demand for flash memory products 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully integrate these operations or that we will be able to achieve and sustain any benefit from fasl llc s creation 
intel corporation s dominance of the microprocessor market  its position in the flash memory market and its business practices may limit our ability to compete effectively 
intel has dominated the market for microprocessors used in desktop and mobile pcs for many years 
intel is also a significant competitor in the server segment of the microprocessor market and in the flash memory market 
because of its dominant position  intel has been able to control x microprocessor and pc system standards and dictate the type of products the microprocessor market requires of intel s competitors 
in addition  intel s significant financial resources allow it to market its products aggressively  to target our customers and our channel partners with special incentives  and to discipline customers who do business with us 
these aggressive activities can result in lower unit sales and average selling prices for our products and adversely affect our margins and profitability 
intel also exerts substantial influence over pc manufacturers and their channels of distribution through the intel inside brand program and other marketing programs 
as long as intel remains in this dominant position  we may be materially adversely affected by its pricing and allocation strategies and actions  product mix and introduction schedules  product bundling  marketing and merchandising strategies  exclusivity payments to its current and potential customers  control over industry standards  pc manufacturers and other pc industry participants  including motherboard  chipset and basic input output system  or bios  suppliers  and user brand loyalty 
intel also dominates the pc system platform 
as a result  pc oems are highly dependent on intel  less innovative on their own and  to a large extent  are distributors of intel technology 
in marketing our microprocessors to oems we depend on third party companies other than intel for the design and manufacture of core logic chipsets  graphics chips  motherboards  bios software and other components 
in recent years  many of these third party designers and manufacturers have lost significant market share to intel or exited the business 
in addition  these companies produce chipsets  motherboards  bios software and other components to support each new generation of intel s microprocessors  and intel has significant leverage over their business opportunities 
we do not currently plan to develop microprocessors that are bus interface protocol compatible with intel microprocessors because our patent cross license agreement with intel does not extend to microprocessors that are bus interface protocol compatible with intel s six and subsequent generation processors 
thus  our microprocessors are not designed to function with motherboards and chipsets designed to work with intel microprocessors 
our ability to compete with intel in the market for microprocessors will depend on our ability to develop relationships with infrastructure providers and ensure that these third party designers and manufacturers design pc platforms to support new generations of our microprocessors 
a failure of the designers and producers of motherboards  chipsets and other system components to support our microprocessor offerings  particularly our new amd athlon and amd opteron microprocessors  would have a material adverse effect on us 
we expect intel to maintain its dominant position in the microprocessor market as well as to continue to invest heavily in research and development  new manufacturing facilities and other technology companies 
intel has substantially greater financial resources than we do and accordingly spends substantially greater amounts on research and development than we do 
we expect competition from intel to increase in and beyond to the 
table of contents extent intel reduces prices for its products and as intel introduces new competitive products 
for example  in february  intel announced that it intends to introduce bit processors for servers and workstations that will be able to run existing bit software applications in mid we believe that these processors will compete with our amd opteron microprocessors 
in addition  intel announced that it will offer bit processors for the desktop market and other market segments that will be able to run existing bit software applications in a time frame based on both timing and availability of the infrastructure required to support them  and customer demand 
these products would compete with our amd athlon microprocessors 
moreover  intel currently manufactures certain of its microprocessor products on millimeter wafers using nanometer process technology 
use of nanometer technology can result in products that are higher performing  use less power and that cost less to manufacture 
use of millimeter wafers can decrease manufacturing costs and increase capacity by yielding more equivalent chips per wafer than millimeter wafers 
we have not yet made comparable transitions at our microprocessor manufacturing facilities 
as a result  we may be more vulnerable to intel s aggressive pricing strategies for microprocessor products 
intel s strong position in the microprocessor market  its existing relationships with top tier oems and its aggressive pricing strategies could result in lower unit sales and average selling prices for our products  which could adversely affect our revenues 
if we are unable to develop  produce and successfully market higher performing microprocessor products  we may be materially adversely affected 
the microprocessor market is characterized by short product life cycles and migration to ever higher performance microprocessors 
to compete successfully  we must transition to new process technologies at a fast pace and offer higher performance microprocessors in significantly greater volumes at competitive prices 
if we fail to achieve yield and volume goals or to offer higher performance microprocessors in significant volume on a timely basis and at competitive prices  we could be materially adversely affected 
to be successful  we must increase sales of our x microprocessor products to existing customers and develop new customers in both consumer and commercial markets  particularly the latter 
our production and sales plans for microprocessors are subject to other risks and uncertainties  including market acceptance for the amd opteron and amd athlon microprocessors  which rely on market acceptance and demand for our amd technology  our ability to fund our planned millimeter wafer fabrication facility and develop associated process technologies that will be required for long term competitiveness  our ability to increase our share of the enterprise market with tier one oem customers in order to have the demand necessary to utilize the capacity of our planned millimeter wafer fabrication facility  our ability to successfully market the amd athlon xp  amd opteron  amd athlon and amd duron processors  which rely in part on market acceptance of a metric based on overall processor performance versus processor clock speed measured in megahertz frequency  the pace at which we expect to be able to convert production in fab to nanometer process technology  our ability to maintain adequate selling prices of microprocessors despite increasingly aggressive intel pricing strategies  marketing programs  new product introductions and product bundlings of microprocessors  motherboards and chipsets  our ability  on a timely basis  to produce microprocessors in the volume and with the performance and feature set required by customers  our ability to attract and retain engineering and design talent  our ability to expand system design capabilities  and the availability and acceptance of motherboards and chipsets designed for our microprocessors 

table of contents our ability to increase microprocessor product revenues and benefit fully from the substantial investments we have made and continue to make related to microprocessors depends on the success of our amd opteron and amd athlon processors and the continuing success of our amd athlon xp and amd duron microprocessors 
if we fail to achieve continued and expanded market acceptance of our microprocessors  we may be materially adversely affected 
if we were to lose microsoft corporation s support for our products  our ability to market our processors would be materially adversely affected 
our ability to innovate beyond the x instruction set controlled by intel depends on microsoft s designing and developing its operating systems to run on or support our microprocessor products 
if microsoft does not continue to design and develop its operating systems so that they work with our x instruction sets  including our amd technology introduced with our amd opteron and amd athlon processors  independent software providers may forego designing their software applications to take advantage of our innovations and customers may not purchase pcs with our microprocessors 
if we fail to retain the support of microsoft  our ability to market our processors could be materially adversely affected 
the loss of a significant customer for our spansion flash memory products in the high end mobile telephone market  or a lack of market acceptance of fasl llc s mirrorbit technology may have a material adverse effect on us 
since the third quarter of  our flash memory product sales growth was almost entirely based on strength in the high end mobile phone market 
to date  our sales in that market have been concentrated with a few customers 
in addition  we expect competition in the market for flash memory devices to continue to increase as new competitors enter the flash memory market  particularly the nor segment  existing competing manufacturers introduce new products or pursue aggressive pricing strategies and industry wide production capacity increases 
we may be unable to maintain or increase our market share in flash memory devices as the market develops and other competitors introduce new competing products 
a decline in unit sales of our flash memory devices  lower average selling prices  a downturn in the mobile phone market or a loss of a significant mobile phone customer  would have a material adverse effect on us 
in july  we commenced production shipments of the first product with mirrorbit technology 
mirrorbit technology is a memory cell architecture that enables flash memory products to hold twice as much data as standard flash memory devices 
a lack of customer or market acceptance  or any substantial difficulty in transitioning flash memory products  including those based on mirrorbit technology  to any future process technology could reduce fasl llc s ability to be competitive in the market and could have a material adverse effect on us 
spansion flash memory products are based on the nor architecture  and a significant market shift to the nand architecture could materially adversely affect us 
spansion flash memory products are based on the boolean logic based nor not or architecture  which is typically used for code execution 
fasl llc does not manufacture products based on nand not and architecture  which typically offers greater storage capacity 
during  sales of products based on nand architecture have grown at higher rates than sales of nor products 
this has resulted in the nand vendors gaining a greater share of the overall flash market 
any significant shift in the marketplace to products based on nand architecture or other architectures may reduce the total market available to us and therefore reduce our market share  which could have a material adverse effect on us 
worldwide economic and political conditions may affect demand for our products and slow payment by our customers 
the recent economic slowdown in the united states and worldwide  exacerbated by the occurrence and threat of terrorist attacks and consequences of sustained military action in the middle east  adversely affected demand for our products 
although economic conditions began to improve in the second half of  another decline of the worldwide semiconductor market or a future decline in economic conditions in any significant geographic area would likely decrease the overall demand for our products  which could have a material adverse effect on us 
if the economic slowdown returns as a result of terrorist activities  military action or otherwise  it could adversely impact our customers ability to pay us in a timely manner 

table of contents manufacturing capacity constraints and manufacturing capacity utilization rates may adversely affect us 
there may be situations in which our manufacturing facilities are inadequate to meet the demand for certain of our products 
our inability to obtain sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet demand  either in our own facilities or through foundry or similar arrangements with others  could have a material adverse effect on us 
if we do not transition to nanometer manufacturing process technology at fab on a timely basis  we may not be able to meet the demand for certain of our microprocessor products 
in addition  fasl llc s manufacturing facilities may be inadequate to meet our demand for certain flash memory products 
as a result  fasl llc may not be able to provide us with sufficient quantities of these products to allow us to meet demand for these products from our customers 
at times we may underutilize our manufacturing facilities as a result of reduced demand for certain of our products 
we are substantially increasing our manufacturing capacity by building fab  transitioning to smaller manufacturing process technologies and making significant capital investments in fab in addition  fasl llc is increasing its manufacturing capacity by transitioning to smaller manufacturing process technologies  expanding fab  jv  jv  and jv and increasing the capacity of its assembly and test facilities to accommodate both a growth in units that transition to higher densities and an increase in mcp products 
if the increase in demand for our products is not consistent with our expectations  we and fasl llc may underutilize manufacturing facilities  and we could be materially adversely affected 
this has in the past had  and in the future may have  a material adverse effect on our earnings and cash flow 
we believe that at this time  the most significant risk is manufacturing capacity constraint 
unless we maintain manufacturing efficiency  our future profitability could be materially adversely affected 
manufacturing semiconductor components involves highly complex processes that require advanced equipment 
we and our competitors continuously modify these processes in an effort to improve yields and product performance  and decrease costs 
during  we plan to transition our microprocessor production to nanometer process technology  and fasl llc intends to transition the production of certain of its memory products to nanometer process technology 
during periods when we or fasl llc are implementing new process technologies  our or fasl llc s manufacturing facilities may not be fully productive 
substantial delay in the technology transitions in fab to smaller process technologies employing silicon on insulator technology and in fasl llc s wafer fabrication facilities to smaller geometries could have a material adverse effect on us  particularly if our competitors transition to more cost effective technologies earlier than we do 
for example  intel currently manufactures certain microprocessor products on millimeter wafers using nanometer process technology 
use of nanometer technology can result in products that are higher performing  use less power and that cost less to manufacture 
use of millimeter wafers can decrease manufacturing costs and increase capacity by yielding more equivalent chips per wafer than millimeter wafers 
we have not yet made comparable transitions at our microprocessor manufacturing facilities 
furthermore  impurities or other difficulties in the manufacturing process can lower yields 
our manufacturing efficiency will be an important factor in our future profitability  and we cannot be sure that we will be able to maintain our manufacturing efficiency or increase manufacturing efficiency to the same extent as our competitors 
we may experience manufacturing problems in achieving acceptable yields or product delivery delays in the future as a result of  among other things  capacity constraints  construction delays  delays in meeting the milestones set forth in our joint development agreement with ibm  upgrading or expanding existing facilities  or changing our process technologies  which could result in a loss of future revenues 
our results of operations could also be adversely affected by the increase in fixed costs and operating expenses related to increases in production capacity if revenues do not increase proportionately 
external factors  such as the sars virus  bird flu and potential terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war  may materially adversely affect us 
in early  the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars virus 
table of contents had an adverse effect upon the asian economies and affected demand for our products in asia 
a new outbreak of the virus  or a new virus such as the recent bird flu virus  could have a similar impact on demand for our products in asia 
in addition  if there were to be a case of sars discovered in any of our operations in asia  the measures to prevent the spread of the virus could disrupt our operations at that location 
terrorist attacks may negatively affect our operations directly or indirectly and such attacks or related armed conflicts may directly impact our physical facilities or those of our suppliers or customers 
furthermore  these attacks may make travel and the transportation of our products more difficult and more expensive  and ultimately affect our sales 
also as a result of terrorism  the united states may be involved in armed conflicts that could have a further impact on our sales  our supply chain and our ability to deliver products to our customers 
political and economic instability in some regions of the world may also result and could negatively impact our business 
the consequences of armed conflicts are unpredictable  and we may not be able to foresee events that could have an adverse effect on our business 
more generally  any of these events could cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease or result in increased volatility to the united states economy and worldwide financial markets 
any of these occurrences could have a significant impact on our operating results and financial condition  and also may result in the volatility of the market price for our securities and on the future prices of our securities 
intense competition in the integrated circuit industry may materially adversely affect us 
the integrated circuit industry is intensely competitive 
products compete on performance  quality  reliability  price  adherence to industry standards  software and hardware compatibility  marketing and distribution capability  brand recognition  and availability 
after a product is introduced  costs and average selling prices normally decrease over time as production efficiency improves  competitors enter the market  and successive generations of products are developed and introduced for sale 
failure to reduce our costs on existing products or to develop and introduce  on a cost effective and timely basis  new products or enhanced versions of existing products with higher margins  would have a material adverse effect on us 
if our microprocessors are not compatible with some or all industry standard software and hardware  we could be materially adversely affected 
our microprocessors may not be fully compatible with some or all industry standard software and hardware 
further  we may be unsuccessful in correcting any such compatibility problems in a timely manner 
if our customers are unable to achieve compatibility with software or hardware after our products are shipped in volume  we could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  the mere announcement of an incompatibility problem relating to our products could have a material adverse effect on us 
our debt instruments impose restrictions on us that may adversely affect our ability to operate our business 
our july loan agreement  as amended  contains restrictive covenants and also requires us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy other financial condition tests when our net domestic cash is below specified amounts  and the dresden loan agreements impose restrictive covenants on amd saxony  including a restriction on its ability to pay dividends 
the july fasl term loan contains restrictive covenants  including a prohibition on fasl llc s ability to pay dividends and also requires fasl llc to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy other financial condition tests when its net domestic cash is below specified amounts 
our ability to satisfy the covenants  financial ratios and tests of our debt instruments  and fasl llc s ability to satisfy the covenants  financial ratios and tests of the july fasl term loan  can be affected by events beyond our or fasl llc s control 
we cannot assure you that we or fasl llc will meet those requirements 
a breach of any of these covenants  financial ratios or tests could result in a default under our july loan agreement  the july fasl term loan and or the dresden loan agreements 
in addition  these agreements contain cross default provisions whereby a default under one agreement would likely result in 
table of contents cross default under agreements covering other borrowings 
for example  the occurrence of a default under the july fasl term loan would cause a cross default under the july loan agreement and a default under the july loan agreement or under the indentures governing our debentures and our notes would cause a cross default under the dresden loan agreements 
the occurrence of a default under any of these borrowing arrangements would permit the applicable lenders or note holders to declare all amounts outstanding under those borrowing arrangements to be immediately due and payable and would permit the lenders to terminate all commitments to extend further credit 
if we or fasl llc were unable to repay those amounts  the lenders under the july loan agreement  the july fasl term loan agreement and the dresden loan agreements could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness 
we have granted a security interest in substantially all of our inventory and accounts receivable under our july loan agreement  fasl llc has granted a security interest in certain property  plant and equipment as security under the july fasl term loan agreement  and amd saxony has pledged substantially all of its property as security under the dresden loan agreements 
if the lenders under any of the credit facilities or the note holders or the trustee under the indentures governing our debentures and our notes accelerate the repayment of borrowings  we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient assets to repay those borrowings and our other indebtedness 
costs related to defective products could have a material adverse effect on us 
one or more of our products may be found to be defective after the product has been shipped to customers in volume 
the cost of a recall  software fix  product replacements and or product returns may be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on us 
in addition  modifications needed to fix the defect may impede performance of the product 
if essential raw materials are not available to manufacture our products  we could be materially adversely affected 
certain raw materials we use in the manufacture of our products and fasl llc uses in the manufacture of its products are available from a limited number of suppliers 
for example  we are dependent on key chemicals from a limited number of suppliers and rely on a few foreign companies to supply the majority of certain types of integrated circuit packages we purchase 
similarly  fasl llc purchases commercial non flash memory die  such as sram  from third party suppliers and incorporates these die into its mcp products 
interruption of supply or increased demand in the industry could cause shortages and price increases in various essential materials 
if we or fasl llc are unable to procure certain of these materials  we or fasl llc might have to reduce our manufacturing operations 
such a reduction could have a material adverse effect on us 
our operations in foreign countries are subject to political and economic risks  which could have a material adverse effect on us 
nearly all product assembly and final testing of our microprocessor products are performed at our manufacturing facilities in malaysia  and singapore  or by subcontractors in the united states and asia 
nearly all product assembly and final testing of spansion products are performed at fasl llc s facilities in malaysia  thailand  and china 
we manufacture our microprocessors in germany 
we also depend on foreign foundry suppliers for the production of our personal connectivity solutions and chipset products  international joint ventures for the manufacture of optical photomasks that we intend to use in the manufacture of our microprocessors  and we have international sales operations 
the political and economic risks associated with our operations in foreign countries include expropriation  changes in a specific country s or region s political or economic conditions  trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements  difficulty in protecting our intellectual property  changes in foreign currency exchange rates and currency controls  changes in freight and interest rates  disruption in air transportation between the united states and our overseas facilities  and loss or modification of exemptions for taxes and tariffs  
table of contents any of the above risks  should they occur  could have a material adverse effect on us 
as part of our business strategy  we are continuing to seek expansion of product sales in emerging overseas markets 
expansion into emerging overseas markets presents similar political and economic risks as described above  and we may be unsuccessful in our strategy to penetrate these emerging overseas markets 
also  a significant portion of the manufacturing costs for our microprocessor products is denominated in euros while sales of those products are denominated primarily in us dollars 
if the us dollar continues to depreciate against the euro in the foreign exchange market  our gross margins may deteriorate 
our inability to continue to attract and retain key personnel may hinder our product development programs 
our future success depends upon the continued service of numerous key engineering  manufacturing  marketing  sales and executive personnel 
if we are not able to continue to attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel necessary for our business  the progress of our product development programs could be hindered  and we could be otherwise materially adversely affected 
our inability to effectively implement new modules of our enterprise resource planning system could have a material adverse effect on us 
in november  we restarted the implementation of the sales and distribution modules of the enterprise resource planning erp system that we initially began implementing in early and postponed from september to november as part of our cost cutting initiatives 
the erp system is intended to provide an integrated information system to serve all of amd 
we are heavily dependent on the proper function of our internal systems to conduct our business 
system failure or malfunctioning may result in disruption of operations and the inability to process transactions 
if we encounter unforeseen problems with regard to system operations or these additional module implementations  we could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  if the semiconductor industry does not continue to improve in accordance with our expectations or undergoes another downturn or if demand for our products is lower than our expectations  we may again postpone implementation of these modules 
we rely on third parties to provide supply chain logistics functions  including physical distribution of our products  and some information technology services 
we rely on a third party provider to deliver our products to our customers and to distribute materials for fab and the sdc 
in addition  we rely on a third party provider in india to provide certain information technology services to us  including helpdesk support  desktop application services  business and software support applications  server and storage administration  data center operations  database administration  and voice  video and remote access 
our relationships with these providers is governed by fixed term contracts 
we cannot guarantee that these providers will fulfill their respective responsibilities in a timely manner in accordance with the contract terms  in which case our internal operations  the distribution of our products to our customers and the distribution of materials for fab and the sdc may be adversely affected 
also  we cannot guarantee that our contracts with these third party providers will be renewed  in which case we would have to transition these functions in house or secure new providers  which may have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  we decided to co source these functions to third parties primarily to lower our operating expenses and create a more variable cost structure for the company 
however  if the costs related to administration  communication and coordination of these third party providers are greater than we expect  then we will not realize our anticipated cost savings 
our operating results are subject to substantial seasonal fluctuations 
our operating results tend to vary seasonally 
for example  our revenues are generally higher in the fourth quarter than the third quarter of each year 
this seasonal pattern is largely a result of decreased demand in europe during the summer months and higher demand in the retail sector of the pc market during the winter holiday season 
in recent quarters  a substantial portion of our quarterly sales have been made in the last month of the quarter 

table of contents uncertainties involving the ordering  and shipment of  and payment for our products could materially adversely affect us 
our sales are typically made pursuant to individual purchase orders  and we generally do not have long term supply arrangements with our customers 
generally  our customers may cancel orders days prior to shipment without incurring a significant penalty 
we base our inventory levels on customers estimates of demand for their products  which is difficult to predict 
this difficulty may be compounded when we sell to oems indirectly through distributors  as our forecasts for demand are then based on estimates provided by multiple parties 
in addition  our customers may change their inventory practices on short notice for any reason 
the cancellation or deferral of product orders  the return of previously sold products or overproduction due to failure of anticipated orders to materialize could result in excess or obsolete inventory  which could result in write downs of inventory 
while we believe inventories in the supply chain are currently at reasonable levels  market conditions are uncertain and these and other factors could materially adversely affect our revenues 
our price protection obligations and return rights under specific provisions in our agreements with distributors may adversely affect us 
distributors typically maintain an inventory of our products 
in most instances  our agreements with distributors protect their inventory of our products against price reductions  as well as products that are slow moving or have been discontinued 
these agreements  which may be canceled by either party on a specified notice  generally allow for the return of our products 
we defer the gross margins on our sales to distributors  resulting from both our deferral of revenue and related product costs  until the applicable products are re sold by the distributors 
the price protection and return rights we offer to our distributors could materially adversely affect us if distributors exercise these rights as a result of an unexpected significant decline in the price of our products or otherwise 
if we cannot adequately protect our technology or other intellectual property  in the united states and abroad  through patents  copyrights  trade secrets  trademarks and other measures  we may lose a competitive advantage and incur significant expenses 
we may not be able to adequately protect our technology or other intellectual property  in the united states and abroad  through patents  copyrights  trade secrets  trademarks and other measures 
any patent licensed by us or issued to us could be challenged  invalidated or circumvented or rights granted thereunder may not provide a competitive advantage to us 
furthermore  patent applications that we file may not result in issuance of a patent 
despite our efforts to protect our rights  others may independently develop similar products  duplicate our products or design around our patents and other rights 
in addition  it is difficult to cost effectively monitor compliance with  and enforce  our intellectual property on a worldwide basis 
from time to time  we have been notified that we may be infringing intellectual property rights of others 
if any such claims are asserted against us  we may seek to obtain a license under the third party s intellectual property rights 
we cannot assure you that all necessary licenses can be obtained on satisfactory terms  if at all 
we could decide  in the alternative  to resort to litigation to challenge such claims 
such challenges could be extremely expensive and time consuming and could have a material adverse effect on us 
we cannot assure you that litigation related to the intellectual property rights of us and others will always be avoided or successfully concluded 
failure to comply with any applicable environmental regulations could result in a range of consequences including fines  suspension of production  alteration of manufacturing process  sales limitations  and criminal and civil liabilities 
existing or future regulations could require us or fasl llc to procure expensive pollution abatement or remediation equipment  to modify product designs or to incur other expenses associated with compliance with environmental regulations 
any failure to control the use of  disposal or storage of  or adequately restrict the discharge of  hazardous substances could subject us to future liabilities and could have a material adverse effect on our business 
future litigation proceedings may materially affect us 
from time to time we are a defendant or plaintiff in various legal actions 
litigation can involve complex factual and legal questions and its outcome is uncertain 

table of contents any claim that is successfully asserted against us may cause us to pay substantial damages 
in addition  future litigation may result in injunctions against future product sales 
even if we were to prevail  any litigation could be costly and time consuming and would divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations  which could have a material adverse effect on us 
our corporate headquarters in california and fasl llc s manufacturing facilities in japan are located in earthquake zones and these operations could be interrupted in the event of an earthquake 
our corporate headquarters are located near major earthquake fault lines in california and fasl llc s wafer fabrication facilities are located near major earthquake fault lines in japan 
in the event of a major earthquake  we and fasl llc could experience business interruptions  destruction of facilities and or loss of life  all of which could materially adversely affect us 
the conversion of our outstanding notes could have a significant negative impact on our earnings per share and the market price of our common stock 
on november   we sold million of our notes in a registered offering 
the notes are convertible at the option of the holder at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the maturity date of december   unless previously redeemed or repurchased  into shares of common stock at a conversion price of per share  subject to adjustment in certain circumstances 
at this conversion price  each  principal amount of the notes will be convertible into approximately shares of our common stock  for an aggregate potential issuance of approximately million additional shares

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate risk 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
in order to reduce this interest rate risk  we usually invest our cash in investments with short maturities 
as of december   substantially all of our investments in our portfolio were short term investments and consisted primarily of bank notes  short term corporate notes  short term money market auction rate preferred stocks and short term federal agency notes 
the majority of our debt obligations are fixed rate and long term 
we continually monitor market conditions and enter into hedges when appropriate 
we do not currently have any hedges of interest rate risk in place 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
default risk 
we mitigate default risk by investing in only the highest credit quality securities and by constantly positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor 
the portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity 
we are averse to principal loss and ensure the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting default risk and market risk 
we use proceeds from debt obligations primarily to support general corporate purposes  including capital expenditures and working capital needs

we use foreign currency forward and option contracts to reduce our exposure to currency fluctuations on our foreign currency exposures in our foreign sales subsidiaries and amd saxony and for foreign currency denominated fixed asset purchase commitments 
the objective of these contracts is to minimize the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our operating results and on the cost of capital asset acquisitions 
our accounting policy for these instruments is based on our designation of such instruments as hedges of underlying exposure to variability in cash flows 
we do not use these contracts for speculative or trading purposes 
we had an aggregate of million notional amount of short term foreign currency forward contracts and purchased call option contracts denominated in japanese yen and european union euro outstanding as of december  unrealized gains and losses related to the foreign currency forward and option contracts for the year ended december  were not material 
we do not anticipate any material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows resulting from the use of these instruments in the future 
however  we cannot give any assurance that these strategies will be effective or that transaction losses can be minimized or forecasted accurately
