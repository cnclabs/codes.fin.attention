overview inforte corp 
is a customer strategy and solutions consultancy that helps clients improve performance by tying together customer and corporate strategy 
inforte combines strong business and operational planning with innovative software solutions to ensure its client base serves the right customers in the right ways to generate the greatest return 
founded in  inforte is headquartered in chicago and has offices in atlanta  dallas  london  los angeles  new york and san francisco 
our revenue is derived almost entirely through the performance of professional services 
the majority of the services we perform is on a time and materials basis  however  we also perform services on a fixed price basis if this structure best fits out clients preferences or the requirements of the project 
typically  the first portion of an engagement involves a strategy project or a discovery phase lasting to days 
this work enables us to determine with our clients the scope of successive phases of work 
these successive phases of work can be additional strategy phases  or phases for technology design and implementation  and generally last three to nine months 
if a project is to be performed on a fixed price basis  the fixed price is based upon estimates from senior personnel in our consulting organization who project the length of the engagement  the number of people required to complete the engagement and the skill level and billing rates of those people 
we then adjust the fixed price based on various qualitative risk factors such as the aggressiveness of the delivery deadline  the technical complexity of the solution and the value of the solution delivered to the client 
we typically ask clients to pay of our fixed price projects in advance to enable us to secure a project team in a timeframe that is responsive to the client s needs 
results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage of net revenue of certain items included in inforte s non gaap supplemental consolidated statement of operations year ended december  revenue before reimbursements net revenue operating expenses before reimbursements project personnel and related expenses sales and marketing recruiting  retention and training management and administrative total operating expenses before reimbursements operating income loss interest income  net and other income before income taxes income tax expense net income reconciliation of net income on a non gaap supplemental basis to gaap net income non gaap supplemental net income subtract non cash  non recurring stock compensation expense gaap basis net loss in inforte incurred a non cash  non recurring stock compensation expense of  for a performance based option  which is recognized as an expense under gaap 
this option was granted in with an exercise price equal to the fair market value at the time of the grant and with vesting based on achieving specified corporate performance criteria 
once vesting is probable the measurement date gaap requires recording of an expense equal to the difference between fair market value on the measurement date and exercise price times the number of shares granted under the option 
with typical time based vesting criteria the measurement date equals the grant date and no expense is recorded normally 
even though the vesting criteria on this performance based option were more difficult to achieve than the criteria on a normal time based option making the option less valuable from the employee s perspective and more advantageous from inforte s perspective gaap results in lower earnings with this performance based option than if the option were time based 
the non gaap supplemental information shows results excluding the non cash  non recurring stock compensation expense described in the previous paragraph 
this non gaap supplemental information is a non gaap financial measure that may not conform to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
we present this non gaap supplemental information to allow for comparability of our results for this period with the results of other periods 
the stock compensation expense from this performance based option did not occur in prior periods and will not occur in future periods 
we believe that comparability of results from different periods is reduced significantly without this non gaap supplemental presentation  considering the magnitude of the stock compensation expense relative to our normal level of operating expenses 
in addition to providing comparability  we believe the non gaap supplemental information corrects for an anomalous situation where gaap earnings are lower with this performance based option than with a time based option even though inforte is economically better off with the performance based option since it has more difficult to achieve vesting criteria 
the stock compensation expense had no impact on income tax expense

net revenue excludes reimbursable expenses that are billed to our clients 
net revenue decreased million or to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  we attribute this decline in net revenue to the slow growth rate of the us economy and the negative impact that economic uncertainty has had on information technology it spending 
these factors have depressed the market for strategic technology services over the last months

our allowance for doubtful accounts was million as of december   compared to million as of december  the revised balances reflect more accurately our exposure to loss from non paying customers  due to an overall reduction in business activity 
the adjustments in both years were not due to any write off of a specific customer account 
project personnel and related expenses represented of net revenue for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  this increase is due to the higher use of subcontractors in in addition to an escalation in the non billable project related expenses 
net revenue per consultant was  in the year ended december   up from  in the year ended december  the slight change in net revenue per consultant versus the prior year is a result of the small increase in our effective hourly rate 
in june inforte offered a six to nine month voluntary leave of absence program and a voluntary resignation program to employees in underutilized areas 
approximately people participated in the programs

sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of compensation  benefits and travel costs for employees in the market development and practice development groups and costs to execute marketing programs

during most management and administrative areas had lower expenses relative to expense reductions related primarily to lower headcount and lower facilities costs 
total management and administrative headcount declined from as of december  to as of december  lease expense in was lower than lease expense in due to a write down to lease expense in of million necessitated by a downward revision in our initial estimate of sublease income due to a reduction in the rental price of office space 
in addition to that  in the third quarter on  we reversed  of previously recognized losses as we succeeded in subletting a portion of the abandoned office space  which had been initially regarded as unsuitable for sublease 
the initial charge in was determined based on future lease obligations less estimated sublease income 
interest income  net and other 
during the year ended december   interest income  net and other decreased million  or to million 
the decrease was due to the reinvestment of matured securities into similar type securities at lower market interest yields 
income tax expense 
income tax expense for the year ended december  was of pre tax income versus income tax expense of of pre tax income in the decrease in the effective income tax rate results primarily from a reduction of income tax expense by  to account for a decline in certain estimates for nondeductible expenses and state and international income tax liabilities  offset in part by a drop in tax exempt interest income as a percentage of pretax book income

project personnel and related expenses represented of net revenue for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  this decrease is due to consulting headcount declining at a faster rate than the rate of net revenue decline 
net revenue per consultant was  in the year ended december   up from  in the year ended december  the increase in net revenue per consultant versus the prior year results from higher consultant utilization as excess consulting capacity was reduced  offset slightly by a small decline in our effective hourly rate

sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of compensation  benefits and travel costs for employees in the market development and practice development groups and costs to execute marketing programs 
sales and marketing and and costs to expenses decreased million or to million for the year ended december  from million in this decrease is due to lower headcount in this area  resulting in lower salary and benefit costs and a decrease in travel expense

management and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation  benefits and travel costs for management  finance  information technology and facilities personnel  together with rent  telecommunications  audit  legal  business insurance  and depreciation and amortization of capitalized computers  purchased software and property 
management and administrative expenses decreased million or to million for the year ended december  from million in for the year ended december   management and administrative expenses increased as a percent of revenue to from in the prior year period  as net revenue declined at a greater rate than management and administrative expenses 
during some management and administrative areas had lower expenses relative to  while other areas had higher expenses 
expense reductions related primarily to lower headcount and lower facilities costs 
total management and administrative headcount declined from as of december  to as of december  and as of december  lease expense in is lower than lease expense in due to a write down of million in for abandoned lease space which we were working to sublet 
the charge was determined based on future lease obligations less estimated sublease income 
during we recorded an additional charge of million to lease expense as our estimate of sublease income has decreased due to a reduction in the rental price of office space 
offsetting the overall reduction in management and administrative salary expense were increased costs for variable executive compensation resulting from improved operating income  severance costs related to senior management terminations and start up costs for new practice areas 
business insurance costs also increased significantly 
interest income  net and other 
during the year ended december   interest income  net and other decreased million  or to million 
the decrease was due to the reinvestment of matured securities into similar type securities at lower market interest yields and also due to the lower average cash balances as a result of inforte s stock buyback program 
income tax expense 
income tax expense for the year ended december  was of pre tax income versus income tax expense of of pre tax income in the unusually high tax rate for results primarily from expenses not deductible for income tax purposes  the most significant of which is the non cash  non recurring stock compensation expense 
excluding the non cash  non recurring stock compensation expense  effective income tax expense was of pre tax income in the decrease of the tax rate in versus  excluding the non cash  non recurring stock compensation expense  reflects the adjustment of certain estimates for non deductible expenses and state and internal tax obligations 
this decrease is partially offset by the tax effect of having less interest income from tax exempt and tax advantaged investments 
the income tax expense was the sum of a operating income times a combined federal and state tax rate and b interest income  net and other times a reduced tax rate of 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents increased from million as of december  to million as of december  short term marketable securities decreased from million as of december  to million as of december  long term marketable securities increased from million as of december  to million as of december  short term and long term marketable securities are available for sale securities consisting of commercial paper  us government or municipal notes and bonds  corporate bonds and corporate auction preferreds 
in total  cash and cash equivalents  short term and long term marketable securities increased from million to million during the year ended december  during  inforte s cash flow from operations was positive million and capital expenditures were million  resulting in million of positive free cash flow cash flow from operations minus capital expenditures 
financing activities resulted in a cash inflow of million from employees participating in stock purchase and stock option plans 
in january  inforte announced that the board of directors approved a stock repurchase program that allows inforte to buy up to million of inforte shares 
the program was completed in august the board of directors approved an additional million stock repurchase program on august  we stated at that time that we had no present plans to make additional repurchases of stock  and as of december   we have made no repurchases under this second program 
on december   inforte had  shares outstanding and million in cash and marketable securities  resulting in of cash and marketable securities per basic share 
as of december   the public float shares not held by executive officers and directors totaled million shares or of total outstanding shares 
inforte believes that its current cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to meet working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the foreseeable future 
all highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased are considered cash equivalents 
cash and cash equivalent balances consist of obligations of us and us banks  high grade municipal and usgovernment agencies bonds and other high quality  short term obligations of us companies 
short term and long term marketable securities are available for sale securities that are recorded at fair market value 
the difference between amortized cost and fair market value  net of tax  is shown as a separate component of stockholders equity 
the cost of securities available for sale is adjusted for amortization of premiums and discounts to maturity 
interest and amortization of premiums and discounts for all securities are included in interest income 
inforte has several operating leases that have contractual cash obligations for future payments 
there are no other contractual obligations that require future cash obligations or other commitments 
the table below identifies all future commitments 
payments due by period total in thousands contractual obligations long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases unconditional purchase obligations other long term obligations total contractual cash obligations critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements  in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and other assumptions  which it believes are reasonable 
if actual amounts are ultimately different from these estimates  the revisions are included in the company s results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known 
accounting policies are considered critical when they require management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made and when different estimates than management reasonably could have used have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition  changes in financial condition or results of operations 
revenue recognition  losses on fixed price contracts  deferred revenue 
we recognize revenue when all of the following four criteria are met persuasive evidence exists that we have an agreement  service has been rendered  our price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we recognize net revenue from fixed price contracts based on the ratio of hours incurred to total estimated hours 
the cumulative impact of any change in estimated hours to complete is reflected in the period in which the changes become known 
we recognize time and materials net revenue as we perform the services 
in november  the financial accounting standards board s emerging issues task force issued topic  income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred stating these costs should be characterized as revenue in the income statement if billed to customers 
for each quarter beginning with the march  quarter  we included reimbursable expenses in revenue and expense and we have reclassified prior periods in the comparative consolidated financial statements as required by the financial accounting standards board 
this reclassification had no effect on current or previously reported net income loss per share 
for presentation purposes  we show two components of total revenue revenue before reimbursements  which we call net revenue  consisting of revenue for performing consulting services  and reimbursements  consisting of reimbursements we receive from clients for out of pocket expenses incurred 
we believe net revenue is a more meaningful representation of our economic activity than total revenue since it excludes pass through  zero margin expense reimbursements 
financial instruments 
short term and long term marketable securities are available for sale securities which are recorded at fair market value 
the difference between amortized cost and fair market value  net of tax effect  is shown as a separate component of stockholders equity 
the cost of securities available for sale is adjusted for amortization of premiums and discounts to maturity 
interest and amortization of premiums and discounts for all securities are included in interest income 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
an allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained for potential credit losses 
the amount of the reserve is established analyzing all client accounts to determine credit risk 
in establishing a client s creditworthiness we consider whether the client has a deteriorating or poor financial condition  limited financial resources  poor or no payment history  a large relative accounts receivable balance or a non us location 
stock compensation 
at december   inforte has three stock based employee compensation plans  which are described more fully in footnote of the consolidated financial statements 
we account for stock based employee compensation in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and have adopted the disclosure only provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas related to options issued to employees 
all options granted under our plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
bonus accruals 
we have several bonus programs that are based on individual and company performance 
revenue bonuses are earned based on individual or roll up revenue credit assigned to salespeople  client executives  other senior delivery personnel and senior management 
margin bonuses are earned by all employees based on company or business unit operating income performance 
in addition  senior management may award discretionary bonuses 
all of these bonuses are expensed in the period in which they are earned 
a corresponding accrual is included on the balance sheet in accrued expenses until the bonus is paid 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas  which requires the recognition of deferred income taxes based upon the tax consequences of temporary differences between financial reporting and income tax reporting by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities 
sfas also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income tax liability for each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current income tax expense and assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of certain income or expense items for income tax reporting and financial reporting purposes 
we also recognize as deferred tax assets the expected future tax benefits of net operating loss carry forwards 
in evaluating the realizability of deferred tax assets associated with net operating loss carry forwards  we consider  among other things  expected future taxable income  the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary reporting differences  and the expected impact of tax planning strategies that may be implemented to prevent the potential loss of future tax benefits 
changes in  among other things  income tax legislation  statutory income tax rates or future taxable income levels could materially impact the our valuation of income tax assets and liabilities and could cause our income tax provision to vary significantly among financial reporting periods 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation number  consolidation of variable interest entities interpretation no 

interpretation no 
clarified the application of accounting research bulletin number  consolidated financial statements to certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
qualifying special purpose entities as defined by fasb statement number  accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities are excluded from the scope of interpretation no 
interpretation no 
applied immediately to all variable interest entities created after january  and was originally effective for fiscal periods beginning after july  for existing variable interest entities 
in october  the fasb postponed the effective date of interpretation no 
to december  in december  a revised version of interpretation revised interpretation no 
was issued by the fasb 
the revisions clarify some requirements  ease some implementation problems  add new scope exceptions  and add applicability judgments 
revised interpretation no 
is required to be adopted by most public companies no later than march  the adoption of revised interpretation no 
will not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in may  the fasb issued statement number  accounting for financial instruments with characteristics of liabilities  equity  or both sfas no 

this limited scope statement establishes standards for how certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity are to be classified and measured 
in november  the fasb issued fasb staff position number  which deferred indefinitely the effective date of sfas no 
as it relates to certain mandatorily redeemable non controlling interests 
sfas no 
was effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  the adoption of sfas no 
will not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
on december   the staff of the securities and exchange commission sec or the staff issued sab  revenue recognition  which amends sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
sab s primary purpose is to rescind accounting guidance contained in sab related to multiple element revenue arrangements  superseded as a result of the issuance of eitf additionally  sab rescinds the sec s revenue recognition in financial statements frequently asked questions and answers the faq issued with sab that had been codified in sec topic  revenue recognition 
selected portions of the faq have been incorporated into sab while the wording of sab has changed to reflect the issuance of eitf  the revenue recognition principles of sab remain largely unchanged by the issuance of sab the adoption of sab did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
subsequent events on march  inforte acquired compendit  inc  a leading provider of sap business intelligence implementation consulting services 
under the terms of the merger agreement  inforte paid million in cash on closing with an additional aggregate cash payment of  in cash within days after closing based on a closing statement calculation of cash less transaction costs 
supplementary cash amounts of up to million may be paid over and based on performance 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk during  our international revenues were over of our total net revenue 
we face additional risks internationally that we do not face domestically 
such risks include longer customer payment cycles  adverse taxes and compliance with local laws and regulations 
further  the effects of fluctuations in currency exchange rates may adversely affect the results of operations 
finally  as the us economic slowdown has spread to the rest of the world  our ability to obtain international revenue going forward could be limited 
interest rate risk as of december  inforte s total short term and long term marketable securities equaled million 
during  interest income represented of inforte s pre tax income 
as a result  fluctuations in interest rates can have a significant impact on our net income loss per share 
we estimate that the impact on interest income from a percentage point change in interest rates could change our annual net income loss per share by approximately per diluted share 
our estimate is calculated using investment balances as of december  and diluted weighted average shares outstanding for the year then ended
