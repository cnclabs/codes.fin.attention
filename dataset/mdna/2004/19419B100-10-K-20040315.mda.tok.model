item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview collagenex pharmaceuticals  inc and subsidiaries is a specialty pharmaceutical company currently focused on providing innovative medical therapies to the dental and dermatology markets 
our first product  periostat r  is an orally administered  prescription pharmaceutical product that was approved by the united states food and drug administration in september and is the first and only dental pharmaceutical to treat adult periodontitis by inhibiting the enzymes that destroy periodontal support tissues 
we are marketing periostat and other pharmaceutical products to the dental and dermatology communities through our own professional pharmaceutical sales force of approximately sales representatives and managers 
pursuant to an exclusive license and marketing agreement with atrix laboratories  inc  we began  in october  to actively market atrix s proprietary dental products  atridox r and atrisorb freeflow r  and atrisorb d r  to the united states dental market 
in may  we executed a sublicense agreement with altana inc to  among other things  market and distribute  in the united states and puerto rico  pandel r  a mid potency topical corticosteroid product developed by altana inc we distribute periostat and pandel exclusively through drug wholesalers in the united states 
periostat is also sold through wholesalers and direct to dentists in the united kingdom through our wholly owned subsidiary  collagenex international ltd  and by distributors and licensees in certain other overseas markets 
the atrix dental products are distributed through specialty distributors who sell these products directly to dental practitioners in the united states and puerto rico 
for the years ended december  and  we achieved net income of approximately million and  respectively 
we have  however  incurred losses in each year from inception through and have an accumulated deficit of million at december  during the years ended december   and  periostat accounted for approximately  and of our total net revenues  respectively 
although we currently derive additional revenue from marketing and or selling other products atridox  atrisorb freeflow  atrisorb d and pandel and from licensing fees from foreign marketing partners  our revenue and profitability in the near future will depend on our ability to successfully market and sell periostat 
mutual has submitted an application to the fda for approval of a generic version of periostat 
we have filed suits to enforce our patent rights and to compel the fda to award patent and exclusivity protections that would prevent a generic drug application from being approved now 
we cannot predict the outcome of these matters 
in addition  we cannot be sure that one or more generic versions of periostat will not be approved and marketed 
if one or more generic versions of periostat are approved and marketed  our revenues from periostat would significantly decrease and  as a result  our business  financial condition  cash flows and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 
this annual report on form k and the documents incorporated herein contain forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities and exchange act of  as amended 
for this purpose  any statements contained herein or incorporated herein that are not statements of historical fact may be forward looking statements 
for example  the words may  will  continue  believes  expects  anticipates  intends  estimates  should and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
there are a number of important factors that could cause our results to differ materially from those indicated by such forward looking statements 
these factors include those set forth in the section entitled additional factors that may affect future results included in item of this annual report 
in particular  our business of selling  marketing and developing pharmaceutical products is subject to a number of significant risks  including risks relating to the implementation of our sales and marketing plans for periostat and other products that we market  risks inherent in research and development activities  risks associated with enforcement of our intellectual property rights  including risks relating to the outcome and consequences of our patent litigation against mutual  risks that the fda will approve products  such as mutual s product  that will compete with and limit the market for periostat  risks relating to our litigation with the fda  risks associated with conducting business in a highly regulated environment and uncertainty relating to clinical trials of products under development 
our success depends to a large degree upon the market acceptance of periostat by periodontists  dental practitioners  other health care providers  patients and insurance companies 
there can be no assurance that our product candidates other than the fda s approval of periostat for marketing in the united states  the united kingdom medicines control agency s approval of periostat for marketing in the united kingdom and periostat s marketing approval in austria  finland  switzerland  ireland  israel  italy  luxembourg  the netherlands  portugal and canada will be approved by any regulatory authority for marketing in any jurisdiction or  if approved  that any such products will be successfully commercialized by us 
in addition  there can be no assurance that we will successfully promote pandel  atridox  atrisorb freeflow or atrisorb d 
as a result of such risks  those risks set forth in the section entitled additional risks that may affect results and others expressed from time to time in our filings with the securities and exchange commission  our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in or implied by the forward looking statements contained herein 
we undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of its financial position and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management believes the critical accounting policies and areas that require the most significant judgments and estimates to be used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements pertain to revenue recognition  stock compensation and deferred taxes 
revenue recognition we recognize product sales revenue upon shipment  net of estimated returns  provided that collection is determined to be probable and no significant obligations remain 
sales revenue from our customers is subject to agreements allowing limited rights of return  rebates and price protection 
accordingly  we reduce revenue recognized for estimated future returns  rebates and price protection at the time the related revenue is recorded 
the estimates for returns are adjusted periodically based upon historical rates of returns  inventory levels in the distribution channel and other related factors 
while management believes it can make reliable estimates for these matters  unsold products in these distribution channels may be exposed to expiration 
accordingly  it is possible that these estimates will change in the future or that the actual amounts could vary materially from our estimates and that the amounts of such changes could impact our results of operations  financial condition and our business 
our contract revenues are fee based arrangements where revenue is earned as prescriptions are filled 
accordingly  since we never take title to the product being promoted  no significant obligations exist beyond the point that revenue is recognized 
since our inception  a portion of our revenue has been generated from license and distribution agreements for our products 
we recognize nonrefundable signing or license fees that are not dependent on future performance under these agreements as revenue when received and over the term of the arrangement if we have continuing performance obligations 
any amounts deferred are amortized to revenue over the expected performance period of each underlying agreement 
the expected performance period is based on management s best estimate and is subject to change based on current market conditions 
deferred revenue represents the portion of up front license payments received that has not been earned 
milestone revenue from licensing arrangements is recognized upon completion of the milestone event or requirement if it represents the achievement of a significant step in the research  development or regulatory process 
stock based compensation it is our policy to apply accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations to account for our stock option grants rather than statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
as such  compensation expense is recorded on fixed stock option grants only if the current market value of the underlying stock exceeds the exercise price of the option at the date of grant and is recognized on a straight line basis over the vesting period 
had we applied sfas no 
 which requires recording stock option grants at their fair value  our net income loss for each of the years ended december   and would have varied from the reported net income loss as we would have recorded additional expenses in each period 
deferred taxes in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
this assessment requires significant judgment and estimates 
the ultimate realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the period in which those temporary differences become deductible 
we consider our history of losses  scheduled reversal of deferred tax assets and liabilities and projected future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax asset items are deductible 
should we continue to be profitable  we will assess and may reduce the valuation allowance 
the tax reform act of contains provisions that may limit the net operating loss nol and research and experimentation credit carryforwards available to be used in any given year upon the occurrence of certain events  including significant changes in ownership interest 
the rules providing for the definition of an ownership change are complex 
recently issued accounting standards fasb statement no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity  was issued in may this statement establishes standards for the classification and measurement of certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
the statement also includes required disclosures for financial instruments within its scope 
for us  the statement was effective for instruments entered into or modified after may  for certain mandatorily redeemable financial instruments  the statement will be effective at a later date 
the effective date has been deferred indefinitely for certain other types of mandatorily redeemable financial instruments 
we currently do not have any financial instruments that are within the scope of this statement 
results of operations we generated net income allocable to common stockholders of million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december  as compared to a net loss of  or per diluted share for the year ended december  the increase in profitability from to was primarily a result of increases in net product sales  contract revenues  and licensing revenues 
product sales increased as a result of the increased volume in periostat product sales as well as increases in pandel product sales  which we began to sell direct in july the increase in contract revenues was primarily attributable to our co promotion efforts related to the avar and denavir product lines  partially offset by the termination of other co promotion agreements 
license revenues increased primarily as the result of milestones achieved by our foreign partners in and the accelerated recognition of previously deferred up front payments that were recognized as the result of terminated license agreements 
these increases were partially offset by increased research and development expenditures as well as increases in cost of products sold and selling  general and administrative expenses 
our revenues are affected by a number of factors  including our ability to influence physician prescribing habits  managing the purchasing practices of the united states drug wholesalers  managing our sales professionals and delivering our marketing message effectively 
we believe future revenues will be affected by our ability to maintain the current business and expand the use of periostat for new indications 
in order to effectively manage the wholesale channel  we executed inventory management agreements with our major wholesalers in these agreements help us manage the level of inventory of our products in the wholesale channel  obtain weekly retail demand information for our products and to make sales that are consistent with end user prescription demand for our products 
in exchange for retail demand data  we allow our wholesalers to purchase a specific amount of inventory from us at the sales price in effect immediately prior to announced price increases 
periostat sales have historically been subject to seasonality in the united states market based on holiday schedules and vacation patterns 
our sales may fluctuate on a quarterly basis based on such seasonal fluctuations
