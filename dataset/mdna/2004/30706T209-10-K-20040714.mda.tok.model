critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a contains a discussion of the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to customer incentives  product returns  bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  income taxes  and contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company s significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to its consolidated financial statements 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect the company s more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts receivables are stated net of allowances for doubtful accounts of approximately million and million at march  and  respectively 
on a regular basis  the company evaluates its receivables and establishes the allowance for doubtful accounts based on a combination of specific customer circumstances and historical write off experience 
credit is extended to customers based upon an evaluation of their financial position 
generally  advance payment is not required 
at march   the company recorded an increase of approximately million reserve to the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable and notes receivable  primarily as a result of its continuing evaluation of the collectibility of its accounts receivable 
recently  as a result of market conditions  the company has witnessed an increase in the filing of bankruptcy by its customers 
see  legal proceedings 
in deciding how to account for these filings  the company  which is an unsecured creditor in the bankruptcy proceedings  monitors the 
table of contents proceedings and evaluates the collectibility of the accounts in light of the bankruptcy through information and advice it receives from counsel and the bankruptcy trustee 
as a result of its continuing experience in this area  in the fourth quarter  the company increased its allowance to approximately of the total amount of the accounts in bankruptcy 
of the approximately million increase in the reserve to the allowance for doubtful accounts recorded in the fourth quarter  the accounts which were in bankruptcy accounted for over million and a reserve that the company established for other customers accounted for approximately  this additional reserve was established as a result of the company s continuing experience with the management of its accounts receivable  including its experience with accounts in bankruptcy and the company s annualized history of losses  which approximates of total accounts receivable 
the company feels its allowance for doubtful accounts at march  is adequately stated in relationship to its accounts receivable 
inventory valuation inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined using the first in  first out basis of accounting 
inventories consist of brand and generic drugs  over the counter products  health and beauty aids  and nutritional supplements for resale 
the inventories of the company s three distribution centers are constantly monitored for out of date or damaged products  which if exist  are reclassed and physically relocated out of saleable inventory to a holding area  referred to as the morgue inventory  for return to and credit from the manufacturer 
it is important that the company continually monitor the morgue inventory to assure that merchandise is returnable to the manufacturer in accordance with the vendors return policy 
improper management of the morgue inventory could result in write downs of the morgue inventory and result in a charge to cost of sales 
in addition  if market acceptance of the company s existing products or the successful introduction of new products should significantly decrease  inventory write downs could be required 
as of march    and  no inventory valuation allowances were necessary  goodwill and intangible assets the company has completed several acquisitions which have generated significant amounts of goodwill and intangible assets and related amortization 
the values assigned to goodwill and intangibles  as well as their related useful lives  are subject to judgment and estimation by the company 
in addition  upon adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
 the company ceased amortization of goodwill effective april  and reviews goodwill annually for impairment 
goodwill and intangibles related to acquisitions are determined based on purchase price allocations 
valuation of intangible assets is generally based on the estimated cash flows related to those assets  while the initial value assigned to goodwill is the residual of the purchase price over the fair value of all identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
thereafter  the value of goodwill cannot be greater than the excess of the fair value of the company s reportable unit over the fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities  and the quoted market prices of the company s common stock  based on the annual impairment test 
downward movement in the company s common stock could have a material effect on the fair value of goodwill in future measurement periods 
useful lives are determined based on the expected future period of benefit of the asset  the assessment of which considers various characteristics of the asset  including historical cash flows 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its fair value  then an indication exists that the company s goodwill may be impaired 
as of march   the company had unamortized goodwill in the amount of  impairment of long lived assets long lived assets are reviewed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that a diminution in value may have occurred  based on a comparison of undiscounted future cash flows to the carrying amount of the long lived asset 
periodically  the company evaluates the recoverability of the net carrying value of its property and equipment  by comparing the carrying values to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows 
a deficiency in these cash flows relative to the carrying amounts is an indication of the need for a write down due to impairment 
the impairment write down would be the difference between the carrying amounts and the fair value of these 
table of contents assets 
losses on impairments are recognized by a charge to earnings 
as of march   management s analysis did not indicate an impairment to the company s long lived assets 
allowance for deferred income tax asset the company had a deferred income tax asset and valuation allowance at march   which primarily represented the potential future tax benefit associated with its operating losses through the fiscal year ended march  in assessing the realizability of deferred income tax assets  management considered whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets would not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred income tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
management evaluated the scheduled reversal of deferred income tax liability  the company s profitability for the year ended march   reviewed the company s business model  and future earnings projections  and believed the evidence indicated that the company will be able to generate sufficient taxable income to utilize the deferred income tax asset 
based upon the evaluations made  management concluded that realization of the deferred income tax asset was more likely than not  therefore  the valuation allowance was reversed in fiscal during the fiscal year ended march   the company recorded a deferred income tax benefit of approximately 
million related to losses reported for the fiscal year  and recorded a valuation allowance of 
million for a portion of deferred tax assets which management concluded that their realization was not more likely than not 
based upon management s analysis and discussion in fiscal  the company reserved the net deferred tax asset at march   as it appears to be more likely than not that the company will not be able to utilize the deferred income tax asset of approximately million 
therefore  the company recorded the million as a charge to income tax expense in the fourth quarter of fiscal revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when goods are shipped and title or risk of loss resides with unaffiliated customers  and at which time the appropriate provisions are recorded for estimated contractual chargeback credits from the manufacturers based on the company s contract with the manufacturer 
rebates and allowances are recorded as a component of cost of sales in the period they are received from the vendor or manufacturer unless such rebates and allowances are reasonably estimable at the end of a reporting period 
the company records chargeback credits due from its vendors in the period when the sale is made to the customer which is eligible for contract pricing from the manufacturer 
detailed accounting  internal auditing and reconciliations are necessary for the company to maintain accurate records for the rebates  allowances and chargebacks 
the company s failure to properly record  audit and submit timely reports to vendors could result in the loss of revenue related to the rebates  allowances and chargebacks 
the company accepts return of product from its customers for product which is saleable  in unopened containers and carries a current date 
generally  product returns are received via the company s own delivery vehicles  thereby eliminating a direct shipping cost from being incurred by the customer or the company 
depending on the length of time the customer has held the product  the company may charge a handling and restocking fee 
failure to process returns correctly could result in the company accepting outdated or damaged merchandise from customers 
the company reviews all requests for return of product to assure that the company accepts returned merchandise in saleable condition 
overall  the percentage of the return of product to the company is extremely low 
the company has no sales incentive or rebate programs with its customers

revenues reported for fiscal decreased approximately million  or as compared to revenues for fiscal revenues for fiscal increased approximately million  or as compared to revenues for fiscal the following schedule summarizes the company s sales in its four product lines over the last three years for the fiscal year ended march  as a of total revenues for the fiscal year ended march  as a of total revenues for the fiscal year ended march  as a of total revenues revenue from branded pharmaceuticals generic pharmaceuticals over the counter and other respiratory products total revenues the net decrease in revenues were the result of several factors as stated previously under the heading business  the company s products function within the structure of the healthcare financing and reimbursement system of the united states 
as a result of a wide variety of political  economic and regulatory influences  this system is currently under intense scrutiny and subject to fundamental changes 
in recent years  the system has changed significantly in an effort to reduce costs 
these changes include 
table of contents increased use of managed care  cuts in medicare  consolidation of pharmaceutical and medical surgical supply distributors  and the development of large  sophisticated purchasing groups 
as a result  the company s profit margins have been negatively impacted  particularly with regard to branded pharmaceuticals 
the company expects that these forces will continue to negatively impact profit margins  including as a result of changes in vendor programs affecting alternate source customers licensed distributors without authorized distributor status with manufacturers  the highly competitive nature of the pharmaceutical wholesale business  drug manufacturers reduction of wholesale buying opportunities  and continuing efforts by drug manufacturers and others to eliminate forward buying by wholesalers 
buying opportunities occur when manufacturers announce that wholesalers with whom they conduct business may purchase inventory at favorable prices if they are willing to purchase more than their usual inventory of product 
forward buying is a speculative purchasing strategy employed in the industry to purchase inventory in advance of expected price increases 
as a result of these forces  the company has implemented a business strategy aimed at increasing its margins while reducing costs by focusing on higher margin products 
in general  the company s branded products experience smaller margins than its generic  over the counter and other products 
the company implemented this strategy by focusing on its core business of servicing independent pharmacies  hospitals and small chain stores  and de emphasizing sales to warehouse customers  which generate high volume revenue  but nominal gross profit 
the company s focus on higher margin products  and corresponding de emphasis on lower margin products  resulted in a decrease of sales of branded pharmaceuticals 
branded drug sales declined by approximately million in fiscal as compared to fiscal  and declined approximately million in fiscal as compared to fiscal the decline in the sale of branded pharmaceuticals was also caused  in part  by changes in vendor programs affecting alternate source customers 
brand name drug manufacturers recently have started to require drug wholesalers to reduce or eliminate forward buying  a strategy pursuant to which wholesalers purchase products in anticipation of expected price increases 
further  brand manufacturers are reducing the number of buy in programs that they are offering 
buy in programs are special opportunities provided by manufacturers to purchase greater than normal quantities at reduced prices 
both of these trends have resulted in further downward pressure on the company s gross margins 
therefore  emphasis on generic sales continues to be part of the company s focus to improve gross profit  loss of business amounting to approximately million due to the complaint filed by qk healthcare  and expensive branded drugs going off patent which were replaced by generic equivalent drugs at substantially lower cost 
in  one of the company s largest customers  qk healthcare  ceased doing business with the company and sued the company in connection with the sale by the company of bottles of allegedly counterfeit lipitor 
this law suit has now been settled and the company expects to resume its business relationship with qk healthcare 
see legal proceedings 
in fiscal  the company increased sales of generic products to of total sales as compared to in the prior year 
sales decreased million in fiscal as compared to fiscal principally due to the loss of customers due to bankruptcy filings and continued downward sales  and price pressure on generic drugs after their entry into the market of multiple generic drug manufacturers 

table of contents during fiscal  over the counter and other sales amounted to approximately million  as compared to approximately million for fiscal  and approximately million in fiscal the decline of the revenues recognized from the over the counter and other products was caused by the company s lesser degree of participation in special buy in programs offered by manufacturers 
manufacturers have  because of current competitive market conditions  reduced the number of special buy in opportunities offered to wholesalers 
as stated above  buy in opportunities are opportunities provided from time to time by manufacturers to purchase greater than normal volumes of product prior to planned price increases by the manufacturers 
further  when these buy in opportunities are offered by manufacturers  often times they require a volume of purchasing that exceeds the company s needs or abilities to acquire 
management believes this trend in reduced buying opportunities will continue in the near future 
in fiscal  the company generated approximately  in revenues from the respiratory vial business as a result of the acquisition of avery pharmaceuticals in may the company subcontracts its productions to a specialty manufacturer 
gross margins expected on the sales of the respiratory vial business are estimated between 
gross profit the company achieved gross profits of million  million and million for the years ended march    and  respectively  representing a decrease of approximately million in fiscal over fiscal  and an increase of approximately 
million in fiscal over fiscal the company s margin  as a percentage of revenue  decreased in fiscal to as compared to for both fiscal and the decrease in gross margin percentage in fiscal over and  was primarily as a result of a the overall decline in total revenue  b the decline in volume of higher profit generic and otc sales  c the loss of buy in opportunities and incentives from manufacturers  thus increasing the cost of purchased goods  as a result of the reduced purchasing levels caused by the loss of the qk healthcare business  and d the loss of primary customer base  which carries a higher gross profit due to credit issues  including bankruptcy filings 
pursuant to the company s focus on higher margin products  sales of generic products as a percentage or total sales have increased  representing approximately  and of the total sales for the fiscal years  and  respectively 
the gross profit earned on sales to the company s core business customers ranges from to  and represented more than of the total gross profit earned by the company for fiscal  and brand name drug manufacturers recently have started to require drug wholesalers to reduce or eliminate forward buying  a strategy pursuant to which wholesalers purchase products in anticipation of expected price increases 
further  brand manufacturers are reducing the number of buy in programs that they are offering 
buy in programs are special opportunities provided by manufacturers to purchase greater than normal quantities at reduced prices 
both of these trends have resulted in further downward pressure on the company s gross margins 
therefore  emphasis on generic sales continues to be part of the company s focus to improve gross profit

in deciding how to account for these filings  the company  which is an unsecured creditor in the bankruptcy proceedings  monitors the proceedings and evaluates the collectibility of the accounts in light of the bankruptcy through information and advice it receives from counsel and the bankruptcy trustee 
as a result of its continuing experience in this area  in the fourth quarter  the company increased its allowance to approximately of the total amount of the accounts in bankruptcy 
of the approximately million reserve to the allowance for doubtful accounts recorded in the fourth quarter  the accounts which were in bankruptcy accounted for over million and an additional reserve for other accounts that the company established accounted for approximately  the additional reserve was established as a result of the company s continuing experience with the management of its accounts receivable  including its experience with accounts in bankruptcy and the company s annualized history of losses  which approximates of total accounts receivable

the company does not anticipate charges to interest expense to increase materially in fiscal as compared to fiscal income taxes the company had an estimated gross deferred income tax asset and valuation allowance of approximately million as of the fiscal year ended march   which primarily represented the potential future tax benefit associated with its operating losses through the fiscal year ended march  management evaluated the scheduled reversal of deferred income tax liability  the company s profitability for the year ended march   reviewed the company s business model  and future earnings projections  and based on such evaluation believed the evidence indicated that the company would be able to generate sufficient taxable income to utilize the deferred income tax asset  therefore  the company recognized the full million deferred income tax asset  offset by deferred income tax expense of

based upon current results and management s analysis and discussion at 
table of contents march   the company reserved the entire deferred income tax asset at march   as it appears to be more likely than not that the company will not be able to utilize the deferred income tax asset of approximately million 
therefore  the company recorded the million as a charge to income tax expense in the fourth quarter of fiscal the company s total valuation allowance at march  is approximately million 
net income loss per share earnings loss per share eps is calculated by dividing the net income loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period

million  which decreased the loss per basic and diluted share by 
during the year ended march   the company reduced its entire valuation allowance  and booked approximately million of deferred income tax benefit  net of the current year deferred income tax expense of approximately 
million  which provided the company with additional net income of 
per basic and 
per diluted share 
over the past decade  participants in the wholesale pharmaceutical distribution industry have experienced declining gross and operating margin percentages 
in addition  brand name drug manufacturers recently have started to require drug wholesalers to reduce or eliminate forward buying  a strategy pursuant to which wholesalers purchase products in anticipation of expected price increases 
further  brand manufacturers are reducing the number of buy in programs that they are offering 
buy in programs are special opportunities provided by manufacturers to purchase greater than normal quantities at reduced prices 
both of these trends may result in further downward pressure on the company s gross margins 
as a result of these pressures  although the company continues to distribute brand products as requested by its customers  beginning in fiscal it began to focus its efforts on higher margin products  including generic and over the counter products 
as part of this strategy  from time to time  the company seeks to acquire additional complementary higher margin product lines  as it did through its acquisition of avery 
in addition  the company anticipated profitable results from its subsidiaries valley south since its acquisition in october  and avery since its acquisition in may  however neither operating unit has been profitable since their respective acquisitions 
in the first quarter  the company began utilizing the patent pending vial machine developed for the use in the respiratory area by avery 
management has combined the operations of valley south and avery for fiscal which will consolidate and eliminate overhead expenses  and believes the business model currently being developed for the combined operations will improve the profitability of the combined business unit in future fiscal periods for the company 
in fiscal  the company generated approximately  in revenues from the respiratory vial business as a result of the acquisition of avery pharmaceuticals in may the company subcontracts its productions to a specialty manufacturer
