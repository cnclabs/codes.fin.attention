item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion below should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes  which are included in this report  and the risk factors information in the business section of this report 
overview we began our domestic operations in as a designer and manufacturer of quiksilver branded boardshorts designed for the sport of surfing 
we grew our business through the late s by expanding our quiksilver products into a full range of sportswear  and we bought our us trademark from the quiksilver brand s australian founders in the distribution of our products was primarily through surf shops 
since the early s  we have diversified and grown our business by increased sales of our quiksilver product line  the creation of new brands such as roxy  the introduction of new products  the development of our retail operations  and acquisitions 
we acquired the quiksilver licensee in europe in to expand geographically  we purchased quiksilver international in to gain global ownership of the quiksilver brand  and we acquired quiksilver asia pacific at the end of to unify our global operating platform and take advantage of available synergies in product development and sourcing  among other things 
we also acquired various other smaller businesses and brands 
brand building has been a key to our growth  and we have always maintained our roots in the boardriding lifestyle 
today our products are sold throughout the world  primarily in surf shops and specialty stores that provide an outstanding retail experience for our customers 
over the last five years  our revenues have grown from million in fiscal to million in fiscal we design  produce and distribute clothing  accessories and related products exclusively in the consumer products industry 
through fiscal  we had two geographic segments  the americas and europe 
we also now have the asia pacific segment as a result of an acquistion in fiscal the americas segment includes revenues from the us  canada and other exports from the us the european segment includes revenues primarily from western europe 
the asia pacific segment includes revenues primarily from australia  new zealand  and japan 
royalties earned from various licenses in other international territories are categorized in corporate operations 
revenues by geographic segment are as follows years ended october  in thousands americas europe asia pacific corporate operations total revenues we operate in markets that are highly competitive  and our ability to evaluate and respond to changing consumer demands and tastes is critical to our success 
shifts in consumer preferences could have a negative effect on companies that misjudge these preferences 
we believe that our historical success is due to the development of an experienced team of designers  artists  sponsored athletes  merchandisers  pattern makers  and cutting and sewing contractors 
it s this team and the heritage and current strength of our brands that has helped us remain in the forefront of design in our markets 
our success in the future will depend on our ability to continue to design products that are acceptable to the marketplace 
there can be no assurance that we can do this 
the consumer products industry is fragmented  and in order to retain and or grow our market share  we must continue to be competitive in the areas of quality  brand image  distribution methods  price  customer service  and intellectual property protection 

table of contents results of operations the table below shows the components in our statements of income as a percentage of revenues years ended october  revenues gross profit selling  general and administrative expense operating income interest expense foreign currency and other expense income before provision for income taxes fiscal compared to fiscal revenues total revenues increased in fiscal primarily as a result of increased unit sales and new products 
revenues in the americas increased  and european revenues increased 
primarily because we acquired the business of our australian and japanese licensees in the first quarter of fiscal  our royalty income decreased to million from million 
instead we now report product sales in this geographic region  which totaled million in fiscal americas revenues in our men s category  which includes the quiksilver young men s  boys  toddlers  wintersports  quiksilveredition  hawk clothing and fidra divisions  increased to million in fiscal from million the year before 
americas revenues in our women s category  which includes the roxy  roxy girl  teenie wahine  raisins  leilani and radio fiji divisions  increased to million from million for those same periods 
wintersports hardgoods are sold primarily under the lib technologies  gnu and bent metal brands and totaled million in fiscal compared to million in the previous year 
men s revenues in the americas increased generally across all divisions 
the women s increase came from both the roxy and raisins divisions 
we believe that our product design and marketing efforts are resulting in increased consumer demand for our products in the americas 
european revenues were approximately of our consolidated total in fiscal in us dollars  revenues in the men s category increased to million in fiscal from million in the previous year 
women s revenues increased to million from million for those same periods 
revenue growth was the largest in france  spain and the united kingdom 
we believe that our product design and marketing efforts are resulting in increased consumer demand for our products in the european market 
for consolidated financial statement reporting  euro results must be translated into us dollar amounts at average exchange rates  but this can distort performance when exchange rates change from year to year 
to understand our european fiscal growth and better assess competitive performance and market share gains  it is important to look at revenues in euros as well  which is our operational currency in europe 
in euros  revenues grew in fiscal this is lower than the growth rate in us dollars because the us dollar was worth fewer euros on average in fiscal compared to fiscal gross profit our consolidated gross profit margin increased basis points in fiscal the gross profit margin in the americas increased to from  while our european gross profit margin increased to from 
the asia pacific gross profit margin was 
the americas improvement occurred primarily due to an increase in our gross profit margin in the first half of fiscal because we lowered inventory levels toward the end of fiscal consequently  our end of season clearance business was down compared to the year before  and our gross margins on those sales were up 
in the second half  the americas gross profit margin was 
our european gross profit margin increased in the second half of fiscal primarily as a result of the weaker us dollar 
because a portion of our european product is 
table of contents purchased with us dollars  product costs in euros decrease as the us dollar decreases in value in comparison to the euro 
additionally  both the americas and european gross profit margins improved because we had a higher percentage of our sales through company owned retail stores 
we earn higher gross margins on sales in company owned stores  but these higher gross margins are offset by store operating costs 
selling  general and administrative expense selling  general and administrative expense increased in fiscal in the americas  it increased to million from million  and in europe it increased to million from million for those same periods 
the asia pacific segment added million of these expenses 
higher personnel costs and other costs related to increased sales volume were the primary reasons for these increases 
as a percentage of revenues  selling general and administrative expense increased to in fiscal from in fiscal selling  general and administrative expense increased as a percentage of revenues primarily due to the incremental operating costs of new company owned retail stores  and to a lesser extent additional marketing expenses 
interest expense and income taxes interest expense decreased in fiscal additional interest on debt incurred to acquire and operate the new asia pacific segment was more than offset by lower interest rates in europe and in the americas 
the company s income tax rate decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal this improvement resulted primarily because a higher percentage of our fiscal profits were generated in countries with lower tax rates 
net income net income in fiscal increased  and earnings per share on a diluted basis increased 
fiscal compared to fiscal revenues total revenues increased in fiscal primarily as a result of increased unit sales and new products 
revenues in the americas increased  and european revenues increased 
royalty income decreased in fiscal from because we acquired our domestic outlet store licensee during the fourth quarter of fiscal year and terminated our domestic watch licensee 
accordingly  royalty income was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal in the americas  our men s revenues increased to million in fiscal from million the year before 
women s revenues increased to million from million for those same periods 
wintersports hardgoods totaled million in fiscal compared to million in the previous year 
revenues in our men s category increased generally across all divisions 
the increase in our women s category was the result of increases in both the roxy and raisins divisions 
we believe that our product design and marketing efforts resulted in increased consumer demand for our products 
european revenues were approximately of our consolidated total in fiscal in us dollars  revenues in our men s category increased to million in fiscal from million in the previous year 
revenues in our women s category increased to million from million for those same periods 
revenue growth was the largest in france  the united kingdom and spain 
we believe that our product design and marketing efforts resulted in increased consumer demand for our products in the european market 
in euros  revenues grew in fiscal this is lower than the growth rate in us dollars because the us dollar was worth fewer euros on average in fiscal compared to fiscal 
table of contents gross profit our consolidated gross profit margin increased basis points in fiscal in the americas  the gross profit margin increased to from  while our european gross profit margin increased to from 
the majority of the improvement in the americas gross profit margin was related to events in the prior year 
we recorded a million write down in the carrying value of our domestic inventory in the fourth quarter of fiscal in the aftermath of september   the market for consumer products  including casual lifestyle apparel  experienced a dramatic falloff in demand and resulted in a substantial amount of customer order cancellations 
this phenomenon created an industry wide glut of excess product available to the traditional off price channel thereby driving the price of certain seasonal product below cost 
accordingly  a reduction in the carrying value of our domestic inventories was required 
we had no such reduction in fiscal the domestic gross profit margin improved in the second half of fiscal because we lowered inventory levels toward the end of the year 
consequently  our end of season clearance business was down compared to the year before  and our gross margins on those sales were up 
this offset lower domestic gross margins on sales of end of season inventories in the first half of the year 
our european gross profit margin increased primarily due to lower production costs 
additionally  both the americas and european gross profit margins improved because we had a higher percentage of our sales through company owned retail stores 
we earn higher gross margins on sales in company owned stores  but these higher gross margins are offset by store operating costs 
selling  general and administrative expense selling  general and administrative expense increased in fiscal in the americas  it increased to million from million  and in europe it increased to million from million for those same periods 
higher personnel costs and other costs related to increased sales volume were the primary reasons for these increases 
as a percentage of revenues  selling general and administrative expense increased to in fiscal from in fiscal selling  general and administrative expense increased as a percentage of revenues primarily due to the incremental operating costs of new company owned retail stores 
interest expense and income taxes interest expense decreased in fiscal this decrease was due primarily to lower average balances and lower interest rates on our debt in the americas 
our income tax rate decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal this improvement resulted primarily because a higher percentage of our fiscal profits were generated in countries with lower tax rates 
our rate also decreased because we adopted sfas no 
during fiscal and discontinued the amortization of certain intangible assets  which was not tax deductible 
net income net income in fiscal increased  and earnings per share on a diluted basis increased 
financial position  capital resources and liquidity we finance our working capital needs and capital investments with operating cash flows and bank revolving lines of credit 
multiple banks in the us  europe and  now  australia and japan  make these lines of credit available 
term loans are used to supplement these lines of credit and are typically used to finance long term assets 
cash and cash equivalents totaled million at october  versus million at october  working capital amounted to million at october   compared to million at october   an increase of 
our strategy is to keep cash balances low and maintain adequate liquidity in our credit facilities to supplement operating cash flows as needed 
we believe that our current cash flows and credit facilities are adequate to cover our cash needs for the foreseeable future 
furthermore  we believe that increases in our credit facilities can be obtained if needed to fund future growth 

table of contents operating cash flows we generated million from operations in fiscal compared to million in fiscal this decrease was primarily caused by the increase in inventories combined with the small decrease in accounts payable  which together used of cash  a million increase in cash used compared to of cash provided the year before 
this more than offset the million increase in cash from higher net income adjusted for noncash expenses 
changes in other working capital components also used of additional cash compared to the year before 
we generated million from operations in fiscal compared to million in fiscal this million improvement resulted from several factors 
the largest factor was the decrease in inventories 
we used million in fiscal as inventories increased and accounts payable decreased 
by contrast  we generated million in fiscal as inventories decreased and trade accounts payable increased  an improvement of million 
cash flows increased by million from higher net income adjusted for noncash expenses  and accounts receivable increased at a slower rate  resulting in an million improvement 
the increases in accrued liabilities and income taxes payable resulted in an additional million of positive cash flows compared to the year before 
capital expenditures we have avoided high levels of capital expenditures for our manufacturing functions by using independent contractors for sewing and other processes such as washing  dyeing and embroidery 
we perform the cutting process in house in the americas to enhance control and efficiency  and we screenprint a portion of our product in house in both the americas and in europe 
fiscal capital expenditures were million  which was approximately million higher than the million we spent in fiscal and the million spent in fiscal in fiscal  we increased our investment in company owned retail stores and in computer systems 
investments in warehouse equipment  computer equipment and fixtures continued in fiscal as in the previous years 
new company owned retail stores are again part of our plans in fiscal computer hardware and software will also be added to continuously improve systems 
capital spending for these and other projects in fiscal is expected to range between million and million  depending on the pace of our retail expansion 
acquisitions effective december   we acquired our licensees in australia and japan to unify our global operating platform and take advantage of available synergies in product development and sourcing  among other things 
this group of companies is referred to as asia pacific and comprises two australian operating companies  ug manufacturing co 
pty ltd 
and qsj holdings pty ltd  one japanese operating company  quiksilver japan kk  and the holding company  quiksilver australia pty ltd 
ug manufacturing co 
pty ltd 
was still owned by the founders of the quiksilver brand and was the original quiksilver operating company that has been producing quiksilver products in australia and surrounding countries and territories for over years 
along with a japanese partner  the founders also started quiksilver japan kk  which has been the quiksilver licensee in japan for approximately years 
the operations of asia pacific have been included in the company s results since december  the initial purchase price  excluding transaction costs  includes cash of million and million shares of our common stock valued at million 
transaction costs totaled million 
the valuation of the common stock issued in connection with the acquisition was based on the quoted market price for days before and after the announcement date 
the initial purchase price was subject to adjustment based on the closing balance sheet  which was finalized in the third quarter of fiscal the sellers are entitled to future payments denominated in australian dollars ranging from zero to million if certain sales and earnings targets are achieved during the three years ending october  the amount of goodwill initially recorded for the transaction would increase if such contingent payments are made 

table of contents the following table summarizes the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition 
in thousands current assets long term assets license agreements goodwill total assets acquired current liabilities net assets acquired license agreements will be amortized over their remaining lives through june goodwill is not subject to amortization and is generally not expected to be deductible for tax purposes 
effective november   we acquired the operations of our european licensee for eyewear and wetsuits  omareef europe  sa the initial purchase price was million  and includes cash of million and assumed debt of million 
this transaction was recorded using the purchase method of accounting and resulted in goodwill of million 
effective february   we acquired our us eyewear licensee  us optics  inc the initial purchase price was million  and includes cash of million and assumed debt of million 
the acquisition has been recorded using the purchase method of accounting and resulted in goodwill of million 
the operating results for each of the acquisitions are included in our consolidated results since their acquisition dates 
assuming each of these acquisitions had occurred as of november   consolidated revenues would have been million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
net income would have been million and million  respectively  for those same years  and diluted earnings per share would have been and  respectively 
effective september   we acquired beach street  inc  a company that operates quiksilver outlet stores 
the acquisition of beach street has increased our control over our brands and distribution and has enabled us to capture some incremental gross margin 
we issued  shares of our common stock valued at million as consideration for the acquisition 
effective july   we acquired quiksilver international  an australian company that owns the worldwide trademark rights to the quiksilver brand name other than in the united states and mexico where those rights were already owned by us 
the initial acquisition payment was million  which included cash consideration of million and transaction costs  net of imputed interest  of million 
under the terms of the purchase agreement  two additional payments were to be made 
one was made at the end of fiscal  and another is to be made at the end of fiscal these additional payments  which are denominated in australian dollars  are contingent on the computed earnings of quiksilver international through june   subject to specified minimums 
the deferred minimum purchase price payments  which were discounted to present value  totaled million at the date of the acquisition and were included as a component of the purchase price recorded at july  the payment made at the end of fiscal was increased by million  with a corresponding increase to trademarks  as a result of quiksilver international s operations for the two years ended june   resulting in a total payment of million 
the obligation related to the remaining deferred purchase price payment is reflected in our consolidated balance sheet as a component of debt 
we believe that we have benefited and will continue to benefit from unified ownership of the quiksilver brand worldwide 
global product decisions can be controlled by us  and the opportunities for coordinated global sourcing and marketing programs are enhanced 

table of contents debt structure a syndication of us banks finances our business in the americas  european banks finance our european business  and australian and japanese banks finance our asia pacific business 
our debt structure includes short term lines of credit and long term loans as follows october  in thousands european short term credit arrangements asia pacific short term lines of credit americas line of credit americas term loan european long term debt asia pacific long term debt deferred purchase price obligation total debt in june  we replaced our syndicated bank facility in the americas with a new syndicated revolving line of credit 
the line of credit expires june and provides for borrowings up to million 
the line of credit bears interest based on the bank s reference rate or based on libor for borrowings committed to be outstanding for days or longer 
however  the interest rate on a portion of the borrowings under the facility is fixed through interest rate swaps  which were valued at a loss of million at october  the weighted average interest rate at october  was 
the line of credit can be accessed by some of our foreign subsidiaries and includes a million sublimit for letters of credit and a million sublimit for borrowings in certain foreign currencies 
the line of credit agreement contains restrictive covenants 
the most significant covenants relate to maintaining certain leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios 
the payment of dividends is restricted  among other things  and our us assets  other than trademarks and other intellectual property  generally have been pledged as collateral 
at october   we were in compliance with such covenants 
in europe  we have arrangements with several banks that provide approximately million for cash borrowings and approximately million for letters of credit 
these lines of credit expire on various dates through april  and we believe that the banks will continue to make these facilities available with substantially similar terms 
the amount outstanding on these lines of credit at october  was million at an average interest rate of 
in asia pacific  we have revolving lines of credit with banks that provide up to approximately million for cash borrowings and letters of credit 
these lines of credit will be reviewed by the banks in january and september  and we believe the banks will continue to make these facilities available with substantially similar terms 
the amount outstanding on these lines of credit at october  was million at an average interest rate of 
these line of credit commitments and agreements in the americas  europe and asia pacific allow for total maximum cash borrowings and letters of credit of million 
commitments totaling million expire in fiscal  while million expire in fiscal we had million of borrowings drawn on these lines of credit as of october   and letters of credit issued at that time totaled million 
we also have a term loan with a single bank in the americas that amounted to million on october  and is repayable in installments of million per month with a final balloon payment due on october  we anticipate that these monthly payments and final balloon payment will be paid from borrowings on our americas line of credit 
this term loan was established in april and is secured by the leasehold improvements at our headquarters in huntington beach  california 
the interest rate structure and restrictive covenants are substantially the same as those under the line of credit 
however  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement  which was valued at a loss of million at october   to fix the interest rate at per year 
this swap agreement is effective through april and is an effective hedge of the related interest rate exposure 

table of contents in europe  we also have million of long term debt with several banks  most of which is collateralized by fixed assets 
this debt bears interest at rates ranging generally from to 
principal and interest payments are required either monthly  quarterly or annually  and the loans are due at various dates through our financing activities provided million of cash in fiscal as debt was increased to fund the capital expenditures and business acquisitions discussed above 
by contrast in fiscal debt was reduced  and our financing activities used million 
in fiscal  million was provided by our financing activities to fund capital expenditures 
contractual obligations and commitments we lease certain land and buildings under non cancelable operating leases 
the leases expire at various dates through  excluding extensions at our option  and contain various provisions for rental adjustments including  in certain cases  adjustments based on increases in the consumer price index 
the leases generally contain renewal provisions for varying periods of time 
we also have long term debt and obligations related to business acquisitions 
additional payments to the sellers  ranging from zero to million  could be required for our acquisition of asia pacific if certain sales and earnings targets are achieved 
our deferred purchase price obligation related to our acquisition of quiksilver international could increase based on the computed earnings of quiksilver international through june our significant contractual obligations and commitments as of october  are summarized in the following table payments due by period two to four to after one three five five in thousands year years years years total operating lease obligations long term debt obligations certain purchase obligations professional athlete sponsorships we establish relationships with professional athletes in order to promote our products and brands 
we have entered into endorsement agreements with professional athletes in sports such as surfing  snowboarding  skateboarding  windsurfing and golf 
many of these contracts provide incentives for magazine exposure and competitive victories while wearing or using our products 
accordingly  the amounts of future payments under the terms of these agreements cannot be predicted with certainty 
such expenses are an ordinary part of our operations and are expensed as incurred 
trade accounts receivable and inventories our trade accounts receivable were million at october  versus million the previous year  an increase of 
of those totals  receivables in the americas increased to million compared to million  and european receivables increased to million from million 
the new asia pacific segment added million at october  accounts receivable grew more slowly than revenues in the americas and europe primarily because of improved collections 
the european accounts receivable increase was only as measured in euros 
our overall average days sales outstanding decreased approximately three days at the end of fiscal compared to the end of fiscal consolidated inventories increased to million at october  from million the year before 
inventories in the americas increased to million from million  and european inventories increased to million from million 
inventories in the new asia pacific division totaled million at october  inventories in the americas increased primarily as a result of the earlier production of current season goods  which increased inventories million  and a million increase in inventories held based on 
table of contents assortment planning for the outlet stores that were acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal in addition  newly opened  company owned retail stores added about million of additional inventory 
inventories in europe increased as a result of several factors 
the stronger euro in relation to the us dollar increased the us dollar value of european inventories by approximately million 
in addition  there was approximately million of current season goods on hand at october   which were produced early compared to the previous year  and we had million of inventory held for our company owned outlet stores which was a new practice in fiscal inflation inflation has been modest during the years covered by this report 
accordingly  inflation has had an insignificant impact on our sales and profits 
new accounting pronouncements effective with our financial statements for the quarterly period ended april   we adopted the disclosure requirements of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas no 
amended sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  sfas no 
amended the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
we apply accounting principles board opinion and related interpretations in accounting for our stock option plans 
no stock based employee compensation expense is reflected in net income  as all options granted under our stock option plans had exercise prices equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the grant dates 
the following table contains the pro forma disclosure requirements years ended october  in thousands actual net income less stock based employee compensation expense determined under the fair value based method pro forma net income actual net income per share pro forma net income per share actual net income per share  assuming dilution pro forma net income per share  assuming dilution in august  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which requires that costs associated with exit or disposal activities be recognized when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
we have adopted this standard and will apply it when  and if  we initiate exit or disposal activities 
in november  the fasb issued fin no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin no 
elaborates on the disclosures to be made by the guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
it also requires that a guarantor recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
the initial recognition and measurement provisions of this interpretation are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  while the provisions of the disclosure requirements began with our financial statements for the three months ended january   the adoption of fin no 
has not had a material impact on our operational results or financial position 

table of contents in january  the fasb issued fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated in certain circumstances by the primary beneficiary even if it lacks a controlling financial interest 
adopting fin will not have a material impact on our operational results or financial position since we do not have any variable interest entities 
joint venture arrangement we have formed a joint venture with glorious sun enterprises  ltd 
to pursue opportunities to develop our quiksilver business in china 
the joint venture is owned by us and owned by glorious sun 
neither partner can independently control the joint venture  and accordingly  the results of its operations are not consolidated in our financial statements 
rather  our pro rata share of the operating profits or losses are reported in our income statements as a component of operating income  and our net investment is included in other assets 
our investment in the joint venture has not been material to date  but additional capital contributions are anticipated as the joint venture ramps up its business and annual business plans are approved by us and glorious sun 
our first boardriders club in mainland china is expected to open in the second quarter of fiscal in the city of shanghai 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
to prepare these financial statements  we must make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities 
these estimates also affect our reported revenues and expenses 
judgments must also be made about the disclosure of contingent liabilities 
actual results could be significantly different from these estimates 
we believe that the following discussion addresses the accounting policies that are necessary to understand and evaluate our reported financial results 
revenue recognition revenues are recognized when the risk of ownership and title passes to our customers 
generally  we extend credit to our customers and do not require collateral 
our payment terms range from net to net  depending on the country or whether we sell directly to retailers in the country or to a distributor 
none of our sales agreements with any of our customers provide for any rights of return 
however  we do approve returns on a case by case basis at our sole discretion to protect our brands and our image 
we provide allowances for estimated returns when revenues are recorded  and related losses have historically been within our expectations 
if returns are higher than our estimates  our earnings would be adversely affected 
accounts receivable it is not uncommon for some of our customers to have financial difficulties from time to time 
this is normal given the wide variety of our account base  which includes small surf shops  medium sized retail chains  and some large department store chains 
throughout the year  we perform credit evaluations of our customers  and we adjust credit limits based on payment history and the customer s current creditworthiness 
we continuously monitor our collections and maintain a reserve for estimated credit losses based on our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that have been identified 
historically  our losses have been consistent with our estimates  but there can be no assurance that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have experienced in the past 
unforeseen  material financial difficulties of our customers could have an adverse impact on our profits 
inventories we value inventories at the cost to purchase and or manufacture the product or the current estimated market value of the inventory  whichever is lower 
we regularly review our inventory quantities on hand  and adjust inventory values for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on estimated forecasts of product demand and market value 
demand for our products could fluctuate significantly  which was evident in the aftermath of september th 
the demand for our products could be negatively affected by many factors  including the following 
table of contents weakening economic conditions  further terrorist acts or threats  unanticipated changes in consumer preferences  reduced customer confidence in the retail market  and unseasonable weather 
some of these factors could also interrupt the production and or importation of our products or otherwise increase the cost of our products 
as a result  our operations and financial performance could be negatively affected 
additionally  our estimates of product demand and or market value could be inaccurate  which could result in an understated or overstated provision required for excess and obsolete inventory 
long lived assets we acquire tangible and intangible assets in the normal course of our business 
we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of these long lived assets including fixed assets  trademarks and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted future cash flows estimated to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset 
impairments  if any  would be recognized in operating earnings 
we continually use judgment when applying these impairment rules to determine the timing of the impairment tests  the undiscounted cash flows used to assess impairments  and the fair value of a potentially impaired asset 
the reasonableness of our judgment could significantly affect the carrying value of our long lived assets 
goodwill we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill at least annually based on a two step impairment test 
the first step compares the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill 
if the carrying amount exceeds fair value  then the second step of the impairment test is performed to measure the amount of any impairment loss 
fair value is computed based on estimated future cash flows discounted at a rate that approximates our cost of capital 
such estimates are subject to change  and we may be required to recognize impairments losses in the future 
income taxes current income tax expense is the amount of income taxes expected to be payable for the current year 
a deferred income tax asset or liability is established for the expected future consequences of temporary differences in the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the value of our deferred tax assets 
if we determine that it is more likely than not that these assets will not be realized  we would reduce the value of these assets to their expected realizable value  thereby decreasing net income 
evaluating the value of these assets is necessarily based on our judgment 
if we subsequently determined that the deferred tax assets  which had been written down would  in our judgment  be realized in the future  the value of the deferred tax assets would be increased  thereby increasing net income in the period when that determination was made 
foreign currency translation a significant portion of our revenues are generated in europe  where we operate with the euro as our functional currency  and a smaller portion of our revenues are generated in asia pacific  where we operate with the australian dollar and japanese yen as our functional currencies 
our european revenues in the united kingdom are denominated in british pounds  and some european and asia pacific product is sourced in us dollars  both of which result in exposure to gains and losses that could occur from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
we also have other foreign currency obligations related to our acquisition of quiksilver international and asia pacific 
our assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange on the balance sheet date 
revenues and expenses are translated using the average exchange rate for the period 
gains and losses from 
table of contents translation of foreign subsidiary financial statements are included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss 
as part of our overall strategy to manage our level of exposure to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  we enter into various foreign exchange contracts generally in the form of forward contracts 
for all contracts that qualify as cash flow hedges  we record the changes in the fair value of the derivatives in other comprehensive income 
we also use other derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting to mitigate our exposure to currency risks 
these derivatives are marked to fair value with corresponding gains or losses recorded in earnings 
forward looking statements certain words in this report like believes  anticipates  expects  estimates and similar expressions are intended to identify  in certain cases  forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of these statements involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from the predicted results 
such factors include  among others  the following general economic and business conditions  the acceptance in the marketplace of new products  the availability of outside contractors at prices favorable to us  the ability to source raw materials at prices favorable to us  currency fluctuations  changes in business strategy or development plans  availability of qualified personnel  changes in political  social and economic conditions and local regulations  particularly in europe and asia and other factors outlined in our previously filed public documents  copies of which may be obtained without cost from us 
given these uncertainties  investors are cautioned not to place too much weight on such statements 
we are not obligated to update these forward looking statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s we are exposed to a variety of risks 
two of these risks are foreign currency fluctuations and changes in interest rates that affect interest expense 
see also note of our financial statements 
foreign currency and derivatives we are exposed to gains and losses resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relating to certain sales  royalty income  and product purchases of our international subsidiaries that are denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies 
we are also exposed to foreign currency gains and losses resulting from domestic transactions that are not denominated in us dollars  and to fluctuations in interest rates related to our variable rate debt 
furthermore  we are exposed to gains and losses resulting from the effect that fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have on the reported results in our consolidated financial statements due to the translation of the operating results and financial position of our international subsidiaries 
we use various foreign currency exchange contracts and intercompany loans as part of our overall strategy to manage the level of exposure to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
in addition  we use interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to the risk of fluctuations in interest rates 
changes in the fair value of the derivatives for all qualifying cash flow hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income 
other derivatives not qualifying for hedge accounting but used to mitigate exposure to currency risks are marked to fair value with corresponding gains or losses recorded in earnings 
as of october   we were hedging forecasted foreign currency transactions expected to occur in the following fourteen months 
assuming exchange rates at october  remain constant  
table of contents we expect million of losses related to hedges of these transactions to be reclassed into earnings over the next fourteen months 
also included in accumulated other comprehensive income at october  is a million net charge related to cash flow hedges of our long term debt  which is denominated in australian dollars and matures through fiscal  and a million net charge from interest rate swaps  which are related to our us dollar denominated long term debt and mature through fisal on the date we enter into a derivative contract  we designate the derivative as a hedge of the identified exposure 
we formally document all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items  as well as the risk management objective and strategy for entering into various hedge transactions 
we identify in this documentation the asset  liability  firm commitment  or forecasted transaction that has been designated as a hedged item and indicate how the hedging instrument is expected to hedge the risks related to the hedged item 
we formally measure effectiveness of our hedging relationships both at the hedge inception and on an ongoing basis in accordance with our risk management policy 
we will discontinue hedge accounting prospectively if we determine that the derivative is no longer effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of a hedged item  when the derivative expires or is sold  terminated or exercised  if it becomes probable that the forecasted transaction being hedged by the derivative will not occur  because a hedged firm commitment no longer meets the definition of a firm commitment  or if we determine that designation of the derivative as a hedge instrument is no longer appropriate 
during the fiscal year ended october   we reclassified into earnings a net loss of million resulting from the expiration  sale  termination or exercise of derivative contracts 
additionally  we recognized a loss of million during the fiscal year ended october  for changes in the value of derivatives that were marked to fair value 
we enter into forward exchange and other derivative contracts with major banks and are exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by these banks 
we anticipate  however  that these banks will be able to fully satisfy their obligations under the contracts 
accordingly  we do not obtain collateral or other security to support the contracts 
translation of results of international subsidiaries as discussed above  we are exposed to financial statement gains and losses as a result of translating the operating results and financial position of our international subsidiaries 
we translate the local currency statements of income of our foreign subsidiaries into us dollars using the average exchange rate during the reporting period 
changes in foreign exchange rates affect our reported profits and distort comparisons from year to year 
we use various foreign currency exchange contracts and intercompany loans to hedge the profit and loss effects of such exposure  but accounting rules do not allow us to hedge the actual translation of sales and expenses 
by way of example  when the us dollar strengthens compared to the euro  there is a negative effect on our reported results for quiksilver europe 
it takes more profits in euros to generate the same amount of profits in stronger us dollars 
the opposite is also true 
that is  when the us dollar weakens there is a positive effect 
in fiscal  the us dollar weakened compared to the euro 
as a result  our european sales increased in euros compared to the year before  but increased in us dollars 
the euro the primary countries where our european subsidiary operates  with the exception of the united kingdom  adopted the euro as legal currency effective january  at that time  exchange rates between the french franc and certain other european currencies were fixed versus the euro 
euro denominated currency began circulating as of january  our european subsidiary began processing transactions in euros as of november  
table of contents interest rates most of our lines of credit and long term debt bear interest based on libor 
interest rates  therefore  can move up or down depending on market conditions 
as discussed above  we have entered into interest rate swap agreements to hedge a portion of our exposure to such fluctuations 
the approximate amount of our remaining variable rate debt was million at october   and the average interest rate at that time was 
if interest rates were to increase by  our net income would be reduced by approximately million based on these fiscal levels
