item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is provided to assist readers in understanding the company s financial performance during the periods presented and significant trends which may impact the future performance of the company 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the company and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this form k 
management overview the company manufactures and markets premium products and services to the oil and gas exploration and production industry  the petrochemical industry and other industrial markets 
the company provides a comprehensive line of technologically advanced products and engineering services  including drilling and completion fluid systems  solids control and separation equipment  waste management services  oilfield production chemicals  three cone and diamond drill bits  turbine products  fishing services  drilling tools  underreamers  casing exit and multilateral systems  packers and liner hangers 
the company also offers supply chain management solutions through an extensive branch network providing pipe  valves and fittings as well as mill  safety and other maintenance products 
management believes the increasing complexity of drilling programs has resulted in a shift in exploration and production spending toward value added  technology based products  which reduce operators overall drilling costs 
the company continues to focus on investing in the development of technology based products that considerably improve the drilling process through increased efficiency and rates of penetration and reduced formation damage 
management believes the overall savings realized by the use of the company s premium products compensate for the higher costs of these products over their non premium counterparts 
the company s operations are largely driven by the level of exploration and production e p spending in major energy producing regions around the world and the depth and complexity of these projects 
although e p spending is significantly influenced by the market price of oil and natural gas  it may also be affected by supply and demand fundamentals  finding and development costs  decline and depletion rates  political actions and uncertainties  environmental concerns  the financial condition of independent e p companies and the overall level of global economic growth and activity 
in addition  approximately percent of the company s consolidated revenues relate to the downstream energy sector  including petrochemical plants and refineries  whose spending is largely impacted by the general condition of the us economy 
capital investment by energy companies is largely divided into two markets which vary greatly in terms of primary business drivers and associated volatility levels 
north american drilling activity is primarily influenced by natural gas fundamentals  with approximately percent of the current rig count focused on natural gas finding and development activities 
conversely  drilling in areas outside of north america is more dependent on crude oil fundamentals  which influence over three quarters of international drilling activity 
historically  business in markets outside of north america has proved to be less volatile as the high cost e p programs in these regions are generally undertaken by major oil companies  consortiums and national oil companies as part of a longer term strategic development plan 
although over half of the company s consolidated revenues were generated in north america during  smith s profitability was largely dependent upon business levels in markets outside of north america 
the distribution segment  which accounts for approximately one quarter of consolidated revenues and primarily supports a north american customer base  serves to distort the geographic revenue mix of the company s oilfield segment operations 
excluding the impact of the distribution operations  percent of the company s revenues were generated in markets outside of north america 
market and industry activity and outlook the average worldwide rig count grew percent above the prior year level  primarily associated with a strong land based north american drilling recovery 
the company anticipates a modest increase in e p spending in  which is somewhat dependent upon commodity prices remaining at or near the average level reported in the incremental spending is expected to be largely concentrated in markets outside north america  as e p companies develop higher reserve projects to address production declines associated with historical underinvestment in their upstream operations 
although there are several factors which could influence forecasted spending  the company s business is highly dependent on the general economic environment in the united states and other major world economies  which ultimately impact energy consumption and the resulting demand for our products and services 
any deterioration in the global economic environment could adversely impact worldwide drilling activity and the future financial results of the company 
forward looking statements this discussion contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of concerning  among other things  the company s outlook  financial projections and business strategies  all of which are subject to risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
these forward looking statements are identified by their use of terms such as believe  anticipate  forecast  expect  estimate  project and similar terms 
the statements are based on certain assumptions and analyses made by the company that it believes are appropriate under the circumstances 
such statements are subject to general economic and business conditions  industry conditions  changes in laws or regulations and other risk factors outlined elsewhere in this form k  many of which are beyond the control of the company 
should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize  or should the assumptions prove incorrect  actual results may vary 
results of operations segment discussion the company markets its products and services throughout the world through four business units which are aggregated into two reportable segments 
the oilfield products and services segment consists of three business units m i swaco  smith technologies and smith services 
the distribution segment includes the wilson business unit 
the revenue discussion below has been summarized by business unit in order to provide additional information in analyzing the company s operations 
for the years ended december  amount percent amount percent amount percent financial data dollars in thousands revenues m i swaco    smith technologies    smith services    oilfield products and services    wilson    total    geographic revenues united states oilfield products and services    distribution    total united states    canada oilfield products and services    distribution    total canada    non north america oilfield products and services    distribution    total non north america    total revenue    operating income oilfield products and services    distribution    general corporate    total    market data average worldwide rig count united states   canada non north america   total    average commodity prices crude oil bbl natural gas mcf source m i swaco 
average west texas intermediate wti spot closing prices 
average weekly composite spot us wellhead prices 
not meaningful oilfield products and services segment revenues m i swaco primarily provides drilling and completion fluid systems  engineering and technical services to the oil and gas industry 
additionally  these operations provide oilfield production chemicals and manufacture and market equipment and services used for solids control  particle separation  pressure control  rig instrumentation and waste management 
m i swaco is significantly influenced by spending in markets outside of north america  which contributes approximately two thirds of the unit s revenues  and by its exposure to the us offshore market  which constitutes approximately percent of the revenue base 
us offshore drilling programs  which account for approximately five percent of the worldwide rig count  are generally more revenue intensive than land based projects due to the complex nature of the related drilling environment 
m i swaco s revenues totaled billion for the year ended december   an increase of percent above the prior year period 
excluding the effect of acquired operations  revenues rose percent above levels impacted by increased sales volumes in markets outside of north america 
on a geographic basis  increased e p spending and new contract awards in latin america  the former soviet union fsu and west africa influenced the higher reported revenues 
the year over year base revenue growth was also impacted by the significant increase in the number of north american land based drilling programs and  to a lesser extent  a favorable customer mix in the us offshore market 
for the year ended december   m i swaco reported revenues of billion  a decline of four percent from revenue levels 
excluding the impact of acquired operations  revenues were ten percent below the prior period and compared to an percent decline in the average worldwide rig count 
the majority of the base revenue decline was attributable to the lower number of land based drilling programs in the western hemisphere markets  primarily the united states  argentina and venezuela 
lower sales of synthetic drilling fluids  related to a percent reduction in the average number of us offshore drilling projects  accounted for the remainder of the year to year variance 
smith technologies designs  manufactures and sells three cone drill bits  diamond drill bits and turbines for use in the oil and gas industry 
due to the nature of its product offerings  revenues for these operations correlate more closely to the rig count than any of the company s other businesses 
smith technologies reported revenues of million for the year ended december   an increase of percent over the prior year 
excluding incremental revenues from businesses acquired in the latter half of  base revenues were approximately percent above the prior year and approximated the increase in the worldwide rig count 
the year to year base revenue growth was generated in north america  reflecting the higher level of land based drilling activity and  to a lesser extent  the impact of new product introductions 
for the year ended december   smith technologies revenues totaled million 
revenues for the smith technologies unit were percent below the prior year and mirrored the decline in worldwide activity levels 
the majority of the revenue variance resulted from lower unit sales of three cone bits  reflecting the percent reduction in us drilling activity 
reduced activity levels in certain latin american markets  specifically colombia  argentina and venezuela  accounted for the remainder of the year to year variance 
smith services manufactures and markets products and services used in the oil and gas industry for drilling  work over  well completion and well re entry 
revenues for smith services are evenly distributed between north america and the international markets and are heavily influenced by the complexity of drilling projects  which drive demand for a wider range of its product offerings 
for the year ended december   smith services reported revenues of million  a two percent increase from the prior year 
the year to year revenue comparison was impacted by a percent reduction in us drill pipe product sales  which are not highly correlated to drilling activity 
excluding the impact of drill pipe sales  revenues increased seven percent above the prior year  primarily attributable to higher e p spending in north america and certain middle east markets 
on a product basis  the majority of the core revenue growth was driven by higher demand for remedial product and service lines  including new product introductions 
for the year ended december   smith services reported revenues of million 
revenues were comparable with amounts reported in  as incremental revenues from acquired operations offset a percent decline in base business volumes 
the base revenue reduction primarily reflects the effect of a percent decline in north american activity levels  which impacted demand for drilling related products and services  including tubulars and inspection services 
operating income operating income for the oilfield products and services segment was million  or percent of revenues  for the year ended december  segment operating margins increased one percentage point above the prior year level reflecting a combination of gross margin expansion and  to a lesser extent  reduced operating expenses as a percentage of revenues 
the gross margins were influenced by a favorable shift in the revenue mix towards higher margin products and  to a lesser extent  improved expense coverage resulting from the impact of increased sales volumes on the segment s manufacturing and service infrastructure 
for the year ended december   oilfield operating income was million  a percent decline from the prior year period 
operating margins for the segment were percent  approximately three percentage points below the prior year s level 
the year to year decrease in segment operating income relates to decreased gross profit  primarily associated with lower sales volumes 
to a lesser extent  decreased demand for higher margin products  specifically drill bits and premium drilling fluids which accounted for over three quarters of the revenue decline  contributed to the gross profit reduction 
segment operating expenses were comparable with the prior year  as the effect of lower employee profit sharing requirements and the elimination of goodwill amortization was offset by incremental expenses associated with acquired operations and higher costs incurred under medical and casualty insurance programs 
distribution segment revenues wilson markets pipe  valves  fittings and mill  safety and other maintenance products to energy and industrial markets  primarily through an extensive network of supply branches in the united states and canada 
the segment has the most significant north american revenue exposure of any of the company s operations with over percent of wilson s revenues generated in those markets 
moreover  approximately one third of wilson s revenues relate to sales to the downstream energy sector  including petrochemical plants and refineries  whose spending is largely influenced by the general state of the us economic environment 
additionally  certain customers in this sector utilize petroleum products as a base material and  accordingly  are adversely impacted by increases in crude oil and natural gas prices 
wilson reported revenues of million for the year ended december   three percent above the prior year 
the year over year revenue increase was reported in the energy sector operations driven by the higher level of north american drilling and completion activity 
lower industrial sales volumes  primarily related to reduced maintenance and repair spending in the refining  petrochemical and power generation customer base impacted the reported revenue variance 
for the year ended december   wilson s revenues totaled million  a percent decline from the prior year period 
over percent of the revenue variance was reported in the energy sector operations related to a combination of lower north american drilling and completion activity and reduced canadian tubular product sales due to increased competition from steel mills 
lower spending for major maintenance programs and projects by customers in the us industrial and petrochemical markets contributed to the remainder of the segment s revenue variance 
operating income operating income for the distribution segment declined million from the level  impacted by a million charge recorded in the fourth quarter of approximately million of this amount was an inventory related charge  while the remainder provided for estimated losses associated with the bankruptcy of a large industrial customer 
excluding this charge  distribution operating results increased million over the amount reported in  equating to incremental operating income of approximately two percent of revenues 
the incrementals were below those historically reported in the segment  impacted by the higher mix of project and export orders  which typically generate lower comparable margins 
for the year ended december   distribution segment operating income declined million from the amounts reported in  equating to decremental operating margins of percent 
the decrementals reflect the significant reduction in gross profit associated with the reported revenue decline  partially offset by lower variable based operating expenses 
other the distribution segment goodwill balance  which approximated million as of december   is subject to an annual impairment test 
this evaluation is largely influenced by future cash flow projections  and  therefore  requires management to make judgments about future operating results and working capital requirements 
as noted above  wilson s financial performance has been impacted by the lower level of business volumes experienced in its downstream and industrial sector 
changes in cash flow assumptions or other factors which negatively impact the estimated fair value of the distribution business would influence the evaluation and might result in the determination that a portion of the goodwill is impaired when the analysis is performed during the first quarter of for the periods indicated  the following table summarizes the results of operations of the company and presents these results as a percentage of total revenues dollars in thousands for the years ended december  amount percent amount percent amount percent revenues    gross profit    operating expenses    operating income    interest expense    interest income    income before income taxes  minority interests and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle    income tax provision    minority interests    income before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
   cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  net of tax and minority interests  net income    versus consolidated revenues were billion for the year ended december   percent above the prior year s level 
the majority of the revenue growth was reported in the company s oilfield operations  impacted by increased worldwide drilling activity and  to a lesser extent  revenues from acquired operations 
excluding incremental revenues from acquired operations  base business revenues grew percent over the prior year as demand for the company s products and services was impacted by increased north american drilling activity as well as customer spending and new contract awards in markets outside the united states and canada 
gross profit was billion  percent above the prior year period 
the increase in gross profit reflects higher sales volumes associated with the increased worldwide activity levels 
gross profit margins for the year were percent of revenues  one percentage point above the gross profit margins reported in the prior year 
the gross margin improvement was primarily impacted by an increased proportion of oilfield segment sales  which traditionally generate higher gross profit margins than the distribution segment 
to a lesser extent  a favorable shift in the product mix towards higher margin products  including drill bits and premium drilling fluids  contributed to the margin expansion 
operating expenses  consisting of selling  general and administrative expenses  increased million from the amount reported in the majority of the year to year increase was attributable to higher variable costs directly associated with the improved business volumes  as well as increased investment in people and infrastructure to support the expanding base business 
to a lesser extent  the operating expense variance was impacted by incremental expenses associated with acquired operations 
as a percentage of revenues  operating expenses were comparable with the prior year 
net interest expense  which represents interest expense less interest income  equaled million in net interest expense was relatively consistent with the prior year amount as average debt levels were comparable between the periods 
the effective tax rate approximated percent  which was above the percent effective rate reported in the prior year  but below the us statutory rate 
the effective tax rate was lower than the us statutory rate due to the impact of m i swaco s us partnership earnings for which the minority partner is directly responsible for its related income taxes 
the company properly consolidates the pre tax income related to the minority partner s share of us partnership earnings but excludes the related tax provision 
the effective tax rate increased one percentage point from the prior year due to a shift in the geographic mix of pre tax income toward higher rate jurisdictions and  to a lesser extent  a lower proportion of m i swaco s us partnership earnings 
minority interests reflect the portion of the results of majority owned operations which are applicable to the minority interest partners 
minority interests totaled million in  a million increase from the prior year 
the increase predominantly reflects the higher profitability of the m i swaco joint venture during the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle included for represents the impact of the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
versus consolidated revenues were billion for the year ended december   percent below the prior year s level 
the majority of the revenue reduction was reported in the company s distribution operations  which are concentrated in north america and were impacted by the significant decline in corresponding activity levels 
the revenue variance was also influenced by the impact of revenues from acquired operations and  to a lesser extent  the contribution of certain oilfield segment operations to an unconsolidated joint venture in the fourth quarter of excluding the net impact of acquired and divested operations  base revenues declined percent from the prior year  as demand for the company s products and services was impacted by a percent reduction in western hemisphere drilling activity 
base revenue growth in the eastern hemisphere markets  attributable to increased activity levels and new contract awards  served to partially offset the overall revenue decline 
gross profit was million  percent below the prior year period 
the decrease in gross profit reflects lower sales volumes associated with the reduction in worldwide activity levels and  to a lesser extent  decreased demand for higher margin oilfield segment products 
gross profit margins for the year were percent of revenues  comparable with the prior year period 
an increased proportion of oilfield segment revenues in  which generate higher gross profit margins than the distribution operations  served to mask the margin deterioration reported in the oilfield segment 
operating expenses  consisting of selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million from the amount reported in the operating expense decline was attributable to cost reduction efforts initiated in response to the decrease in western hemisphere activity levels  lower employee profit sharing requirements and the elimination of goodwill amortization in accordance with sfas no 
incremental expenses from acquired operations and the increased cost of medical and casualty insurance programs served to partially offset the overall expense decline 
as a percentage of revenues  operating expenses increased two percentage points  reflecting lower fixed cost coverage related to the overall sales and administrative functions in both of the company s operating segments 
net interest expense  which represents interest expense less interest income  decreased million from the minimal increase in average debt levels  primarily related to financing acquisitions in the fourth quarter of the prior year  was more than offset by the impact of reduced short term interest rates on the company s variable rate debt 
the effective tax rate approximated percent  which was below both the percent effective rate reported in the prior year and the us statutory rate 
the effective tax rate was lower than the us statutory rate due to the impact of m i swaco s us partnership earnings for which the minority partner is directly responsible for its related income taxes 
the company properly consolidates the pre tax income related to the minority partner s share of us partnership earnings but excludes the related tax provision 
the effective tax rate declined one percentage point from the prior year due to the elimination of goodwill amortization  a portion of which was not tax deductible  and a favorable shift in the geographic mix of pre tax income toward lower rate jurisdictions 
minority interests reflect the portion of the results of majority owned operations which are applicable to the minority interest partners 
minority interests totaled million in  a million reduction from the decrease reflects the lower profitability of the m i swaco joint venture  partially offset by the impact of acquiring a majority interest in united engineering services llc in the fourth quarter of liquidity and capital resources general at december   cash and cash equivalents equaled million 
during  the company s operations generated million of cash flows as compared to the million generated by the company s operations in the prior year 
the significant recovery of worldwide drilling activity has driven higher working capital investment  particularly accounts receivable and inventories  in contrast to the prior year when declining business levels contributed to positive cash flow from working capital accounts 
in  cash flows used in investing activities totaled million  consisting of amounts required to fund acquisitions and  to a lesser extent  capital expenditures 
acquisition funding  which primarily related to the purchase of the oilfield production chemical operations of dynea international  resulted in cash outflows of million in the company also invested million in property  plant and equipment  net of cash proceeds arising from certain asset disposals 
projected net capital expenditures for are expected to approximate million  as higher drilling activity and an expanding business base impact the level of investment in manufacturing and rental tool equipment 
capital spending in is expected to primarily consist of spending for routine additions of property and equipment to support the company s operations and maintenance of the company s capital equipment base 
the combination of excess cash balances held at the beginning of the year and cash flows from operations exceeded cash required to fund investing activities resulting in repayments of million in outstanding indebtedness 
cash flows used in financing activities totaled million for as debt repayments were largely offset by cash proceeds associated with the exercise of employee stock options 
the company s primary internal source of liquidity is cash flow generated from operations 
cash flow generated by operations is primarily influenced by the level of worldwide drilling activity  which affects profitability levels and working capital requirements 
capacity under revolving credit agreements is also available  if necessary  to fund operating or investing activities 
the company has various revolving credit facilities in the united states 
as of december   the company had million of capacity available under these facilities for future operating or investing needs 
the company also has revolving credit facilities in place outside of the united states  which are generally used to finance local operating needs 
at year end  the company had available borrowing capacity of million under the non us borrowing facilities 
the company s external sources of liquidity include debt and equity financing in the public capital markets  if needed 
the company carries an investment grade credit rating with recognized rating agencies  generally providing the company with access to debt markets 
the company s overall borrowing capacity is  in part  dependent on maintaining compliance with financial covenants under the various credit agreements 
as of year end  the company was well within the covenant compliance thresholds under its various loan indentures  as amended  providing the ability to access available borrowing capacity 
management believes funds generated by operations  amounts available under existing credit facilities and external sources of liquidity will be sufficient to finance capital expenditures and working capital needs of the existing operations for the foreseeable future 
management continues to evaluate opportunities to acquire products or businesses complementary to the company s operations 
additional acquisitions  if they arise  may involve the use of cash or  depending upon the size and terms of the acquisition  may require debt or equity financing 
the company has not engaged in off balance sheet financing arrangements through special purpose entities  and the consolidation of the company s minority ownership positions would not result in an increase in reported leverage ratios 
the company has no contractual arrangements in place that could result in the issuance of additional shares of the company s common stock at a future date other than the company s stock option program  which is discussed in note  summary of significant accounting policies  and note  employee stock options 
the company believes that it has sufficient existing manufacturing capacity to meet current demand for its products and services 
additionally  inflation has not had a material effect on the company in recent years and is expected to have a modest impact on the operations in the foreseeable future 
the company has generally been able to offset most of the effects of inflation through productivity gains  cost reductions and price increases 
contractual obligations  commitments and contingencies contractual obligations the following table summarizes the company s debt maturities and future minimum payments under non cancelable operating leases having initial terms in excess of one year as of december  in thousands amount of commitment expiration per period total less than more than year years years years debt maturities      operating lease commitments      total      amounts related to commitments under capital lease agreements  as well as pension and other postretirement obligations  were immaterial for the periods presented 
standby letters of credit and guarantees in the normal course of business with customers  vendors and others  the company is contingently liable for its performance under standby letters of credit and bid  performance and surety bonds 
certain of these outstanding instruments guarantee payment of notes issued to former shareholders of an acquired entity as well as to insurance companies which reinsure certain liability coverages of the company s insurance captive 
excluding the impact of these instruments  for which the million of related liabilities are reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets  the company is contingently liable for approximately million of standby letters of credit and bid  performance and surety bonds at december  management does not expect any material amounts to be drawn on these instruments 
the company has also provided loan guarantees related to certain joint ventures accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
as the net assets and cash flows of these entities are available to satisfy obligations as they become due  management believes the likelihood is remote that the company will be required to perform under these guarantees 
the company s estimated maximum exposure under these loan guarantees approximated million as of december insurance the company maintains insurance coverage for various aspects of its business and operations 
the company has elected to retain a portion of losses that occur through the use of deductibles and retentions under its insurance programs 
amounts in excess of the self insured retention levels are fully insured to limits believed appropriate for the company s operations 
self insurance accruals are based on claims filed and an estimate for claims incurred but not reported 
while management believes that amounts accrued in the accompanying consolidated financial statements are adequate for expected liabilities arising from the company s portion of losses  estimates of these liabilities may change as circumstances develop 
litigation the company is a defendant in various legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business 
in the opinion of management  these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
environmental the company routinely establishes and reviews the adequacy of reserves for estimated future environmental clean up costs for properties currently or previously operated by the company 
in connection with most business acquisitions  the company obtains contractual indemnifications from the seller related to environmental matters 
these indemnifications generally provide for the reimbursement of environmental clean up costs incurred by the company for events occurring or circumstances existing prior to the purchase date  whether the event or circumstance was known or unknown at that time 
a substantial portion of the company s total environmental exposure is associated with its m i swaco operations  which are subject to various indemnifications from former owners 
as of december   the company s environmental reserve approximated million 
this amount reflects the future undiscounted estimated exposure related to identified properties  without regard to indemnifications from former owners 
while actual future environmental costs may differ from estimated liabilities recorded at december   the company does not believe that these differences will have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations  subject to the indemnifications in place 
during the first quarter of  the company initiated legal action against m i swaco s former owners to address issues associated with certain provisions of the environmental indemnification provided 
this matter is expected to go to trial during the fourth quarter of in the event that i m i swaco s former owners and other parties to indemnification agreements with the company do not fulfill their obligations  and ii costs incurred to remediate the identified properties reach estimated maximum exposure limits  the company would be required to establish additional environmental reserves of up to million  impacting earnings and cash flows in future periods 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the company evaluates its estimates on an on going basis  based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following describes significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company extends credit to customers and other parties in the normal course of business 
management regularly reviews outstanding receivables and provides for estimated losses through an allowance for doubtful accounts 
in evaluating the level of established reserves  management makes judgments regarding the parties ability to make required payments  economic events and other factors 
as the financial condition of these parties change  circumstances develop or additional information becomes available  adjustments to the allowance for doubtful accounts may be required 
inventory reserves 
the company has made significant investments in inventory to service its customers around the world 
on a routine basis  the company uses judgments in determining the level of reserves required to state inventory at the lower of cost or market 
management s estimates are primarily influenced by technological innovations  market activity levels and the physical condition of products 
changes in these or other factors may result in adjustments to the carrying value of inventory 
goodwill 
the company has acquired a number of operations during the past decade  which has resulted in the recording of a material amount of goodwill 
under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  the company is required to perform an annual goodwill impairment evaluation  which is largely influenced by future cash flow projections 
estimating future cash flows of the company s operations requires management to make judgments about future operating results and working capital requirements 
although the majority of the goodwill relates to the company s oilfield operations  million of goodwill has been recorded which relates to distribution transactions 
wilson s financial performance has been impacted by the lower level of business volumes experienced in its downstream and industrial sector 
changes in cash flow assumptions or other factors which negatively impact the fair value of the distribution business would influence the evaluation and might result in the determination that a portion of the goodwill is impaired when the analysis is performed during the first quarter of self insurance 
the company maintains insurance coverage for various aspects of its business and operations 
the company retains a portion of losses that occur through the use of deductibles and retentions under self insurance programs 
management regularly reviews estimates of reported and unreported claims and provides for losses through insurance reserves 
as claims develop and additional information becomes available  adjustments to loss reserves may be required 
income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for differences between the book basis and tax basis of the net assets of the company 
in providing for deferred taxes  management considers current tax regulations  estimates of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies 
in certain cases  management has established reserves to reduce deferred tax assets to estimated realizable value 
if tax regulations  operating results or the ability to implement tax planning strategies vary  adjustments to the carrying value of deferred tax assets and liabilities may be required 
environmental obligations 
the company records liabilities for environmental obligations when remedial efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated 
management s estimates are based on currently enacted laws and regulations 
as more information becomes available or environmental laws and regulations change  such liabilities may be required to be adjusted 
additionally  in connection with acquisitions  the company generally obtains indemnifications from the seller related to environmental matters 
if the indemnifying parties do not fulfill their obligations  adjustments of recorded amounts may be required 
recent accounting pronouncements from time to time  new accounting pronouncements are issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb which are adopted by the company as of the specified effective date 
unless otherwise discussed  management believes the impact of recently issued standards  which are not yet effective  will not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements upon adoption 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative market risk disclosures the company is exposed to market risks from changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates and enters into various hedging transactions to mitigate these risks 
the company does not use financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
see note  financial instruments  for additional discussion of hedging instruments 
the company s exposure to interest rate changes is managed through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt and by entering into interest rate contracts  from time to time  on a portion of its long term borrowings 
the company had no interest rate contracts outstanding as of december  and at december   percent of the company s long term debt carried a variable interest rate 
management believes that significant interest rate changes will not have a material near term impact on the company s future earnings or cash flows 
the company s exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates is managed primarily through the use of forward exchange contracts 
these contracts increase or decrease in value as foreign exchange rates change  to protect the value of the underlying transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
all currency contracts are components of the company s hedging program and are entered into for the sole purpose of hedging an existing or anticipated currency exposure 
the gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the value of the related exposures 
the terms of these contracts generally do not exceed two years 
as of december   the notional amounts of fair value hedge contracts and cash flow hedge contracts outstanding were million and million  respectively  and the fair value exceeded the notional amount of these contracts by million 
as of december   the notional amounts of fair value hedge contracts and cash flow hedge contracts outstanding were million and million  respectively  and the fair value exceeded the notional amount of these contracts by million 
in some areas  where hedging is not cost effective  the company addresses foreign currency exposure utilizing working capital management 
the company utilizes a value at risk var model to determine the maximum potential one day loss in the fair value of its foreign exchange sensitive financial instruments 
the var model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a percent confidence level 
the company s var computations are based on the historical price movements in various currencies a historical simulation during the year 
the model includes all of the company s foreign exchange derivative contracts 
anticipated transactions  firm commitments and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies  which certain of these instruments are intended to hedge  were excluded from the model 
the var model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that will be incurred by the company  nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market factors 
the estimated maximum potential one day loss in fair value of currency sensitive instruments  calculated using the var model  was not material to the company s financial position or results of operations
