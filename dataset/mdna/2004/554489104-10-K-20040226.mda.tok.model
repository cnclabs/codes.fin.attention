item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of mack cali realty corporation and the notes thereto collectively  the financial statements 
certain defined terms used herein have the meaning ascribed to them in the financial statements 
critical accounting policies the financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of the financial statements require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
these estimates and assumptions are based on management s historical experience that are believed to be reasonable at the time 
however  because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment 
the company s critical accounting policies are those which require assumptions to be made about matters that are highly uncertain 
different estimates could have a material effect on the company s financial results 
judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of these policies and estimates may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions and circumstances 
rental property rental properties are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization 
costs directly related to the acquisition  development and construction of rental properties are capitalized 
capitalized development and construction costs include pre construction costs essential to the development of the property  development and construction costs  interest  property taxes  insurance  salaries and other project costs incurred during the period of development 
interest capitalized by the company for the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
ordinary repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred  major replacements and betterments  which improve or extend the life of the asset  are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives 
fully depreciated assets are removed from the accounts 
the company considers a construction project as substantially completed and held available for occupancy upon the completion of tenant improvements  but no later than one year from cessation of major construction activity as distinguished from activities such as routine maintenance and cleanup 
if portions of a rental project are substantially completed and occupied by tenants  or held available for occupancy  and other portions have not yet reached that stage  the substantially completed portions are accounted for as a separate project 
the company allocates costs incurred between the portions under construction and the portions substantially completed and held available for occupancy and capitalizes only those costs associated with the portion under construction 
properties are depreciated using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
the estimated useful lives are as follows leasehold interests remaining lease term buildings and improvements to years tenant improvements the shorter of the term of the related lease or useful life furniture  fixtures and equipment to years upon acquisition of rental property  the company estimates the fair value of acquired tangible assets  consisting of land  building and improvements  and identified intangible assets and liabilities generally consisting of the fair value of i above and below market leases  ii in place leases and iii tenant relationships 
the company allocates the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their relative fair values 
in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired  the company considers information obtained about each property as a result of its due diligence and marketing and leasing activities  and utilizes various valuation methods  such as estimated cash flow projections utilizing appropriate discount and capitalization rates  estimates of replacement costs net of depreciation  and available market information 
the fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property considers the value of the property as if it were vacant 
above market and below market lease values for acquired properties are recorded based on the present value using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired of the difference between i the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to each in place lease and ii management s estimate of fair market lease rates for each corresponding in place lease  measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease for above market leases and the initial term plus the term of any below market fixed rate renewal options for below market leases 
the capitalized above market lease values are amortized as a reduction of base rental revenue over the remaining term of the respective leases  and the capitalized below market lease values are amortized as an increase to base rental revenue over the remaining initial terms plus the terms of any below market fixed rate renewal options of the respective leases 
other intangible assets acquired include amounts for in place lease values and tenant relationship values which are based on management s evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant s lease and the company s overall relationship with the respective tenant 
factors to be considered by management in its analysis of in place lease values include an estimate of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease up periods considering current market conditions  and costs to execute similar leases 
in estimating carrying costs  management includes real estate taxes  insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease up periods  depending on local market conditions 
in estimating costs to execute similar leases  management considers leasing commissions  legal and other related expenses 
characteristics considered by management in valuing tenant relationships include the nature and extent of the company s existing business relationships with the tenant  growth prospects for developing new business with the tenant  the tenant s credit quality and expectations of lease renewals 
the value of in place leases are amortized to expense over the remaining initial terms of the respective leases 
the value of tenant relationship intangibles will be amortized to expense over the anticipated life of the relationships 
on a periodic basis  management assesses whether there are any indicators that the value of the company s rental properties may be impaired 
a property s value is impaired only if management s estimate of the aggregate future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges to be generated by the property is less than the carrying value of the property 
to the extent impairment has occurred  the loss shall be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the property over the fair value of the property 
the company s estimates of aggregate future cash flows expected to be generated by each property are based on a number of assumptions that are subject to economic and market uncertainties including  among others  demand for space  competition for tenants  changes in market rental rates  and costs to operate each property 
as these factors are difficult to predict and are subject to future events that may alter management s assumptions  the future cash flows estimated by management in its impairment analyses may not be achieved 
management does not believe that the value of any of the company s rental properties is impaired 
rental property held for sale and discontinued operations when assets are identified by management as held for sale  the company discontinues depreciating the assets and estimates the sales price  net of selling costs  of such assets 
if  in management s opinion  the net sales price of the assets which have been identified as held for sale is less than the net book value of the assets  a valuation allowance is established 
if circumstances arise that previously were considered unlikely and  as a result  the company decides not to sell a property previously classified as held for sale  the property is reclassified as held and used 
a property that is reclassified is measured and recorded individually at the lower of a its carrying amount before the property was classified as held for sale  adjusted for any depreciation amortization expense that would have been recognized had the property been continuously classified as held and used  or b the fair value at the date of the subsequent decision not to sell 
effective january   the company adopted the provisions of fasb no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which supercedes fasb no 
fasb no 
requires that long lived assets that are to be disposed of by sale be measured at the lower of book value or fair value less cost to sell 
fasb no 
retains the requirements of fasb no 
regarding impairment loss recognition and measurement 
in addition  it requires that one accounting model be used for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale and broadens the presentation of discontinued operations to include more disposal transactions 
as the statement requires implementation on a prospective basis  properties which were identified as held for sale by the company as of december  are presented in the accompanying financial statements in a manner consistent with the presentation prior to january  properties identified as held for sale and or sold from january  forward are presented in discontinued operations for all periods presented 
see note to the financial statements 
investments in unconsolidated joint ventures  net the company accounts for its investments in unconsolidated joint ventures under the equity method of accounting as the company exercises significant influence  but does not control these entities 
these investments are recorded initially at cost  as investments in unconsolidated joint ventures  and subsequently adjusted for equity in earnings and cash contributions and distributions 
on a periodic basis  management assesses whether there are any indicators that the value of the company s investments in unconsolidated joint ventures may be impaired 
an investment is impaired only if management s estimate of the value of the investment is less than the carrying value of the investment 
to the extent impairment has occurred  the loss shall be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over the value of the investment 
see note to the financial statements 
deferred leasing costs costs incurred in connection with leases are capitalized and amortized on a straight line basis over the terms of the related leases and included in depreciation and amortization 
unamortized deferred leasing costs are charged to amortization expense upon early termination of the lease 
certain employees of the company provide leasing services to the properties and receive compensation based on space leased 
the portion of such compensation  which is capitalized and amortized  approximated million  million  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
derivative instruments the company measures derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  at fair value and records them as an asset or liability  depending on the company s rights or obligations under the applicable derivative contract 
for derivatives designated as fair value hedges  the changes in the fair value of both the derivative instrument and the hedged item are recorded in earnings 
for derivatives designated as cash flow hedges  the effective portions of the derivative are reported in other comprehensive income oci and are subsequently reclassified into earnings when the hedged item affects earnings 
changes in fair value of derivative instruments not designated as hedging and ineffective portions of hedges are recognized in earnings in the affected period 
see note to the financial statements interest rate contract 
revenue recognition base rental revenue is recognized on a straight line basis over the terms of the respective leases 
unbilled rents receivable represents the amount by which straight line rental revenue exceeds rents currently billed in accordance with the lease agreements 
above market and below market lease values for acquired properties are recorded based on the present value using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired of the difference between i the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to each in place lease and ii management s estimate of fair market lease rates for each corresponding in place lease  measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease for above market leases and the initial term plus the term of any below market fixed rate renewal options for below market leases 
the capitalized above market lease values are amortized as a reduction of base rental revenue over the remaining term of the respective leases  and the capitalized below market lease values are amortized as an increase to base rental revenue over the remaining initial terms plus the terms of any below market fixed rate renewal options of the respective leases 
parking and other revenue includes income from parking spaces leased to tenants  income from tenants for additional services provided by the company  income from tenants for early lease terminations and income from managing and or leasing properties for third parties 
escalations and recoveries are received from tenants for certain costs as provided in the lease agreements 
these costs generally include real estate taxes  utilities  insurance  common area maintenance and other recoverable costs 
see note to the financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts management periodically performs a detailed review of amounts due from tenants to determine if accounts receivable balances are impaired based on factors affecting the collectibility of those balances 
management s estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts requires management to exercise significant judgment about the timing  frequency and severity of collection losses  which affects the allowance and net income

liquidity and capital resources historically  rental revenue has been the principal source of funds to pay operating expenses  debt service  capital expenditures and dividends  excluding non recurring capital expenditures 
to the extent that the company s cash flow from operating activities is insufficient to finance its non recurring capital expenditures such as property acquisitions  development and construction costs and other capital expenditures  the company has and expects to continue to finance such activities through borrowings under its revolving credit facility and other debt and equity financings 
the company believes that with the general downturn in the economy in recent years  and the softening of the company s markets specifically  it is reasonably likely that vacancy rates may continue to increase  effective rental rates on new and renewed leases may continue to decrease and tenant installation costs  including concessions  may continue to increase in most or all of its markets in as a result of the potential negative effects on the company s revenue from the overall reduced demand for office space  the company s cash flow could be insufficient to cover increased tenant installation costs over the short term 
if this situation were to occur  the company expects that it would finance any shortfalls through borrowings under its revolving credit facility and other debt and equity financings 
the company expects to meet its short term liquidity requirements generally through its working capital  net cash provided by operating activities and from its revolving credit facility 
the company frequently examines potential property acquisitions and development projects and  at any given time  one or more of such acquisitions or development projects may be under consideration 
accordingly  the ability to fund property acquisitions and development projects is a major part of the company s financing requirements 
the company expects to meet its financing requirements through funds generated from operating activities  proceeds from property sales  long term and short term borrowings including draws on the company s revolving credit facility and the issuance of additional debt and or equity securities

the agreement provides for the first office or hotel component ventures to be formed no later than four years after the grand opening of the entertainment phase  and requires that all component ventures for the office and hotel phases be formed no later than years from such date  but does not require that any or all components be developed 
however  under the meadowlands venture agreement  mills has the ability to accelerate such formation schedule  subject to certain conditions 
should the company fail to meet the time schedule described above for the formation of the component ventures  the company will forfeit its rights to cause the meadowlands venture to form additional component ventures
