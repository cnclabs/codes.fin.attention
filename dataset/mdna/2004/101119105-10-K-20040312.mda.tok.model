the company also made a commitment to investing in our infrastructure in we significantly increased the resources committed to risk management and regulatory compliance  both in terms of staffing and in systems 
management believes that these increased resources are aligned to support our future growth and the increasing complexity of the financial services industry 
there were several significant economic factors that were relevant to the company s overall performance in in  the company realized of its revenues from private banking net interest income despite continued low interest rates and significant compression in net interest margin 
it has taken awhile to feel the full impact of the decline in interest rates as the yield on certain fixed rate assets and liabilities did not change until they matured or were called or refinanced 
for boston private  net interest margin declined basis points to for the fourth quarter  down from for fourth quarter last year and in the third quarter of while the margin compression is a short term negative to earnings  our continued success in organic business growth should position us well for the future 
management has taken certain actions to position the company s balance sheet for rate improvements by increasing the percentage of variable rate loans and by shortening maturities on certain other assets and extending liabilities 
even with these changes  interest rates on liabilities are expected to reprice more quickly than interest rates on assets 
accordingly  increases in interest rates may reduce net interest income in the short term  even though increasing interest rates should eventually increase net interest income 
see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
for  boston private s net interest income increased to million  compared to million in  on a fully taxable equivalent basis as our balance sheet growth was more than sufficient to offset reduced net interest margins 
management tracks net interest income  net interest margin  deposit growth  loan growth and loan quality as important business metrics in evaluating the condition of its private banking business 
another significant economic factor impacting the company in was the rebound of the equity markets

the effective tax rate for was and the related expense was million 
the rate would have been excluding the retroactive portion of the reit tax increase 
this is higher than the effective tax rate for the increase was due to higher state taxes which were partially offset by increased tax exempt interest income 
due to the business acquisitions that closed in february  and the changes in state tax laws regarding reits  the company anticipates the effective income tax rate  before the retroactive reit state tax charge  will increase 
the return on average assets decreased basis points to for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  the return on average assets would have been if the retroactive portion of the reit tax adjustment and the lease accrual were excluded

average assets increased million  or from billion to billion during but net interest income only increased million  or due to reduced margins 
return on average equity was at december   a decrease of basis points from at december  the return for improves to if the costs of the retroactive portion of the reit tax adjustment and the lease accrual are excluded 
average equity increased during to million 
earnings growth was less than as increased investment management fees were not sufficient to offset the reduced margins and cost increases consistent with our business growth

during this same timeframe  the s p index increased 
the composition of the aum as of december  is shown below 
almost of the aum are equities  therefore any change in the stock market will have a significant impact on the value of the aum and the related management fees since fees are typically a percentage of aum

in  recurring fees were up to million as compared to million in the prior year 
financial planning fees  which comprise of these recurring fees  increased  to million for the full year over million in most of the remaining increase in recurring fees in was due to commercial lending fees 
in the aggregate  recurring fees have increased at a compound annual growth rate of over the past five years 
boston private recorded million in nonrecurring fees in  which consists primarily of million of realized investment gains and million of gains on sales of mortgages 
the ability to underwrite loans for sale was a business driver during and allowed the company to book profitable fee income while helping to mitigate interest rate risk 
if the slow down in refinancing activity that started in the last half of continues  this source of fee income will decrease
