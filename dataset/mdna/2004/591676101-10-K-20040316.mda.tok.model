critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  asset impairment  intangible assets and inventory and accounts receivable 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
see note to our consolidated financial statements  accounting policies  for a summary of each significant accounting policy 
we believe the following critical accounting policies and estimates  among others  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
revenue related to sales of our products and systems is generally recognized when products are shipped or services are rendered  the title and risk of loss has passed to the customer  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we accrue related product return reserves and warranty expenses at the time of sale 
additionally  we record estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs and incentive offerings including special pricing agreements  price protection  promotions and other volume based incentives 
we recognize revenue and profit as work progresses on long term contracts using the percentage of completion method  which relies on estimates of total expected contract revenue and costs 
recognized revenues and profits are subject to revisions as the contract progresses to completion 
revisions in profit estimates are charged to income in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
bad debts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
if economic or political conditions were to change in the countries where we do business  it could have a significant impact on the results of operations  and our ability to realize the full value of our accounts receivables 
furthermore  we are dependent on customers in the retail markets 
economic difficulties experienced in those markets could have a significant impact on our results of operations  and our ability to realize the full value of our accounts receivables 
in establishing the appropriate provisions for customer receivable balances  we make assumptions with respect to their future collectibility 
our assumptions are based on an individual assessment of a customer s credit quality as well as subjective factors and trends  including the aging of receivable balances 
once we consider all of these factors  a determination is made to the probability of default 
an appropriate provision is made  which takes into account the severity of the likely loss on the outstanding receivable balance based on our experience in collecting these amounts 
inventory 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated market value  less disposal costs and reasonable profit margin  based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory writedowns may be required 
goodwill 
goodwill represents the excess of the cost of businesses acquired over the fair value of the related net identifiable assets at the date of acquisition 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we no longer amortize goodwill  but test for impairment of goodwill using a discounted cash flow analysis 
the goodwill impairment test is a two step process  which requires management to make judgments in determining what assumptions to use in the calculation 
the first step of the process consists of estimating the fair value of each reporting unit based on a discounted cash flow model using revenue and profit forecasts and comparing those estimated fair values with the carrying values  which includes the allocated goodwill 
if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value  a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment by determining an implied fair value of goodwill 
the determination of a reporting unit s implied fair value of goodwill requires us to allocate the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit 
any unallocated fair value represents the implied fair value of goodwill  which is compared to its corresponding carrying value 
we completed our annual impairment test as of october  and determined that there was no goodwill impairment to be recognized 
the key assumptions used to determine the fair value of our reporting units included a cash flow periods of years  b terminal values based upon a terminal growth rate of  and c a discount rate of  which was based on the company s weighted average cost of capital adjusted for the risks associated with the operations 
long lived assets 
we assess the impairment of our long lived assets  other than goodwill  including property  plant and equipment  identifiable intangible assets and software development costs whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired asset  changes in historical or projected operating performance and significant negative economic trends 
research and development software development costs 
we expense all research and development costs as incurred 
research and development expenses may fluctuate due to the timing of expenditures for the varying states of research and product development and the availability of capital resources 
we capitalize costs incurred for internally developed product software where economic and technological feasibility has been established and for qualifying purchased product software 
we assess the recoverability of our software development costs against estimated future revenue over the remaining economic life of the software 
impact of recently issued accounting standards 
in april  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections 
in addition to other technical provisions  this statement requires all gains and losses from the extinguishment of debt to be included as an item of income from continuing operations 
we adopted the provisions of this statement on january  and have recorded a gain of million on the extinguishment of the utc subordinated debt in other income expense in the consolidated statement of operations during in june  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
this statement nullifies eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
sfas requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
under eitf issue  certain liabilities were recognized at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan 
adoption of this statement had no material impact on our consolidated financial position  consolidated results of operations or liquidity 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  or fin this interpretation clarifies the application of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements  to certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
fin applies immediately to variable interest entities created after january   and to variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date 
in october  the fasb deferred the effective date for applying the provisions of fin to interests held in vies created before february  to the end of the first interim or annual period ending after december  in addition  the fasb issued an exposure draft of a proposed interpretation of fin in october to address implementation issues 
we do not expect the adoption of fin and related interpretations to have any significant impact on our consolidated financial position  consolidated results of operations or liquidity 
in may  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for certain financial interests with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
this statement requires liability classification for certain types of financial instruments  many of which were previously classified as equity 
the statement was effective on july   however  fasb s adoption of certain provisions has been deferred for an indefinite period 
adoption of this statement had no material impact on our consolidated financial position  consolidated results of operations or liquidity 
executive overview we are experts in optical image capture and processing solutions 
we utilize our expertise to design  manufacture and market sophisticated imaging and scanning solutions serving a variety of point of sale  commercial and industrial applications 
our solutions utilize a broad array of laser  holographic and vision based technologies designed to provide superior functionality and a compelling value proposition for our customers 
in recent years  we have increased sales  cash flow from operations and net income primarily through the introduction of new products and a focus on cost reduction activities to maintain a competitive advantage 
success factors critical to our business include sales growth through continued penetration in existing and new markets  maintaining a highly responsive and cost efficient infrastructure  achieving the financial flexibility to ensure that we can respond to new market opportunities and return value to our shareholders  and selective pursuit of strategic acquisitions 
in order to continue our penetration into new and existing markets our strategy involves expanding our sales channels and expanding our product development activities 
we have recently concentrated our direct sales efforts to further penetrate some of the largest retailers in the united states 
during  we were awarded significant contracts from some major customers in both our pos oem and industrial optical business segments partially attributing to year over year sales growth of approximately 
in addition  we continued to invest in developing new and improved products to meet the changing needs of our existing customers 
a significant portion of our product development was focused on the introduction of pos and industrial products that will allow us to penetrate new markets that we have not previously served 
during  we introduced stratos  a bi optic  high speed supermarket scanner  a new handheld laser scanner featuring bluetooth wireless communications capabilities and a new two dimensional handheld barcode scanner 
in addition  we are currently adapting our advanced vision based technology to satisfy emerging retail applications that require the capture of more than one dimensional bar codes 
we achieved our sales growth without any significant contribution from the new products discussed above 
while these products significantly increase our addressable market  these new products only attributed to approximately of sales 
we believe sales will be positively affected as these new products begin to ship in larger quantities to maintain a highly responsive and cost efficient infrastructure  our focus is to maximize the efficiency of our organization through process improvements and cost containment 
we continually strive to reduce our manufacturing costs through product engineering and design efforts 
during  the benefits of these process improvements were evident through lower direct material costs  royalty costs  and related overhead costs 
also during  we began construction of an addition to our manufacturing facility in suzhou  china that will nearly double the size of the existing china operations and more importantly  will take advantage of cost efficiencies through lower direct labor costs 
closely linked to the success factors discussed above is our continued focus to achieve the financial flexibility 
in october  we completed a follow on public offering of million shares of common stock  prior to a two for one stock split on october   which provided us with net proceeds of million 
we used a portion of those net proceeds to pay down existing indebtedness and purchase our blackwood  nj facilty 
we intend to use the remaining net proceeds to fund working capital requirements in the future for continued growth of our business 
as of december  the company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately million and total debt of only million 
in addition to our internal development and organic growth we may selectively pursue strategic acquisitions that we believe will broaden or complement our current technology base and allow us to serve additional end users and the evolving needs of our existing customers 
in february we purchased the remaining interest in metrologic do brasil that we previously did not own and in august  we entered into an agreement to purchase the remaining of metrologic eria iberica over the next three years 
in addition  our interests in metrologic eria france contains an option for us to purchase the remaining interest 
we expect to purchase the minority interest in forward looking statements contained in this overview are highly dependent upon a variety of important factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from those reflected in such forward looking statements 
for list of the factors that could cause actual results to differ from expectations  refer to the section on forward looking statements included at the beginning of this item on management s discussion and analysis 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain of our consolidated statement of operations data as a percentage of revenues for the periods indicated 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
december  sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses selling  general and administrative expenses research and development expenses severance costs total operating expenses operating income loss other income expenses  net income loss before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net income loss our business is divided into two major segments point of sale original equipment manufacturers  or pos oem  and industrial scanning and optical 
pos oem bar code scanners are typically either handheld scanners or fixed projection scanners 
handheld bar code scanners are principally suited for retail point of sale  document processing  library  healthcare and inventory applications 
fixed projection scanners  which can be mounted on or in a counter  are principally suited for supermarkets  convenience stores  mass merchandisers  health clubs and specialty retailers 
industrial scanning and dimensioning products are comprised of fixed position systems that are either laser or vision based 
these systems range from simple  one scanner solutions to complex  integrated systems incorporating multi scanner  image capture and dimensioning technologies 
adaptive optical solutions are highly customized sophisticated  laser based systems that correct for the natural distortion of light as it exits a complex laser and travels through the atmosphere or other transmission medium 
the following table sets forth certain information regarding our revenues by our two business segments for the periods indicated 
in thousands pos oem    industrial optical industrial    optical    total industrial    total company    most of our product sales in western europe  brazil and asia are billed in foreign currencies and are subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations 
a significant percentage of our products are manufactured in our us facility and  therefore  sales and results of operations are affected by fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies 
manufacture of our point of sale products in our suzhou  china facility accounted for approximately and of point of sale unit sales in and  respectively 
in  sales and gross profit were adversely affected by the continuing rise in the value of the us dollar in relation to foreign currencies 
in and  sales and gross profit were favorably affected by the continuing decline in the value of the us dollar in relation to certain foreign currencies  especially the euro 
the following table sets forth certain information as to our sales by geographical location year ended december  dollars in thousands north america    europe    rest of world    total    we derive revenue from product sales  engineering development  system maintenance and other services 
our cost of sales includes manufacturing costs  labor costs related to service revenues  the costs associated with quality control and the payment of royalties on license agreements 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses primarily consist of salaries  commissions and related expenses for personnel engaged in sales  marketing and sales support functions  costs associated with other marketing activities  salaries and related expenses for executive  finance  accounting  legal and human resources personnel  and professional fees and corporate expenses 
research and development r d expenses primarily consist of salaries and expenses for development and engineering and prototype costs 
we also participate in government and customer funded research programs 
costs of the engineers working on such programs are charged to cost of sales for the time spent on the programs 
when the engineers are not working on these programs  they are available to work on our own internal development projects and their costs are included in research and development expense 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  sales increased to million in from million in the increase was primarily attributable to higher sales of our point of sale pos and original equipment manufacturers oem products 
sales of our pos and oem products increased by  sales of industrial products increased by  while sales of optical systems decreased by 
approximately million of the increase in pos oem sales resulted from the strengthening of the euro against the us dollar in pos oem sales increased approximately million due to increased unit sales of our handheld scanners  of which million was attributed to the introduction of new products in these factors were partially offset by a decrease of approximately million resulting from lower average selling prices due to competitive pricing pressures experienced in the retail sector during  primarily in europe 
the increase in the industrial product sales is primarily due to increased sales attributable to i a contract with a large systems integrator for use in a new automated parcel and package system for the us postal service  and ii a contract with a major airline customer for bar code scanning equipment and installation services to build and install scanning stations and tunnels for use in baggage handling systems 
the decrease in optical system sales reflects the termination of certain optical projects at aoa in these projects included certain government contracts related to programs that were cancelled or downsized by the government as well as purchase orders from a customer involved in the semiconductor manufacturing industry 
revenue from these customers was million in as compared with million in which included a million negotiated settlement for purchase order cancellations from one customer 
these purchase order cancellations were the result of our customer s excess capacity due to an acquisition 
we continue to receive contracts from this customer 
international sales accounted for million or of total sales in and million  or of total sales in the largest portion of the growth in international sales was from increased sales in europe 
no individual customer accounted for or more of revenues in or the increase in european sales can be attributed to increased unit volume along with the strengthening of the euro against the us dollar  offset by lower average selling prices 
cost of sales increased to million in from million in as a percentage of sales  cost of sales was in compared with in the decrease in the percentage of cost of sales in was due to the following o the strengthening of the euro against the us dollar  as discussed above  net of the decreases in average selling prices 
o a decrease in direct labor costs as a percent of sales as a result of increased unit production in our suzhou  china facility and the workforce reductions in o a decrease in direct material costs as a percent of sales resulting from product redesigns lowering our bill of material costs 
o a decrease in royalty costs due to a reduction in the number of products covered by the agreement between symbol technologies and the company 
see note to the consolidated financial statements  commitments and contingencies  located elsewhere in this document 
o more favorable product mix resulting from increased sales of certain more profitable handheld scanners in these factors were partially offset by increased sales of certain lower margin products  including our portable data terminals that are not manufactured by us  but purchased from other sources 
these items generally have margins lower than our own manufactured products 
sg a expenses increased million or  to million in from million in as a percentage of sales  sg a expenses were in as compared with in sg a expenses in included million of expenses incurred prior to the finalization of the amended and restated credit agreement that was executed on july  excluding these expenses  sg a expenses were million in as a percentage of sales  sg a expenses were of sales in compared with excluding the financing related expenses of million in the increase in sg a expenses was due to increased variable selling expenses associated with the higher sales volume in  the strengthening of the euro against the us dollar on euro denominated expenses  increased marketing expenses and an increase in incentive compensation expense during these increases were partially offset by lower personnel costs resulting from workforce reductions in r d expenses remained relatively flat in dollars at million in compared to million in  however  as a percent of sales  r d expenses decreased to of sales from of sales 
the decrease in r d expenses was the result of expanded r d efforts focused on our development of the iq camera based acquisition vision system during severance costs decreased to million in from million in the decrease is attributed to workforce reductions in march  april  august  and september net interest expense decreased by to million in from million in the decrease is due to lower outstanding borrowings and lower interest rates in interest expense in includes million of unamortized original issue discount associated with repayment of the subordinated note to mr

knowles in october interest expense in includes million of additional interest expense that resulted from the incremental basis point default interest rate charged by our bank group from april  to july  other income expense reflects net other income of million in compared to net other expenses of million in the increase in other income was due to i a million gain on the early repayment of subordinated debt related to the acquisition of aoa  ii foreign exchange gains of million in as compared with foreign exchange losses of million in  and iii million of bank charges in incurred in connection with our efforts to refinance our bank debt and restructure our overall debt position that enabled us to realize the gain on early extinguishment of debt 
net income was million in as compared with million in net income reflects a and effective income tax rate in and  respectively 
the decrease in the effective income tax rate can be attributed to the million gain on early extinguishment of debt which  for tax purposes  will be treated as a reduction of the purchase price of aoa  and as such will not be subject to federal or state income tax 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  sales increased to million in from million in the increase was primarily attributable to higher sales of our pos and oem products 
sales of our pos and oem products increased by  sales of industrial products increased by  while sales of optical systems decreased by 
approximately million of the increase in pos oem sales resulted from the strengthening of the euro against the us dollar in pos oem sales increased approximately million due to the introduction of new products in these factors were partially offset by a decrease of approximately million resulting from lower average selling prices

international sales accounted for million or of total sales in and million  or of total sales in sales in north america increased in due primarily to increased sales of pos products to major retail customers 
sales in asia and south america increased by in due primarily to increased demand for our pos products in china 
these increases  however  were partially offset by decreased sales in europe due to lower unit demand resulting from the recession in europe

r d expenses increased to million in from million in  and increased as a percentage of sales to from 
the increase in r d expenses was the result of expanded r d efforts focused on our development of the iq camera based acquisition vision system 
severance costs of million in were due to workforce reductions in march and april and further workforce reductions in august and september as a result of these workforce reductions  our total number of employees decreased by employees  or approximately of the total workforce 
these workforce reductions were part of a company wide effort to increase our future profitability 
the workforce reductions and additional cost reductions represented annualized savings of approximately million in overhead and operating expenses 
net interest expense decreased by from million in to million in the decrease is due to lower outstanding borrowings in interest expense in includes million of additional interest expense that resulted from the incremental basis point default interest rate charged by our bank group from april  to july  other income expense reflects net other expenses of million in compared to net other income of million in the increase in other expenses was due in part to foreign currency transaction losses of million in as compared with transaction gains of million in net income was million in compared with a net loss of million in net income loss reflects a effective income tax rate in and inflation and seasonality inflation and seasonality have not had a material impact on our results of operations 
however  our sales are typically impacted by fluctuation decreases in seasonal demand from european customers in our third quarter 
for quarterly results of operations  see supplementary data following the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources operating activities for the period ended december  net cash provided from operations decreased million  or from million in to million in net cash provided by operating activities in can be attributed primarily from net income of million  increases in inventory  accounts receivable and accrued expenses offset by a decrease in accounts payable 
our working capital increased million to million as of december  from million as of december  as a result of our profitable operations  proceeds from our october follow on public offering  increases in inventory and accounts receivable and the debt restructuring discussed below 
the significant balance sheet changes were as follows o inventory increased million to million as of december  from million as of december  the increase is a result of a buildup in the inventory levels resulting from the longer delivery cycle of finished goods from our suzhou  china facility as we increase our production volume in suzhou 
o accounts receivable  net increased million to million as of december  from million as of december  the increase is primarily attributable to our increased sales volumes especially near the end of the fourth quarter 
our days sales outstanding dso increased slightly to days in from days in o the current portion of lines of credit and notes payable decreased million to million as of december  from million as of december  the decrease is a result of the payment of subordinated promissory notes due to utos and the payment in full of the term loan under our amended credit facility 
o deferred contract revenue decreased million to million as of december  from million as of december  the decrease is a result of the recognition of revenue for work performed on a specific contract that was recognized as deferred contract revenue in o accrued expenses increased million to million as of december  from million as of december  the increase is primarily attributable to accrued compensation and accrued commissions as a result of higher sales volumes and related incentive compensation  which was partially offset by a reduction in accrued corporate taxes and accrued interest 
operating activities for the year ended december  net cash provided by operating activities for resulted primarily from income tax refunds  reductions in inventory  increases in accounts payable and deferred contract revenue plus non cash charges 
our working capital decreased to million as of december  from million as of december  as a result of our profitable operations  reduction in inventory and the debt restructuring discussed below 
the significant balance sheet changes are as follows o restricted cash decreased million to million as of december  from million as of december  the decrease is a result of million used to pay bank debt offset by the establishment of an additional million of restricted cash from loans from certain of our executive officers 
the above transactions were in accordance with the terms of our amended credit agreement dated july  o income tax receivable decreased million to a zero balance as of december  from million as of december  the decrease is a result of the receipt of income tax refunds in o inventory decreased million to million as of december  from million as of december  the decrease is a result of our effort to reduce inventory levels in order to help minimize outstanding debt 
o the current portion of lines of credit and notes payable decreased million to million as of december  from million as of december  the decrease is a result of payments on the line of credit and term loan under our amended credit agreement 
the credit facility and the subsequent amendments and restructuring are more fully described below under outstanding debt and financing arrangements 
o accounts payable increased million to million as of december  from million as of december  the increase is a result of increased business opportunities in the fourth quarter of combined with an increase in accounts payable days 
o deferred revenue increased million as of december  from a zero balance as of december  the increase is a result of the recognition of deferred revenue for a contract in which cash received was in excess of the revenue earned based on percentage completed 
investing activities cash used in investing activities was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in cash used by investing activities is primarily due to an increase in cash used for property  plant and equipment purchases of million primarily related to the purchase of our blackwood  nj facility and initial funding for the expansion of our suzhou  china manufacturing facility 
furthermore  the increase is also attributed to the release of million of cash previously restricted according to the january  amendment the amendment to the amended credit agreement 
the credit facility and the subsequent amendments and restructuring are more fully described below under outstanding debt and financing arrangements 
cash used in investing activities in reflected million used for property  plant and equipment expenditures offset in part by the release of million of restricted cash used to pay bank debt  net of an additional million of cash restricted in accordance with the amendment 
during  we continued making expenditures related to manufacturing automation and capacity expansion 
our current plans for future capital expenditures include i approximately million for investment and expansion of our suzhou  china facility  ii approximately million for continued investment in manufacturing capacity expansion at our blackwood  new jersey headquarters  and iii approximately million for additional manufacturing automation equipment and information technology related equipment 
financing activities cash provided by used in financing activities was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this change is primarily attributed to i proceeds of million from the follow on public offering that closed in october  ii million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options  iii proceeds from the issuance of notes payable  iv partially offset by higher principal payments on notes payable 
cash used in financing activities in reflected million used to pay down our revolving credit facility and term note partially offset by million of proceeds from the issuance of notes payable 
outstanding debt and financing arrangements in connection with the acquisition of aoa on january   we entered into a million credit facility with our primary bank  as agent for other bank parties 
under the terms of the credit facility  we secured a million term loan and a million revolving credit line 
proceeds from the credit facility were applied toward the financing of the acquisition of aoa  paying down our existing term loans and lines of credit and providing us and our subsidiaries with working capital 
we granted a security interest in our assets and properties to our primary bank as agent for the banks as security for borrowings under the credit facility 
on july   we replaced the credit facility by executing an amended and restated credit agreement the amended credit agreement with our lenders 
the amended credit agreement provided for a term loan in the amount of million and a revolving credit facility of million 
on january   we executed an amendment the amendment to the amended and restated credit agreement dated july  the agreement 
the amendment  which extended the agreement until january   provided for a million revolving credit facility and a million term loan 
principal payments on the term loan were  a month commencing in march with the balance due at maturity 
the interest rates under the amendment were prime plus 
on borrowings under the revolving credit facility and prime plus 
on the term loan 
the amendment contained various negative and positive covenants including minimum tangible net worth requirements and fixed charge coverage ratios 
all outstanding borrowings under the agreement were repaid in october and the agreement was terminated 
as a result  unamortized deferred financing costs of  were recognized as a charge to income in the fourth quarter of in connection with the acquisition of aoa  we entered into subordinated promissory notes subordinated debt aggregating million with united technologies optical systems  inc utos  the former parent of aoa 
in january  we and utos entered into a payoff agreement to accelerate the principal payments on the subordinated debt 
in accordance with the payoff agreement  we paid utos million on january  and million on march  as payment in full of our obligation under the subordinated debt 
accordingly  we have recorded a million gain on the extinguishment of the subordinated debt in march in order to provide us with sufficient subordinated financing within the time period required to meet the terms of the payoff agreement which provided a million gain  in january  we issued a million subordinated note to c 
harry knowles  our chairman and chief executive officer  and his spouse  janet h 
knowles  a director and vice president  administration 
the subordinated note bore interest at and required monthly principal payments of  with the balance of million due in january in connection with this note  we issued a common stock purchase warrant  expiring on january   to mr 
and mrs
