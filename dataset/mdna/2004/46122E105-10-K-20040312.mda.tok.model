critical accounting policies revenue recognition revenues are recognized on product detailing contracts as services are performed 
most of the company s vhsm contracts involve two phases  a deployment phase  typically three months  in which the company performs initial recruiting  training and preparation for deployment of the field force at the start of a new contract  and the promotion phase in which the company s deployed field force actively promotes specified products for clients through detailing detailing 
most of the company s contracts specify a separate fee for the initial deployment phase of a project 
the company considers the deployment phase to be a separate and distinct earnings process and recognizes the related revenues throughout the deployment phase  which typically spans a period of two to three months at the beginning of the first year of a contract 
the company recognizes revenue during the promotion phase of its contracts on a straight line basis based on the size of the deployed field force 
many of the product detailing contracts allow for additional periodic incentive fees to be earned by the company once agreed upon performance benchmarks have been attained 
revenue earned from incentive fees is recognized when the company is reasonably assured that payment will be made  and is typically based upon verification through calculation of achievement  third party data or client verification 
many contracts also stipulate penalties if agreed upon performance benchmarks have not been met 
these penalties are recognized upon verification of performance shortfalls 
a number of the company s smaller detailing contracts for products promoted by the company s standing specialty sales teams are revenue sharing based arrangements whereby the company receives a portion of the revenue from products it promotes 
revenue from these contracts is recognized when agreed upon performance benchmarks have been attained and payment is reasonably assured 
the company periodically analyzes its detailing contracts to determine the likelihood and amount of any potential loss on a contract resulting from lower than anticipated product or field force performance 
in the event that current information illustrates a loss is likely to be incurred over the remaining life of the contract  the company accrues that loss at the time it becomes probable 
non refundable conversion fees are earned and recognized as revenue when one of the company s sales professionals accepts a firm offer of permanent employment from a customer during the term of a contract 
reimbursable costs including those relating to travel and out of pocket expenses  sales force bonuses tied to product revenues  and other similar costs  are included in revenues  and an equivalent amount of reimbursable expenses is included in costs of services 
revenues for the company s hpr planning and analytics business generally include fixed fees  which are recognized when monthly services are performed based on percentage of completion and when payment is reasonably assured 
hpr s initial contracts typically range from one month to one year 
revenues for additional services are recognized when the services are provided and payment is reasonably assured 
customers are invoiced according to agreed upon billing terms 
contracts that are invoiced prior to performance of related services are recorded as client advances and unearned revenue and are not recognized as revenues until earned  in accordance with the company s revenue recognition policies 
amounts earned for revenues recognized before the agreed upon billing terms have been met are recorded as revenue and included in unbilled services 
upon billing  these amounts are transferred to billed accounts receivable 
contracts are typically either terminable upon days written notice by client  or non cancelable for a one year term 
most contracts are immediately terminable by the client for default by the company 
normally  if a client terminates a project  the client remains obligated to pay for services performed and reimbursable expenses incurred through the date of termination

cash provided by operations may not be sufficient to fund all internal growth initiatives that we may wish to pursue 
if we pursue significant internal growth initiatives or if we wish to acquire additional businesses in transactions that include cash payments as part of the purchase price  we may pursue additional debt or equity sources to finance such transactions and activities  depending on market conditions

our revenues are dependent on expenditures by companies in the life sciences industries  and a variety of factors could cause the overall levels of those expenditures to decline 
our revenues are highly dependent on promotional  marketing and sales expenditures by companies in the life sciences industries  particularly the pharmaceutical industry 
promotional  marketing and sales expenditures by pharmaceutical manufacturers have in the past been  and could in the future be  negatively impacted by  among other things  governmental reform or private market initiatives intended to reduce the cost of pharmaceutical products or by governmental  medical association or pharmaceutical industry initiatives designed to regulate the manner in which pharmaceutical manufacturers promote their products 
furthermore  the trend in the life sciences industries toward consolidation  by merger or otherwise  may result in a reduction in overall sales and marketing expenditures and  potentially  a reduction in the overall use of contract sales and marketing services providers 
if the demand for outsourced marketing and sales services in the life sciences industries declines our business will be harmed 
our business and growth depend in large part on the demand from the pharmaceutical and life sciences industries for the outsourced marketing and sales services 
companies may elect to perform such services internally based on industry and company specific factors such as the rate of new product development and fda approval of those products  number of sales representatives employed internally in relation to demand for or the need to promote new and existing products  and competition from other suppliers 
the decision by the pharmaceutical or life sciences companies not to use  or to reduce the use of  outsourced marketing and sales services such as those that we provide would have a material adverse effect on our business 
many of the contracts under which we provide marketing and sales services are subject to termination on short notice  which may make our revenues less predictable 
we provide services to many of our most significant clients under contracts that our clients may cancel  typically on to days notice 
in addition  many of these contracts provide our clients with the opportunity to internalize the sales forces sales force conversion under contract  with sufficient notice 
also  although the company has been successful in a number of cases in negotiating longer term commitments and a non cancelable initial period  the company cannot be assured that clients will renew relationships beyond the expiration date of existing contracts 
as a result  we cannot assure you that our most significant clients will continue to do business with us over the long term 
if any of our significant clients elect to cancel  convert or not renew their contracts  it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we may not be successful in managing our infrastructure and resources to support continued growth 
our ability to grow depends to a significant degree on our ability to successfully leverage our existing infrastructure to perform services for our clients  as well as on our ability to develop and successfully implement new marketing methods or channels for new services 
our growth will also depend on a number of other factors  including our ability to maintain the high quality of the services we provide to our customers and to increase our penetration with existing customers  to recruit  motivate and retain qualified personnel  and to economically train existing sales representatives and recruit new sales representatives 
we will also be required to implement operational and financial systems and additional management resources to operate efficiently and effectively regardless of market conditions 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to manage or expand our operations effectiv ely to address current demand and market conditions
