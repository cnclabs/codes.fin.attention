the company realized oil and gas revenues of  in as compared to  in and as compared to  in the increase in revenues in from was due to an increase in prices in gas prices for gas produced from the swan creek field averaged per mcf in as compared to per mcf in oil prices for oil produced from the swan creek field averaged per barrel in as compared to in gas prices for gas produced from the kansas properties averaged per mcf in compared to per mcf in oil prices for oil produced from the kansas properties averaged per barrel in compared to per barrel in the increase in prices was partially offset by a reduction in volumes produced 
the company sold  mcf of natural gas from swan creek and kansas in compared to  mcf in the company also sold  barrels of oil from swan creek and kansas in  compared to  barrels in the reason for the decrease in volumes produced in was the company s dispute with bank one which significantly limited the company s ability to drill new wells and to work over under producing wells in kansas 
the company s subsidiary  tpc  had pipeline transportation revenues of  in  a decrease compared to of  in and  in  resulting from the decrease in volumes of gas produced from the swan creek field 
the company s production costs and taxes have increased each year from to as additional costs have been incurred to maintain the kansas properties and to begin production from the swan creek field in the production costs and taxes increased in to  from  in and from  in this increase was due to the fact that the company s field personnel cost was capitalized as the company was drilling new wells in and  compared to when all employees were working to maintain production and these costs  including field salaries in swan creek in the amount of  were expensed 
the remaining increase is due to increased property taxes on the pipeline because it has been assessed at a higher value after completion

liquidity and capital resources in november  bank one extended to the company a line of credit of up to million 
the initial borrowing base under such credit agreement was million 
in april  the company received a notice from bank one stating that it had redetermined and reduced the borrowing base under the credit agreement to approximately million and requiring a million reduction of the outstanding loan 
the schedule of reserve reports required by the credit agreement upon which such redeterminations were to be based specifically established a procedure involving an automatic monthly principal payment of  commencing february  as of march   the outstanding principal balance under the credit agreement was approximately million 
as a result of bank one s unexpected reduction of the borrowing base and the corresponding demand for payment of million  combined with the fact that the company is still in the early stages of its oil and gas operating history during which time the company has had a history of losses from operations and has an accumulated deficit of  and a working capital deficit of  as of december   the company s independent auditors issued their opinion which emphasized their substantial doubt about the company s ability to continue as a going concern on the company s consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  the company s ability to continue as a going concern depends upon its ability to obtain long term debt or raise capital and satisfy its cash flow requirements 
in may  the company filed suit against bank one in federal court in the eastern district of tennessee  northeastern division at greeneville  tennessee to restrain bank one from taking any steps pursuant to the credit agreement to enforce its demand that the company reduce its loan obligation or else be deemed in default and for actual and punitive damages resulting from the demand 
see item legal proceedings for a discussion of this action 
although the parties may continue to consider settlement of all outstanding issues  no settlement discussions are presently occurring and no settlement has been reached 
the court has adjusted the procedural schedule so that the trial of this action is scheduled to commence on december  in the event settlement is not concluded 
even if the company concludes a settlement with bank one  the company does not anticipate that the company will be able to either increase the borrowing base under the bank one credit agreement or borrow any additional sums from bank one 
to fund additional drilling and to provide additional working capital  the company is required to pursue other options 
although the company intends to apply the net proceeds of its rights offering initially to repay outstanding non bank indebtedness and to apply the balance of such proceeds  if any  to repay bank indebtedness to some extent and or to fund the drilling of additional wells  there can be no assurances that such net proceeds will be sufficient for such purposes or that the company will be able to resolve the difficulties currently preventing it from drilling additional wells and increasing production volumes of natural gas from the swan creek field and to perform work necessary to maintain production from its kansas properties

the company must make substantial capital expenditures for the acquisition  exploration and development of oil and gas reserves 
the company is presently unable to fund the resumption of its drilling program in the swan creek field 
at the present time and until the company is able to increase its production and sales of gas and to resolve its dispute with bank one  the company must obtain the necessary funds to proceed with its drilling program from other sources  such as the rights offering as well as equity investment  bank loan or a joint venture with other companies  as to which there can be no assurances 
in addition to its operational cash requirements and indebtedness to bank one  the company also has a significant amount of loans and other obligations which will either become due or mature on april  and july   including unsecured and convertible notes in the principal amount of approximately  and secured promissory notes due to dolphin offshore partners  lp and jeffrey n

see  item certain relationships and related transactions 
although the company intends to apply the net proceeds from the rights offering initially to repay non bank indebtedness and to apply the balance of such proceeds  if any  to repay in part bank indebtedness and or other working capital purposes  including the drilling of additional wells  there can be no assurances that such net proceeds will be sufficient for such purposes or that the company will be able to resolve the financial difficulties currently preventing it from drilling wells and increasing production volumes of natural gas from the swan creek field 
in addition  the company s revenues or cash flows could be reduced because of a variety of reasons  including lower oil and gas prices or the inoperability of some or all of our existing wells  as to which there can be no assurances 
the company does not know that it will be able to obtain additional funding 
critical accounting policies the company s accounting policies are described in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
the company prepares its consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which requires the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the year 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the company considers the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing the company s financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact the company s results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenues based on actual volumes of oil and gas sold and delivered to its customers 
natural gas meters are placed at the customers location and usage is billed each month 
crude oil is stored and at the time of delivery to the customers  revenues are recognized 
full cost method of accounting the company follows the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas property acquisition  exploration and development activities 
under this method  all productive and non productive costs incurred in connection with the acquisition of  exploration for and development of oil and gas reserves for each cost center are capitalized 
capitalized costs include lease acquisitions  geological and geophysical work  daily rentals and the costs of drilling  completing and equipping oil and gas wells 
the company capitalized   and  of these costs in  and  respectively 
costs  however  associated with production and general corporate activities are expensed in the period incurred 
interest costs related to unproved properties and properties under development are also capitalized to oil and gas properties 
gains or losses are recognized only upon sales or dispositions of significant amounts of oil and gas reserves representing an entire cost center 
proceeds from all other sales or dispositions are treated as reductions to capitalized costs 
the capitalized oil and gas property  less accumulated depreciation  depletion and amortization and related deferred income taxes  if any  are generally limited to an amount the ceiling limitation equal to the sum of a the present value of estimated future net revenues computed by applying current prices in effect as of the balance sheet date with consideration of price changes only to the extent provided by contractual arrangements to estimated future production of proved oil and gas reserves  less estimated future expenditures based on current costs to be incurred in developing and producing the reserves using a discount factor of and assuming continuation of existing economic conditions  and b the cost of investments in unevaluated properties excluded from the costs being amortized 
no ceiling write downs were recorded in  or oil and gas reserves depletion depreciation and amortization of oil and gas properties the capitalized costs of oil and gas properties  plus estimated future development costs relating to proved reserves and estimated costs of plugging and abandonment  net of estimated salvage value  are amortized on the unit of production method based on total proved reserves 
the costs of unproved properties are excluded from amortization until the properties are evaluated  subject to an annual assessment of whether impairment has occurred 
the company s proved oil and gas reserves as at december  were estimated by ryder scott  lp  petroleum consultants 
projecting the effects of commodity prices on production  and timing of development expenditures include many factors beyond the company s control 
the future estimates of net cash flows from the company s proved reserves and their present value are based upon various assumptions about future production levels  prices  and costs that may prove to be incorrect over time 
any significant variance from assumptions could result in the actual future net cash flows being materially different from the estimates 
asset retirement obligations the company is required to record the effects of contractual or other legal obligations on well abandonments for capping and plugging wells 
management periodically reviews the estimate of the timing of the wells closure as well as the estimated closing costs  discounted at the credit adjusted risk free rate of 
quarterly  management accretes the discount into the liability and makes other adjustments to the liability for well retirements incurred during the period 
contingencies the company accounts for contingencies in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting contingencies which requires that the company record an estimated loss from a loss contingency when information available prior to the issuance of the company s financial statements indicate that it is probable an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
accounting for contingencies such as environmental  legal and income tax matters requires management of the company to use its judgment 
while management of the company believes that the company s accrual for these matters are adequate  if the actual loss from a loss contingency is significantly different from the estimated loss  the company s results of operations may be over or understated 
the primary area in which the company has to estimate contingent liabilities is with respect to legal actions brought against the company 
recent accounting pronouncements a reporting issue has arisen regarding the application on certain provisions of statement of financial accounting standard no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas to companies in the extracting industries including oil and gas companies 
the issue is whether sfas requires the registrants to classify the cost of mineral rights held under lease or other contractual arrangements associated with extracting oil and gas as intangible assets in the balance sheet  apart from other capitalized oil and gas properties owned and provide specific footnote disclosures 
historically  the company had included the cost of such mineral rights associated with extracting oil and gas as a component of oil and gas properties 
if it is ultimately determined that sfas requires oil and gas companies to classify cost of mineral rights held under lease or other contractual arrangement associated with extracting oil and gas as a separate intangible asset line item on the balance sheet  the company would be required to reclassify approximately  at december  and  at december   out of oil and gas properties and into a separate intangible asset line item 
the company s consolidated statements of net loss and cash flows would not be affected since such intangible assets would continue to be depleted and amortized for impairment in accordance with full cost accounting rules 
further  the company does not believe the classification of the cost of mineral rights associated with extracting oil and gas as intangible assets would have any impact on compliance with covenants under its debt agreement 
in  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard no  accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas 
sfas addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
this statement requires companies to record the present value of obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets in the period in which it is incurred 
the liability is capitalized as part of the related long lived asset s carrying amount 
over time  accretion of the liability is recognized as an operating expense and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the expected useful life of the related asset 
the company s asset retirement obligations relate primarily to the plugging dismantlement  removal  site reclamation and similar activities of its oil and gas properties 
prior to adoption of this statement  such obligations were accrued ratably over the productive lives of the assets through its depreciation  depletion and amortization for oil and gas properties without recording a separate liability for such amounts 
the company has adopted sfas beginning on january   recording a cumulative loss as a result of the adoption of this statement of approximately

the company owns no interests in variable interest entities  and therefore this new interpretation has not affected company s consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard no

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk s commodity risk the company s major market risk exposure is in the pricing applicable to its oil and gas production 
realized pricing is primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and spot prices applicable to natural gas production 
historically  prices received for oil and gas production have been volatile and unpredictable and price volatility is expected to continue 
monthly oil price realizations ranged from a low of per barrel to a high of per barrel during gas price realizations ranged from a monthly low of per mcf to a monthly high of per mcf during the same period 
the company did not enter into any hedging agreements in to limit exposure to oil and gas price fluctuations 
interest rate risk at december   the company had debt outstanding of approximately million including  as of that date  million owed on its revolving credit facility with bank one 
the interest rate on the bank one revolving credit facility is variable based on the financial institution s prime rate plus 
the company s remaining debt of million has fixed interest rates ranging from to 
as a result  the company s annual interest costs in fluctuated based on short term interest rates on approximately of its total debt outstanding at december  the impact on interest expense and the company s cash flows of a percent increase in bank one s prime rate approximately basis points would be approximately  assuming borrowed amounts under the bank one credit facility remained at the same amount owed as of december  the company did not have any open derivative contracts relating to interest rates at december  forward looking statements and risk certain statements in this report  including statements of the future plans  objectives  and expected performance of the company  are forward looking statements that are dependent upon certain events  risks and uncertainties that may be outside the company s control  and which could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated 
some of these include  but are not limited to  the market prices of oil and gas  economic and competitive conditions  inflation rates  legislative and regulatory changes  financial market conditions  political and economic uncertainties of foreign governments  future business decisions  and other uncertainties  all of which are difficult to predict 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in projecting future rates of production and the timing of development expenditures 
the total amount or timing of actual future production may vary significantly from estimates 
the drilling of exploratory wells can involve significant risks  including those related to timing  success rates and cost overruns 
lease and rig availability  complex geology and other factors can also affect these risks 
additionally  fluctuations in oil and gas prices  or a prolonged period of low prices  may substantially adversely affect the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows
