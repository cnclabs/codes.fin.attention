overview founded in  foundry designs  develops  manufactures and markets a comprehensive  end to end suite of high performance data networking solutions  including ethernet layer and layer switches  metro routers  and internet traffic management products 
our customers include internet and metro service providers  and enterprises such as e commerce sites  entertainment  health and wellness  financial and manufacturing companies  universities  and government agencies 
our product suite includes the fastiron family of layer enterprise switches  the ironpoint tm family of wireless access points  the bigiron family of layer backbone switches  the edgeiron family of layer wiring closet switches  the netiron family of metro routers  the serveriron family of layer traffic management switches  and the ironview tm network management software system 
business environment at the end of  the data networking industry entered a period of market contraction as global economies entered a recessionary period and the global it environment experienced excess network capacity from the large volume of networking equipment deployed during the previous two years in anticipation of high network traffic growth 
this was particularly evident with telecom carriers and service providers who significantly reduced their it budgets in response to excess capacity when network traffic did not increase as expected 
according to an independent research group  after two years of significant growth in excess of in and  the market for ethernet based products decreased in and in  before stabilizing and showing a slight growth rate in in response to this economic environment  we shifted our sales focus from telecom carriers and service providers to enterprises and government agencies 
we also evolved our core strategy from one of performance  to one of features and performance 
since many of our enterprise customers had not only reduced their it budgets  but also the size of their it staffs  we focused our development efforts on product enhancements that would reduce total cost of ownership and allow enterprise customers to manage their networks with fewer resources 
although the data networking industry experienced slight growth in  many of our customers remain cautious about their capital spending and many of our competitors continue to struggle financially 
we believe economic conditions have improved  but are uncertain as to the duration and strength of the economic recovery 
financial performance marks our fifth consecutive year of profitability since we went public in september our revenues for were million  a increase over sales to the us government represented of our revenues in  compared to in revenues per employee increased to an industry high of  in  compared to  in our gross margins improved from in to in this improvement was achieved primarily as a result of economies of scale associated with our year over year revenue growth of  significant cost reduction for both components and assemblies  and  to a lesser extent  increased sales of higher end  higher gross margin products 
net income in was million  or of revenues  compared to million  or of revenues  in in  we grew our revenues and improved our gross margins  while carefully controlling expenses to achieve bottom line growth 
our balance sheet remains debt free  with cash and investments of million  an increase of million from in  we generated million of cash from operations and received million of cash from employee stock option exercises 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the period reported 
by their nature  these estimates and judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
management bases their estimates and judgments on historical experience  market trends  and other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of these estimates form the basis for judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  reflect the more significant judgments and estimates that can have a significant effect on our results of operations and the value of certain assets and liabilities on our consolidated financial statements 
management has discussed the development  selection  and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
these and other significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
revenue recognition we generate the majority of our revenue from sales of stackable and chassis based networking equipment  with the remainder of our revenue coming from customer support fees  training and installation services 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery or performance has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
when sales arrangements contain multiple elements ie  hardware  training  and installation  judgment is applied to determine the appropriate accounting  including how we allocate revenue to each element and when we recognize revenue for each element 
product revenue is generally recognized at the time of shipment  unless an acceptance period or other contingency exists  in which case revenue is recognized upon the earlier of customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period  or upon satisfaction of the contingency 
at the time product revenue is recognized  we estimate the amount of warranty costs to be incurred and record the amount as a cost of revenue 
our standard warranty period extends months from the date of sale  and our estimate of the amount necessary to settle warranty claims is based primarily on our past experience with repair costs related to warranty claims 
although we believe our estimate is adequate and that the judgment we apply is appropriate  actual warranty costs could differ materially from our estimate 
if actual warranty costs are greater than initially estimated  our cost of revenues could increase in the future 
we also provide a provision for estimated customer returns at the time product revenue is recognized 
our provision is based primarily on actual historical sales returns and our return policies 
our resellers generally do not have a right of return  and our contracts with original equipment manufacturers only provide for rights of return in the event our products do not meet specifications or there is an epidemic failure  as defined in the contracts 
if historical data used by us to calculate estimated sales returns does not reasonably approximate future returns  revenue in future periods could be affected 
allowance for doubtful accounts customers are subject to a credit review process  which evaluates the customer s financial condition and ability to pay  and are generally assigned a credit limit that may be increased only after a successful collection history with the customer has been established 
we continually monitor and evaluate the collectibility of our trade receivables and actively manage our accounts receivable to minimize bad debt 
we record specific allowances for doubtful accounts when we become aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligation to us  such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or significant deterioration in financial condition 
we estimate allowances for doubtful accounts for all other customers based on factors such as current economic and industry trends  the extent to which receivables are past due and historical collection experience 
if circumstances change  estimates regarding the collectibility of receivables would be adjusted 
we mitigate some collection risk by requiring certain international customers to provide letters of credit or bank guarantees prior to placing an order with us 
although we believe our allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate and that the judgment we applied is appropriate  our actual amount of bad debt could differ materially from our estimate 
inventories the networking industry is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product introductions  changes in customer requirements  and evolving industry standards 
our inventory purchases and commitments are made based on anticipated demand for our products 
we perform a detailed assessment of our inventory each period  which includes a review of  among other factors  demand requirements  manufacturing lead times  technological changes  product life cycles and development plans  component cost trends  product pricing and quality issues 
based on this analysis  we estimate the amount of excess  obsolete and impaired inventory  and provide reserves to record inventory at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value 
once inventory has been written down to the lower or cost or estimated net realizable value  it is reflected on our balance sheet at its new carrying cost until it is sold or otherwise disposed of 
revisions to our inventory reserves may be required if actual factors differ from our estimates 
we subcontract substantially all of our manufacturing to companies that assemble and test our products 
our agreements with some of these companies allow them to procure long lead time component inventory on our behalf based on a rolling production forecast provided by us 
we may be contractually obligated to purchase long lead time component inventory procured by certain contract manufacturers in accordance with our forecast  unless we give notice of order cancellation at least days prior to the delivery date 
as of december   we were potentially committed to purchase approximately million of such inventory 
if actual demand for our products is below the level in our production forecasts  we may have excess inventory or a liability as a result of our purchase commitments with our contract manufacturers 
deferred tax asset valuation allowance we recognize deferred tax assets based on differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
significant management judgment is required in determining whether valuation allowances should be recorded against our deferred tax assets 
management assesses the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized against projected future taxable income  and to the extent that realization is not believed to be more likely than not  a valuation allowance is established 
in the event we determine that we are unable to realize some or all of our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to our deferred tax assets would be necessary  resulting in a charge to income in the period such determination is made 
likewise  if we later determine that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets would be realized  the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed 
our deferred tax assets as of december  and were million and million  respectively 
loss contingencies we are subject to the possibility of loss contingencies in the normal course of our business  including those related to intellectual property and securities litigation 
a loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
we continually reassess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to our contingencies  as well as potential ranges of probable losses  and will recognize a liability  if any  for these contingencies based on a careful analysis of each issue with the assistance of outside legal counsel and other experts 
results of operations net revenues the following table presents net product and service revenues for the years ended december    and dollars in thousands year ended december  of net revenues of net revenues of net revenues net revenues product service total net revenues net product revenues were million  million  and million in   and  respectively  representing an increase of in and a decrease of in the increase in can be attributed to an increase in overall it spending  increased market share and expanded sales coverage 
during  we focused our sales efforts on broadening our customer base  particularly in non cyclical customer verticals such as healthcare  research enterprises  government agencies  and universities  that typically demonstrate continued capital spending during slow economic cycles 
sales to the us government were particularly strong in  accounting for of our total revenues  compared to in  due to the government s effort to both expand and upgrade their networks 
in late  the federal government certified many of our jetcore based products for sale to the department of defense dod 
once certified  we generated significant revenue from sales of these products to the dod 
our success within the global enterprise market and the us federal government can be attributed to our ability to offer a compelling value proposition  our product architecture  which provides an easy migration path to new technologies with minimal disruption  and our financial strength relative to other data networking vendors 
we also experienced significant revenue growth in japan in  due to the establishment of a direct sales force in to complement our reseller relationship with mitsui  one of our largest resellers 
in  our expanded sales coverage in japan resulted in sales growth of in that country 
product revenues decreased in from  due to lower average selling prices caused by weak economic conditions  competitive pressures  and reduced it spending 
although our product revenues grew from million in the first quarter of to million in the fourth quarter of  as a result of market acceptance of our new products introduced in early  we were unable to achieve product revenue growth year over year due to difficult economic and it spending conditions 
the following table presents net chassis and stackable product revenues for the years ended december    and dollars in thousands year ended december  of net revenues of net revenues of net revenues net product revenues chassis stackable total net product revenues we offer products in two configuration platforms  a fixed configuration stackable or a flexible configuration chassis 
a stackable has a fixed configuration that cannot be altered 
chassis use a modular platform that can be populated and reconfigured with various management and line card modules as frequently as desired by the customer 
for example  customers can use our chassis products at the edge of their network and then reconfigure the chassis to be used in the backbone or core of their network 
our selling prices and gross margins on chassis based products are generally higher than our stackable products because of the flexible configuration offered by chassis based products 
our chassis products accounted for   and of our net product revenues in   and  respectively 
we do not expect sales of our chassis and stackable products to fluctuate significantly as a percentage of total product revenues in the future 
service revenues consist primarily of revenue from customer support contracts  and to a lesser extent  from providing training and installation services 
net service revenues were million  million  and million in   and  respectively  and accounted for of total revenues in and  and in the revenue increases in absolute dollars were due to a larger installed base of our networking equipment each year as customers purchased new support contracts with their new equipment purchases and renewed maintenance contracts on existing equipment 
our customer base grew from  customers at the end of  to  customers in  and to  customers at the end of for the year ended december   two customers accounted for greater than of our total revenues 
mitsui  a reseller in japan  accounted for of our total revenues  and a us government integrator accounted for of our total revenues 
in  mitsui accounted for of our revenues 
no individual customer accounted for more than of our total revenues in sales to the us government represented approximately and of our total revenues in and  respectively  and less than of our total revenues in international sales represented   and of our total revenues for the years ended december    and  respectively 
one individual country outside of the united states  japan  accounted for and of our total revenues in and  respectively 
no individual country outside of the united states accounted for greater than of our total revenues in sales to customers located in japan increased in as a result of our expanded sales presence in japan 
gross margins the following table presents gross margins and gross margin percentages for product and service revenues for the years ended december    and dollars in thousands year ended december  gross margin gross margin gross margin gross margins product service total gross margin our cost of product revenues consists primarily of materials  labor  manufacturing overhead  warranty costs  and provisions for excess and obsolete inventory 
product gross margins were million  million  and million in   and  or   and of product revenues  respectively 
the increase in product gross margin as a percentage of product revenues in was due primarily to cost efficiencies associated with increased business volume in and significant reductions of our component and sub assembly costs 
product margins improved to a lesser extent as a result of increased sales of our high end  high margin products in and lower provisions for excess and obsolete inventory 
during  our total port shipments of all products increased by from  but our shipments of gigabit ethernet ports  a higher gross margin product  grew by 
this shift in product mix was due to our customers increasing preference for gigabit ethernet  a layer switching technology and higher gross margin product  instead of ethernet  a layer technology and lower gross margin product 
this product mix shift contributed to our gross margin improvement in during the first nine months of  our component and assembly costs were reduced significantly  which dramatically improved our gross margins 
in the fourth quarter of  our component and assembly costs stabilized 
lead times for various components have lengthened recently as a result of it spending and the general economic recovery 
as component demand increases and lead times become longer  our suppliers are less inclined to reduce component costs 
if we are unable to further reduce component costs  or our selling prices decline  our gross margins may also decline 
see risk factors our gross margins may decline over time and the average selling prices of our products may decrease as a result of competitive pressures and other factors 
the increase in product gross margins from in to in was due to significantly lower inventory provisions in  offset by increased manufacturing overhead expenses due to the expansion of our manufacturing facility 
inventory provisions were million in  million in  and million in significant inventory reserves were provided in in connection with our transition from ironcore asic based products to products incorporating our next generation jetcore asics 
our cost of service revenues consists primarily of costs of providing services under customer support contracts 
these costs include material costs  labor  and overhead 
service gross margins were in and  and in despite significantly higher service revenues in  our service gross margin percentage remained unchanged from  due primarily to increased service inventory and labor costs associated with supporting a larger customer base 
as noted above  our customer base grew considerably between and service gross margin as a percentage of service revenue increased in  compared to  due to a write off of service inventory at customer sites in many of our customers ceased operations during due to the economic recession and  as a result  we were unable to recover our service inventory 
we expect service gross margins to experience variability over time due to the timing of technical support initiations and renewals and additional investments in our customer support infrastructure 
research and development  sales and marketing  and general and administrative expenses the following table presents research and development  sales and marketing  and general and administrative expenses for the years ended december    and dollars in thousands year ended december  of net revenues of net revenues of net revenues research and development sales and marketing general and administrative research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel expenses  prototype materials and expenses related to the development of our asics  software development and testing costs  and the depreciation of property and equipment used in research and development activities 
research and development expenses were million  million  and million in   and  or   and of revenue  respectively 
the increase in research and development expenses in was due primarily to prototype expenses incurred in connection with development of our terabit capacity ethernet switching products  and  to a lesser extent  an increase in our average headcount from engineers in to engineers in research and development expenses increased million in due to an increase in headcount from an average of engineers in to engineers in  offset by reduced prototype expenses in as a result of the completion of our next generation jetcore asics in we believe continued investment in product enhancements and new product development is critical to achieving our strategic objectives  and  as a result  we expect research and development expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing  sales and customer support activities  costs associated with trade shows  advertising  and promotions  and the cost of facilities 
sales and marketing expenses were million  million  and million in   and  or   and of revenues  respectively 
the increase in absolute dollars from to was primarily due to higher sales commissions as a result of increased revenues in  higher travel costs associated with expanding our sales coverage  and to a lesser extent  increased marketing expenses associated with the launch of new products in the decrease in absolute dollars from to was primarily due to a reduction in our domestic sales force in we believe that continued investment in sales and marketing activities is critical to our success  and expect these expenses to increase slightly in absolute dollars in as we initiate additional sales and marketing programs to support our products 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for executive  finance and administrative personnel  costs of facilities  bad debt  legal fees  and other general corporate expenses 
general and administrative expenses were million  million  and million in   and  or   and of revenue  respectively 
the million increase in was primarily due to an increase of million in legal expenses related to litigation matters discussed in part i item legal proceedings  and an increase of million in executive bonuses  offset by a million decrease in bad debt expense as a result of the effect of improved economic conditions on the financial condition of our customer base 
the decrease of million from to was primarily due to the effect of the economic recession in in  we recorded a provision for doubtful accounts receivable of million  a charge of million in for the write down of a note receivable from a stockholder  and million of costs related to consolidation of facilities 
in  we recorded only million for doubtful accounts  and did not incur any expenses for write downs of notes receivable or consolidation of facilities 
we expect general and administrative expenses to increase slightly in  compared to amortization of deferred stock compensation 
in connection with the granting of stock options to employees and a director  we recorded deferred stock compensation in the aggregate amount of million in and million in  representing the difference between the exercise price and the deemed fair market value of our common stock on the date stock options were granted 
we recorded no additional deferred stock compensation after deferred stock compensation was amortized to operations over the respective vesting periods of the options 
we recorded amortization of deferred stock compensation expense of approximately  million  and million for fiscal   and  respectively 
we have no remaining deferred stock compensation at december  interest income 
we earn interest income on funds maintained in interest bearing money market and investment accounts 
we recorded interest income of million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
despite higher levels of cash and investments throughout  interest income remained nearly unchanged from due to lower average interest rates in interest income decreased from to  primarily due to lower average interest rates on our portfolio of fixed income securities in see item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for a description of our investment policy 
write down of minority investment 
in february  we made a million minority investment in a privately held development stage company  who was also a customer 
total sales to this customer were insignificant 
in december  we determined that the investment s decline in fair market value was other than temporary based on certain factors such as the value of the investee s most recent round of financing  market and industry conditions  and the financial condition of  and business outlook for  the investee 
accordingly  we wrote down our entire minority investment during the year ended december  income taxes 
the effective tax rate for the years ended december    and was   and  respectively 
these rates reflect applicable federal and state tax rates  offset by research and development tax credits  foreign sales corporation tax benefits  and tax exempt interest income 
since tax exempt interest income and research and development credits as a percentage of net income were significantly higher in than in  our effective tax rate was higher in in addition  we recorded a valuation allowance of million in against a deferred tax asset associated with a capital loss carryover  as we do not believe we can generate significant capital gains from our investment portfolio to utilize the capital loss carryover before its statutory expiration in our income taxes payable for federal and state purposes have been reduced  and stockholders equity increased  by the tax benefits associated with taxable dispositions of employee stock options 
when an employee exercises a stock option issued under a nonqualified plan  or has a disqualifying disposition related to a qualified plan  we receive an income tax benefit for the difference between the fair market value of the stock issued at the time of the exercise and the employee s option price  tax effected 
these benefits are credited directly to stockholders equity and amounted to million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had cash and investments totaling million  an increase of million from million at december  the increase was primarily the result of increased profitability in and proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options 
due to significant tax deductions in and resulting from disqualifying dispositions of employee stock options  we paid relatively insignificant amounts of taxes in those years in relation to our income before taxes 
in  we generated million of income before taxes  we received million of cash from employee stock option exercises and stock purchases  and our deferred support revenue increased by million as a result of our larger installed product base 
these factors were the primary contributors to our increase in cash and investments in accounts receivable  net of allowances  increased million  or  to million as of december   from million as of december  our accounts receivable and days sales outstanding dso are primarily affected by shipment linearity and collections performance 
shipment linearity is a measure of the level of shipments throughout a particular period 
a steady level of shipments throughout a period will result in lower dso  than a period in which there is a higher level of shipments toward the end of the period  due to less time available to collect accounts receivable prior to period end 
dso  calculated based on annualized revenues for the most recent quarter and net accounts receivable as of the balance sheet date  increased to days as of december   from days as of december  the increase in dso was due to less linear shipments during the fourth quarter of fiscal  in which more than of our revenue shipped during the last month of the quarter 
disclosures about contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table aggregates our contractual obligations and commercial commitments at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods in thousands total less than year years years more than years operating leases purchase commitments with contract manufacturers total contractual cash obligations for purposes of the above table  contractual obligations for the purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable  legally binding on us  and subject us to penalties if we cancel the agreement 
our purchase commitments are based on our short term manufacturing needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons 
although it is difficult for us to predict future liquidity requirements with certainty  we believe our existing cash balances and anticipated funds from operations will satisfy our cash requirements for at least the next months 
key factors affecting our cash flows include our ability to effectively manage our working capital  in particular inventories and accounts receivable  and future demand for our products and related pricing 
we may incur higher capital expenditures in the near future if market conditions improve and we expand our operations 
although we do not have any current plans or commitments to do so  we may from time to time consider the acquisition of products or businesses complementary to our business 
any acquisition or investment may require additional capital 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not maintain any off balance sheet transactions  arrangements  or obligations that are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition  results of operations  liquidity  or capital resources

risk factors that may affect future results and the market price of our stock weak economic and market conditions or geopolitical turmoil may adversely affect our revenues  gross margins and expenses 
our quarterly revenues and operating results may continue to fluctuate  due to the effects of general economic conditions in the united states and globally  and  in particular  market conditions in the communications and networking industries 
additionally  current political turmoil in many parts of the world  including terrorist and military actions  may weaken the global economy 
if economic conditions in the united states and globally do not improve  or if they worsen  we may experience material negative effects on our business  operating results and financial condition 
although we experienced improved sales  gross margins  and profitability on a quarter over quarter basis throughout as a result of improving economic and market conditions  there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain or further improve our financial results or that economic and market conditions will continue to improve and will not deteriorate 
because our financial results are difficult to predict  we may not meet quarterly financial expectations  which could cause our stock price to decline 
our quarterly revenues and operating results are difficult to predict and may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter 
delays in generating or recognizing forecasted revenues could cause our quarterly operating results to be below the expectations of public market analysts or investors  which could cause the price of our common stock to fall 
we may experience a delay in generating or recognizing revenue for a number of reasons 
unfulfilled orders at the beginning of each quarter typically do not equal expected revenue for that quarter and are generally cancelable at any time prior to shipment 
therefore  we depend on obtaining orders in a quarter for shipment in that quarter to achieve our revenue objectives 
in addition  our reseller agreements typically allow the reseller to delay scheduled delivery dates without penalty 
moreover  demand for our products may fluctuate as a result of seasonality 
in addition  we may incur increased costs and expenses related to sales and marketing  including expansion of our direct sales operations and distribution channels  product development  customer support  expansion of our corporate infrastructure  legal matters  and facilities expansion 
we base our operating expenses on anticipated revenue levels  and a high percentage of our expenses are fixed in the short term 
as a result  any significant shortfall in revenue relative to our expectations could cause a significant decline in our quarterly operating results 
because of the uncertain nature of the economic environment and rapidly changing market we serve  period to period comparisons of operating results may not be meaningful 
in addition  you may not be able to rely on the results for any period as an indication of future performance 
in the future  our revenue may remain flat  decrease or increase  and we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future 
as a consequence  operating results for a particular quarter are extremely difficult to predict 
although our customer base has increased  we still depend on large  recurring purchases from certain customers  and a loss  cancellation or delay in purchases by these customers could negatively affect our revenue 
sales to our ten largest customers accounted for and of total revenues in and  respectively 
the loss of continued orders from any of our more significant customers  such as the us government or individual agencies within the us government  mitsui  america online  or hewlett packard  could cause our revenue and profitability to suffer 
our ability to attract new customers will depend on a variety of factors  including the cost effectiveness  reliability  scalability  breadth and depth of our products 
although our financial performance may depend on large  recurring orders from certain customers and resellers  we do not generally have binding commitments from them 
for example our reseller agreements generally do not require minimum purchases  our customers can stop purchasing and our resellers can stop marketing our products at any time  and our reseller agreements generally are not exclusive and are for one year terms  with no obligation of the resellers to renew the agreements 
because our expenses are based on our revenue forecasts  a substantial reduction or delay in sales of our products to  or unexpected returns from  customers and resellers  or the loss of any significant customer or reseller  could harm our business 
although our largest customers may vary from period to period  we anticipate that our operating results for any given period will continue to depend on large orders from a small number of customers 
the united states government is a significant customer and has been one key to our financial success 
however  government demand is unpredictable and there is no guarantee of future contract awards 
as part of the changing economic environment  the united states government has become an important customer for the networking industry  and for us in particular 
the process of becoming a qualified government vendor takes considerable time and effort  and the timing of contract awards and deployment of our products are hard to predict 
typically  six to twelve months may elapse between the initial evaluation of our systems by governmental agencies and the execution of a contract 
the revenue stream from these contracts is hard to predict and may be materially uneven between quarters 
government agency contracts are frequently awarded only after formal competitive bidding processes  which are often protracted and may contain provisions that permit cancellation in the event funds are unavailable to the government agency 
even if we are awarded contracts  substantial delays or cancellations of purchases could result from protests initiated by losing bidders 
in addition  government agencies are subject to budgetary processes and expenditure constraints that could lead to delays or decreased capital expenditures in certain areas 
if we fail to win any significant government contract award  if the government or individual agencies within the government terminate or reduce the scope and value of our existing contracts  or if the government fails to reduce the budget deficit  our financial results may be harmed 
intense competition in the market for network solutions could prevent us from maintaining or increasing revenue and sustaining profitability 
the market for network solutions is intensely competitive 
in particular  cisco systems  inc maintains a dominant position in this market and several of its products compete directly with our products 
cisco s substantial resources and market dominance have enabled it to reduce prices on its products within a short period of time following the introduction of these products  which reduces margins and  therefore  the profitability of its competitors 
purchasers of networking solutions may choose cisco s products because of its longer operating history  broader product line and strong reputation in the networking market 
in addition  cisco may have developed  or could in the future develop  new technologies that directly compete with our products or render our products obsolete 
although we are currently among the top providers of network infrastructure solutions  we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against cisco  currently the leading provider in the networking market 
we also compete with other companies  such as extreme networks  juniper networks  nortel networks  enterasys networks  com  huawei  and alcatel 
some of our current and potential competitors have greater market leverage  longer operating histories  greater financial  technical  sales  marketing and other resources  more name recognition and larger installed customer bases 
additionally  we may face competition from unknown companies and emerging technologies that may offer new lan  man and lan wan solutions 
furthermore  a number of these competitors may merge or form strategic relationships that would enable them to apply greater resources and sales coverage than we can  and to offer  or bring to market earlier  products that are superior to ours in terms of features  quality  pricing or other factors 
in order to remain competitive  we must  among other things  invest significant resources in developing new products with superior performance at lower prices than our competitors  enhance our current products and maintain customer satisfaction 
in addition  we must make certain our sales and marketing capabilities allow us to effectively compete against our competitors 
if we fail to do so  our products may not compete favorably with those of our competitors and our revenues and profitability could suffer 
we must continue to introduce new products with superior performance and features in a timely manner in order to sustain and increase our revenue 
the networking industry is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product introductions  changes in customer requirements  and evolving industry standards 
therefore  in order to remain competitive  we must introduce new products in a timely manner that offer substantially greater performance and support a greater number of users per device  all at lower price points 
the process of developing new technology is complex and uncertain  and if we fail to develop or obtain important intellectual property and accurately predict customers changing needs and emerging technological trends  our business could be harmed 
we must commit significant resources to develop new products before knowing whether our investments will eventually result in products that the market will accept 
after a product is developed  we must be able to forecast sales volumes and quickly manufacture a sufficient volume of products and mix of configurations that meet customer requirements  all at low costs 
the current life cycle of our products is typically to months 
the introduction of new products or product enhancements may shorten the life cycle of our existing products or replace sales of some of our current products  thereby offsetting the benefit of even a successful product introduction  and may cause customers to defer purchasing our existing products in anticipation of the new products 
this could harm our operating results by decreasing sales  increasing our inventory levels of older products and exposing us to greater risk of product obsolescence 
in addition  we have experienced  and may in the future experience  delays in developing and releasing new products and product enhancements 
this has led to  and may in the future lead to  delayed sales  increased expenses and lower quarterly revenues than anticipated 
during the development of our products  we have also experienced delays in the prototyping of our asics  which in turn has led to delays in product introductions 
our ability to increase our revenues depends on expanding our direct sales operations and reseller distribution channels and continuing to provide excellent customer support 
if we are unable to effectively develop and retain our sales and support staff  or establish and cultivate relationships with our indirect distribution channels  our ability to grow and increase revenue could be harmed 
additionally  if our resellers are not successful in their sales efforts  sales of our products may decrease and our operating results could suffer 
some of our resellers also sell products that compete with our products 
as a result  we cannot assure you that our resellers will market our products effectively or continue to devote the resources necessary to provide us with adequate sales  marketing and technical support 
in an effort to gain market share and support our customers  we may need to expand our direct sales operations and customer service staff to support new and existing customers 
the timing and extent of any such expansion are uncertain in light of the current economic environment 
expansion of our direct sales operations and reseller distribution channels may not be successfully implemented and the cost of any expansion may exceed the revenues generated 
our gross margins may decline over time and the average selling prices of our products may decrease as a result of competitive pressures and other factors 
our industry has experienced erosion of average product selling prices due to a number of factors  particularly competitive and macroeconomic pressures and rapid technological change 
the average selling prices of our products has decreased in the past and may continue to decrease in response to competitive pressures  increased sales discounts  new product introductions by our competitors or other factors 
both we and our competitors occasionally lower sales prices in order to gain market share or create more demand 
furthermore  as a result of the recent disruption in the technology sector  coupled with more broad macro economic factors  both we and our competitors may pursue more aggressive pricing strategies in an effort to maintain sales levels 
such intense pricing competition could cause our gross margins to decline and may adversely affect our business  operating results or financial condition 
our gross margins may be adversely affected if we are unable to reduce manufacturing costs and effectively manage our inventory levels 
although management continues to closely monitor inventory levels  declines in demand for our products could result in additional provisions for excess inventory 
additionally  our gross margins may be negatively affected by fluctuations in manufacturing volumes  component costs  the mix of product configurations sold and the mix of distribution channels through which our products are sold 
for example  we generally realize higher gross margins on direct sales to an end user than on sales through resellers or to our oems 
as a result  any significant shift in revenues through resellers or to our oems could harm our gross margins 
if product or related warranty costs associated with our products are greater than we have experienced  our gross margins may also be adversely affected 
we need additional qualified personnel to maintain and expand our business 
if we are unable to promptly attract and retain qualified personnel  our business may be harmed 
we believe our future success will depend in large part on our ability to identify  attract and retain highly skilled managerial  engineering  sales and marketing  finance and manufacturing personnel 
despite the economic downturn  competition for these personnel can be intense  especially in the san francisco bay area  and we may experience some difficulty hiring employees in the timeframe we desire  particularly engineers 
volatility or lack of positive performance in our stock price may also adversely affect our ability to retain key employees  all of whom have been granted stock options 
in order to improve productivity  we have historically used stock options to motivate and retain our employees 
some of the proposals currently under consideration by the accounting profession regarding the accounting treatment of stock options could limit our ability to continue to use stock options as an incentive and retention tool 
we may not succeed in identifying  attracting and retaining personnel 
the loss of the services of any of our key personnel  the inability to identify  attract or retain qualified personnel in the future  or delays in hiring required personnel  particularly engineers and sales personnel  could make it difficult for us to manage our business and meet key objectives  such as timely product introductions 
our success also depends to a significant degree on the continued contributions of our key management  engineering  sales and marketing  finance and manufacturing personnel  many of whom would be difficult to replace 
in particular  we believe that our future success depends on bobby r 
johnson  jr  president  chief executive officer and chairman of the board 
we do not have employment contracts or key person life insurance for any of our personnel 
our presence in international markets involves inherent risks that we may not be able to control 
as a result  our business may be harmed if we are unable to successfully address these risks 
our success will depend  in part  on increasing international sales and expanding our international operations 
our international sales primarily depend on our resellers  including pervasive networks and spot distribution ltd 
in europe  mitsui in japan  shanghai gentek and gti in china  and samsung in korea 
for example  our largest reseller  mitsui  accounted for and of our total net revenues in and  respectively 
the failure of our international resellers to sell our products would limit our ability to sustain and grow our revenue 
in particular  our revenue from japan depends primarily on mitsui s ability to sell our products and on the strength of the japanese economy  which has been weak in recent years 
there are a number of risks arising from our international business  including potential recessions in economies outside the united states  longer accounts receivable collection cycles  seasonal reductions in business activity  higher costs of doing business in foreign countries  difficulties in managing operations across disparate geographic areas  difficulties associated with enforcing agreements through foreign legal systems  political instability and export restrictions  potential adverse tax consequences  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  military conflict and terrorist activities  and widespread medical epidemics  such as sars 
one or more of such factors may have a material adverse effect on our future international operations and  consequently  on our business  operating results and financial condition 
generally  our international sales are denominated in us dollars 
as a result  an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products less competitive on a price basis in international markets 
in the future  we may elect to invoice some of our international customers in local currency  which could subject us to fluctuations in exchange rates between the us dollar and the local currency 
we purchase several key components for our products from several sources  if these components are not available  our revenues may be harmed 
we purchase several key components used in our products from several sources and depend on supply from these sources to meet our needs 
the inability of any supplier to provide us with an adequate supply of key components  or the loss of any of our suppliers  may cause a delay in our ability to fulfill orders and may have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 
lead times for various components have lengthened recently as a result of limits on it spending and the economic uncertainty  which has made certain components scarce 
as component demand increases and lead times become longer  our suppliers may increase component costs 
if component costs increase  our gross margins may also decline 
our principal limited sourced components include dynamic and static random access memories  commonly known as drams and srams  asics  printed circuit boards  optical components  microprocessors and power supplies 
we acquire these components through purchase orders and have no long term commitments regarding supply or price from these suppliers 
from time to time  we have experienced shortages in allocations of components  resulting in delays in filling orders 
we may encounter shortages and delays in obtaining components in the future which could impede our ability to meet customer orders 
we depend on anticipated product orders to determine our material requirements 
lead times for limited sourced materials and components can be as long as six months  vary significantly and depend on factors such as the specific supplier  contract terms and demand for a component at a given time 
inventory management remains an area of focus as we balance the need to maintain strategic inventory levels to ensure competitive lead times with the risk of inventory obsolescence due to rapidly changing technology and customer requirements 
if orders do not match forecasts  or if we do not manage inventory effectively  we may have either excess or insufficient inventory of materials and components  which could negatively affect our operating results and financial condition 
our reliance on third party manufacturing vendors to manufacture our products may cause a delay in our ability to fill orders 
we subcontract substantially all of our manufacturing to companies that assemble and test our products 
our agreements with some of these companies allow them to procure long lead time component inventory on our behalf based on a rolling production forecast provided by us 
we may be contractually obligated to purchase long lead time component inventory procured by our contract manufacturers in accordance with our forecast  unless we give notice of order cancellation at least days prior to the delivery date 
if actual demand for our products is below our projections  we may have excess inventory as a result of our purchase commitments with our contract manufacturers 
we do not have long term contracts with these manufacturers 
we have experienced delays in product shipments from our contract manufacturers  which in turn delayed product shipments to our customers 
we may in the future experience similar delays or other problems  such as inferior quality and insufficient quantity of product  any of which could harm our business and operating results 
we intend to regularly introduce new products and product enhancements  which will require us to rapidly achieve volume production by coordinating our efforts with our suppliers and contract manufacturers 
we attempt to increase our material purchases  contract manufacturing capacity and internal test and quality functions to meet anticipated demand 
the inability of our contract manufacturers to provide us with adequate supplies of high quality products  the loss of any of our contract manufacturers  or the inability to obtain raw materials  could cause a delay in our ability to fulfill orders 
due to the lengthy sales cycles of some of our products  the timing of our revenue is difficult to predict and may cause us to fail to meet our revenue expectations 
some of our products have a relatively high sales price  and often represent a significant and strategic decision by a customer 
the decision by customers to purchase our products is often based on their internal budgets and procedures involving rigorous evaluation  testing  implementation and acceptance of new technologies 
as a result  our sales cycle in these situations can be as long as months and may vary substantially from customer to customer 
while our customers are evaluating our products and before they may place an order with us  we may incur substantial sales and marketing expenses and expend significant management effort 
consequently  if sales forecasted from a specific customer for a particular quarter are not realized in that quarter  we may not meet our revenue expectations 
if we fail to protect our intellectual property  our business and ability to compete could suffer 
our success and ability to compete are substantially dependent on our internally developed technology and know how 
our proprietary technology includes our asics  our ironcore  jetcore  and terathon hardware architecture  our ironware software  our ironview network management software  and certain mechanical designs 
we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws and contractual restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights in these proprietary technologies 
although we have patent applications pending  there can be no assurance that patents will be issued from pending applications  or that claims allowed on any future patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology 
we provide software to customers under license agreements included in the packaged software 
these agreements are not negotiated with or signed by the licensee  and thus may not be enforceable in some jurisdictions 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights through confidentiality and license agreements  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology 
these precautions may not prevent misappropriation or infringement of our intellectual property 
monitoring unauthorized use of our products is difficult and the steps we have taken may not prevent misappropriation of our technology  particularly in some foreign countries in which the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
we may be subject to intellectual property infringement claims that are costly to defend and could limit our ability to use certain technologies in the future 
the networking industry is increasingly characterized by the existence of a large number of patent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
in particular  some companies in the networking industry claim extensive patent portfolios 
as a result of the existence of a large number of patents and rapid rate of issuance of new patents in the networking industry  it is not economically practical for a company of our size to determine in advance whether a product or any of its components may infringe intellectual property rights claimed by others 
from time to time third parties have asserted exclusive patent  copyright and trademark rights to technologies and related standards that are important to us 
such third parties may assert claims or initiate litigation against us or our manufacturers  suppliers or customers alleging infringement of their intellectual property rights with respect to our existing or future products 
in march  nortel filed a lawsuit against us in the united states district court for the district of massachusetts  alleging that certain of our products infringe several of nortel s patents and seeking injunctive relief and unspecified damages 
nortel has also brought suit  on the same or similar patents  against a number of other networking companies 
we have analyzed the validity of nortel s claims and believe that nortel s suit is without merit 
we are committed to vigorously defending ourself against these claims 
on october   we filed a lawsuit against nortel in the united states district court  northern district of california  alleging that certain of nortel s products infringe one of our patents  and alleging breach of contract by nortel 
we are seeking injunctive relief and damages 
in may  lucent filed a lawsuit against us in the united states district court for the district of delaware  alleging that certain of our products infringe several of lucent s patents  and seeking injunctive relief and unspecified damages 
lucent also brought suit on the same patents and one other patent against one of our competitors 
on august   we filed a motion to sever the cases  and on february   the district court granted the motion 
the parties are in the process of rescheduling the court dates in view of the district court s order to sever the cases 
we have analyzed the validity of lucent s claims and believe lucent s suit is without merit 
we are committed to vigorously defending ourself against lucent s claims 
regardless of the merits of our position  we may incur substantial expenses in defending against third party claims 
in the event of a determination adverse to us  we could incur substantial monetary liability  and be required to change our business practices 
either of these could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
in difficult economic times  some companies have attempted to realize revenues from their patent portfolios by using licensing programs 
some of these companies have contacted us regarding a license 
we carefully review all license requests  but are unwilling to license technology not required for our product portfolio 
however  any asserted license demand can require considerable effort to review and respond 
moreover  a refusal by us to a license request could result in threats of litigation or actual litigation  which  if initiated  could harm our business 
we face litigation risks 
we are a party to lawsuits in the normal course of our business 
litigation in general  and intellectual property and securities litigation in particular  can be expensive  lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations 
moreover  the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict 
we believe that we have defenses in the lawsuits pending against us as indicated in part i  item legal proceedings  and we are vigorously contesting these allegations 
responding to the allegations has been  and probably will continue to be  expensive and time consuming for us 
an unfavorable resolution of the lawsuits could adversely affect our business  results of operations  or financial condition 
the timing of the adoption of industry standards may negatively affect widespread market acceptance of our products 
our success depends in part on both the adoption of industry standards for new technologies in our market and our products compliance with industry standards 
many technological developments occur prior to the adoption of the related industry standard 
the absence or delay of an industry standard related to a specific technology may prevent market acceptance of products using the technology 
we intend to develop products using new technological advancements  such as mpls draft martini  and may develop these products prior to the adoption of industry standards related to these technologies 
as a result  we may incur significant expenses and losses due to lack of customer demand  unusable purchased components for these products and the diversion of our engineers from future product development efforts 
further  if the adoption of industry standards moves too quickly  we may develop products that do not comply with a later adopted industry standard  which could hurt our ability to sell these products 
if the industry evolves to new standards  we may not be able to successfully design and manufacture new products in a timely fashion that meet these new standards 
even after industry standards are adopted  the future success of our products depends on widespread market acceptance of their underlying technologies 
at least one networking equipment standards body has reportedly stopped all work on a standard in response to assertions by nortel that it controls the patent rights to certain industry standards 
attempts by third parties to impose licensing fees on industry standards could undermine the adoption of such standards and lessen industry opportunities 
if our products contain undetected software or hardware errors  we could incur significant unexpected expenses and lost sales and be subject to product liability claims 
our products are complex and may contain undetected defects or errors  particularly when first introduced or as new enhancements and versions are released 
despite our testing procedures  these defects and errors may be found after commencement of commercial shipments 
any defects or errors in our products discovered in the future or failures of our customers networks  whether caused by our products or another vendors products  could result in negative customer reactions  product liability claims  negative publicity regarding us and our products  delays in or loss of market acceptance of our products  product returns  lost sales  and unexpected expenses to remedy errors 
if we do not adequately manage and evolve our financial reporting and managerial systems and processes  our ability to manage and grow our business may be harmed 
our ability to successfully implement our business plan and comply with regulations requires an effective planning and management process 
we expect that we will need to continue to improve existing  and implement new  operational and financial systems  procedures and controls to manage our business effectively in the future 
any delay in the implementation of  or disruption in the transition to  new or enhanced systems  procedures or controls  could harm our ability to accurately forecast sales demand  manage our supply chain and record and report financial and management information on a timely and accurate basis 
our products may not meet the standards required for their sale  which may harm our business 
in the united states  our products must comply with various regulations and standards defined by the federal communications commission and underwriters laboratories 
internationally  products that we develop may be required to comply with standards established by telecommunications authorities in various countries  as well as those of certain international bodies 
although we believe our products are currently in compliance with domestic and international standards and regulations in countries in which we currently sell  there can be no assurance that our existing and future product offerings will continue to comply with evolving standards and regulations 
if we fail to obtain timely domestic or foreign regulatory approvals or certification  we may not be able to sell our products where these standards or regulations apply  which may prevent us from sustaining our revenues or maintaining profitability 
we may engage in acquisitions that could result in the dilution of our stockholders  cause us to incur substantial expenses and harm our business if we cannot successfully integrate the acquired business  products  technologies or personnel 
although foundry focuses on internal product development and growth  we may learn of acquisition prospects that would complement our existing business or enhance our technological capabilities 
any acquisition by us could result in large and immediate write offs  the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities  or amortization expenses related to amortizable intangible assets  any of which could negatively affect our results of operations 
furthermore  acquisitions involve numerous risks and uncertainties  including difficulties in the assimilation of products  operations  personnel and technologies of the acquired companies  diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  risks of entering geographic and business markets in which we have no or limited prior experience  and potential loss of key employees of acquired organizations 
although we do not currently have any agreements or plans with respect to any material acquisitions  we may make acquisitions of complementary businesses  products or technologies in the future 
we may not be able to successfully integrate any businesses  products  technologies or personnel that might be acquired  and our failure to do so could harm our business 
our stock price has been volatile historically  which may make it more difficult to sell shares when needed at attractive prices 
the trading price of our common stock has been  and may continue to be  subject to wide fluctuations 
our stock price may fluctuate in response to a number of events and factors  such as quarterly variations in operating results  announcements of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors  changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts  the operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors may deem comparable  and news reports relating to trends in our markets 
in addition  the stock market in general  and technology companies in particular  have experienced extreme volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies 
these broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the price of our stock  regardless of our operating performance 
additionally  volatility or lack of positive performance in our stock price may adversely affect our ability to retain key employees  all of whom have been granted stock options 
if we are required to record compensation expense in connection with stock option grants  our profitability may be reduced significantly 
the financial accounting standards board has recently indicated that they will require stock based employee compensation to be recorded as a charge to earnings 
the various methods for expensing stock options are based on  among other things  the volatility of the underlying stock 
as noted above  our stock price has historically been volatile 
therefore  the adoption of an accounting standard requiring companies to expense stock options could negatively affect our profitability and may adversely affect our stock price 
such adoption could also limit our ability to continue to use stock options as an incentive and retention tool  which could  in turn  hurt our ability to recruit employees and retain existing employees 
fasb is expected to issue final rules on stock option expensing in the second half of we will continue to monitor fasb s progress on the issuance of this standard 
management beneficially owns approximately of our stock  their interests could conflict with other shareholders  significant sales of stock held by them and other employees could have a negative effect on our stock price 
our directors and executive officers beneficially own approximately of our outstanding common stock as of december  as a result of their ownership and positions  our directors and executive officers collectively are able to significantly influence all matters requiring stockholder approval  including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions 
our employees who own foundry common stock are also collectively able to significantly influence such matters 
such concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of foundry 
in addition  sales of significant amounts of shares held by foundry s employees  directors and executive officers  or the prospect of these sales  could adversely affect the market price of foundry s common stock 
anti takeover provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us 
our board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to determine the price  rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions  including voting rights  of those shares without any further vote or action by the stockholders 
the rights of the holders of common stock may be subject to  and may be adversely affected by  the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
the issuance of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change of control of foundry without further action by the stockholders and may adversely affect the voting and other rights of the holders of common stock 
we have no present plans to issue shares of preferred stock 
further  certain provisions of our charter documents  including provisions eliminating the ability of stockholders to take action by written consent and limiting the ability of stockholders to raise matters at a meeting of stockholders without giving advance notice  may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or management of foundry  which could have an adverse effect on the market price of our stock 
in addition  our charter documents do not permit cumulative voting  which may make it more difficult for a third party to gain control of our board of directors 
our operations could be significantly hindered by the occurrence of a natural disaster  terrorist acts or other catastrophic event 
our operations are susceptible to outages due to fire  floods  power loss  power shortages  telecommunications failures  break ins and similar events 
in addition  certain of our local and foreign offices and contract manufacturers are located in areas susceptible to earthquakes and acts of terrorism  which could cause a material disruption in our operations 
the prospect of such unscheduled interruptions may continue for the foreseeable future and we are unable to predict either their occurrence  duration or cessation 
we do not have multiple site capacity for all of our services in the event of any such occurrence 
despite our implementation of network security measures  our servers are vulnerable to computer viruses  break ins  and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems 
we may not carry sufficient insurance to compensate us for losses that may occur as a result of any of these events 
any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  and financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our investments are made in accordance with an investment policy approved by our board of directors 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve capital while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
our exposure to interest rate risk relates to our investment portfolio 
we do not use interest rate swaps in our investment portfolio 
we place our investments with high credit quality issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure with any one issuer or fund 
for liquidity purposes  our investment policy requires that we maintain a minimum of million in money market accounts of suitable credit quality 
we have performed a hypothetical sensitivity analysis assuming an immediate parallel shift in the yield curve of plus or minus basis points  while all other variables remain constant 
a hypothetical basis point decline in interest rates would reduce our annualized interest income by approximately million at december  our investment portfolio is classified as held to maturity and is recorded at amortized cost  and includes only securities with original maturities of less than two years and with secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity 
since we hold our investments to maturity  we are exposed to risk in the event an issuer is not able to meet its obligations at maturity 
to mitigate this risk  our investment policy does not allow us to invest more than million with any one issuer 
we do not have any investments denominated in foreign country currencies  and therefore are not subject to foreign currency risk on such investments 
currently  the majority of our sales and expenses are denominated in us dollars and  as a result  we have not experienced significant foreign exchange gains and losses to date 
we do not currently enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge exposures denominated in foreign currencies or any other derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
however  in the event our exposure to foreign currency risk increases  we may choose to hedge those exposures 
for most currencies  we are a net payer of foreign currencies and  therefore  benefit from a stronger us dollar and are adversely affected by a weaker us dollar relative to those foreign currencies 
we have performed a sensitivity analysis as of december  using a modeling technique that measures the change in fair values arising from a hypothetical adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar  with all other variables held constant 
foreign currency exchange rates used were based on market rates in effect at december  the sensitivity analysis indicated that a hypothetical adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates would not result in a material loss in the fair values of foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities at december
