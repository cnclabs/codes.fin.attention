at december   we operated  funeral service locations  cemeteries and crematoria located in eight countries 
we also had a minority interest equity investment in funeral and cemetery operations in the united kingdom and australia

we expect to sell our minority interest equity investment in the united kingdom in the second quarter of  pending a successful public offering transaction 
on march   we sold our funeral operations in france hereafter referred to as joint ventured and then purchased a equity interest in the acquiring entity 
the french operations consisted of funeral service locations and crematoria at december  for additional information regarding this transaction  see note twenty to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k

our cemeteries provide cemetery property interment rights including mausoleum spaces  lots and lawn crypts and sell cemetery related merchandise including stone and bronze memorials  burial vaults  casket and cremation memorialization products and services primarily merchandise installation fees and burial opening and closing fees 
cemetery items are sold on an atneed or preneed basis

funeral and cemetery operations general the funeral and cemetery operations consist of our funeral service locations  cemeteries  crematoria and related businesses 
as of december   our operations were organized into a north america division  which represents the united states and canada  a european division primarily consisting of operations in france and an other foreign division relating to operations managed in south america and singapore 
in march  we joint ventured our funeral operations in france 
for additional information regarding this transaction  see note twenty to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
during the fourth quarter of  we realigned our funeral and cemetery operations in north america to better meet the needs of different market types 
as a result  the funeral and cemetery operations in north america are organized into major markets and middle markets 
each market is led by a market director with responsibility for funeral and cemetery operations as well as preneed sales 
within each market  the operational facilities realize efficiencies by sharing common resources such as personnel  preparation services and vehicles 
there are three market support centers in north america to assist market directors with financial  administrative and human resource needs 
these support centers  commonly referred to as hubs  are located in houston  new york and los angeles 
the primary functions of the market support centers are to help facilitate the execution of corporate strategies  coordinate communication between the field and corporate offices and serve as liaisons for implementation of policies and procedures 
the death care industry in north america is characterized by a large number of locally owned  independent operations 
in order to be successful  we believe our funeral service locations and cemeteries must maintain good reputations and high professional standards in the industry  as well as offer attractive products and services at competitive prices 
we believe we have an unparalleled network of funeral service locations and cemeteries that offer high quality products and services at prices that are competitive with local competing funeral homes  cemeteries and retail locations 
we have multiple funeral service locations and cemeteries in a number of metropolitan areas 
within individual metropolitan areas  the funeral service locations and cemeteries operate under various names because most operations were acquired as existing businesses 
some of our international funeral service locations operate under certain brand names specific for a general area or country 
we have branded our funeral operations in north america under the name dignity memorial r 
a national brand name is unique to the death care industry in north america and we believe this gives us a strategic advantage in the industry 
while this branding process is intended to emphasize our seamless national network of funeral service locations and cemeteries  the original names associated with acquired operations  and their inherent goodwill and heritage  will generally remain the same

lewis sons funeral directors is now geo

lewis sons funeral directors  a dignity memorial r provider 
in the death care industry  there has been a growing trend in the number of cremations performed in north america as an alternative to traditional funeral service dispositions 
the west coast of the united states  florida and arizona have the highest concentration of cremation consumers in north america 
cremations usually result in lower revenue and gross profit dollars than traditional funeral services 
in north america during  of all funeral services we performed were cremation cases  compared to performed in we have expanded our cremation memorialization products and services in several north america markets  which has resulted in higher average sales for cremation cases compared to historical levels 
during  we continued to expand our nationally branded cremation service locations called national cremation r service ncs 
at december   ncs operated in eighteen states and canada 
ncs plans to expand its presence in existing states by adding locations where there is a business need 
historically  we focused on the acquisition and consolidation of independent funeral homes and cemeteries in the fragmented death care industry in north america 
during the s  we also expanded our operations through acquisitions in europe  australia  south america and the pacific rim 
at one time  our network consisted of more than  businesses in countries on continents 
during the mid to late s  the acquisition market became extremely competitive resulting in increased prices for acquisitions and substantially reduced returns on invested capital 
in  we significantly reduced the level of acquisition activity and focused on identifying and addressing non strategic or underperforming businesses 
this focus resulted in the divestiture of several north america and international operations 
during and  we completed joint ventures of operations in australia  united kingdom  spain and portugal  and divested of operations in the netherlands  norway  italy and belgium 
in  we sold our equity investment in our operations in australia  spain and portugal 
during the first quarter of  we completed a joint venture of our funeral operations in france 
we expect to sell our minority interest equity investment in the united kingdom in the second quarter of  pending a successful public offering transaction 
we will pursue discussions with various third parties concerning the sale or joint venture of our remaining international operations primarily in south america as we intend to focus our efforts on operating a core business of high quality funeral service locations and cemeteries in north america 
funeral service locations our  funeral service locations provide all professional services relating to funerals  including the use of funeral facilities  motor vehicles  and preparation and embalming services 
funeral service locations sell caskets  coffins  burial vaults  cremation receptacles  flowers  burial garments  and other ancillary products and services 
our funeral service locations generally experience a greater demand for services in the winter months primarily related to higher incidents of deaths from pneumonia and influenza 
in addition to selling products and services to client families at the time of need  we also sell prearranged funeral services in most of our service markets 
funeral prearrangement is a means through which a customer contractually agrees to the terms of a funeral to be performed in the future 
all or a portion of the funds collected from prearranged funeral contracts are placed into trust accounts  pursuant to applicable law 
alternatively  where allowed  customers may choose to purchase a life insurance or annuity policy from third party insurance companies to fund their prearranged funeral 
in certain situations and pursuant to applicable laws  we will post a surety bond as financial assurance for a certain amount of the preneed funeral contract in lieu of placing certain funds in trust accounts 
see the financial assurances section included in financial condition  liquidity and capital resources in item of this form k for further details on our practice of posting such surety bonds 
at december   our deferred prearranged funeral contract revenues amounted to approximately  million of which  million related to north america 
for additional information regarding prearranged funeral activities  see the prearranged funeral and cemetery activities section in financial condition  liquidity and capital resources in item and notes three  four and five to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
cemeteries our cemeteries sell interment rights associated with cemetery property such as mausoleum spaces  lots and lawn crypts  and sell cemetery merchandise such as stone and bronze memorials  burial vaults  caskets and cremation memorialization products 
our cemeteries perform interment services and provide management and maintenance of cemetery grounds 
certain cemeteries operate crematoria and certain cemeteries contain gardens specifically for the purpose of cremation memorialization 
cemetery sales are often made on a preneed basis pursuant to installment contracts providing for monthly payments 
a portion of the proceeds from cemetery contracts is generally required by law to be paid into perpetual care trust funds 
earnings from perpetual care trust funds are used to defray the maintenance costs of cemeteries 
additionally  all or a portion of the proceeds from the sale of preneed cemetery merchandise and services may be required by various state laws to be paid into merchandise and services trusts until the merchandise is delivered or the service is provided 
in certain situations and pursuant to applicable laws  we will post a surety bond as financial assurance for a certain amount of the preneed cemetery contract in lieu of placing certain funds into trust accounts 
see the financial assurances section included in financial condition  liquidity and capital resources in item of this form k for further details on the practice of posting such surety bonds 
at december   our deferred cemetery contract revenue amounted to approximately  million of which  million related to north america 
for additional information regarding cemetery preneed activities  see the prearranged funeral and cemetery activities section in financial condition  liquidity and capital resources in item of this form k and notes three  four and six to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
combined funeral service locations and cemeteries we currently own funeral service cemetery combination locations in which a funeral service location is physically located within or adjoining an sci owned cemetery 
combination locations allow certain facility  personnel and equipment costs to be shared between the funeral service location and cemetery and typically have a higher gross margin than if the funeral and cemetery operations were operated separately 
combination locations also create synergies between funeral and cemetery sales force personnel and give consumers added convenience to purchase both funeral and cemetery products and services at a single location 
employees at december   we employed   in north america individuals on a full time basis and   in north america individuals on a part time basis 
of the full time employees   were employed in the funeral and cemetery operations and were employed in corporate or other overhead activities and services 
all eligible employees in the united states who so elect are covered by sci s group health and life insurance plans 
eligible employees in the united states are participants in retirement plans of sci or various subsidiaries  while international employees are covered by other sci or sci subsidiary defined or government mandated benefit plans 
approximately of our employees in north america are represented by unions 
although labor disputes are experienced from time to time  relations with employees are generally considered favorable 
regulation our operations are subject to regulations  supervision and licensing under numerous foreign  federal  state and local laws  ordinances and regulations  including extensive regulations concerning trust funds  preneed sales of funeral and cemetery products and services and various other aspects of our business 
we comply in all material respects with the provisions of such laws  ordinances and regulations 
since  we have operated in the united states under the federal trade commission ftc comprehensive trade regulation rule for the funeral industry 
the rule contains requirements for funeral industry practices  including extensive price and other affirmative disclosures and imposes mandatory itemization of funeral goods and services 
from time to time in connection with our former strategy of growth through acquisitions  we entered into consent orders with the ftc that required us to dispose of certain operations in order to proceed with such acquisitions  or limited our ability to make acquisitions in specified areas 
the trade regulation rule and the various consent orders have not had a material adverse effect on our operations 
as previously mentioned  we sold our funeral operations in france to a joint venture in march the french funeral services industry has undergone significant regulatory change in recent years 
historically  the french funeral services industry had been controlled  as provided by national legislation  either i directly by municipalities through municipality operated funeral establishments municipal monopoly  or ii indirectly by the remaining municipalities that have contracted for funeral service activities with third party providers  such as our french funeral operations exclusive municipal authority 
legislation was passed that has generally ended municipal control of the french funeral service business and has allowed free competition among funeral service providers 
under such legislation  the exclusive municipal authority was abolished in january  and the municipal monopoly was eliminated in january cemeteries in france are currently controlled by municipalities and religious organizations 
we previously sold cemetery merchandise such as markers and monuments to consumers for use in these cemeteries 
item properties 
our corporate headquarters are located at allen parkway  houston  texas a wholly owned subsidiary of sci owns an undivided one half interest in the building and parking garage 
the other undivided one half interest is owned by an unrelated third party 
we plan to acquire the other one half interest in the building at the end of the lease in july for million 
the property consists of approximately  square feet of office space and  square feet of parking space 
we lease all of the office space in the building for thousand per month and pay all operating expenses 
one half of the rent is paid to the wholly owned subsidiary and the other half is paid to the owners of the remaining undivided one half interest 
we own and utilize two additional buildings located in houston  texas for corporate activities containing a total of approximately  square feet of office space 
at december   we owned approximately of the real estate and buildings used by our  funeral service locations  cemeteries and crematoria  and of such facilities are leased 
in addition  we leased two aircraft pursuant to cancelable operating leases 
at december   we operated  vehicles  of which were owned and were leased 
for additional information regarding leases  see the contractual  commercial and contingent commitments section in financial condition  liquidity and capital resources in item and note twelve to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
at december   our cemeteries contained a total of approximately  acres  of which approximately was developed

dollars in millions  except average sales prices and per share data restatement of historical financial statements we restated our previously issued financial statements for the fiscal years ended december   and  the interim quarters of  and  and the first three quarters of  primarily related to adjustments to deferred preneed cemetery contract revenues 
all applicable amounts relating to these restatements have been reflected in the consolidated financial statements and notes to the consolidated financial statements 
effective january   we adopted the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab  and recorded a liability for deferred preneed cemetery contract revenues of approximately billion 
this deferred revenue represented presold cemetery merchandise and services that had not been delivered or had not been performed 
as a result of the adoption of sab  we significantly changed our accounting procedures and controls to comply with the new revenue recognition accounting policies under sab beginning in the latter part of and continuing through and  we improved our procedures and controls for reporting the delivery of cemetery merchandise and performance of services 
these improvements identified approximately million of preneed cemetery contract items that had been delivered or performed  but for which no revenues had been recognized 
previously  we recorded revenues associated with these preneed cemetery contract items as changes in estimates in the period identified in our accounting system 
the amounts per quarter  where material  have been previously disclosed as changes in estimates under our previous interpretation of the accounting rules in our annual reports on form k for the years and these amounts  where material  were also disclosed in our earnings press releases and quarterly reports on form q 
we have now determined to report the recognition of revenues for these items in the periods in which the cemetery merchandise and services were delivered or performed 
additionally  we also concluded that previously reported deferred revenues included approximately million of items for which delivery or performance occurred  but revenue recognition had not occurred 
therefore  the restatement includes adjustments related to these two items affecting the cumulative effect of the adoption of sab  revenues and deferred revenues from through to report cemetery merchandise and service revenues in the period these items were delivered or performed 
we have also reviewed our accounting policy for amortizing prearranged funeral deferred selling costs and have changed the methodology for amortizing these costs from a straight line basis to a method more in proportion to when the associated revenues are recognized 
we have included this change in amortization in our restated results

overview service corporation international sci  headquartered in houston  texas  is the world s largest funeral and cemetery company 
at december   we operated  funeral service locations  cemeteries  and crematoria in eight countries 
north america operations represented of funeral service locations  of cemeteries and of crematoria owned at december   and approximately of consolidated revenues and of consolidated gross profits 
north america operations to meet the needs of different markets  the funeral and cemetery operations in north america are organized into major markets and middle markets 
each market is led by a market director with responsibility for both funeral and cemetery operations as well as preneed sales in their particular market 
within each market  the businesses realize efficiencies by sharing common resources such as personnel  preparation services  and vehicles 
to assist market directors with financial and administrative needs as well as human resource issues  there are three market support centers in north america 
these support centers  commonly referred to as hubs are located in houston  new york and los angeles 
the market support centers help to facilitate the execution of corporate strategies  coordinate the communication between corporate office and the field  and act as liaisons for implementation of policies and procedures 
international operations on march   we sold our funeral operations in france and then purchased a equity interest in the acquiring company 
we also have a minority interest equity investment in the united kingdom 
remaining international operations outside of north america consist of funeral businesses in singapore and primarily cemetery businesses in argentina  chile and uruguay 
it is our intention to exit these remaining international businesses when market values and economic conditions are conducive to a sale or joint venture 
at this time  we believe our focus is best spent in north america where significant opportunities for growth exist 
strengths and challenges sci is the dominant industry leader in north america 
while there are three other publicly traded companies that operate in our industry  we have more physical locations and serve more consumers than the rest of the public peer group combined 
with that said  the industry remains highly fragmented with these three public companies and sci combined representing approximately of the total industry  and the other of the industry is represented by independent funeral and cemetery operators 
in  we launched the first national branding strategy in the funeral service industry in north america under the name dignity memorial r 
while this branding process is intended to emphasize our seamless national network of funeral service locations and cemeteries  the original names associated with acquired locations generally remain the same 
for example  geo 
h 
lewis sons funeral directors is now geo 
h 
lewis sons funeral directors  a dignity memorial r provider 
we believe sci is the only company in our industry to successfully implement a national brand 
we believe that a national brand gives us a competitive advantage and is discussed further in our strategies for growth described below 
our core business can be characterized as stable  reflective of favorable demographics and relatively predictable revenue and cash flow streams that are further enhanced by more than  million of deferred revenues associated with north america preneed funeral and cemetery sales 
this backlog of future revenues is primarily supported by investments in trust funds or third party insurance companies 
we and others in the industry face certain challenges in growing revenues 
the primary external factors impacting revenue growth are a lack of near term growth in the number of deaths and an increasing trend toward cremation 
although the united states census bureau projects that the numbers of deaths will grow between and annually through  modern advances in medicine and healthier lifestyles could reduce the numbers of deaths during this time 
our comparable same store funeral services performed declined in which we believe is consistent with  or in certain instances less than  the declines experienced by other companies in the funeral service and casket manufacturing industries as well as mortality data reported by the centers for disease control and prevention cdc 
preliminary mortality statistics reported by the cdc reflect a decline in the number of deaths in the united states of more than in versus in north america  social trends  religious changes  environmental issues and cultural preferences are driving an increasing preference for cremation 
sci is the largest provider of cremation services in north america where approximately of the total funeral services we perform are cremation services as compared to the national average of approximately 
our cremation mix is greater due to the high concentration of properties we own along the west coast of the united states  florida  and arizona where cremation rates exceed 
the rate of cremation in north america has been increasing approximately to basis points each year and we expect this trend to continue in the near term 
a cremation service historically has generated less revenues and gross profit dollars than a traditional funeral service 
additionally  the cremation consumer may choose not to purchase cemetery property or merchandise 
we believe we are well positioned to address this growing trend and have experienced initial success through the use of contemporary marketing strategies and unique product and service offerings that specifically appeal to cremation consumers 
see further information regarding initiatives to address cremation as part of our overall revenue growth strategy described below 
the path to growth with the significant progress made in reducing debt and increasing cash flow since  we believe our current capital structure affords us improved financial flexibility 
our primary focus has shifted to initiatives that will grow revenues and earnings 
in the near term  we believe that cost reduction efforts will be the main means to improving earnings 
we believe strategies centered on our national brand  dignity memorial r  and other revenue growth initiatives will provide the framework that will drive sustainable growth over the longer term 
improving the infrastructure we have historically had an infrastructure that did not fully realize the inherent efficiencies in our large organization 
as a result  we did not fully capitalize on the benefits of standardization  technology  process improvement and outsourcing programs 
some of the key actions taken to improve the infrastructure while reducing costs include redesigning our sales organization  improving business and financial processes  implementing new information systems  and changing the management structure 
in late and early  we made significant changes to the structure and processes of the sales organization 
these changes included eliminating certain lead generation programs  incentive travel programs and other inefficient sales activities and shifting to a sales model based on personal referrals and standardized professional certification  redesigning sales management compensation programs to profit based measures from revenue based measures and reducing sales management positions 
we are also in the final stages of shifting to a compensation model for sales counselors that is variable and directly related to the production of new business 
historically  sales counselors compensation was based solely on commissions 
these changes made to the sales organization were a significant driver of improved cemetery margins in in  we began to focus on improving business and financial processes and systems that support our north america funeral and cemetery operations 
the information systems used by us in the field were proprietary systems developed by us internally 
there were three separate systems funeral  cemetery and trust administration and the systems operated independent of each other 
these systems were costly to maintain 
in  we began to implement a new information system in the field that would replace the three separate contract entry systems and integrate these functions into one system 
in addition  process improvement reviews resulted in our decision to outsource certain accounting functions  including accounts payable and payroll  and to change outsourcers for trust administration 
having simplified our sales approach and redesigned our financial  technical and administrative infrastructure  we were able to make significant changes to the field management structure in late the old management structure consisted of multiple layers and two organizations sales and operations 
the new management structure is based on a major market and middle market concept with the understanding that our markets and businesses are not all the same and can benefit from different management approaches 
we eliminated the dual management organizations and now have one person responsible for each market who has the ability to lead in a multi segment environment  who is focused on growing our business and who is committed to the dignity memorial r standards and brand 
this single line management structure is expected to increase accountability and execution  improve communication and reduce overhead costs 
to assist market directors with financial and administrative needs as well as human resource issues  there are three market support centers  commonly referred to as hubs 
the market support centers help facilitate the execution of corporate strategies  coordinate the communication between the corporate office and our operating locations  and act as liaisons for implementation of policies and procedures  including monitoring and enhancing our internal control policies and procedures 
building the brand sci has implemented the first national brand in the funeral service industry called dignity memorial r 
internally  we are focused on ensuring that we have consistency in service standards and processes across our network of businesses 
we want every customer interaction to be the standard dignity interaction  which is based upon values of integrity  respect  enduring relationships and service excellence 
all of our employees who interact with consumers must complete a dignity certification process 
additionally  we are developing a comprehensive training program under the name dignity university that incorporates required specific curriculum for each job type within sci using a combination of traditional classroom  web based courses  virtual classroom and on the job training for the more than  individuals that we employ in north america 
externally  we continue to enhance signage and local advertising efforts using the dignity r name and logo 
through our national brand we are the sponsor of several nationally recognized community programs including dignity memorial escape school r www 
escapeschool 
com  which provides parents and their children with critical abduction prevention and escape techniques  dignity memorial smart and safe seniors r www 
smartandsafe 
com  which educates seniors about consumer fraud  cons and scams  home break ins  travel safety and other topics  and the vietnam wall experience www 
vietnamwallexperience 
com  which is a traveling  three quarter scale replica of the vietnam veterans memorial in washington  dc we are also currently testing new television  radio and print advertising  which if successful  will be launched on a national basis 
this new media advertising focuses on the unique products and services exclusive to dignity memorial r providers 
it is our belief that today s funeral consumers preferences are changing 
the focus in this industry historically has been on selling caskets  flowers and interment rights 
based on our market studies  we believe customers are less interested in buying products and more interested in creating a meaningful experience and receiving professional help to deal with the aspects of what occurs when a loved one dies 
through our dignity r brand we are developing more contemporary and comprehensive products and services that we believe will help the consumer through the entire experience 
some of the exclusive items offered through dignity providers include grief counseling services through a hour compassion helpline  legal services membership  internet memorial archive capabilities through making everlasting memories www 
mem 
com and the aftercare r planner a comprehensive organizing system that helps families manage the many business details that arise after a death occurs 
dignity benefits also include the bereavement travel program  a unique feature through which customers can obtain special rates on airfare  car rentals and hotel accommodations for family and friends who must travel from out of town to attend memorial services 
depending on the number of visitors and the cities from which their travel originates  the cumulative savings in connection with one funeral can be in the hundreds even thousands of dollars 
importantly  these products and services appeal to both burial and cremation consumers 
we are also focusing on programs that offer consumers new ways to personalize funeral services and create meaning in the experience 
growing our revenues as described earlier  we believe improvements in our cost structure will drive near term earnings growth  however  we realize to achieve sustainable long term growth that we must grow our revenues 
we believe we can be successful in this regard by developing the dignity brand  listening to our consumers and developing an approach that takes our company to new levels 
enhancing sales opportunities we believe we can grow core revenues by utilizing technology and contemporary marketing strategies to enhance our sales opportunities and strengthen the competitive advantage of our national brand  dignity memorial r 
in this regard  particular focus is being placed on selling dignity memorial r packaged funeral and cremation plans  developing product differentiation within our cemeteries  and enhancing our cremation strategies 
our national brand name  dignity memorial r  also represents a unique set of packaged funeral and cremation plans offered exclusively through our network on an atneed and preneed basis 
these packages are designed to simplify customer decision making and include the unique value added products and services described earlier which have traditionally been unavailable through funeral service locations 
our customer satisfaction index  as measured by independent surveys completed by consumers three weeks following a funeral  continues to reach record levels which we believe is largely attributable to the value and savings consumers receive when they select a dignity package 
when dignity packages are sold  it results in significant incremental revenue and gross profit margin per funeral service compared to non dignity sales due to the comprehensive product and service offerings they provide 
on a burial funeral  dignity packaged sales generate on average approximately  more than non dignity sales 
on a cremation service  dignity packaged sales generate approximately  more than non dignity sales 
in  approximately of the total funeral consumers we served selected a dignity package 
on a preneed basis  approximately of funeral prearrangement contracts sold were dignity plans 
a key initiative to help drive increases in the selection rate of dignity packaged plans is through improved merchandising techniques 
in a limited number of test locations  modifications are being made to casket selection rooms that will place less emphasis on traditional funeral merchandise and more focus on the comprehensive product and service offerings unique to dignity memorial providers 
these new displays and other presentation models also offer a special emphasis on personalization options 
we will continue to enhance and make modifications to these new displays in the test locations in early as we finalize a model of what works best  these new modifications will be launched nationally in late and we are also beginning to use more contemporary marketing strategies within our cemetery segment 
initiatives are underway to employ a tiered product strategy that emphasizes a wide range of product offerings versus only grave spaces 
special emphasis is being placed on the development of high end cemetery property projects such as private family estates 
as of december   this tiered product strategy had been implemented in less than of the more than cemeteries that we own and we believe this initiative will be a key driver of cemetery revenue growth in and to grow core revenues and profits  we believe we must address the growing trend toward cremation 
we believe a successful cremation strategy is built on product differentiation  personalization and simplicity 
the sale of dignity memorial r cremation plans can have a meaningful impact in the near term as these sales on average result in more than  of incremental revenue per service to us compared to non dignity cremation sales 
we are also developing new displays to be used in the arrangement process that clearly explain the products and services available to cremation consumers 
within the cemetery segment  we are promoting cremation gardens  which are separate sections located within certain of our cemeteries where cremated remains can be permanently placed and that contain other unique memorialization products 
we continue to develop and expand our national brand  national cremation r  which targets the direct cremation consumer 
and finally  comprehensive training programs are being developed to support and drive these key initiatives  as well as to focus on creating a personal and meaningful experience for the cremation consumer 
increasing market share we believe that sci has unique opportunities to grow market share due to its size and geographic diversity 
we believe that a national brand will provide us access to new customers over the long term due to an increasingly mobile society in north america 
we think consumers today are less likely to know a funeral director personally or live in the same area as past generations who may have used funeral home services before 
a favorable experience with dignity memorial r through one of our community outreach programs  attending a funeral service at a dignity location  or through previous use of a dignity provider may influence a consumer to choose one of our funeral homes 
our centralized marketing effort will utilize information from our broad customer databases to determine geographic  demographic and lifestyle information about our consumers in order to promote awareness of the dignity memorial r brand name  our local names  and our provider network in the most efficient and effective manner 
in addition  we will continue to capitalize on our nationwide network of providers to develop affinity relationships with large groups of individuals to whom we could market our products and services including employers  social organizations and insurance companies 
our most strategic affinity partnership today is with the veterans of foreign wars and ladies auxiliary whose membership exceeds two million 
over the longer term  we believe these types of groups can be key influencers in the funeral home selection process 
in addition to reducing costs  our new management structure is intended to have our strongest business leaders driving results in each of our markets 
under the new structure  many of the administrative and financial functions are now handled by support centers and the geographical scope of responsibility and accountability for business leaders has been narrowed 
we believe this allows our market leaders to have a greater focus on developing people  growing market share and improving profitability in their respective markets 
in addition  we continue to use market action plans as a measurement tool to drive accountability and improved results 
market leaders identify the strengths  weaknesses  opportunities and threats of their local area and develop supporting action plans in response that include measurable objectives  necessary resources and a timetable for completion 
we are also targeting expansion through acquisition or construction in the top markets in north america where probable investment returns will exceed our cost of capital 
we will focus future growth capital deployment in the major metropolitan markets where there are large population bases and where multiple businesses are more conducive to clustering and contemporary marketing strategies and it is easier to attract quality management 
over the longer term  the potential for a franchise opportunity exists for further expansion in the smaller markets 
in a franchise relationship we could recruit independent funeral providers to join the dignity memorial r network and earn fees for a comprehensive range of services that we could provide to the franchisee all at very little or no capital cost to us 
outlook for fiscal our outlook for demonstrates continued strength in cash flows and further improvements to the capital structure 
we expect growth in operating margins in largely as a result of infrastructure improvements and cost reduction programs that began in as discussed earlier in this section  initiatives centered on our dignity memorial r brand are being further developed to increase revenues and profits while addressing the consumers increasing preference for value added products and services that assist them through the entire experience when a death occurs 
in  we anticipate increases in the selection rate of dignity memorial packaged funeral and cremation plans 
we are continuing to focus on the development of strategic high end cemetery inventory and implementation of a tiered product approach and standard pricing model in each of our cemeteries 
the outlook below provides ranges for certain operating measures on the income statement that could be used to calculate a broad range of expected diluted earnings per share  however  we believe it is more appropriate to use the range of expected diluted earnings per share provided because of the uncertainty of developments described below

the following commentary describes our assumptions  estimates and beliefs supporting our outlook operating measures o comparable financial information as used in our outlook is intended to be reflective of same store results and excludes the effects of acquisition or construction as well as divestitures or joint ventures 
o the outlook for north america comparable funeral revenues assumes the number of funeral services performed will be flat to slightly down with an increase in cremation services performed offset by a to increase in the overall average revenue per funeral service compared to levels 
o north america comparable cemetery revenues are expected to be lower than levels due to a decline in cemetery construction revenues to more normalized levels 
revenues associated with cemetery property development projects in were approximately million 
normalized levels of construction revenues in are expected to be to million 
offsetting this decline in revenues are anticipated increases in preneed sales as our sales structure becomes more stabilized following the significant changes that occurred in late and o north america funeral and cemetery gross margin percentages are expected to improve in compared to primarily due to the recent business process and operating management structure changes and expected reductions in pension plan expenses 
o general and administrative expenses in were million and included million of net costs associated with various litigation related matters

for  we are estimating general and administrative expenses to be to million excluding the possibility of the recognition of costs associated with settlements of litigation or receivables for insurance recoveries 
reductions in system costs will be somewhat offset by increased expenses associated with sarbanes oxley compliance and compensation programs 
o interest expense is expected to decrease to million in compared to as a result of retiring debt that is scheduled to mature in interest expense expected in of to million includes approximately million associated with amortization of deferred loan costs 
the outlook for interest expense does not take into consideration any additional debt reduction that could occur with proceeds from asset sales or joint ventures or from cash flows from operating activities 
o the consolidated effective tax rate is expected to be to in compared to in these unusually low rates are attributable to tax benefits received from certain international transactions

cash flows from operating activities in are expected to be to million 
this amount includes our ownership of france through march   and excludes the million payment related to the proposed settlement of certain florida litigation and any possible payments that could be made associated with other litigation matters 
it also excludes any receipts from insurance recoveries related to litigation matters and the cash contribution to our frozen pension plan as discussed below 
anticipated improvements in north america funeral and cemetery margins and reduced interest expense are expected to offset the loss of cash flows from operating activities in due to the joint venture of france  the discontinued use of surety bonding in florida as discussed below 
o excluded from our outlook for cash flows from operating activities are payments made related to litigation matters 
in february  we paid million into escrow to settle certain litigation matters in florida 
we expect this payment to be partially offset by the receipt of million in recoveries under the first layer of our insurance coverage in o on march   we completed the joint venture of our funeral operations in france 
in  cash flows from operating activities were approximately million associated with these businesses in france 
o in the first quarter of  we made a voluntary cash contribution of million to our frozen pension plan to increase the fair value of the plan assets 
this contribution is excluded from our outlook for cash flows from operating activities 
o in february  we discontinued the use of surety bonding as a means to provide financial assurance to customers for the prospective sale of preneed contracts in florida 
beginning with contracts written in early  we have elected to deposit customer receipts from the sale of preneed contracts into trust funds in accordance with state requirements 
as a result of this change  our cash flows from operating activities will decline by to million  net of prospective trust receipts  in over levels 
in subsequent periods  the impact to cash flows is expected to be immaterial 
not included in the outlook for are other potential changes regarding the use of surety bonding 
we are currently evaluating our surety bonding program and may elect to discontinue the use of bonding in other states or cancel certain outstanding bonds and replace with funds in trusts in accordance with state regulations 
o payments on restructuring charges are expected to increase by approximately million in compared to primarily due to severance costs associated with the reorganization of our operating management structure in the fourth quarter of o similar to  we do not expect to pay us federal income taxes in due to significant tax loss carry forwards 
because of these tax loss carry forwards  we believe we will not pay cash taxes until in  we expect to pay approximately million for various state and canadian province taxes

this includes approximately million related to our partial year ownership of france in growth oriented capital spending in north america is expected to increase due to investments in new funeral service facilities  dignity r product displays in our funeral homes  and in developing strategic high end cemetery property inventory 
o depreciation and amortization expense is expected to decline in compared to primarily due to the elimination of accelerated systems amortization costs and a reduction in cemetery deferred selling amortization costs due to expected lower levels of preneed revenues in critical accounting policies  new accounting pronouncements and accounting changes our consolidated financial statements are impacted by the accounting policies used and the estimates and assumptions made by management during their preparation 
the following is a discussion of our critical accounting policies pertaining to revenue recognition  the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  and the use of estimates 
revenue recognition funeral revenue is recognized when funeral services are performed 
our trade receivables primarily consist of amounts due for funeral services already performed 
we sell price guaranteed prearranged funeral contracts through various programs providing for future funeral services at prices prevailing when the agreements are signed 
revenues associated with sales of prearranged funeral contracts  which include accumulated trust earnings and increasing insurance benefits  are deferred until such time that the funeral services are performed see notes three and five to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
revenue associated with cemetery merchandise and services is recognized when the service is performed or merchandise is delivered 
revenue associated with preneed cemetery property interment rights is recognized in accordance with the retail land sales provision of sfas no 
 accounting for the sales of real estate sfas 
under sfas  revenue from constructed cemetery property is not recognized until a minimum percentage of the sales price has been collected 
revenue related to the preneed sale of unconstructed cemetery property is deferred until it is constructed and of the sales price is collected 
revenue associated with sales of preneed merchandise and services is not recognized until the merchandise is delivered or the services are performed see notes three and six to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
impairment or disposal of long lived assets we review our goodwill annually for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  by assessing the fair values of each of our reporting units compared to our reported carrying amounts 
we determine the fair value of the reporting units based on several valuation methodologies discounted future cash flows and multiples of revenue in order to assess impairment 
if the fair value is less than our carrying amounts  the deficiency is charged to expense 
we review our deferred selling costs for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises sfas 
we incur deferred selling costs associated with our deferred revenue from prearranged funeral contracts which will be funded by trusts and preneed cemetery contracts 
when circumstances indicate our deferred selling costs are not recoverable compared to the associated portfolio of deferred revenue  the deficiency is charged to expense 
we review our remaining long lived assets for impairment when changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
sfas requires that long lived assets to be held and used be reported at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value 
assets to be disposed of and assets not expected to provide any future service potential to us are recorded at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less estimated cost to sell 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the carrying values of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date 
actual results could differ from such estimates due to uncertainties associated with the methods and assumptions underlying our critical accounting measurements 
key estimates used by management  among others  include allowances we provide various allowances and or cancellation reserves for our funeral and cemetery preneed and atneed receivables  our prearranged funeral and preneed cemetery deferred revenues  as well as for our funeral and cemetery deferred selling costs 
these allowances are based on an analysis of historical trends and include  where applicable  collection and cancellation activity 
these estimates are impacted by a number of factors  including changes in economy  relocation  and demographic or competitive changes in our areas of operation 
depreciation of long lived assets we depreciate our long lived assets over their estimated useful lives 
these estimates of useful lives may be affected by such factors as changing market conditions or changes in regulatory requirements 
in  we changed the estimated useful life of our existing information technology systems as a result of the decision to implement a new north america point of sale system and an upgraded general ledger system 
we recognized approximately and million of additional amortization expense related to this change in estimate in and  respectively 
amortization of deferred selling costs deferred selling costs  which relate to our deferred revenues associated with prearranged funeral contracts which will be funded by trusts and preneed cemetery contracts  are expensed in proportion to the applicable revenue when recognized in the consolidated statement of operations 
taxes our ability to realize the benefit of deferred tax assets requires us to achieve certain future earnings levels 
we have established a valuation allowance against a portion of deferred tax assets and could be required to further adjust that valuation allowance if market conditions change materially and future earnings are  or are projected to be  significantly different from its current estimates 
we intend to permanently reinvest the unremitted earnings of certain of our foreign subsidiaries in those businesses outside the united states and  therefore  have not provided for deferred federal income taxes on such unremitted foreign earnings 
pension cost our pension costs and liabilities are actuarially determined based on certain assumptions  including expected long term rates of return on plan assets and the discount rate used to compute future benefit obligations 
it is our policy to use a discount rate comparable to rates of return on high quality fixed income investments available and expected to be available during the period to maturity of the company s pension benefits 
in and in prior years  actuarial gains and losses resulting from changes in the assumptions  or experience differences from those assumptions  are amortized over the remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits under the plans 
since  we have used a assumed rate of return on plan assets as a result of a high allocation of equity securities within the plan assets 
at december   of the plan assets were equity securities with the remaining of plan assets being represented by fixed income securities 
as of december   the equity securities were invested approximately in us large cap investments  in international equities  in us small cap investments and in the company s stock 
our actuaries estimate the expected performance over a ten year period of each class of security 
the rate of return on plan assets was determined by allocating these expected long term returns to the different components of the assets 
pursuant to the previously mentioned million infusion of funds into the plan in early  we expect to rebalance the plan assets to have a lower percentage invested in traditional equity securities and fixed income securities and instead incorporate investments in hedge funds 
we believe that this reallocation will reduce the volatility with limited reduction of returns 
furthermore  we are changing our method of accounting for gains and losses on pension assets and obligations in to recognize such gains and losses during the year in which they occur 
in addition to the change in our investment strategy described above  we expect to record net pension expense reflecting estimated returns on plan assets and obligations for our interim financial statements 
under the new accounting policy  upon completion of our annual remeasurement during the fourth quarter  we will recognize actual gains and losses on plan assets and obligations 
therefore  pension expense during the fourth quarter could be different than amounts recorded in interim periods 
additionally  the rate of return on pension plan assets could be lower in due to the accounting change to immediately recognize gains and losses and due to the reallocation of plan assets as discussed above 
see accounting changes and note four to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k for details of this accounting change 
insurance loss reserves we purchase comprehensive general liability  morticians and cemetery professional liability  automobile liability and workers compensation insurance coverages structured with high deductibles 
this high deductible insurance program results in the company being primarily self insured for claims and associated costs and losses covered by these policies 
historical insurance industry experience indicates a high degree of inherent variability in assessing the ultimate amount of losses associated with casualty insurance claims 
this is especially true with respect to liability and workers compensation exposures due to the extended period of time that transpires between when the claim might occur and the full settlement of such claim  often many years 
we continually evaluate loss estimates associated with claims and losses related to these insurance coverages and falling within the deductible of each coverage through the use of qualified and independent actuaries 
a variety of actuarial methodologies are applied to the underlying loss data by the actuary in arriving at an estimate of the reasonably possible loss range 
assumptions based on factors such as claim settlement patterns  claim development trends  claim frequency and severity patterns  inflationary trends and data reasonableness will generally effect the analysis and determination of the best estimate of the projected ultimate claim losses 
the results of these actuarial evaluations are used to both analyze and adjust our insurance loss reserves 
new accounting pronouncements in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin arb no 

this interpretation clarifies the application of arb  consolidated financial statements  to certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity and risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
in december  the fasb revised fasb interpretation no 
fin r which allows companies with certain types of variable interest entities to defer implementation until march  we are currently in discussions with the staff of the securities and exchange commission related to our implementation of fin r 
the discussion relates to i the consolidation under fin r of our prearranged funeral and preneed cemetery merchandise and service trusts  ii the potential consolidation of our cemetery perpetual care trust funds  and iii the policies of recognition of the associated investment earnings of the trust funds 
we believe  at this time  that we will consolidate the prearranged funeral and preneed cemetery merchandise and service trust funds upon implementation of fin r 
upon consolidation  the large majority of the trust assets will be recorded at fair value 
we are unclear at this time whether we will consolidate the cemetery perpetual care trust funds upon implementation of fin r 
currently  the perpetual care trust funds are not recognized on our consolidated balance sheet 
if the cemetery perpetual care trust funds are consolidated  we believe we will recognize an asset and a corresponding liability in our consolidated balance sheet of approximately million 
the large majority of the assets of cemetery perpetual care trust funds will be recorded at fair value 
currently  we defer investment earnings associated with prearranged funeral and preneed cemetery merchandise and service trust funds until the corresponding merchandise is delivered or the service is performed 
it is unclear at this time whether this revenue recognition policy will continue upon implementation of fin r  or if we will have to recognize these trust fund earnings in a revised manner  such as at the time the trusts funds themselves earn such investment earnings 
realized investment earnings from cemetery perpetual care trust funds recognized in current cemetery revenues as they are intended to defray cemetery maintenance costs 
we expect to continue recognizing these investment earnings under this new accounting policy 
we believe the consolidation of the prearranged funeral and preneed cemetery merchandise and service trust funds and possibly the cemetery perpetual care trust funds will have an effect on certain components within our consolidated statement of cash flows 
upon such consolidation  proceeds from sales of trust fund investments and disbursements for purchases of trust fund investments will be shown as separate components of cash flows from investing activities 
currently  the cash flows described above are reported within cash flows from operations as they are receivables collected from third parties 
in addition to potentially consolidating our trust funds  we also believe we will consolidate certain cemeteries managed by us upon implementation of fin r 
we expect to recognize a charge of approximately to million  representing the cumulative effect of an accounting change  as a result of consolidating these cemeteries as of march  the results of operations and cash flows of these cemeteries will be included in our consolidated financial statements upon implementation of fin r  although no material impact is anticipated 
we are also discussing our accounting policies for insurance funded prearranged funeral contracts see note five to the consolidated financial statements with the staff of the securities and exchange commission 
the discussion relates to whether amounts recorded in prearranged funeral contracts  net and deferred prearranged funeral contract revenues  net associated with such contracts represent assets and liabilities of the company as defined in statement of financial accounting concepts no 
 elements in financial statements 
if it is concluded that these amounts are not assets and liabilities as defined  we will remove from our consolidated balance sheet  amounts relating to insurance funded prearranged funeral contracts recorded in prearranged funeral contracts  net and deferred prearranged funeral contract revenues  net which  as of december   were approximately billion and billion  respectively 
such a change in accounting would have no impact on our consolidated stockholders equity  results of operations or cash flows 
effective january   we changed the accounting for gains and losses on our pension plan assets and liabilities 
we will recognize such gains and losses in our consolidated statement of operations as such gains and losses are incurred under pension accounting 
prior to january   we amortized the difference between actual and expected investment returns and actuarial gains and losses over seven years except to the extent that settlements with employees required earlier recognition 
we believe the change is preferable as the new method of accounting better reflects the economic nature of our pension plan and recognizes gains and losses on the pension plan assets and liabilities in the year the gains and losses occur 
as a result of this accounting change  we expect to recognize a charge for the cumulative effect of an accounting change of approximately million on a pretax basis as of january  this amount represents accumulated unrecognized net losses related to the pension plan assets and liabilities 
results of operations our results for the fiscal years ended and and the first three quarter of have been restated 
the financial data below reflects the effects of the restatement for all periods affected 
for details relating to this restatement  see notes two and twenty one to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
additionally  we have reclassified certain prior year amounts to conform to the current period financial presentation with no effect on previously reported net income  financial condition or cash flows 
total consolidated revenues were  million in compared to  million in and  million in the growth in revenues in over is largely attributable to increases in our funeral operations in france and driven by positive currency fluctuations 
the decrease in revenues in compared to is primarily the result of the sale of our funeral and cemetery operations in the united kingdom  which previously generated annual revenues of approximately million  and various businesses in north america 
although revenues have declined from levels  gross profits improved to million in compared to million in  which in turn was higher than the gross profit margin was flat at in and and substantially above in largely as a result of successful ongoing cost reduction initiatives 
net income in totaled million compared to net losses in and of million and million  respectively

net income in was negatively impacted by litigation related expenses  net of estimated insurance recoveries  of million 
included in these net litigation expenses was the recognition of a million receivable during the fourth quarter of for expected insurance recoveries under the first layer of our insurance coverage related to the previously announced million proposed settlement of certain florida litigation

detailed comparable operating results for  and results in all periods presented below are representative of comparable results  which excludes operations that were acquired or constructed after january  and divested by prior to december  comparable financial results are meant to be reflective of same store results of operations 
in  we ceased amortization of goodwill as required by sfas  changed the allocation methodology of overhead costs in north america to be based on funeral and cemetery reporting unit revenues  began recognizing revenues associated with delivered caskets previously prearranged on cemetery contracts as part of funeral operations instead of cemetery operations  and ceased depreciation of operating assets held for sale during in  we determined transactions to sell or joint venture certain assets would be delayed until after as a result  we resumed normal depreciation of those assets held in france and chile in the third quarter of in january  we once again ceased depreciation of france operating assets held for sale 
for purposes of the following discussion  we have presented the financial information for on a pro forma basis as if these changes had been implemented as of january  the following is a discussion of results of comparable operations by geographic segment comparable dollars in thousands year ended december  north of of other of of america revenue europe revenue foreign revenue total revenue restated restated revenues funeral     cemetery    gross profit and margin percentage funeral     cemetery    comparable year ended december  north of of other of of america revenue europe revenue foreign revenue total revenue restated restated revenues funeral     cemetery    gross profit and margin percentage funeral     cemetery    comparable pro forma dollars in thousands year ended december  north of of other of of america revenue europe revenue foreign revenue total revenue restated restated revenues funeral     cemetery    gross profit and margin percentage funeral     cemetery    comparable funeral services performed north other america europe foreign total december comparable funeral segment analysis comparable north america funeral revenues in were  million and on the upper end of our guidance range of  million to  million 
comparable north america funeral revenues decreased slightly in over a decline of in the number of funeral services performed and lower levels of general agency revenues associated with the sale of insurance funded prearranged funeral contracts were partially offset by an increase of in the average revenue per funeral service 
we believe the declines in funeral services performed are consistent with  and in certain instances less than  the declines reported by others in the funeral service and casket manufacturing industries 
we also track weekly mortality data published by the centers for disease control cdc 
we believe that the decline in our funeral services performed in is less than the decline in the number of deaths reported by the cdc 
general agency revenues declined in versus due to the anticipated decrease in sales of insurance funded prearranged funeral contracts as a result of the significant changes made to the sales organization 
comparable north america funeral revenues increased in compared to led by a slight increase in comparable funeral services performed and a increase in the average revenue per funeral service 
the average revenue per funeral service increased in over and increased in over the fourth quarter of represents the fourteenth consecutive quarter in which we have increased our average revenue per funeral service 
this consistent growth in average revenue is largely a result of the success of the nationally branded dignity memorial r packaged funeral and cremation plan initiative 
dignity memorial packaged plans are designed to simplify the customer decision making process  provide savings and enhance the value to consumers through unique products and services which have traditionally been unavailable through funeral service locations 
in addition to improving customer satisfaction levels as measured by independent surveys  dignity memorial burial and cremation packaged plans generate significant incremental revenue per funeral service compared to non dignity sales due to the comprehensive product and service offerings they provide 
on a burial funeral  dignity memorial packaged sales generate on average approximately  more than non dignity sales 
on a cremation service  dignity memorial packaged sales generate approximately  more than non dignity sales 
during  approximately of the total funeral consumers served selected a dignity packaged plan compared to approximately in and approximately in on a preneed basis  approximately of funeral prearrangement contracts sold in were dignity plans compared to approximately in and approximately in we achieved increases in average revenue during through despite an increase in cremation services 
in the death care industry  there has been a growing trend in the number of cremations performed in north america as an alternative to traditional funeral service dispositions 
while cremations performed by us in north america typically have higher gross profit margins than traditional funeral services  cremations usually result in lower revenue and gross profit dollars compared to traditional burial funeral services 
of the total comparable funeral services performed in north america during  were cremation services compared to in and in our ability to offer the cremation consumer a broad array of products and services through dignity packaged plans resulted in increases in the average revenue per cremation service in compared to the north america funeral gross margin percentage for the twelve months ended december  was and on the lower end of our targeted range of to 
the north america funeral gross profit and gross margin percentage declined in compared to and primarily due to volume declines experienced by us and others in the industry and increased employee benefit costs and insurance costs 
these increases in employee benefit and insurance costs were somewhat offset by reductions in selling and other overhead costs 
comparable international funeral revenues and gross profits  which predominantly are associated with our businesses in france  increased in compared to and subsequent to december   these businesses were sold in a joint venture transaction on march  and we retained a minority equity interest 
in  france s reported revenues and gross profits were million and million  respectively 
included in results are positive effects of foreign currency translation of million in revenues and million in gross profits compared to excluding favorable currency effects  france s revenues grew and the gross margin percentage improved to compared to 
these improved results were driven by a increase in funeral services performed and a increase in the average revenue per funeral service 
also  results included million of depreciation expense that was not included in under accounting rules once we began to actively pursue a joint venture with respect to these funeral operations 
revenues and gross profits for france also improved in over despite a decline in funeral services 
the effect of foreign currency translations positively benefited revenues by million and gross profits by million 
included in results for is approximately million more of depreciation expense as discussed above 
excluding favorable currency effects and the impact of depreciation expense  france s revenues grew by and gross profits improved by approximately million 
these improved results were due to a increase in the average revenue per funeral and increases in burial monument sales  along with successful cost reduction initiatives 
comparable cemetery segment analysis comparable north america cemetery revenues for the twelve months ended december  were million 
comparable north america cemetery revenues decreased in compared to associated with the anticipated decrease in preneed revenues due to significant changes in the sales organization and lower levels of revenues associated with completed cemetery property development projects 
as a result of redesigning sales compensation programs  eliminating certain lead generation programs  incentive travel programs and other sales activities and shifting to a sales model based on personal referrals  we expected revenues in to be negatively impacted 
we also expected  and realized  higher gross margins as a result of these strategic changes 
comparable north america cemetery revenues increased in compared to as a result of increases in completed cemetery property development projects and increases in the amount of cash receipts and down payments received from preneed property sales 
preneed cemetery property revenues are recognized when development of the property is completed and customer payments are at least of the total contract amount 
the cemetery gross margin percentage for the twelve months ended december  was  which exceeded the gross margin percentage of 
a significant decline in preneed selling costs as described above helped to overcome increased employee benefit and insurance costs and increased maintenance expenses to bring certain cemeteries in line with company standards 
comparable north america cemetery gross profit and margin percentage increased in compared to primarily as a result of increases in completed cemetery property development projects 
international cemetery operations are associated with our businesses in south america 
for the full year  south america generated cemetery revenues and gross profits of million and million  respectively 
included in are positive effects of foreign currency translation of million in revenues and million in gross profits compared to excluding favorable currency effects  south america s cemetery revenues grew and the gross margin percentage improved to from  reflective of improvement in economic conditions in the region 
revenues and gross profits declined in compared to primarily as a result of unfavorable currency effects and a million increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts recorded in general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses in were million compared to million in this increase of million is primarily a result of an increase in litigation expenses of million 
we recognized expenses  net of estimated insurance recoveries  of million in compared to million in these expenses were primarily associated with litigation matters in florida 
excluding these litigation related expenses in and  general and administrative expenses increased million 
decreases in technology and other overhead costs were offset by million of accrued expenses associated with our long term incentive compensation program 
this new plan is based upon our total shareholder return share price appreciation including reinvested dividends during the period to relative to a peer group of companies 
this new compensation plan is expensed currently in contrast to our historical stock option plan in that was not expensed 
amounts accrued in related to this compensation plan are not expected to be paid until and only if earned 
general and administrative expenses increased million in compared to included in is million of expenses associated with litigation related matters and million of accelerated non cash amortization expense related to our decision to implement new information systems that was not included in in  we made the decision to implement new information systems and  therefore  accelerated the existing systems amortization costs which ceased in the third quarter of in addition to general and administrative expenses  there are two other components of overhead costs in north america home office overhead and field overhead 
these overhead costs are allocated to funeral and cemetery operations in north america 
home office and field overhead costs totaled million in compared to million in representing a decline of more than million or 
this decline is primarily attributable to reductions in preneed sales overhead costs as a result of significant changes made to our sales organization in late and early other income and expenses in  we recognized a net pretax gain of million in gains and impairment losses on dispositions  net  primarily related to the sale of certain equity investments during the year 
in december  we sold our equity investment in australia and collected an associated note receivable that generated a gain and net cash proceeds of million 
during the second quarter of  we sold our equity investment in spain for net cash proceeds of million and recognized a gain of million 
these gains helped to offset net losses related to sales of various north america businesses 
in  we recognized a net loss of million primarily related to an impairment charge for several funeral and cemetery operations held for sale in north america 
in  we recognized a net loss of million primarily related to the loss on joint venturing our australian operations  losses from the disposition of operations in the netherlands  norway and belgium and the impairment of certain international operations held for sale 
other operating expenses of million recognized in are largely due to severance costs associated with the reorganization of our operating management structure in the fourth quarter of in november  we moved to a major market and middle market concept with the understanding that our markets and businesses are not all the same and require different management approaches 
we eliminated the dual management organizations of sales and operations and now have one leader responsible for each market that has the ability to lead in a multi segment environment  who is focused on growing our business and who is committed to the dignity memorial r standards and brand 
other operating expenses recognized in of million related to market value adjustments of certain options associated with our notes due  severance costs of former employees  and expenses related to the termination of certain consulting and non compete contractual obligations 
interest expense decreased to million in compared to million and million in and  respectively 
the decrease in interest expense reflects the success we have had in reducing outstanding debt 
other income  net was million in compared to million in and million in other income  net primarily consists of income from various notes receivable and cash investments  gains from early extinguishments of debt  equity earnings of investments in certain companies and cash overrides associated with prearranged funeral sales with third party insurance companies 
other income  net increased in over and primarily associated with increases in interest income and transactional foreign currency exchange gains which helped to offset declines in gains from early extinguishments of debt and lower levels of cash overrides received from third party insurance companies associated with the sale of prearranged funeral contracts 
in the twelve months ended december   we recognized an after tax charge of million as a result of the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
this standard required goodwill to no longer be amortized  but instead tested for impairment annually 
this charge related to impairment of goodwill in our north america cemetery segment 
the effective tax rate was in compared to in the decline in the effective tax rate is due primarily to income tax benefits associated with certain international transactions 
we expect the annual effective tax rate in to be to due to income tax benefits of approximately million related to our joint venture of france which will be realized in the first quarter of financial condition  liquidity and capital resources our primary financial objectives are to continue to improve our financial flexibility by generating strong cash flows  completing remaining asset sales or joint ventures  and further reducing debt 
we have a goal of achieving specific ratings with the credit rating agencies 
at december   our long term debt was rated bb by standard and poor s and b by moody s investors service 
our targeted rating from standard and poor s is bb and from moody s investors service a ba 
our balance sheet continues to improve 
we have made significant progress in reducing debt since december  cash and cash equivalents total debt    net debt total debt less cash    cash and cash equivalents were million at the end of as compared with million at the end of and million at the end of total debt less cash and cash equivalents at december   was  million  representing the lowest levels in our company since total debt has been reduced by million or since december  this reduction since december   is a result of strong cash flows from operating activities including the receipt of tax refunds of approximately million and a successful asset divestiture and joint venture program that produced more than million of net cash proceeds 
cash flow we believe our ability to generate cash from operations to reinvest in our business is one of our fundamental financial strengths 
cash flows from operating activities were million in included payments of million  net of insurance recoveries  to resolve certain litigation matters 
excluding these litigation payments  cash flows from operating activities were million  ahead of our guidance range of to million our target range specifically excluded any potential impact from litigation matters 
also included in our actual and projected amounts and our guidance range was the receipt of a million tax refund 
cash flows from operating activities in were million and included a million tax refund and a million escrow receipt from the sale of our french insurance company 
had we not incurred these net litigation payments or received the tax refunds and escrow receipt  cash flows from operating activities in would have been million compared to million in  representing an increase of million or 
the increase is primarily attributable to reductions in cash interest paid 
we also had improvements in working capital in north america associated with reduced preneed selling costs which helped to offset reduced operating cash flows from our french operations 
our investing activities resulted in a net cash outflow of million in compared to a net cash inflow of million in the change is primarily due to a reduction in proceeds from asset sales and joint ventures  increases in capital expenditures and additional deposits to restricted cash as we decided to replace certain letters of credit with cash collateral 
net cash used in financing activities was million in compared to million in the net cash used in both periods is primarily due to our continued focus on debt reduction 
repayments of long term debt were million in and million in included in was a use of cash of million related to the final settlement of certain options associated with our notes due cash flows from operating activities in are expected to be to million  excluding the million payment related to the proposed settlement of certain florida litigation matters in february and the possibility of payments that could be made associated with other litigation related matters 
it also excludes any receipts from insurance recoveries related to litigation matters and the cash contribution to our frozen pension plan 
anticipated improvements in north america funeral and cemetery margins and reduced interest expense are expected to offset the loss of cash flows from operating activities in as a result of the joint venture of france and the discontinued use of surety bonding in florida prospectively 
capital expenditures for  capital expenditures totaled million compared to million in and million in of the total capital expenditures in  million was associated with our funeral operations in france  which was divested in a joint venture on march  capital spending for items that we believe are necessary to maintain our existing facilities in a condition consistent with company standards and extend their useful lives amounted to million in as compared to million in and million in the increase in capital improvement spending at our existing facilities in was planned as we continue to focus on the quality of our facilities to ensure that they are consistent with standards that we have established related to our national branding strategy and that we are competitive in our respective markets 
capital spending associated with new growth initiatives was million in compared to million in included in these amounts are approximately million in and associated with our operations in france 
these expenditures are intended to grow revenues and profits and are primarily related to the construction of cemetery property inventory and the construction of funeral home facilities on sci owned cemeteries 
total capital expenditures in are expected to be million to million 
of the total projected capital expenditures in  we expect to spend approximately to million on capital improvements to maintain our existing facilities 
growth oriented capital spending in north america is expected to increase due to investments in new funeral home facilities  dignity r product displays in our funeral homes  and in developing strategic high end cemetery property 
liquidity we believe we have sufficient liquidity and that our financial position is sound 
as of december   we had a cash balance of approximately million plus approximately million of availability under a million bank credit facility 
we have no cash borrowings under this credit facility  but we have issued approximately million of letters of credit under the facility 
in february  we paid million into escrow to settle certain litigation matters in florida 
we expect this payment to be partially offset by the receipt of million from recoveries under the first layer of our insurance coverage in on march   we successfully completed a joint venture of our funeral operations in france and received approximately million in net cash proceeds while retaining a minority interest in the acquiring company 
in the first quarter of  we made a voluntary cash contribution of million to our frozen pension plan to increase the fair value of plan assets 
for further details regarding this pension plan  see note fourteen to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
beginning in early  we discontinued the use of surety bonding for the prospective sale of preneed cemetery contracts in the state of florida and have elected to deposit customer receipts from the sale of preneed contracts into trust funds 
as a result of this change  we expect our cash flows from operations to decline by to million in pending a successful public offering transaction  we expect to receive proceeds of approximately to million in the second quarter of associated with the sale of our holdings in stock and notes in operations in the united kingdom 
at december   the maturity schedule for outstanding public notes due in the near and intermediate term was as follows outstanding at december  notes due april notes due december notes due december notes due june based on our cash balance and credit availability  expectations of future cash flows from operating activities and asset sales  and proceeds received from the joint venture of france  we believe that we have adequate means to meet the near and intermediate term debt obligations as well as our operating needs 
contractual  commercial and contingent commitments we have assumed various financial obligations and commitments in the ordinary course of conducting our business 
we have contractual obligations requiring future cash payments under existing contractual arrangements  such as management  consulting and non competition agreements 
we also have commercial and contingent obligations which result in cash payments only if certain contingent events occur requiring our performance pursuant to a funding commitment 
the following table details our known future cash payments on an undiscounted basis related to various contractual obligations as of december payments due by period contractual obligations thereafter total current maturities of long term debt   long term debt     casket purchase agreement    operating lease agreements      contingent purchase obligation   management  consulting and non competition agreements      total contractual obligations      our outstanding indebtedness contains standard provisions  such as payment delinquency default clauses and change of control clauses 
in addition  our bank credit agreement contains a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio 
our outstanding indebtedness includes million principal balance of capital lease obligations of which million was associated with capital leases of our french operations 
for further information see note nine to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
we have executed a purchase agreement with a major casket manufacturer for our north america operations with an original minimum commitment of million  covering a six year period  which will expire in the agreement contains provisions for annual price adjustments and provides for a one year extension to december  in which we are allowed to satisfy any remaining commitment that exists at the end of the original term 
at december   our remaining maximum commitment under the purchase agreement was million 
based on our historical purchases  we expect to exercise our option to extend the terms of the agreement for one year and expect to fulfill our commitment without any economic loss 
the majority of our operating leases contain options to i purchase the property at fair value on the exercise date  ii purchase the property for a value determined at the inception of the leases  or iii renew for the fair rental value at the end of the primary lease term 
our operating leases primarily relate to funeral service locations  automobiles  limousines  hearses  cemetery operating and maintenance equipment and two aircraft 
approximately million of our operating leases are associated with facilities in our france operations 
we have residual value exposures related to certain operating leases of approximately million 
we believe it is unlikely that we will have to make future cash payments related to these residual value exposures 
in connection with certain acquisitions related to our south america operations  we entered into contingent purchase obligations with certain former owners of those businesses  which require us to pay additional consideration in any one year between and  at the option of the former owners  based on the results of operations  as defined 
the additional consideration may be partially paid in common stock at the discretion of the former owners 
presently  we expect the former owners to request the additional consideration in and estimate it to be a million liability  which is recorded in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet 
we have entered into management employment  consulting and non competition agreements which contractually require us to make cash payments over the contractual period 
the agreements have been primarily entered into with certain officers and employees of the company and former owners of businesses acquired 
the contractual obligation amounts pertain to the total commitment outstanding under these agreements and may not be indicative of future expenses to be incurred related to these agreements due to cost rationalization programs completed by the company 
we have not included amounts in this table for payments of pension contributions and payments for various postretirement welfare plans and postemployment benefit plans  as such amounts have not been determined beyond furthermore  we have not presented the amounts associated with these obligations for since we are not required to make any payments to the plans 
still  as previously disclosed  we have voluntarily elected to contribute million to our frozen pension plans in the first quarter of the following table details our known potential or possible future cash payments on an undiscounted basis related to various commercial and contingent obligations as of december  expiration by period commercial and contingent obligations thereafter total surety obligations   letters of credit   representations and warranties     total commercial and contingent obligations     to support our operations  we have engaged certain surety companies to issue surety bonds on behalf of the company for customer financial assurance or as required by state and local regulations 
the surety bonds are primarily obtained to provide assurance for our prearranged funeral and preneed cemetery obligations  which are appropriately presented as liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet as deferred prearranged funeral contract revenues and deferred cemetery contract revenues 
the total outstanding surety bonds at december   were million 
of this amount  million was related to prearranged funeral and preneed cemetery obligations 
when we obtain surety bonds  we are required to obtain of our liability amount to perform the services 
when we deposit funds into state mandated trust funds  however  we are often not required to deposit of the liability amount 
therefore  in the event all of the surety companies canceled or did not renew our outstanding surety bonds  which are generally renewed for twelve month periods  we would be required to either obtain replacement assurance or fund approximately million  as of december   primarily into state mandated trust accounts 
at this time  we do not believe we will be required to fund material future amounts related to these surety bonds 
we are currently evaluating our surety bonding program and may elect to discontinue the use of bonding in other states or cancel certain outstanding bonds and replace with funds in trusts in accordance with state regulations 
we are occasionally required to post letters of credit  issued by a financial institution  to secure certain insurance programs or other obligations 
letters of credit generally authorize the financial institution to make a payment to the beneficiary upon the satisfaction of a certain event or the failure to satisfy an obligation 
the letters of credit are generally posted for year terms and are usually automatically renewed upon maturity until such time as we have satisfied the commitment secured by the letter of credit 
we are obligated to reimburse the issuer only if the beneficiary collects on the letter of credit 
we believe that it is unlikely we will be required to fund a claim under our outstanding letters of credit 
in  the full amount of the letters of credit were supported by our credit facility which expires july in addition to the letters of credit described above  we currently have contingent obligations of million related to our asset sale and joint venture transactions 
we have agreed to guarantee certain representations and warranties associated with such disposition transactions with letters of credit or interest bearing cash investments 
we have interest bearing cash investments of million included in deferred charges and other assets pledged as collateral for certain of these contingent obligations 
we do not believe we will ultimately be required to fund to third parties any claims against these representations and warranties 
subsequent to december   we agreed to certain representations and warranties associated with the disposition of our investment in france 
the undiscounted amount of the representations and warranties associated with the sale is approximately million and includes indemnifications related to taxes and other obligations 
this amount will be recorded in other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet 
prearranged funeral and cemetery activities in addition to selling our products and services to client families at the time of need  we believe an active funeral and cemetery prearrangement program  which complements our framework for long term growth  can increase future market share in our service markets 
prearrangement is a means through which a customer contractually agrees to the terms of a funeral service  cremation service  and or cemetery burial interment right  merchandise or cemetery service to be performed or provided in the future that is  in advance of when needed or preneed 
within our business  we traditionally apply the term prearranged to funeral activities and the term preneed to cemetery activities 
both refer to situations where the customer has made contractual arrangements in advance of when the services or merchandise are needed 
prearranged funeral activities when customers contractually prearrange their funeral services  we record an asset  prearranged funeral contracts  net  and a corresponding liability  deferred prearranged funeral contract revenues  net in our consolidated balance sheet for the contract price 
the funeral revenues are deferred and will not be recognized in the consolidated statement of operations until the funeral services are performed or the merchandise is delivered 
while some customers may pay for their contract in a single payment  most prearranged funerals are sold on an installment basis over a period of one to seven years 
on these installment contracts  we receive on average a down payment at the time of sale of approximately 
historically  the majority of our prearranged funeral trust contracts have not included a finance charge 
because the services or merchandise will not be provided until some time in the future  most states and provinces require that all or a portion of the funds collected from customers on prearranged funeral contracts be protected for the benefit of the customer pursuant to applicable law 
some or all of the funds may be required to be placed into trust accounts  or a surety bond may be posted in lieu of trusting collectively trust funded prearranged funeral contracts 
alternatively  where allowed  customers may choose to purchase a life insurance or annuity policy from third party insurance companies to fund their prearranged funeral insurance funded prearranged funeral contract 
only certain of these customer funding options may be applicable in any given market we serve 
trust funded prearranged funeral contracts where the applicable law requires that all or a portion of the funds collected from prearranged funeral contracts be placed in trust accounts  the funds deposited into trust are invested by the independent trustees in accordance with the investment guidelines established by statute or  where the prudent investor rule is applicable  the guidelines established by our investment committee 
the trustees utilize professional investment advisors to select and monitor the money managers that make the individual investment decisions in accordance with the guidelines 
we retain any funds above the amounts required to be deposited into trust accounts and use them for working capital purposes  generally to offset the selling and administrative costs of the prearrangement programs 
applicable law governs the timing of the required deposits into the trust accounts  which generally ranges from five to days after receipt of the funds from the customer 
the trust investments are expected to generate earnings sufficient to offset the inflationary costs of providing the prearranged funeral services and merchandise in the future for the prices that were guaranteed at the time of sale 
we believe the market value of the prearranged funeral trust investments at december  exceeds the expected cost of meeting our obligations to provide funeral services and merchandise for the unperformed prearranged funeral contracts 
investment earnings on funds placed into trust accounts are generally accumulated and deferred until each prearranged contract is either utilized upon the death of  or canceled by  the customer 
however  in certain states  the trusts are allowed to distribute a portion of the investment earnings to us prior to that date 
until the prearranged contract is utilized or canceled  any investment earnings are attributed to the individual prearranged funeral contract 
these attributed investment earnings whether distributed or undistributed are recognized in our consolidated statement of operations when the merchandise is delivered and the services are performed following the death of the customer or when the contract is canceled and we are entitled to retain these earnings 
recognition of the investment earnings is independent of the timing of the receipt of the related cash flows 
direct selling costs incurred pursuant to the sales of trust funded prearranged funeral contracts are deferred and included in deferred charges and other assets in the consolidated balance sheet 
the deferred selling costs are expensed in proportion to the corresponding trust funded prearranged funeral contract revenues when recognized 
other selling costs associated with the sales and marketing of preneed cemetery contracts eg  lead procurements costs  brochures and marketing materials  advertising and administrative costs are expensed as incurred 
an allowance for cancellation is recorded for trust funded prearranged funeral contract deferred selling costs based on historical contract cancellation experience 
if a customer cancels the trust funded prearranged funeral contract  applicable law determines the amount of the refund owed to the customer  including in certain situations the amount of the attributed investment earnings 
upon cancellation  we receive the amount of principal deposited to trust and previously undistributed net investment earnings and pay the customer the required refund 
we retain any excess funds and recognize the attributed investment earnings net of any investment earnings payable to the customer in our consolidated statement of operations 
in certain jurisdictions  we may be obligated to fund any shortfall if the amounts deposited by the customer exceed the funds in trust 
as a result  when realized or unrealized losses of a trust result in trust funded prearranged funeral contracts being under funded  we will assess those contracts to determine whether a loss provision should be recorded 
we have not been required to recognize any loss amounts 
the cash flow activity over the life of a trust funded prearranged funeral contract from the date of sale to its death maturity or cancellation is captured in the line item net effect of prearranged funeral production and maturities in the consolidated statement of cash flows 
while the contract is outstanding  cash flow is provided by the amount retained from funds collected from the customer and any distributed investment earnings 
this is reduced by the payment of trust funded prearranged funeral deferred selling costs 
the effect of amortizing trust funded prearranged funeral deferred selling costs is reflected in depreciation and amortization in the consolidated statement of cash flows 
at the time of death maturity  we receive the principal and undistributed investment earnings from the trust and any remaining receivable due from the customer 
this cash flow at the time of service is generally less than the revenue recognized  thus creating a negative effect on working capital cash flow from operating activities 
in certain situations pursuant to applicable laws  we can post a surety bond as financial assurance for an amount that would otherwise be required to be deposited in trust accounts for trust funded prearranged funeral contracts 
see the financial assurances section within this financial condition  liquidity and capital resources section for further details on our practice of posting such surety bonds 
we believe the deferred revenues associated with prearranged funeral bonded contracts exceed the expected cost of meeting our obligations to provide funeral services and merchandise for the outstanding prearranged funeral bonded contracts  and our future operating cash flows will be sufficient to fulfill these contracts without use of the surety bonds 
if a customer cancels the trust funded prearranged funeral contract that has been bonded prior to death maturity  applicable law determines the amount of the refund owed to the customer 
because the funds have not been held in trust  there are no earnings to be refunded to the customer or us 
we pay the customer refund out of our operating funds  which reduces working capital cash flow from operating activities 
the cash flow activity over the life of a trust funded prearranged funeral contract that has been bonded from the date of sale to its death maturity or cancellation is captured in the line item net effect of prearranged funeral production and maturities in the consolidated statement of cash flows 
the payments received from our customers for their trust funded prearranged funeral contracts that have been bonded are a source of working capital cash flow from operating activities until the contracts mature 
this is reduced by the payment of deferred selling costs  the premiums to the surety companies for the bond coverage  and refunds on customer cancellations of contracts 
when a trust funded prearranged funeral contract that has been bonded matures upon the death of the beneficiary  there is no additional cash flow to us unless the customer owed an outstanding balance 
insurance funded prearranged funeral contracts where permitted  customers prearrange their funeral contract by purchasing a life insurance or annuity policy from third party insurance companies  for which we earn a commission for being the general agent for the insurance company 
the policy amount of the insurance contract between the customer and the third party insurance company equals the amount of the prearranged funeral contract 
the third party insurance company collects funds related to the insurance contract directly from the customer 
the customer policy holder assigns the policy benefits to our funeral home to pay for the prearranged funeral contract at the time of need 
approximately of our north america prearranged funeral production was insurance funded prearranged funeral contracts 
the life insurance contracts include increasing death benefit provisions  which are expected to offset the inflationary costs of providing the prearranged funeral services and merchandise in the future for the prices that were guaranteed at the time of sale 
the increasing death benefits are accumulated and deferred until the death maturity of each prearranged contract 
we record the increase in the prearranged funeral contracts  net  and the deferred prearranged funeral contract revenues  net  in the consolidated balance sheet based on updates from the insurance company 
we believe the value of the insurance funded prearranged funeral contracts at december  exceeds the expected cost of meeting our obligations to provide funeral services and merchandise for the unperformed contracts 
the commission we earn for being the general agent on behalf of the third party insurance companies is based on a percentage per contract sold 
these general agency ga revenues are recognized when the insurance purchase transaction between the customer and third party insurance provider is completed 
prior to january   we recognized these ga revenues as reductions to selling expenses in the consolidated statement of operations 
in  we began recognizing these amounts as funeral revenues 
we have reclassified the prior year amounts to conform to the current period presentation with no effect on previously reported results of operations  financial condition  or cash flows 
direct selling costs incurred pursuant to the sale of insurance funded prearranged funeral contracts are expensed as incurred 
ga revenues recognized by us totaled approximately million  million and million  and direct selling costs expensed by us totaled approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  in connection with sales of insurance funded prearranged funeral contracts 
additionally  we may receive cash overrides based on achieving certain dollar volume targets of life insurance policies sold as a result of marketing agreements entered into in connection with the sale of our insurance subsidiaries in these overrides are recorded in other income  net  in the consolidated statement of operations 
if a customer cancels the insurance funded prearranged funeral contract prior to death maturity  the insurance company pays the cash surrender value under the insurance policy directly to the customer

if the contract was outstanding for less than one year  the insurance company charges back the ga revenues and overrides we received on the contract 
an allowance for these chargebacks is included in the consolidated balance sheet based on our historical chargeback experience 
the cash flow activity over the life of an insurance funded prearranged funeral contract from the date of sale to its death maturity or cancellation is captured in the consolidated statement of operations within our funeral segment 
the cash flow activity associated with these contracts generally occurs at the time of sale  where the ga revenues received net of the direct selling costs provide a net source of cash flow  and at death maturity  where the insurance proceeds including increasing death benefit less the funds used to provide the funeral goods and services provide a net source of cash flow 
if the cancellation occurs within the one year following the date of sale  our cash flow is reduced by the charge back of ga revenues and overrides

preneed cemetery activities when purchasing cemetery property interment rights  merchandise  and services on a preneed basis  approximately of our consumers choose to pay of the contract at the time of sale 
the remaining customers choose to pay for their contracts on an installment basis generally over a period of one to seven years 
on these installment contracts  we receive an average down payment at the time of sale of approximately 
historically  the installment contracts have included a finance charge ranging from to depending on the date sold  the payment period selected  state laws and the payment method ie  monthly statement billing or automated bank draft 
unlike prearranged funeral contracts  where the entire purchase price is deferred and the revenue is recognized as one event at the time of death maturity  the revenues associated with a preneed cemetery contract can be recognized as different contract events occur 
preneed sales of cemetery interment rights cemetery burial property are recognized when a minimum of of the sales price has been collected and the property has been constructed 
with the customer s direction  which is generally obtained at the time of sale  we can choose to order  store  and transfer title to the customer of their personalized marker merchandise 
upon the earlier of vendor storage of these items or delivery in our cemetery  we recognize the associated revenues and record the cost of sale 
for services  personalized marker merchandise where the customer chooses not to elect vendor storage or early delivery to our cemetery  and non personalized merchandise such as vaults  we defer the revenues until the services are performed and the merchandise is delivered 
because the services or merchandise will not be provided until some time in the future  all or a portion of the proceeds from the sale of preneed cemetery merchandise and services may be required by law to be paid into merchandise and services trusts until the merchandise is delivered or the service is provided 
as with trust funded prearranged funeral contracts  the funds deposited into trust are invested by the independent trustees in accordance with the investment guidelines established by statute or  where the prudent investor rule is applicable  the guidelines as established by our investment committee 
the trustees utilize professional investment advisors to select and monitor the money managers that make the investment decisions in accordance with the guidelines 
we retain any funds above the amounts required to be deposited into trust accounts and use them for working capital purposes  generally to defray the selling costs of obtaining the contracts 
applicable law governs the timing of the required deposits into the trust accounts  which generally ranges from five to days after receipt of the funds from the customer 
in certain situations pursuant to applicable laws  we post a surety bond as financial assurance for a certain amount of the preneed cemetery contract in lieu of placing funds into trust accounts 
see the financial assurances section within this financial condition  liquidity and capital resources section for further details on our practice of posting such surety bonds 
the trust investments are expected to generate earnings sufficient to offset the inflationary costs of providing the preneed cemetery services and merchandise in the future for the prices that were guaranteed at the time of sale 
we believe the current market value of the preneed cemetery trust investments at december  exceeds the expected cost of meeting our obligations to provide the cemetery services and merchandise for the outstanding preneed cemetery contracts 
investment earnings on funds placed into trust accounts are generally accumulated and deferred until the delivery of each preneed contract item 
however  in certain states  the trustees are allowed to distribute a portion of the investment earnings to us before the preneed cemetery service or merchandise item is delivered distributable states 
until delivered  any investment earnings are attributed to the individual contract items 
upon delivery  these attributed investment earnings whether distributed or undistributed are recognized in our consolidated statement of operations along with the revenues associated with the related contract item 
recognition of the net investment earnings is independent of the timing of the receipt of the related cash flows  but generally will be the same in states that are not distributable states 
we are generally required by law to deposit a portion of the proceeds from the sale of cemetery property interment rights burial property into perpetual care trust funds 
earnings  and in some cases realized capital gains  from these perpetual care trust funds are used to defray the maintenance costs of our cemeteries 
direct selling costs incurred pursuant to the sales of preneed cemetery contracts are deferred and included in deferred charges and other assets in the consolidated balance sheet 
the deferred selling costs are expensed in proportion to the corresponding revenues when recognized 
other selling costs associated with the sales and marketing of preneed cemetery contracts eg  lead procurements costs  brochures and marketing materials  advertising and administrative costs are expensed as incurred 
an allowance for cancellation is recorded for cemetery deferred selling costs based on historical contract cancellation experience 
if a preneed cemetery contract is canceled prior to delivery  applicable law determines the amount of the refund owed to the customer  if any  including the amount of the attributed investment earnings 
upon cancellation  we receive the amount of principal deposited to trust and previously undistributed investment earnings and  where required  issue a refund to the customer 
we retain any excess funds and recognize the attributed investment earnings net of any investment earnings payable to the customer in our consolidated statement of operations 
based on our historical experience  we have included an allowance for cancellation for preneed cemetery contracts in preneed cemetery contracts  net  and deferred cemetery contract revenues  net  in our consolidated balance sheet 
as the preneed cemetery contract merchandise and service items for which we were required to deposit funds to trust are delivered and recognized as revenues  we receive the principal and previously undistributed investment earnings from the trust 
there is generally no remaining receivable due from the customer  as our policy is to deliver preneed cemetery merchandise and service items only upon payment of the contract balance in full 
this cash flow at delivery is generally less than the revenue recognized  thus creating a negative effect on working capital cash flow from operating activities  especially if we posted a surety bond in lieu of trusting for the preneed cemetery contract merchandise and service items  as there are no funds in trust available for withdrawal 
the cash flow activity from the date of sale of a preneed cemetery contract origination to the date of the recognition of the deferred revenue upon its delivery or cancellation maturity is reported in the net effect of preneed cemetery production and deliveries line item in the consolidated statement of cash flows 
net effect of preneed cemetery production and deliveries is affected by cash flows provided by the amount retained from funds collected from the customer and distributed trust earnings  reduced by the use of funds for the payment of deferred selling costs when the preneed cemetery contracts are originated 
the amortization of the cemetery deferred selling costs is included in depreciation and amortization in the consolidated statement of cash flows

financial assurances in support of operations  we have entered into arrangements with certain surety companies whereby such companies agree to issue surety bonds on our behalf as financial assurance and or as required by existing state and local regulations 
the surety bonds are used for various business purposes  however  the majority of the surety bonds issued and outstanding have been used to support our prearranged funeral and preneed cemetery sales activities 
the underlying obligations these surety bonds assure are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as deferred prearranged funeral contract revenues  net and deferred preneed cemetery contract revenues  net see notes five and six to the consolidated financial statements in item and prearranged funeral and cemetery activities within financial condition  liquidity and capital resources of this form k for further details regarding our prearranged funeral and preneed cemetery activities 
the breakdown of bonds between funeral and cemetery prearrangements  as well as surety bonds for other activities  is as follows in millions december  prearranged funeral preneed cemetery merchandise and services preconstruction bonds supporting prearranged funeral and cemetery obligations bonds supporting prearranged business permits other bonds total bonds outstanding when selling prearranged funeral contract and preneed cemetery contracts  we intend to post surety bonds where allowed by applicable law  except as noted below for florida 
we post the surety bonds in lieu of trusting a certain amount of funds received from the customer 
the amount of the bond posted is determined by the total amount of the prearranged contract that would otherwise be required to be trusted  in accordance with applicable state law 
during and  we recorded million and million  respectively  in cash receipts attributable to bonded sales 
these amounts do not consider reductions associated with taxes  selling costs or other costs 
surety bond premiums are paid annually and are automatically renewable until maturity of the underlying prearranged contracts  unless we are given prior notice of cancellation 
except for cemetery preconstruction bonds which are irrevocable  the surety companies generally have the right to cancel the surety bonds at any time with appropriate notice 
in the event a surety company was to cancel the surety bond  we are required to obtain replacement assurance from another surety company or fund a trust for an amount generally less than the posted bond amount 
a quantitative detail of this subject is discussed in the contractual  commercial and contingent commitments section included within financial condition  liquidity and capital resources 
we do not believe we will be required to fund any material future amounts related to these surety bonds 
the applicable florida law that allows posting of surety bonds for prearranged contracts expires december   however  it allows for prearranged contracts entered into prior to december  to continue to be bonded for the remaining life of those contracts 
thus  we are required to change from bonding to either trust or insurance funding for new prearranged funeral and cemetery contracts in florida by december  we have elected to change to trust funding as of february  of the total bonding contract proceeds we received from customers for and  approximately million and million  respectively  were attributable to florida contracts

these statements are based on assumptions that we believe are reasonable however  many important factors could cause our actual consolidated results in the future to differ materially from the forward looking statements made herein and in any other documents or oral presentations made by  or on behalf of  the company 
these factors are discussed below 
we assume no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements made herein or any other forward looking statements made by the company  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
our ability to execute our strategic plan depends on many factors  many of which are beyond our control 
our strategic plan is focused on reducing overhead costs  increasing cash flow  asset redeployment  and reducing debt while at the same time developing key revenue initiatives designed to generate future internal growth in our core funeral and cemetery operations without the outlay of significant additional capital 
many of the factors necessary for the execution of our strategic plan are beyond our control 
we cannot give assurance that we will be able to execute any or all of our strategic plan 
failure to execute any or all of the strategic plan could have a material adverse effect on us  our financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
our indebtedness limits funds available for our operations 
as of december   we had approximately billion in indebtedness 
our indebtedness may limit our ability to obtain additional financing and require the dedication of more cash flow to service our debt than we desire 
furthermore  it may require sale of assets or limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our markets 
our ability to satisfy our indebtedness in a timely manner will be dependent on the successful execution of our long term strategic plan and the resulting improvements in our operating performance 
our existing credit agreements and indentures contain covenants that may prevent us from engaging in certain transactions 
our existing credit agreements and indentures contain  among other things  various affirmative and negative covenants that may prevent us from engaging in certain transactions that might otherwise be considered beneficial to us 
these covenants limit  among other things  our and our subsidiaries ability to o borrow money  o pay dividends or make distributions  o purchase or redeem stock  o make investments  o engage in transactions with affiliates  o engage in sale leaseback transactions  and o consummate certain liens on assets 
the credit agreement also requires us to maintain certain financial ratios and satisfy other financial condition tests 
although the maturity of our bank credit agreement brings an end to the restrictions created by it  any future credit agreements or indentures may contain terms and conditions that are more or less restrictive than those of the existing bank credit agreement and indentures 
if we lost the ability to use surety bonding to support our prearranged funeral and preneed cemetery activities  we could have to make material cash payments to fund certain trust funds 
we have entered into arrangements with certain surety companies whereby such companies agree to issue surety bonds on our behalf  as financial assurance and or as required by existing state and local regulations 
the surety bonds are used for various business purpose  however  the majority of the surety bonds issued and outstanding have been issued to support our prearranged funeral and preneed cemetery activities 
the applicable florida law that allows posting of surety bonds for prearranged contracts will expire december  thus  we are required to change from bonding to either trust or insurance funding for new prearranged funeral and cemetery contracts in florida by december  we have elected to change to trust funding as of february  of the total bonding contract proceeds we received from customers for and  approximately million and million  respectively  were attributable to florida contracts 
assuming our prearranged funeral and cemetery sales in florida in is consistent with production for the full year of  we forecast a negative impact on our cash flow from operations of approximately to million  net of prospective trust receipts in in subsequent years  we do not expect the impact on cash flows from operations to be material 
furthermore  our future cash flows could be materially affected if we lost access to using surety bonds for financial assurance in our normal course of business 
we are currently evaluating our surety bonding program and may elect to discontinue the use of bonding in other states or cancel certain outstanding bonds and replace with funds in trusts in accordance with state regulations 
the funeral home and cemetery industry is becoming increasingly competitive 
in north america and most international markets in which we operate  the funeral and cemetery industry is characterized by a large number of locally owned  independent operations 
to compete successfully  our funeral service locations and cemeteries must maintain good reputations and high professional standards in the industry  as well as offer attractive products and services at competitive prices 
in addition  we must market our company in such a manner as to distinguish us from our competitors 
if we are unable to successfully compete  our company  our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
our affiliated funeral and cemetery trust funds own investments in equity securities and mutual funds  which are affected by financial market conditions that are beyond our control 
in connection with our prearranged funeral operations and preneed cemetery merchandise and service sales  affiliated funeral and cemetery trust funds own investments in equity securities and mutual funds 
our earnings and investment gains and losses on these equity securities and mutual funds are affected by financial market conditions that are beyond our control 
if our earnings from our trust funds decline  we would likely experience a decline in future revenues 
in addition  if the trust funds experienced significant investment losses  there would likely be insufficient funds in the trusts to cover the costs of delivering services and merchandise or maintaining cemeteries in the future 
we would have to cover any such shortfall with cash flows  which could have a material adverse effect on us  our financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
as of december   net unrealized appreciation in the prearranged funeral and cemetery merchandise and services trust funds amounted to million and million  respectively 
the perpetual care trust funds had net unrealized appreciation of million as of december  the following table summarizes the investment returns excluding fees on our trust funds for the last three years 
prearranged funeral trust funds cemetery merchandise services trust funds perpetual care trust funds increasing insurance benefits related to prearranged funeral contracts funded through life insurance or annuity contracts may not cover future increases in the cost of providing a price guaranteed funeral service 
we sell price guaranteed prearranged funeral contracts through various programs providing for future funeral services at prices prevailing when the agreements are signed 
for prearranged funeral contracts funded through life insurance or annuity contracts  we receive in cash a general agency commission of approximately of the total sale from the third party insurance company 
additionally  we accrue an increasing insurance benefit associated with the contract of approximately per year to be received in cash by us at the time the funeral is performed 
there is no guarantee that the increasing insurance benefit will cover future increases in the cost of providing a price guaranteed funeral service  which could materially adversely affect our future cash flows  revenues and profit margins 
we may not be able to joint venture or sell our international operations on acceptable terms or at all 
our long term strategic plan includes the joint venture or sale of our remaining international operations outside of north america in order to create cash proceeds to reduce debt 
on march   we completed the joint venture of our funeral operations in france having received approximately million in net cash proceeds 
however  if we are unable to joint venture or sell our south america or other international operations on acceptable terms or otherwise  it could adversely affect our ability to achieve our strategic plan 
our foreign operations and investments involve special risks 
our activities in areas outside the united states are subject to risks inherent in foreign operations  including the following o loss of revenue  property and equipment as a result of hazards such as expropriation  nationalization  wars  insurrection and other political risks  o the effects of currency fluctuations and exchange controls  such as devaluation of foreign currencies and other economic problems  and o changes in laws  regulations  and policies of foreign governments  including those associated with changes in the governing parties 
we are the subject of lawsuits in florida that  if not settled in accordance with the agreement in principle with respect thereto  could have a negative effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows and we may be subject to additional class action or other significant lawsuits in the future 
on december   we announced that we entered into an agreement in principle to settle the class action lawsuit and all individual related lawsuits pending against us involving florida s menorah gardens and funeral chapels the florida litigation  with the exception of two lawsuits pending in palm beach county  florida 
all claims under the florida litigation would be dismissed if final court approval of the settlement is obtained 
the terms of the proposed settlement call for us to make payments totaling approximately million in settlement of these claims 
as of december   we have recorded reserves of million related to the florida litigation 
in the fourth quarter of  we recognized a receivable of million for expected recoveries under one primary layer of the company s insurance coverage related to this litigation 
we have a substantial face amount of insurance coverage remaining  although there are various unresolved insurance coverage disputes in litigation 
if the settlement is not approved by the court  the proceedings and litigation will continue 
we cannot assure you that the results of any such continued proceedings and litigation would be on terms as favorable as those of the current settlement agreement 
in addition  on may   the special assistant state attorney for palm beach county  florida  filed criminal charges against the company  a florida subsidiary and certain individuals 
the criminal charges involve allegations of misconduct by the company and its florida subsidiary  including allegations similar to those in the florida litigation 
in february  the company negotiated a plea arrangement with the special assistant state attorney for palm beach county to resolve the criminal charges  however  the court rejected the plea arrangement 
in addition  we are involved in other litigation proceedings in the ordinary course of business 
there is a risk that one of the lawsuits that we do not view as significant at the moment  or an additional lawsuit brought in the future  could have a material adverse effect on us  our financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
we are the subject of securities fraud class action lawsuits that  if decided against us  could have a negative effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
in january  numerous putative class action lawsuits were filed in the united states district courts for the southern and eastern districts of texas  on behalf of persons and entities who acquired shares of our common stock in the merger with equity corporation international eci  purchased shares of our common stock in the open market during the period from july  through january referred herein as the class period  purchased call options in the open market during the class period  sold put options in the open market during the class period  held employee stock options in eci that became options to acquire our stock pursuant to the eci merger  and held employee stock options to purchase our common stock under a plan during the class period 
these actions have been consolidated into one lawsuit in the federal court in houston  texas 
the consolidated complaint alleges that we and three of our current or former executive officers and directors violated federal securities laws by making false and misleading statements and failing to disclose material information concerning our prearranged funeral business and other financial matters  including in connection with the eci merger 
plaintiffs allege damages based on the market loss  during the class period  of the outstanding shares  including those exchanged in the eci merger 
in october  we filed a motion to dismiss the consolidated complaint that has not been ruled on by the court 
the parties have met on at least two occasions to discuss a possible resolution of this case  but no progress has been made 
we anticipate that another meeting will be held in mid april to discuss a possible resolution of this matter 
the ultimate outcome of the stockholder class action cannot be determined at this time 
the class action lawsuit seeks to recover an unspecified amount of monetary damages 
certain insurance policies held by us may limit our cash outflows in the event of a decision adverse to us in these matters 
if the legal costs or the damages awarded against us exceed the insurance coverage  if the insurance coverage is determined not to apply to these amounts  or if an insurance carrier is unable to pay  we would have to pay them out of our own funds  which could have a material adverse effect on us  our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
if the number of deaths in our markets declines  our cash flows and revenues may decrease 
the united states bureau of the census estimates that the number of deaths in the united states will increase up to one percent per year from to however  longer life spans could reduce the number of deaths 
if the number of deaths declines  the number of funeral services and interments performed by us will decrease and our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows may be materially adversely effected 
the growing trend in the number of cremations performed in north america could result in lower revenue and gross profit dollars 
in the death care industry  there has been a growing trend in the number of cremations performed in north america as an alternative to traditional funeral service dispositions 
in north america during  of the comparable funeral services performed by us were cremation cases compared to and performed in and  respectively 
in recent years we have continued to expand our cremation memorialization products and services which has resulted in higher average sales for cremation services 
if we are unable to successfully expand our cremation memorialization products and services  we  our financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
the funeral home and cemetery businesses are high fixed cost businesses 
the majority of our operations throughout the world are managed in groups called markets 
markets are geographical groups of funeral service locations and cemeteries that share common resources such as operating personnel  preparation services  clerical staff  motor vehicles and preneed sales personnel 
personnel costs  the largest of the operating expenses for the company  are the cost components most beneficially affected by this grouping 
we must incur many of these costs regardless of the number of funeral services or interments performed 
because we cannot necessarily decrease these costs when we experience lower sales volumes  the sales decline may cause margins  profits and cash flows to decline at a greater rate than the decline in revenues 
the funeral home and cemetery industry is highly regulated 
our operations are subject to regulation  supervision  and licensing under numerous foreign  federal  state and local laws  ordinances and regulations  including extensive regulations concerning trust funds  preneed sales of funeral and cemetery products and services  and various other aspects of our business 
the impact of such regulations varies depending on the location of our funeral and cemetery operations 
violations of applicable laws could result in fines or their sanctions to us 
in addition  from time to time  governments and agencies propose to amend or add regulations  which would increase costs and decrease cash flows 
for example  foreign  federal  state  local and other regulatory agencies have considered and may enact additional legislation or regulations that could affect the death care industry 
some states and regulatory agencies have considered or are considering regulations that could require more liberal refund and cancellation policies for preneed sales of products and services  limit or eliminate our ability to use surety bonding  increase trust requirements and prohibit the common ownership of funeral homes and cemeteries in the same market 
if adopted by the regulatory authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate  these and other possible proposals could have a material adverse effect on us  our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the information presented below should be read in conjunction with notes eight and nine to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
we have historically used derivatives primarily in the form of interest rate swaps  cross currency interest rate swaps  and forward exchange contracts in combination with local currency borrowings in order to manage our mix of fixed and floating rate debt and to hedge our net investment in foreign assets 
we generally do not participate in derivative transactions that are leveraged or considered speculative in nature 
we were not a party to any derivative transactions at december  subsequent to december   we executed certain forward exchange contracts to hedge our net foreign investment in our france operations 
at december  and  of our total debt consisted of fixed rate debt at a weighted average rate of and  respectively 
approximately of our net investment and of our operating income  excluding gains and impairment losses on dispositions  net  and other operating expenses  are denominated in foreign currencies  primarily the euro  at december  at december   approximately of our net investment and of our operating income excluding gains and impairment losses on dispositions  net  and other operating expenses were denominated in foreign currencies 
we do not have a significant investment in foreign operations that are in highly inflationary economies 
marketable equity and debt securities price risk in connection with our prearranged funeral operations and preneed cemetery merchandise and service sales  the related funeral and cemetery trust funds own investments in equity securities and mutual funds  which are sensitive to current market prices 
cost and market values as of december  and are presented in notes five and six to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
market rate sensitive instruments interest rate and currency risk we perform a sensitivity analysis to assess the impact of interest rate and exchange rate risks on earnings 
this analysis determines the effect of a hypothetical adverse change in market rates 
in actuality  market rate volatility is dependent on many factors that are impossible to forecast 
therefore  the adverse changes described below could differ substantially from the hypothetical change 
a sensitivity analysis of debt instruments with variable interest rate components was modeled to assess the impact that changing interest rates could have on pretax earnings 
the sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous adverse change to the then prevailing interest rates with all other variables held constant 
given this model  our pretax earnings  on an annual basis  would not change at either december  or a similar model was used to assess the impact of changes in exchange rates for foreign currencies on interest expense 
at december  and  our debt exposure was primarily associated with the euro 
a adverse change in the strength of the us dollar would have negatively affected our interest expense  on an annual basis  by approximately million on december  and  respectively
