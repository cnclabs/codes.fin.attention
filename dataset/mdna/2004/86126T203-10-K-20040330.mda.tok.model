critical accounting policies stockeryale s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires stockeryale to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  stockeryale evaluates its estimates  including  accounts receivable  inventories  property  plant and equipment and goodwill and intangible assets 
stockeryale develops its estimates based on historical experience as well as assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
stockeryale believes the following critical policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
accounts receivable the company reviews the financial condition of new customers prior to granting credit 
after completing the credit review  the company establishes a credit line for each customer 
periodically  the company reviews the credit line for major customers and adjusts the credit limit based upon an updated financial condition of the customer  historical sales and payment information and expected future sales 
the company has a large number of customers  therefore  material credit risk is limited to only a small number of customers 
sales to the company s largest customer accounted for of consolidated revenue in no other customer accounted for more than of revenue in the company periodically reviews the collectibility of its accounts receivable 
provisions are established for accounts that are potentially uncollectible 
determining adequate reserves for accounts receivable requires management s judgment 
conditions impacting the collectibility of the company s receivables could cause actual write offs to be materially different than the reserved balances as of december  revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue from product sales at the time of shipment and when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  performance of the company s obligation is complete  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
in certain limited situations  customers have the right to return products 
such rights of return have not precluded revenue recognition because the company has a long history with such returns and accordingly provides a reserve

table of contents part ii item inventory the company values inventories at the lower of cost or market using the first in  first out fifo method 
the company specifically evaluates historical and forecasted demand of the illumination product line to determine if the carrying value of both finished goods and raw materials is recoverable through future sales 
the company also estimates the impact of increased revenues for new products versus the potential obsolescence of older products on a case by case basis 
as a result of this analysis  the company reduced the carrying amount of inventory by approximately million in the company has not established an inventory reserve for the optical components product line since these products are primarily manufactured based upon a customer order 
actual results could be different from management s estimates and assumptions 
intangible assets the company s intangible assets consist of goodwill  which is not being amortized commencing in and beyond and amortizing intangibles  which consist of patents  trademarks and purchased patented technologies  which are being amortized over their useful lives 
all intangible assets are subject to impairment tests on a periodic basis 
note describes the impact of accounting for the adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets  and the annual impairment methodology that the company will employ on january st of each year in calculating the recoverability of goodwill 
this same impairment test will be performed at other times during the course of the year should an event occur which suggests that the recoverability of goodwill should be challenged 
amortizing intangibles are currently evaluated for impairment using the methodology set forth in sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and long lived assets to be disposed of 
recoverability of these assets is assessed only when events have occurred that may give rise to an impairment 
when a potential impairment has been identified  forecasted undiscounted cash flows of the operations to which the asset relates are compared to the current carrying value of the long lived assets present in th at operation 
if such cash flows are less than such carrying amounts  long lived assets  including such intangibles  are written down to their respective fair values 
if an impairment loss exists  the amount of the loss will be recorded in the consolidated statements of operations 
it is possible that future events or circumstances could cause these estimates to change 
long lived assets the company reviews the recoverability of its long lived assets  primarily property  plant and equipment  when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
this review is based on the company s ability to recover the carrying value of the assets from expected undiscounted future cash flows 
if an impairment is indicated  the company measures the loss based on the fair value of the asset using various valuation techniques 
if an impairment loss exists  the amount of the loss will be recorded in the consolidated statements of operations 
it is possible that future events or circumstances could cause these estimates to change 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes under the liability method 
under this method the company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the financial statements or tax returns 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial reporting and tax basis of the assets and liabilities using tax rates expected to be in place when the differences reverse 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized

table of contents part ii item certain factors affecting future operating results statements  other than historical facts  made herein may constitute forward looking statements 
such forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties  which may cause actual results to differ materially from those  anticipated in such statements 
the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from anticipated results include  without limitation  the company s ability to  i compete with entities that have greater financial  technical and marketing resources than the company  ii develop and market new products in its various business lines  iii gain sufficient market acceptance for its fiber products iv obtain financing on favorable terms or refinance indebtedness prior to maturity or v raise capital through equity or debt to fund anticipated expenditures and vi risks inherent with international operations 
in addition  general economic conditions worldwide may affect the company s results 
stockeryale s history of losses and the uncertainty of its future profitability make its common stock a highly speculative investment stockeryale has experienced operating losses during each of the years ending december    and  and the company may continue to incur losses 
stockeryale cannot predict the size or duration of any future losses 
even if stockeryale does achieve profitability  the company may be unable to sustain or increase its profitability in the future 
stockeryale may be unable to fund the initiatives required to achieve its business strategy in  the company began to focus its resources on opportunities that would result in near term revenue and simultaneously reduced its operating expenses by on an annualized basis 
in  the company continued to reduce costs and is currently evaluating the restructuring of its product lines 
this restructuring could impact several product lines 
while the company believes these efforts will assist it in improving its financial condition  the company can give no assurances as to whether its cost reduction and product restructuring efforts will be successful 
if stockeryale s cost reduction strategies and efforts to raise additional capital are unsuccessful  the company may be unable to fund its operations 
the company has historically experienced operating losses over the last several years and may continue to incur losses 
the company cannot predict the size or duration of any future losses 
these operating losses have historically been financed through debt or by the sale of equity in the company 
the company s future capital requirements will depend on a number of factors  including its profitability  growth rate  working capital requirements  expenses associated with protection of the company s patents and other intellectual property  and costs of future research and development activities 
future operating results will depend  in part  on the company s ability to obtain and manage capital sufficient to finance its business 
to the extent that funds currently available or expected to be generated from operations are not sufficient to meet current or planned operating requirements  the company will seek to obtain additional funds through bank credit facilities  equity or debt financing  collaborative or other arrangements with corporate partners and from other sources 
additional funding may not be available when needed or on acceptable terms  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operatio ns 
if adequate funds are not available  the company may be required to delay or to eliminate certain expenditures  or license or sell a product line or intellectual property  or scale back or cease operations

on january   stockeryale s common stock reached per share  which was the high in  and  on january   its common stock closed at per share 
these fluctuations often have no direct relationship to stockeryale s operating performance and there is no assurance that its stock will continue to trade at the current price level 
the market price for stockeryale s common stock may continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors  some of which are beyond its control 
in the past  some companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been the subject of securities class action litigation 
in light of the fluctuations in stockeryale s stock price  it is possible that stockeryale may be the subject of such a securities class action litigation in the future 
such litigation often results in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources and could harm stockeryale s business  prospects  results of operations  or financial condition 
stockeryale s common stock price may be negatively impacted if its trading status on nasdaq national market changes for continued inclusion on the nasdaq national market  stockeryale must meet certain tests  including a minimum bid price of per share

stockeryale s quarterly results are likely to be volatile the implementation of stockeryale s business strategy makes prediction of future revenues difficult 
stockeryale believes that its ability to accurately forecast revenues from sales of its products is also limited because of the development and sales cycles 
this makes it difficult to predict the quarter in which sales will occur 
stockeryale s expense levels are based  in part  on its expectations regarding future revenues  and its expenses are generally fixed  particularly in the short term 
stockeryale may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall 
any significant shortfall of revenues in relation to stockeryale s expectations could cause significant declines in the company s quarterly operating results 
stockeryale s operating results have varied on a quarterly basis during its operating history and are likely to fluctuate significantly in the future 
stockeryale s operating results may be below the expectations of its investors as a result of a variety of factors  many of which are outside of the company s control 
accordingly  stockeryale believes that quarter to quarter comparisons of its operating results are not necessarily meaningful 
investors should not rely on the results of one quarter as an indication of stockeryale s future performance 
stockeryale does not plan to pay dividends on the common stock stockeryale has not and does not expect to declare or pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
stockeryale intends to retain all earnings  if any  in order to expand its operations

stockeryale typically does not have long term agreements with its suppliers and  therefore  its suppliers generally may stop supplying materials and equipment to stockeryale at any time 
this reliance on a sole or limited number of suppliers could result in delivery problems and reduced control over product pricing and quality 
a small number of affiliated stockholders control a significant portion of stockeryale s stock as of the date hereof  stockeryale s executive officers and directors as a group beneficially own or control approximately twenty percent of its common stock 
accordingly  these persons will have the ability to significantly influence stockeryale s board of directors and  therefore  the business  policies  executive compensation  and affairs of the company 
furthermore  such influence could preclude any unsolicited acquisition of the company and  consequently  adversely affect the market price of the common stock 
the loss of stockeryale s key personnel or the inability to recruit additional personnel may harm its business stockeryale is highly dependent on its senior and middle management as well as its technical and research personnel 
in particular  the loss of mark w 
blodgett  the chairman and chief executive officer  or other key personnel  could harm the company significantly 
the loss of key management personnel or an inability to attract and retain sufficient numbers of qualified management personnel could materially and adversely affect stockeryale s business  results of operations  financial condition or future prospects 
the company may not be able to obtain sufficient capital to fund its operating losses 
the company has historically experienced operating losses over the last several years and may continue to incur losses 
the company cannot predict the size or duration of any future losses 
these operating losses have historically been financed through debt or by the sale of equity in the company 
the company s future capital requirements will depend on a number of factors  including its profitability  growth rate  working capital requirements  expenses associated with protection of the company s patents and other intellectual property  and costs of future research and development activities 
future operating results will depend  in part  on the company s ability to obtain and manage capital sufficient to finance its business 
to the extent that funds currently available or expected to be generated from operations are not sufficient to meet current or planned operating requirements  the company will seek to obtain additional funds through bank credit facilities  equity or debt financing  collaborative or other arrangements with corporate partners and from other sources 
additional funding may not be available when needed or on acceptable terms  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operatio ns 
if adequate funds are not available  the company may be required to delay or to eliminate certain expenditures  or license or sell a product line or intellectual property  or scale back or cease operations 
in addition  in the event that the company obtains any additional funding  such financing may have a substantially dilutive effect on the holders of the company s securities 
the company has many competitors in its field and its technologies may not remain competitive 
the company participates in a rapidly evolving field in which technological developments are expected to continue at a rapid pace 
the company has many competitors in the united states and abroad  including various fiber optic component manufacturers  universities and other private and public research institutions 
the company s success depends upon its ability to develop and maintain a competitive position in the product categories and technologies on which the company focuses 
the introduction of new products incorporating new technologies or the emergence of new industry standards could make it more difficult for the company s existing products to compete in terms of pricing or functionality 
many of the company s competitors have greater capabilities  experience and financial resources than the company 
competition is intense and is expected to increase as new products enter the market and new technologies become available

table of contents part ii items  a the company s customers are not obligated to buy material amounts of its products and may cancel or defer purchases on short notice 
the company s customers typically purchase its products under individual purchase orders and may cancel or defer purchases on short notice without significant penalty

decreases in purchases  cancellations of purchase orders or deferrals of purchases may have a material adverse effect on the company  particularly if the company does not anticipate them 
the company faces risks associated with its international operations 
the company distributes and sells certain of its products internationally 
as a result  the company is subject to risks associated with operating in a foreign country  including fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  imposition of limitations on conversion of foreign currencies into dollars or remittance of dividends and other payments by foreign subsidiaries  imposition or increase of withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments on foreign subsidiaries  hyperinflation and imposition or increase of investment and other restrictions by foreign governments 
such risks may have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition in the future 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk foreign currency exchange risk management has determined that all of the company s foreign subsidiaries operate primarily in local currencies that represent the functional currencies of the subsidiaries 
all assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars using the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date  while income and expense accounts are translated at average exchange rates during the year 
as such  the company s operating results are affected by fluctuations in the value of the us dollar as compared to currencies in foreign countries  as a result of the company s transactions in these foreign markets 
the company does not operate a hedging program to mitigate the effect of a significant rapid change in the value of the canadian dollar or euro as compared to the us dollar 
if such a change did occur  the company would have to take into account a currency exchange gain or loss in the amount of the change in the us dollar denominated balance of the amounts outstanding at the time of such change 
while the company does not believe such a gain or loss is likely  and would not likely be material  there can be no assurance that such a loss would not have an adverse material effect on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
interest rate risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates  which may adversely affect its financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
in seeking to minimize the risks from interest rate fluctuations  the company manages exposures through its regular operating and financing activities 
the company is exposed to interest rate risk primarily through its borrowings under its million credit line and million term note with merrill lynch with an interest rate at over the one month libor  a  convertible note with laurus master funds with an interest rate of prime plus and its million cdn credit facility with the national bank of canada with interest rates of and over the canadian prime rate 
as of december  the fair market value of the company s outstanding debt approximates its carrying value due to the short term maturities and variable interest rates 
a change in interest rates could inc rease or decrease interest expense by approximately  on an annual basis
