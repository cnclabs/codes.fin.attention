ratings ratings with respect to claims paying ability and financial strength have become an increasingly important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies 
ratings are important to maintaining public confidence in the company and its ability to market its annuity and life insurance products

nevertheless  it is not possible to anticipate whether such affiliations might occur in the future 
regulation general regulation at state level as an insurance holding company  the company is subject to regulation by the states in which its insurance subsidiaries are domiciled and or transact business 
most states have enacted legislation that requires each insurance holding company and each insurance company in an insurance holding company system to register with the insurance regulatory authority of the insurance company s state of domicile and annually furnish financial and other information concerning the operations of companies within the holding company system that materially affect the operations  management or financial condition of the insurers within such system 
in many cases  under such laws  a state insurance authority must approve in advance the direct or indirect acquisition of or more of the voting securities of an insurance company domiciled in its state 
the company is subject to the insurance holding company laws in the state of ohio 
under such laws  all transactions within an insurance holding company system affecting insurers must be fair and equitable and each insurer s policyholder surplus following any such transaction must be both reasonable in relation to its outstanding liabilities and adequate for its needs 
the state of ohio insurance holding company laws also require prior notice or regulatory approval of the change of control of an insurer or its holding company and of material intercorporate transfers of assets within the holding company structure 
in addition  the laws of the various states establish regulatory agencies with broad administrative powers to approve policy forms  grant and revoke licenses to transact business  regulate trade practices  license agents  require statutory financial statements  limit the amount of dividends and other payments that can be paid by insurance companies without prior approval and impose restrictions on the type and amount of investments permitted 
these regulations are primarily intended to protect policyholders rather than shareholders 
the company cannot predict the effect that any proposed or future legislation may have on the financial condition or results of operations of the company 
insurance companies are required to file detailed annual and quarterly statutory financial statements with state insurance regulators in each of the states in which they do business and their business and accounts are subject to examination by such agencies at any time 
in addition  insurance regulators periodically examine an insurer s financial condition  adherence to statutory accounting practices and compliance with insurance department rules and regulations

in recent years  a number of life and annuity insurers have been the subject of regulatory proceedings and litigation relating to alleged improper life insurance pricing and sales practices 
some of these insurers have incurred or paid substantial amounts in connection with the resolution of such matters 
in addition  state insurance regulatory authorities regularly make inquiries  hold investigations and administer market conduct examinations with respect to insurers compliance with applicable insurance laws and regulations 
nlic and nationwide life and annuity insurance company are currently undergoing regulatory market conduct examinations in six states 
other than these market conduct examinations  none of the company s insurance subsidiaries is the subject of any such investigation by any state insurance regulatory authority 
the company s insurance subsidiaries continuously monitor sales  marketing and advertising practices and related activities of their agents and personnel and provide continuing education and training in an effort to ensure compliance with applicable insurance laws and regulations

regulation of dividends and other payments from insurance subsidiaries as an insurance holding company  nfs ability to meet debt service obligations and pay operating expenses and dividends depends primarily on the receipt of sufficient funds from its primary operating subsidiary  nlic 
the inability of nlic to pay dividends to nfs in an amount sufficient to meet debt service obligations and pay operating expenses and dividends would have a material adverse effect on the company 
the payment of dividends by nlic is subject to restrictions set forth in the insurance laws and regulations of the state of ohio  its domiciliary state 
the state of ohio insurance laws require ohio domiciled life insurance companies to seek prior regulatory approval to pay a dividend or distribution of cash or other property if the fair market value thereof  together with that of other dividends or distributions made in the preceding months  exceeds the greater of i of statutory basis policyholders surplus as of the prior december or ii the statutory basis net income of the insurer for the month period ending as of the prior december during the year ended december   nlic paid dividends of million to nfs 
as of january   based on statutory financial results as of and for the year ended december   nlic could pay dividends totaling million without obtaining prior approval 
in february  nlic obtained prior approval from the ohio department of insurance to pay a dividend to nfs in the amount of million because the december  statutory financial statements had not been filed at the time of the dividend 
the state of ohio insurance laws also require insurers to seek prior regulatory approval for any dividend paid from other than earned surplus 
earned surplus is defined under the state of ohio insurance laws as the amount equal to the company s unassigned funds as set forth in its most recent statutory financial statements  including net unrealized capital gains and losses or revaluation of assets 
additionally  following any dividend  an insurer s policyholder surplus must be reasonable in relation to the insurer s outstanding liabilities and adequate for its financial needs 
the payment of dividends by nlic may also be subject to restrictions set forth in the insurance laws of the state of new york that limit the amount of statutory profits on nlic s participating policies measured before dividends to policyholders that can inure to the benefit of the company and its stockholders 
the company currently does not expect such regulatory requirements to impair its ability to pay operating expenses and dividends in the future 
the ability of nlica to pay dividends is subject to regulation under pennsylvania insurance law 
under pennsylvania law  unless the pennsylvania insurance department either approves payment or fails to disapprove payment within days after being notified  nlica may not pay any cash dividends or other non stock distributions during any month period if the total payments would exceed the same criteria as outlined in the paragraph above as it relates to nlic s limitations

erisa considerations on december   the us supreme court issued its opinion in john hancock mutual life insurance company v 
harris trust and savings bank holding that certain assets in excess of amounts necessary to satisfy guaranteed obligations held by hancock in its general account under a participating group annuity contract are plan assets and therefore subject to certain fiduciary obligations under the employee retirement income security act of  as amended erisa 
erisa requires that fiduciaries perform their duties solely in the interest of erisa plan participants and beneficiaries  and with the care  skill  prudence and diligence that a prudent person acting in a like capacity and familiar with such matters would use in the conduct of an enterprise of a like character and with like aims 
the court imposed erisa fiduciary obligations to the extent that the insurer s general account is not reserved to pay benefits under guaranteed benefit policies ie benefits whose value would not fluctuate in accordance with the insurer s investment experience 
the secretary of labor issued final regulations on january   providing guidance for the purpose of determining  in cases where an insurer issues one or more policies backed by the insurer s general account to or for the benefit of an employee benefit plan  which assets of the insurer constitute plan assets for purposes of erisa and the irc

on september   the second circuit us court of appeals held that hancock by following the terms of the contract did not violate its fiduciary duty when it refused to rollover free funds or revalue plan liabilities 
however  the court said it did violate fiduciary duties by exercising discretionary management decisions in matters not addressed by the contract which included investment of plan funds in its general account and allocation of the returns on investments and expenses among its client accounts 
potential tax legislation congress has  from time to time  considered possible legislation that would eliminate many of the tax benefits currently afforded to annuity products

critical accounting policies and recently issued accounting pronouncements in preparing the consolidated financial statements  management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the reporting period 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates 
nationwide financial services  inc 
and subsidiaries 
table of contents the most critical estimates include those used in determining dac for investment products and universal life insurance products  the value of business acquired voba  impairment losses on investments  valuation allowances for mortgage loans on real estate  goodwill  federal income taxes  and pension and other postretirement benefits 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in the f pages of this report for a discussion of the company s significant accounting policies  including recently issued accounting pronouncements 
deferred policy acquisition costs for investment products and universal life insurance products the costs of acquiring business  principally commissions  certain expenses of the policy issue and underwriting department and certain variable sales expenses that relate to and vary with the production of new and renewal business have been deferred 
dac is subject to recoverability testing at the time of policy issuance and loss recognition testing at the end of each reporting period 
for investment products principally individual and group annuities and universal life insurance products  dac is being amortized with interest over the lives of the policies in relation to the present value of estimated future gross profits from projected interest margins  asset fees  cost of insurance  policy administration and surrender charges  less policy benefits and policy maintenance expenses 
the dac asset related to investment products and universal life insurance products is adjusted to reflect the impact of unrealized gains and losses on fixed maturity securities available for sale as described in note b to the consolidated financial statements included in the f pages to this report 
the most significant assumptions that are involved in the estimation of future gross profits include future net separate account performance  surrender lapse rates  interest margins and mortality 
the company s long term assumption for net separate account performance is currently percent growth per year 
if actual net separate account performance varies from the percent assumption  the company assumes different performance levels over the next three years  such that the mean return equals the long term assumption 
this process is referred to as a reversion to the mean 
the assumed net separate account return assumptions used in the dac models are intended to reflect what is anticipated 
however  based on historical returns of the s p index  the company s policy regarding the reversion to the mean process does not permit such returns to be below zero percent or in excess of percent during the three year reversion period 
changes in assumptions can have a significant impact on the amount of dac reported for investment products and universal life insurance products and their related amortization patterns 
in the event actual experience differs from assumptions or assumptions are revised  the company is required to record an increase or decrease in dac amortization expense dac unlocking  which could be significant 
in general  increases in the estimated general and separate account returns result in increased expected future profitability and may lower the rate of dac amortization  while increases in lapse surrender and mortality assumptions reduce the expected future profitability of the underlying business and may increase the rate of dac amortization 
due to the magnitude of the dac balance related to the individual variable annuity business  the sensitivity of the calculation to minor changes in the underlying assumptions and the related volatility that could result in the reported dac balance without meaningful improvement in its reasonableness  the company evaluates the appropriateness of the individual variable annuity dac balance within pre set parameters 
should the recorded balance of individual variable annuity dac fall outside of these parameters for a prescribed period of time  or should the recorded balance fall outside of these parameters and the company determines it is not reasonably possible to get back within this period of time  assumptions are required to be unlocked and the dac is recalculated using revised best estimate assumptions 
otherwise  individual variable annuity dac is not unlocked to reflect updated assumptions 
in the event individual variable annuity dac assumptions are unlocked and revised  the company will continue to use the reversion to the mean process 
for other investment products and universal life insurance products  dac is set each quarter to reflect revised best estimate assumptions  including the use of a reversion to the mean methodology over the next three years as it relates to net separate account performance 
any resulting dac unlocking adjustments are reflected currently in the consolidated financial statements 
as part of the regular quarterly analysis of dac  at the end of the third quarter of  the company determined that using actual experience to date and assumptions consistent with those used in the second quarter of  its individual variable annuity dac balance would be outside a pre set parameter of acceptable results 
the company also determined that it was not reasonably possible that the dac would return to an amount within the acceptable parameter within a prescribed period of time 
accordingly  the company unlocked its dac assumptions for individual variable annuities and reduced the dac asset to the amount calculated using the revised assumptions 
because the company unlocked the net separate nationwide financial services  inc 
and subsidiaries 
table of contents account growth rate assumption for individual variable annuities for the three year reversion period  the company unlocked that assumption for all investment products and variable universal life insurance products to be consistent across product lines 
therefore  in  the company recorded an acceleration of dac amortization totaling million before tax  or million  net of million of federal income tax benefit  which has been reported in the following segments in the amounts indicated  net of tax individual annuity million  institutional products million and life insurance million 
the acceleration of dac amortization was the result of unlocking certain assumptions underlying the calculation of dac for investment products and variable universal life insurance products 
the most significant assumption changes were the resetting of the company s anchor date for reversion to the mean calculations to september   resetting the assumption for annual net separate account growth to percent during the three year reversion period for all investment products and variable life insurance products and increasing future lapses and costs related to gmdb on individual variable annuity contracts 
these adjustments were primarily driven by the sustained downturn in the equity markets 
value of business acquired as a result of the acquisition of nationwide provident in see note to the consolidated financial statements included in the f pages of this report and the application of purchase accounting  the company reports an intangible asset representing voba 
voba reflects the estimated fair value of the business in force and represents the portion of the purchase price that is allocated to the value of the right to receive future cash flows from the life insurance and annuity contracts existing as of the closing date of the nationwide provident acquisition 
the value assigned to voba is supported by an independent valuation study that was commissioned by the company and executed by a team of qualified valuation experts  including actuarial consultants 
the expected future cash flows used in determining such value were based on actuarially determined projections  by each major line of business  of future policy and contract charges  premiums  mortality and morbidity  separate account performance  surrenders  changes in reserves  operating expenses  investment income and other factors 
these projections took into account all known or expected factors at the valuation date  based on the judgment of management 
the actual experience on purchased business may vary from projections due to differences in renewal premiums  investment spreads  investment gains or losses  mortality and morbidity costs  or other factors 
amortization of voba occurs with interest over the anticipated lives of the major lines of business to which it relates initially ranging from to years in relation to estimated gross profits  gross margins or premiums  as appropriate 
if estimated gross profits  gross margins or premiums differ from expectations  the amortization of voba is adjusted on a retrospective or prospective basis  as appropriate 
for those products amortized in relation to estimated gross profits  the most significant assumptions that are involved in the estimation of future gross profits include future net separate account performance  surrender lapse rates  interest margins and mortality 
the company s long term assumption for net separate account performance is currently percent 
if actual net separate account performance varies from the percent assumption  the company assumes different performance levels over the next three years  such that the mean return equals the long term assumption 
this process is referred to as a reversion to the mean 
the assumed net separate account return assumptions used in the voba models are intended to reflect what is anticipated 
however  based on historical returns of the s p index  the company s policy regarding the reversion to the mean process does not permit such returns to be below zero percent or in excess of percent during the three year reversion period 
changes in assumptions can have a significant impact on the amount of voba reported for all products and their related amortization patterns 
in the event actual experience differs from assumptions or assumptions are revised  the company is required to record an increase or decrease in voba amortization expense voba unlocking  which could be significant 
in general  increases in the estimated general and separate account returns result in increased expected future profitability and may lower the rate of voba amortization  while increases in lapse surrender and mortality assumptions reduce the expected future profitability of the underlying business and may increase the rate of voba amortization 
the voba asset related to investment products and universal life insurance products is also adjusted for the impact of net unrealized gains and losses on securities available for sale had such gains and losses been realized and allocated to the product lines  also as described in note b to the consolidated financial statements included in the f pages of this report  each year  the recoverability of voba is evaluated and if the evaluation indicates that the existing insurance liabilities  together with the present value of future net cash flows from the blocks of business acquired  is insufficient to recover voba  the difference  if any  is charged to expense as accelerated amortization of voba

table of contents impairment losses on investments management regularly reviews each investment in its fixed maturity and equity securities portfolios to evaluate the necessity of recording impairment losses for other than temporary declines in the fair value of investments 
a number of criteria are considered during this process including  but not limited to  the current fair value as compared to amortized cost or cost  as appropriate  of the security  the length of time the security s fair value has been below amortized cost cost  and by how much  specific credit issues and financial prospects related to the issuer  the company s intent to hold or dispose of the securities and current economic conditions 
other than temporary impairment losses result in a permanent reduction of the cost basis of the underlying investment 
also  the company estimates the cash flows over the life of purchased beneficial interests in securitized financial assets 
based on current information and events  if the company estimates that the fair value of its beneficial interests is not greater than or equal to its carrying value and if there has been an adverse change in the estimated cash flows since the last revised estimate  considering both timing and amount  then an other than temporary impairment is recognized and the purchased beneficial interest is written down to fair value 
impairment losses are recorded on long lived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets carrying amount 
significant changes in the factors the company considers when evaluating investments for impairment losses could result in a significant change in impairment losses reported in the consolidated financial statements 
valuation allowances on mortgage loans on real estate the company provides valuation allowances for impairments of mortgage loans on real estate based on a review by portfolio managers 
mortgage loans on real estate are considered impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that the company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
when the company determines that a loan is impaired  a provision for loss is established equal to the difference between the carrying value and the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  or the fair value of the collateral  if the loan is collateral dependent 
in addition to the valuation allowance on specific loans  the company maintains an unallocated allowance for estimated losses incurred as of the balance sheet date  but not yet specifically identified by loan 
changes in the valuation allowance are recorded in net realized gains or losses on investments  hedging instruments and hedged items 
loans in foreclosure are placed on non accrual status 
interest received on non accrual status mortgage loans on real estate is included in net investment income in the period received 
the valuation allowance account for mortgage loans on real estate is maintained at a level believed adequate by the company and reflects the company s best estimate of probable credit losses  including losses incurred at the balance sheet date  but not yet identified by specific loan 
the company s periodic evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for losses is based on past loan loss experience  known and inherent risks in the portfolio  adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay  the estimated value of the underlying collateral  composition of the loan portfolio  current economic conditions and other relevant factors 
significant changes in the factors the company considers in determining the valuation allowance on mortgage loans on real estate could result in a significant change in the provision for valuation allowance reported in the consolidated financial statements 
during the third quarter of  the company refined its mortgage loan valuation allowance process by incorporating more detailed information in the analysis 
this refined estimation process included an analysis by property type of the current composition of the portfolio  historical losses  current market cycles and trends and expected losses incurred at the balance sheet date  but not yet identified by specific loan 
as a result  the valuation allowance was reduced by million 
federal income taxes the company provides for federal income taxes based on amounts the company believes it will ultimately owe 
inherent in the provision for federal income taxes are estimates regarding the deductibility of certain items and the realization of certain tax credits 
in the event the ultimate deductibility of certain expenses or the realization of certain tax credits differ from estimates  the company may be required to significantly change the provision for federal income taxes recorded in the consolidated financial statements 
goodwill in connection with acquisitions of operating entities  the company recognizes the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired as goodwill 
in accordance with gaap  goodwill is not amortized  but rather evaluated nationwide financial services  inc 
and subsidiaries 
table of contents periodically  at the reporting unit level  for impairment 
the company conducts annual goodwill impairment testing in the fourth quarter 
in addition  at each reporting period  the underlying components of goodwill are evaluated to determine whether conditions exist  which would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
the process of evaluating goodwill for impairment requires a number of judgments and assumptions to be made in determining the fair value of the reporting units 
some of the more significant judgments and assumptions include the method used to determine fair value  discount rates  expected levels of cash flows  revenues  earnings  and identification of comparable companies used to develop market based assumptions 
management believes all judgments and assumptions that are made in connection with goodwill impairment testing are reasonable based on the underlying facts and circumstances evaluated 
however  variances in actual results from expectations or changes in expectations for future cash flows  revenues and or earnings could result in significant impairment charges related to goodwill in future periods pension and other postretirement employee benefits the pension expense for substantially all of the company s employees and certain agents totaled million 
this is an increase of million over the pension expense of million 
this increase is primarily due to the impact of the inclusion of nationwide provident for a full year  low interest rates and the declines in the equity market in for the company s primary pension plan  the discount rate used to value the cash flows was lowered to for expenses from the discount rate of for and the long term expected return on plan assets assumption was lowered to in from the assumption of in the postretirement benefit expense for substantially all of the company s employees and in certain agents totaled million  a decrease of million from the postretirement benefit expense of million 
this decrease is primarily due to reductions in benefits provided by the plan 
the discount rate used to value the cash flows was lowered to for expenses from in and the long term expected return on plan assets assumption was lowered to from the assumption of 
in establishing the discount rate and the long term expected rate of return on plan assets  the company employs a prospective building block approach 
this process is integrated with the determination of other economic assumptions such as salary scale 
for a given measurement date  the discount rate is set by reference to the yield on high quality corporate bonds to approximate the rate at which plan benefits could effectively be settled 
for pension benefits  an adjustment is included for plan administration and other expenses likely to be charged by an insurer 
because post retirement benefit claims include administration expenses  a higher discount rate is utilized 
the historic real rate of return for the reference bonds is subtracted from the yield on these bonds to generate an assumed inflation rate 
expected real rate of return on various asset sub classes developed based on historic risk premiums for those sub classes 
the expected real rates of return  reduced for investment expenses  are applied to the target allocation of each asset sub class to produce an expected real rate of return for the target portfolio 
this expected real rate of return will vary by plan and will change when the plan s target investment portfolio changes 
the expected long term rate of return for plan assets is the assumed inflation rate plus the expected real rate of return 
this process effectively sets the expected return for the plan s portfolio at the yield for the reference bond portfolio  adjusted for expected risk premiums of the target asset portfolio 
given the prospective nature of this calculation  short term fluctuations in the market do not impact the expected risk premiums 
however  as the yield for the reference bonds fluctuates  the assumed inflation rate and the expected long term rate are adjusted in tandem 
to illustrate the impact of these assumptions on net periodic pension expense in and going forward  a basis point increase in the pension plan discount rate without changing any other assumption would decrease annual expenses by approximately and a basis point increase in the pension plan long term expected rate of return without changing any other assumption would decrease plan expenses by approximately 
for the retiree medical and death benefit plan  a basis point increase in the discount rate would have decreased expense by approximately  while a basis point increase in the long term expected rate of return would have decreased expense by approximately 
results of operations overview revenues total revenues increased million  or  to billion in compared to billion in revenue growth was fueled by the addition of the nationwide provident  which added million and million of revenues in nationwide financial services  inc 
and subsidiaries 
table of contents and in the fourth quarter of  respectively 
the of growth in total revenues in from billion reported in was primarily driven by the addition of nationwide provident and an increase in net investment income as a result of continued growth in interest spread based businesses  which offset additional realized losses on investments  hedging instruments and hedged items 
policy charges include asset fees  which are primarily earned on separate account values generated from the sale of individual and group variable annuities and investment life insurance products  cost of insurance charges earned on universal life insurance products  administrative fees  which include fees charged per contract on a variety of the company s products and premium loads on universal life insurance products  and surrender fees  which are charged as a percentage of premiums withdrawn during a specified period for annuity and certain life insurance contracts 
policy charges for each of the last three years consisted of the following in millions asset fees cost of insurance charges administrative fees surrender fees total policy charges the fluctuations in asset fees reflect changes in total average separate account assets of million or and billion or in and  respectively 
the decrease in average separate account values in was fueled by market depreciation on investment options underlying variable annuity and investment life insurance products as a result of the sharp declines in the equity markets 
cost of insurance charges are assessed on the net amount at risk on universal life insurance policies 
the net amount at risk is equal to a policy s death benefit minus the related policyholder account value 
the amount charged is based on the insured s age and other underwriting factors 
the increase in cost of insurance charges is due primarily to growth in the net amount at risk related to corporate and individual investment life insurance reflecting the addition of nationwide provident  new production and favorable persistency on policies sold in prior periods 
the net amount at risk related to corporate and individual investment life insurance grew to billion  including billion for nationwide provident  at the end of compared to billion  including billion for nationwide provident at the end of and billion at the end of  respectively 
the million decline in administrative fees in the year ended december  compared to the same period a year ago is primarily attributable to million of fees related to a case that terminated in the first quarter of and a decrease in the number of individual annuity contracts that charge an annual administrative fee 
surrender fees increased in compared to a year ago primarily due to the addition of nationwide provident and higher lapse activity in investment life insurance products as a result of the continued uncertainty in the equity markets 
net investment income includes the investment income earned on investments supporting fixed annuities  the guaranteed fixed option of variable annuities  the medium term note program  certain life insurance products and invested assets not allocated to product segments  net of related investment expenses 
net investment income totaled billion in compared to billion in and billion in  respectively 
these increases were primarily due to increased invested assets supporting growth in individual fixed annuities  allocations to the fixed option of variable annuities  the medium term note program  as well as the acquisition of nationwide provident  partially offset by lower yields due to declining market interest rates 
general account assets supporting insurance products are closely correlated to the underlying reserves on these products 
general account reserves supporting these products grew by billion and billion in and  respectively  and totaled billion as of december  the growth in general account reserves reflects the addition of nationwide provident business and increased customer preference for fixed products in light of continued volatile equity markets 
the company makes decisions concerning the sale of invested assets based on a variety of market  business  tax and other factors 
all realized gains and losses generated by these sales  charges related to other than temporary impairments of available for sale securities and other investments and changes in valuation allowances on mortgage loans on real estate are included as realized gains and losses on investments  hedging instruments and hedged items

other income includes management fees  commissions and other income earned by subsidiaries of the company that provide administration  marketing and distribution services 
other income includes fees generated from structured products transactions including securitization of low income housing tax credits and commercial mortgage loans 
the increase in other income in both and reflects an increase in the number of private sector pension plans sold through nationwide trust company  additional structured products transactions  and the addition of nationwide provident and tbg financial  which are included in the company s consolidated financial statements beginning october  and may   respectively 
benefits and expenses interest credited to policyholder account values totaled billion in compared to billion in and billion in and principally relates to fixed annuities  both individual and institutional  funding agreements backing the company s medium term note program and certain life insurance products 
the increase in interest credited reflects an increase in account values for these products as a result of strong fixed annuity production  increased allocations of variable annuity deposits to the guaranteed fixed option and the addition of nationwide provident fixed business  partially offset by lower crediting rates in the individual annuity and institutional products segments  on products where crediting rates have not already reached guaranteed floors 
other benefits and claims include policyholder benefits in excess of policyholder account values for universal life and individual deferred annuities and net claims and provisions for future policy benefits for traditional life insurance products and immediate annuities

amortization of dac decreased by million to million in compared to million in the substantial increase in dac amortization in reflects an acceleration of dac amortization recorded in the third quarter of as part of the regular quarterly analysis of dac  at the end of the third quarter of  the company determined that using actual experience to date and assumptions consistent with those used in the second quarter of  its individual variable annuity dac balance would be outside a pre set parameter of acceptable results 
the company also determined that it was not reasonably possible that the dac would return to an amount within the acceptable parameter within a prescribed period of time 
accordingly  the company unlocked its dac assumptions for individual variable annuities and reduced the dac asset to the amount calculated using the revised assumptions 
because the company unlocked the net separate account growth rate assumption for individual variable annuities for the three year reversion period  the company unlocked that assumption for all investment products and variable universal life insurance products to be consistent across product lines 
therefore  in  the company recorded an acceleration of dac amortization totaling million  before tax  or million  net of million of tax benefit  which has been reported in the following segments in the amounts indicated  net of tax individual annuity million  institutional products million and life insurance million 
the acceleration of dac amortization was the result of unlocking certain assumptions underlying the calculation of dac for investment products and variable universal life insurance products

as a result  at december   the company reports as a component of long term debt the junior subordinated debentures payable by nfs to the trusts 
previously  the junior subordinated debentures were eliminated in consolidation 
because the company s implementation of fin r did not result in restating prior periods  the related trust preferred securities are still in the totals of long term debt for and the terms of the senior notes contain various restrictive covenants including limitations on the disposition of subsidiaries

the preferred securities have a liquidation value of per security and must be redeemed by nfsctii when the junior subordinated debentures mature or are redeemed by nfs 
there are no sinking fund requirements related to the capital and preferred securities of subsidiary trusts 
nfs is a holding company whose principal asset is the common stock of nlic 
the principal sources of funds for nfs to pay interest  dividends and operating expenses are existing cash and investments  and dividends from nlic and other subsidiaries 
state insurance laws generally restrict the ability of insurance companies to pay cash dividends in excess of certain prescribed limitations without prior approval 
further discussion about such restrictions and dividend capacity is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements included in the f pages to this report and are hereby incorporated by reference 
nfs currently does not expect such regulatory requirements to impair its ability to pay interest  dividends  operating expenses and principal in the future 
also available as a source of funds to the company is a billion revolving credit facility entered into by nfs  nlic and nmic with a group of national financial institutions 
the facility provides for several and not joint liability with respect to any amount drawn by any party 
the facility provides covenants  including  but not limited to  requirements that the company maintain consolidated tangible net worth  as defined  in excess of billion and nlic maintain statutory surplus in excess of million 
the company had no amounts outstanding under this agreement as of december  nlic also has a million commercial paper program and is required to maintain an available credit facility equal to of any nationwide financial services  inc

table of contents amounts outstanding under the commercial paper program 
therefore borrowing capacity under the billion revolving credit facility is reduced by of any amounts outstanding under the commercial paper program 
nlic had million in commercial paper outstanding as of december  the company has an available financing capacity of billion under a shelf registration statement dated february  under the shelf registration statement  the company can issue unsecured senior or subordinated debt securities  preferred stock  class a common stock  stock purchase contracts or stock purchase units 
the company may also  in conjunction with owned trusts  may issue trust preferred securities guaranteed by nfs 
in addition  the company has a majority owned subsidiary that has available a million revolving line of credit 
the line is an annually renewable day million agreement with a single financial institution 
the line of credit is guaranteed by nfs and the line was renewed on september the company had million outstanding on this line of credit as of december  see also note to the consolidated financial statements included in the f pages of this report 
also  the company has entered into an agreement with its custodial bank to borrow against the cash collateral that is posted in connection with its securities lending program 
this is an uncommitted facility  which is contingent on the liquidity of the securities lending program 
the maximum amount available under the agreement is million 
the borrowing rate on this program rate is equal to fed funds plus basis points 
there were no amounts outstanding under this agreement as of december  a primary liquidity concern with respect to annuity and life insurance products is the risk of early policyholder withdrawal 
the company mitigates this risk by offering variable products where the investment risk is transferred to the policyholder  charging surrender fees at the time of withdrawal for certain products  applying a market value adjustment to withdrawals for certain products in the company s general account  and monitoring and matching anticipated cash inflows and outflows 
for individual annuity products billion of reserves as of december  the surrender charge is generally calculated as a percentage of the deposits made and is assessed at declining rates during the first seven years after a deposit is made 
for group annuity products billion of reserves as of december   the surrender charge amounts and periods can vary significantly  depending on the terms of each contract and the compensation structure for the producer 
generally  surrender charge percentages for group products are less than individual products because the company incurs lower expenses at contract origination for group products 
in addition  over ninety percent of the general account group annuity reserves are subject to a market value adjustment at withdrawal 
life insurance policies  while subject to withdrawal  are less susceptible to withdrawal than annuity products because policyholders generally must undergo a new underwriting process and may incur a surrender fee in order to obtain a new insurance policy 
the short term and long term liquidity requirements of the company are monitored regularly to match cash inflows with cash requirements 
the company periodically reviews its short term and long term projected sources and uses of funds and the asset liability  investment and cash flow assumptions underlying these projections 
adjustments are made periodically with respect to the company s investment policies to reflect changes in the company s short term and long term cash needs and changing business and economic conditions 
given the company s historic cash flow and current financial results  management of the company believes that the cash flow from the operating activities of the company over the next year will provide sufficient liquidity for the operations of the company  as well as provide sufficient funds to enable the company to make dividend and interest payments 
as described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in the f pages of this report  the company acquired nationwide provident effective october  the aggregate purchase price was billion  which was funded through a combination of the issuance of million shares of nfs class a common stock valued at million  the payment of million in cash and the issuance of million of policy credits 
of the total consideration  million was funded by provident and the remainder was funded with existing resources  including funds raised by the company in the form of senior debt issued in june the shares of the class a common stock issued in this transaction were valued using an average stock price covering the period extending two days before and after the date the consideration elections were closed

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk sensitive financial instruments the company is subject to potential fluctuations in earnings and the fair value of certain of its assets and liabilities  as well as variations in expected cash flows due to changes in market interest rates and equity prices 
the following discussion focuses on specific exposures the company has to interest rate and equity price risk and describes strategies used to manage these risks 
the discussion is limited to financial instruments subject to market risks and is not intended to be a complete discussion of all of the risks the company is exposed to 
interest rate risk fluctuations in interest rates can impact the company s earnings  cash flows and the fair value of its assets and liabilities 
in a declining interest rate environment  the company may be required to reinvest the proceeds from maturing and prepaying investments at rates lower than the overall yield of the portfolio  which could reduce future interest spread income 
in addition  minimum guaranteed crediting rates ranging from to for a majority of the individual annuity contracts in force on certain individual annuity contracts could prevent the company from lowering its interest crediting rates to levels commensurate with prevailing market interest rates resulting in a reduction of the company s interest spread income in the event market interest rates remain at  or decline further from  december  levels 
the average crediting rate of fixed annuity products during was and for the individual annuity and institutional products segments  respectively  well in excess of the guaranteed rates 
the company mitigates this risk by managing the maturity and interest rate sensitivities of the assets to be consistent with those of the liabilities 
during  in response to the low interest rate environment  the company reduced commissions on fixed annuity sales  launched new products with new guaranteed rates  discontinued the sale of its leading annual reset fixed annuities and implemented limits on variable annuity allocations to the guaranteed fixed option 
nationwide financial services  inc 
and subsidiaries 
table of contents conversely  a rising interest rate environment could result in a reduction of interest spread income or an increase in policyholder surrenders 
existing general account investments supporting annuity liabilities have a weighted average maturity of approximately years as of december  and therefore  the change in yield of the portfolio will lag changes in market interest rates 
this lag is increased if the rate of prepayments of securities slows 
to the extent the company sets renewal rates based on current market rates  this will result in reduced interest spreads 
alternatively  if the company sets renewal crediting rates while attempting to maintain a desired spread from the portfolio yield  the rates offered by the company may be less than new money rates offered by competitors 
this difference could result in an increase in surrender activity by policyholders 
if the company were unable to fund the surrenders with its cash flow from operations  the company may need to sell assets  which likely would have declined in value due to the increase in interest rates 
the company mitigates this risk by offering products that assess surrender charges and or market value adjustments at the time of surrender  and by managing the maturity and interest rate sensitivities of the assets to be consistent with those of the liabilities asset liability management strategies to manage interest rate risk the company employs an asset liability management approach tailored to the specific requirements of each of its products 
each product line has an investment policy based on its specific characteristics 
the policy establishes asset maturity and duration  quality and other guidelines 
the company employs cash flow testing techniques in its asset liability management process because the timing of the payment of future benefits on the majority of the company s business can be changed by the policyholder 
in addition  each year the company s annuity and insurance business is analyzed to determine the adequacy of the statutory basis reserves supporting such business 
this analysis is accomplished by projecting the anticipated cash flows from such business and the assets required to support such business under a number of possible future interest rate scenarios 
the first seven of these scenarios are required by state insurance regulation 
projections are also made using additional scenarios  which involve more extreme fluctuations in future interest rates and equity markets 
finally  to get a statistical analysis of possible results and to minimize any bias in the predetermined scenarios  additional projections are made using randomly generated interest rate scenarios 
for the company s cash flow testing process  interest rates for day treasury bills ranged from to under the predetermined scenarios and to under the random scenarios 
interest rates for longer maturity treasury securities had comparable ranges 
the values produced by each projection are used to determine future gains or losses from the company s annuity and insurance business  which  in turn  are used to quantify the adequacy of the company s statutory basis reserves over the entire projection period 
the results of the company s cash flow testing indicated that the company s statutory basis reserves were adequate as of december  use of derivatives to manage interest rate risk the company is exposed to changes in the fair value of fixed rate investments eg commercial mortgage loans and corporate bonds due to changes in interest rates 
to manage this risk  the company enters into various types of derivative instruments to minimize fluctuations in fair values resulting from changes in interest rates 
the company principally uses interest rate swaps and short euro futures to manage this risk 
under interest rate swaps  the company receives variable interest rate payments and makes fixed rate payments  thereby creating floating rate investments 
short euro futures change fixed rate cash flow exposure to variable rate 
with short euro futures  if interest rates rise fall  the gains losses on the futures adjust the fixed rate income on the investments  thereby creating floating rate investments 
as a result of entering into commercial mortgage loan and private placement commitments  the company is exposed to changes in the fair value of the commitment due to changes in interest rates during the commitment period 
to manage this risk  the company enters into short treasury futures 
with short treasury futures  if interest rates rise fall  the gains losses on the futures will offset the change in fair value of the commitment 
floating rate investments commercial mortgage loans and corporate bonds expose the company to fluctuations in cash flow and investment income due to changes in interest rates 
to manage this risk  the company enters into receive fixed  pay variable over the counter interest rate swaps or long euro futures strips to convert the variable rate investments to a fixed rate 
nationwide financial services  inc 
and subsidiaries 
table of contents in using interest rate swaps  the company receives fixed interest rate payments and makes variable rate payments  thereby creating fixed rate assets 
long euro futures change the variable rate cash flow exposure to fixed rate cash flows 
with long euro futures  if interest rates rise fall  the losses gains on the futures reduce increase the variable rate income on the investments  thereby creating fixed rate investments 
foreign currency risk management in conjunction with the company s medium term note program  from time to time  the company issues both fixed and variable rate liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
as a result  the company is exposed to changes in fair value of the liabilities due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
to manage these risks  the company enters into cross currency swaps to convert these liabilities to a us dollar rate 
for a fixed rate liability  the cross currency interest rate swap is structured to receive a fixed rate  in the foreign currency  and pay a variable us dollar rate  generally month libor 
for a variable rate foreign liability  the cross currency interest rate swap is structured to receive a variable rate  in the foreign currency  and pay a variable us dollar rate  generally month libor 
the company is exposed to changes in fair value of fixed rate investments denominated in a foreign currency due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
to manage this risk  the company uses cross currency interest rate swaps to convert these assets to variable us dollar rate instruments 
cross currency interest rate swaps on assets are structured to pay a fixed rate  in the foreign currency  and receive a variable us dollar rate  generally month libor 
cross currency interest rate swaps in place against each foreign currency obligation or investment hedge the company against adverse currency movements with respect to both period interest payments and principal repayment

immediate annuities included are non life contingent contracts in payout status where the company has guaranteed periodic  typically monthly  payments 
the maturity year is based on the terms of the contracts 
short term debt and long term debt the maturity year is the stated maturity date of the obligation 
while certain obligations are callable  either at a premium or with a make whole provision  the company currently has no plans to call the obligations prior to the stated maturity date 
derivative financial instruments the maturity year is based on the terms of the related contracts 
interest rate swaps include cross currency interest rate swaps that eliminate all foreign currency exposure the company has with existing assets and liabilities 
cross currency interest rate swaps in place against each foreign currency obligation hedge the company against adverse currency movements with respect to both period interest payments and principal repayment 
underlying details by currency have therefore been omitted 
variable swap rates and settlement prices reflect rates and prices in effect as of december  equity market risk asset fees calculated as a percentage of the separate account assets are a significant source of revenue to the company 
as of december   approximately of separate account assets were invested in equity mutual funds 
gains and losses in the equity markets will result in corresponding increases and decreases in the company s separate account assets and the reported asset fee revenue 
in addition  a decrease in separate account assets may decrease the company s expectations of future profit margins due to a decrease in asset fee revenue and or an increase in gmdb claims  which may require the company to accelerate the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs 
the company s long term assumption for net separate account returns is annual growth  earned evenly throughout the year 
if equity markets were unchanged throughout a given year  the company estimates that its net income per diluted share  calculated using current weighted average diluted shares outstanding  would be approximately to less than had the company s long term assumption for net separate account returns been realized 
this analysis assumes no other factors change and that an unlocking of dac assumptions for individual variable annuities would not be required 
although  as it does each quarter  the company would evaluate its dac balance and underlying assumptions to determine whether unlocking is appropriate 
the company can provide no assurance that the experience of flat equity market returns would not result in changes to other factors affecting profitability  including the possibility of unlocking of dac assumptions for individual variable annuities 
many of the company s individual variable annuity contracts offer guaranteed minimum death benefit gmdb features 
a gmdb generally provides a benefit if the annuitant dies and the contract value is less than a contractually defined amount 
such specified amounts vary from contract to contract based on the date the contract was entered into as well as the gmdb feature elected 
a decline in the stock market may cause the contract value to fall below this specified amount  and the net amount at risk to increase 
the net amount at risk is the amount by which the gmdb exceeds the contract value at any given time and is a primary indicator of potential future gmdb claims 
as of december   the net amount at risk  net of amounts reinsured  was billion 
to manage this risk  the company has implemented a gmdb hedging program for certain new and existing business 
the program  which is an economic hedge but does not qualify for hedge accounting under fas  is designed to offset a specified portion of changes in the value of the gmdb obligation 
currently the program shorts s p index futures  which in turn provides a partial offset to changes in the value of the designated nationwide financial services  inc 
and subsidiaries 
table of contents obligation 
prior to implementation of the gmdb hedging program in  the company managed the risk of these benefits by entering into reinsurance arrangements 
the company also offers certain variable annuity products with a guaranteed minimum accumulation benefit gmab rider 
the gmab provides the contract holder with a guaranteed return of premium  adjusted proportionately for withdrawals  after a specified period of time   or years  selected by the contract holder at the time of issuance of the variable annuity contract 
in some cases the contract holder also has the option  after a specified period of time  to drop the rider and continue the variable annuity contract without the gmab 
the gmab is an embedded derivative  and as such  the equity exposure in this product is recognized at fair value  separately from the annuity contract  with changes in fair value recognized in the income statement 
the company is exposed to equity market risk to the extent that the underlying investment options  which can include fixed and variable components selected by the contract holder  do not generate enough earnings over the life of the contract to at least equal the adjusted premiums 
the company is economically hedging the gmab exposure for those risks that exceed a level considered acceptable by purchasing interest rate futures and shorting s p futures 
the gmab economic hedge does not qualify for hedge accounting under fas upon reaching scale  the company anticipates the purchase of s p index put options and over the counter basket put options  which are constructed in order to minimize the tracking error of the hedge and the gmab liability
