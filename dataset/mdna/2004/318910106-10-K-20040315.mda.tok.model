item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition management s discussion and analysis is intended to assist readers in understanding the company s results of operations and changes in financial position for the past three years 
this review should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes beginning on page of this report and the supplemental financial data contained in tables through included with this discussion and analysis 
critical accounting policies the accounting principles followed by the company and the methods of applying these principles conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and with general practices followed by the banking industry 
certain of these principles involve a significant amount of judgment and or use of estimates based on the company s best assumptions at the time of the estimation 
the company has identified two policies as being more sensitive in terms of judgments and estimates  taking into account their overall potential impact to the company s consolidated financial statements the allowance for loan losses  and intangible assets 
allowance for loan losses due to the estimation process and the potential materiality of the amounts involved  the company has identified the accounting for the allowance for loan losses and the related provision for loan losses as an accounting policy critical to the company s consolidated financial statements 
the provision for loan losses charged to operations is an amount sufficient to bring the allowance for loan losses to an estimated balance considered adequate to absorb losses inherent in the portfolio 
management s determination of the adequacy of the allowance is based primarily on a mathematical model that estimates the appropriate allowance for loan losses 
this model has two components 
the first component involves the estimation of losses on loans defined as impaired loans 
a loan is considered to be impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable the company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
the estimated valuation allowance is the difference  if any  between the loan balance outstanding and the value of the impaired loan as determined by either an estimate of the cash flows that the company expects to receive from the borrower discounted at the loan s effective rate  or in the case of a collateral dependent loan  the fair value of the collateral 
the second component of the allowance model is to estimate losses for all loans not considered to be impaired loans 
first  loans that have been risk graded by the company as having more than standard risk but are not considered to be impaired are assigned estimated loss percentages generally accepted in the banking industry 
loans that are classified by the company as having normal credit risk are segregated by loan type  and estimated loss percentages are assigned to each loan type  based on the historical losses  current economic conditions  and operational conditions specific to each loan type 
the reserve estimated for impaired loans is then added to the reserve estimated for all other loans 
this becomes the company s allocated allowance 
in addition to the allocated allowance derived from the model  management also evaluates other data such as the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total loans  net loan growth information  nonperforming asset levels and trends in such data 
based on this additional analysis  the company may determine that an additional amount of allowance for loan losses is necessary to reserve for probable losses 
this additional amount  if any  is the company s unallocated allowance 
the sum of the allocated allowance and the unallocated allowance is compared to the actual allowance for loan losses recorded on the books of the company and any adjustment necessary for the recorded allowance to equal the computed allowance is recorded as a provision for loan losses 
the provision for loan losses is a direct charge to earnings in the period recorded 
although management uses the best information available to make evaluations  future adjustments may be necessary if economic  operational  or other conditions change 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the company s allowance for loan losses 
such agencies may require the company to recognize additions to the allowance based on the examiners judgment about information available to them at the time of their examinations 
for further discussion including a review of the range of provisions for loan losses and its impact on reported results in recent periods  see nonperforming assets and allowance for loan losses and loan loss experience under analysis of financial condition and changes in financial condition 
intangible assets due to the estimation process and the potential materiality of the amounts involved  the company has also identified the accounting for intangible assets as an accounting policy critical to the company s consolidated financial statements 
when the company completes an acquisition transaction  the excess of the purchase price over the amount by which the fair market value of assets acquired exceeds the fair market value of liabilities assumed represents an intangible asset 
the company must then determine the identifiable portions of the intangible asset  with any remaining amount classified as goodwill 
identifiable intangible assets associated with these acquisitions are generally amortized over the estimated life of the related asset  whereas goodwill is tested annually for impairment  but not systematically amortized 
assuming no goodwill impairment  it is beneficial to the company s future earnings to have a lower amount assigned to identifiable intangible assets and higher amount of goodwill as opposed to having a higher amount considered to be identifiable intangible asset and a lower amount classified as goodwill 
for the company  the only identifiable intangible asset typically recorded in connection with a whole bank or bank branch acquisition is the value of the core deposit intangible  whereas when the company acquires an insurance agency  the primary identifiable intangible asset is the value of the acquired customer list 
determining the amount of identifiable intangible assets and their average lives involves multiple assumptions and estimates and is typically determined by performing a discounted cash flow analysis  which involves a combination of any or all of the following assumptions customer attrition runoff  alternative funding costs  deposit servicing costs  and discount rates 
the company typically engages a third party consultant to assist in each analysis 
for the whole bank and bank branch transactions recorded to date  the core deposit intangible in each case has been estimated to have a ten year life  with an accelerated rate of amortization 
for the insurance agency acquisition  the identifiable intangible asset related to the customer list was determined to have a ten year life  with amortization occurring on a straight line basis 
subsequent to the initial recording of the identifiable intangible assets and goodwill  the company amortizes the identifiable intangible assets over their estimated average lives  as discussed above 
in addition  on an at least an annual basis  goodwill is evaluated for impairment by comparing the fair value of the company s reporting units to their related carrying value  including goodwill the company s community banking operations is its only material reporting unit 
at its last evaluation  the fair value of the company s community banking operations exceeded its carrying value  including goodwill 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit were ever to exceed its fair value  the company would determine whether the implied fair value of the goodwill  using a discounted cash flow analysis  exceeded the carrying value of the goodwill 
if the carrying value of the goodwill exceeded the implied fair value of the goodwill  an impairment loss would be recorded in an amount equal to that excess 
performing such a discounted cash flow analysis would involve the significant use of estimates and assumptions 
the company reviews identifiable intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
the company s policy is that an impairment loss is recognized  equal to the difference between the asset s carrying amount and its fair value  if the sum of the expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset 
estimating future cash flows involves the use of multiple estimates and assumptions  such as those listed above 
the foregoing accounting policy was adopted by the company effective on january  in accordance with newly issued accounting standards for goodwill and other intangible assets 
for acquisitions occurring prior to january   the company generally did not separately identify its identifiable intangible assets from its goodwill  as all intangible assets were amortized under accounting standards then in effect 
according to the transition provisions of the accounting standards that changed the company s accounting policy to that described above  the entire amount of those combined intangible assets was accounted for entirely as non amortizable goodwill 
see the section entitled current accounting matters below for further discussion 
merger and acquisition activity over the past three fiscal years  the company has completed several acquisitions  which has resulted in significant amounts of intangible assets being recorded by the company  as detailed below 
as noted above  the accounting for intangible assets changed significantly in with the company being required under new accounting standards to cease the amortization of goodwill 
see the section entitled current accounting matters below and note and note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding intangible assets and their amortization under previous and current accounting standards 
the company completed the following acquisitions during a uwharrie insurance group on january   the company completed the acquisition of uwharrie insurance group  a montgomery county based property and casualty insurance agency 
with eight employees  uwharrie insurance group  inc serves approximately  customers  primarily from its troy based headquarters  and had annual commissions of approximately  the primary reason for the acquisition was to gain efficiencies of scale with the company s existing property and casualty insurance business 
the acquisition resulted in the company recording an intangible asset of approximately  based on an independent appraisal   of the intangible asset recorded was determined to be attributable to the value of the noncompete agreement signed as part of the transaction and is being amortized over its two year life   was determined to be attributable to the value of the customer list and is being amortized on a straight line basis over ten years  and the remaining  was determined to be goodwill and thus will not be systematically amortized  but rather will be subject to an annual impairment test 
b on january   the company completed the acquisition of carolina community bancshares  inc ccb  the parent company of carolina community bank  a south carolina community bank with three branches in dillon county  south carolina 
this represented the company s first entry into south carolina 
dillon county  south carolina is contiguous to robeson county  north carolina  a county where the company already operated four branches 
the company s primary reason for the acquisition was to expand into a contiguous market with facilities  operations and experienced staff in place 
in this transaction  the shareholders of ccb received shares of the company s stock and in cash for each share of ccb stock they owned at the time of closing 
the transaction was completed on january   with the company paying cash of million  issuing  shares of common stock that were valued at approximately million  and assuming employee stock options with an intrinsic value of approximately million 
as of the date of the acquisition  ccb had approximately million in loans  million in deposits and million in total assets 
in connection with the acquisition of ccb  the company recorded total intangible assets of million  of which  was determined to be the value of the core deposit base and is being amortized on an accelerated basis over ten years  and million was determined to be goodwill and thus will not be systematically amortized  but rather will be subject to an annual impairment test 
c on october   the company completed the acquisition of four branches of rbc centura bank located in fairmont  harmony  kenansville  and wallace  all in north carolina 
as of the date of the acquisition  the branches had a total of approximately million in deposits and million in loans 
the primary reason for the acquisition was to expand into new markets and increase the company s customer base 
subject to certain limitations  the company paid a deposit premium of for the branches  which resulted in the company recording intangible assets relating to this purchase of million 
the identifiable intangible asset associated with the fair value of the core deposit base  as determined by an independent consulting firm  was valued at approximately million and is being amortized as expense on an accelerated basis over a ten year period 
the remaining intangible asset of million has been classified as goodwill  and thus will not be systematically amortized  but rather will be subject to an annual impairment test 
the following table contains a condensed balance sheet that indicates the amount assigned to each major asset and liability as of the respective acquisition dates for the acquisitions described above 
uwharrie carolina rbc insurance community centura assets acquired group bank branches total in millions cash securities loans  gross allowance for loan losses premises and equipment other total assets acquired liabilities assumed deposits borrowings other total liabilities assumed value of cash paid and or stock issued to stock holders of acquiree n a intangible assets recorded the company completed one acquisition in as follows a broadway branch purchase on october   the company completed the purchase of a branch of rbc centura located in broadway  north carolina

the primary reason for this acquisition was to increase the company s presence in salisbury  a market that the company entered in with the opening of a de novo branch 
an intangible asset of million was recorded in connection with this acquisition  all of which is classified as nonamortized goodwill by the company 
b insurance agency acquisitions on may   the company completed the purchase of two insurance agencies aberdeen insurance realty company and hobbs insurance and realty company 
both agencies were located in moore county and specialized in placing property and casualty insurance coverage for individuals and businesses in the moore county area 
the primary reason for this acquisition was to give the company the platform to offer property and casualty insurance to its entire customer base 
in completing the acquisition  the agencies were merged into first bank insurance services  inc approximately  shares of company stock were issued in connection with the acquisition of the two agencies 
an intangible asset of  was recorded in connection with the acquisition  which is being amortized on a straight line basis over ten years 
c century bancorp  inc on may   the company completed the purchase of century bancorp  inc century 
century was the holding company for home savings  inc  ssb  a one branch savings institution located in thomasville  nc 
century had total assets of million  total loans of million  and total deposits of million

an intangible asset of million was recorded in connection with this acquisition  all of which is classified as nonamortized goodwill by the company d robeson and scotland counties branch purchase on march   the company completed the purchase of four branches from first union national bank with aggregate deposits of approximately million and aggregate loans of approximately million 
the four branches acquired were in lumberton  pembroke  st 
pauls all located in robeson county  nc  and laurinburg scotland county  nc

pauls and increase market share in one market laurinburg 
total intangible assets of million were recorded in connection with the purchase  all of which is classified as nonamortized goodwill by the company as discussed above  each of the above transactions was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
the following table presents a summary of the fair market value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the purchases described above salisbury insurance robeson and scotland assets acquired branch agencies century counties branches total in millions cash securities loans  gross allowance for loan losses premises and equipment other total assets acquired liabilities assumed deposits borrowings other total liabilities assumed value of cash paid and or stock issued to stock holders of acquiree n a n a intangible assets recorded there are many factors that the company considers when evaluating how much to offer for potential acquisition candidates in the form of a purchase price comprised of cash and or stock for a whole company purchase or a deposit premium in a branch purchase 
most significantly  the company compares expectations of future earnings per share on a stand alone basis with projected future earnings per share assuming completion of the acquisition under various pricing scenarios 
significant assumptions that affect this analysis include the estimated future earnings stream of the acquisition candidate  the amount of cost efficiencies that can be realized  and the interest rate earned lost on the cash received paid 
in addition to the earnings per share comparison  the company also considers other factors including but not limited to marketplace acquisition statistics  location of the candidate in relation to the company s expansion strategy  market growth potential  management of the candidate  potential integration issues including corporate culture  and the size of the acquisition candidate 
analysis of results of operations net interest income  the spread between earnings on interest earning assets and the interest paid on interest bearing liabilities  constitutes the largest source of the company s earnings 
other factors that significantly affect operating results are the provision for loan losses  noninterest income such as service fees and noninterest expenses such as salaries  occupancy expense  equipment expense and other overhead costs  as well as the effects of income taxes 
overview compared to net income for the year ended december  amounted to  or per diluted share  a increase in net income and a increase in diluted earnings per share over the net income of  or per diluted share  reported for the twelve months ended december  the increase in net income in was primarily attributable to an increase in net interest income 
net interest income for the year ended december  amounted to million  an increase of million  or  over the million recorded in the increase in net interest income was caused primarily by growth in the company s loans and deposits 
average loans outstanding during were billion  or higher than in  while average deposits outstanding increased by in to billion 
the positive impact on net interest income from the increases in loans and deposits more than offset a slightly lower net interest margin realized in compared to the company s net interest margin tax equivalent net interest income divided by average earning assets for the year ended december  was compared to the net interest margin realized for the slight decrease in net interest margin was caused primarily by the negative impact of the interest rate cuts initiated by the federal reserve in the fourth quarter of and the second quarter of the acquisition of the four rbc centura bank branches in october also negatively impacted the company s net interest margin as a result of the high mix of cash assumed in the acquisition 
partially offsetting the increases in net interest income realized in was a higher provision for loan losses recorded by the company 
the provision for loan losses for was  compared to  in the higher provision for loan losses was due to high loan growth realized by the company in and not because of credit quality concerns 
internally generated net loan growth in totaled million compared to million in most components of noninterest income and noninterest expense also increased in as a result of the company s overall growth 
noninterest income for was also positively impacted by high refinancing activity driven by the low interest rate environment that increased the amount of fees from presold mortgages  the acquisition of uwharrie insurance group  which increased commissions from financial product sales  and securities gains 
the company s income taxes increased from  in to  in the increase in income tax expense was a result of higher income before income taxes 
the effective income tax rate for both years was approximately 
overview compared to net income for the year ended december  amounted to  or per diluted share  a increase in diluted earnings per share over the per diluted share for the year ended december  in accordance with the adoption of two new accounting standards  the company discontinued the amortization of most of its intangible assets in if the newly adopted accounting standards related to intangible assets had been applicable in  the company would have recorded additional net income of  or approximately per diluted share  for the twelve months ended december  the most significant factor in the company s increase in net income from to was an million  or  increase in net interest income 
the increase in net interest income was a result of a higher level of average earning assets and a higher net interest margin 
average earning assets increased in  while the company s net interest margin tax equivalent net interest income divided by average earning assets increased from in to in partially offsetting the increase in net interest income was a higher provision for loan losses 
although asset quality ratios generally improved in  the company s provision for loan losses more than doubled due to high loan growth  amounting to  in compared to  in in  the company experienced million in internal loan growth compared to million in noninterest income increased and noninterest expense increased in compared to  primarily as a result of the company s growth  including a full year s impact of the acquisitions completed in noninterest income was also positively affected in by increased mortgage loan refinancing activity that increased mortgage origination fees  as well as the offering of a check overdraft product beginning in august that increased fees earned on deposit accounts for a full months in the increase in noninterest expenses was partially offset by the near elimination of amortization expense related to intangible assets 
as noted above  in the company adopted two new accounting standards that required the company to cease amortization of virtually all of its intangible assets 
excluding amortization expense in related to intangible assets that ceased to be amortized in  the company s noninterest expenses increased in the company s income taxes increased from  in to  in the increase in income tax expense was a result of higher income before income taxes 
the effective income tax rate for both years was approximately 
net interest income net interest income on a reported basis amounted to  in   in  and  in for internal purposes and in the discussion that follows  the company evaluates its net interest income on a tax equivalent basis by adding the tax benefit realized from tax exempt securities to reported interest income 
net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis amounted to  in   in  and  in table analyzes net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis 
the company s net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis increased by in and in there are two primary factors that cause changes in the amount of net interest income recorded by the company growth in loans and deposits  and the company s net interest margin tax equivalent net interest income divided by average interest earning assets 
as illustrated in table  in both and  net interest income was positively impacted by higher amounts of average loans and deposits outstanding 
in  the average amount of loans outstanding increased and the average amount of deposits outstanding increased 
in  the average amount of loans outstanding grew by  while the average amount of deposits increased by 
the higher amounts of loans and deposits outstanding in and were a result of both internal growth  as well as growth achieved in corporate acquisitions 
in  most of the loan growth was generated internally while most of the deposit growth was assumed in acquisitions 
the company internally generated million in net loan growth in  while million was assumed in acquisitions 
internally generated deposit growth in amounted to million  while the company assumed million in deposits through acquisitions during the year 
in  the increase in the average amount of loans and deposits outstanding was partially a result of a full year s effect of high growth as well as growth realized in  most all of which was internally generated 
in  loans grew by million  with all but million of the growth internally generated  while deposits grew by million  with all but million internally generated 
in  the positive impact on net interest income from the increases in loans and deposits more than offset slightly lower net interest margins realized in compared to  while in a higher net interest margin enhanced net interest income 
the company s net interest margin tax equivalent net interest income divided by average earning assets was in compared to in and in the variations in net interest margin over the past two years have largely been a result of the federal reserve s interest rate policies during that time  as discussed below 
in  the company s interest rate spreads were negatively impacted by the federal reserve board cutting interest rates times totaling basis points  which resulted in a decrease in the company s net interest margin to from in 
although at january  the company has had more interest sensitive liabilities than interest sensitive assets subject to repricing within twelve months  the company s interest sensitive assets repriced sooner generally the day following the interest rate cut and by a larger percentage generally by the same number of basis points that the federal reserve discount rate was decreased than did the company s interest sensitive liabilities that were subject to repricing 
the company s primary interest sensitive assets are its interest bearing cash  maturing investments  and adjustable rate loans which are typically of the company s total loan portfolio  while its primary interest sensitive liabilities consist of the following savings  now  and money market deposits  and time deposits 
interest rates paid on savings  now and money market deposits are set by management of the company  and although the interest rates on these accounts were decreased by the company within days of each of the federal reserve rate cuts that have occurred in recent years  it has not been possible to reduce the interest rates by the full amount of the federal reserve cuts due to competitive considerations and the already relatively low rates paid on these types of accounts 
interest rates paid on time deposits are generally fixed and not subject to automatic adjustment 
when time deposits mature  the company has the opportunity  at the customers discretion  to renew the time deposit at a rate set by the company 
because time deposits that are interest sensitive in a twelve month horizon mature throughout the twelve month period  any change in the renewal rate will affect only a portion of the twelve month period 
also  although changes in interest rates on renewing time deposits generally track rate changes in the interest rate environment  the company has not been able in recent years to decrease rates on renewing time deposits by the corresponding decreases in the federal reserve discount rate because of competitive pressures in the company s market 
in  there were no changes to interest rates initiated by the federal reserve for the first ten months of the year 
this allowed a significant portion of the company s time deposit portfolio that had been originated when rates were higher to mature and reprice at lower rates as noted above  much of the company s interest sensitive assets had repriced immediately in when the rate cuts were made and did not experience further declines 
largely due to these factors  the company s net interest margin increased in each of the first three quarters of  peaking at in the third quarter of the basis point rate cut announced by the federal reserve on november  negatively impacted the company s net interest margin in the fourth quarter of and into in much the same way as the rate cuts did 
the company s fourth quarter of net interest margin decreased to from the margin realized in the third quarter of in  although the company s deposits continued to reprice downward  the basis rate cut in november and the subsequent june  rate cut of basis points had a more pronounced and a longer lasting negative impact on the company s net interest margin than previous rate cuts because of the inability of the company to reset deposit rates by an amount because of their already near zero rates that would offset the negative impact of the rate cut on the yields earned on the company s interest earning assets 
despite the relatively stable interest rate environment in  with just the one rate cut in june  this factor was largely responsible for preventing a rebound in net interest margin similar to that realized in for the first three quarters of  the company s net interest margin was within six basis points of the margin realized in the fourth quarter of the company s net interest margin of in the fourth quarter of was negatively impacted by the acquisition of four rbc centura bank branches in october as a result of the high mix of cash assumed in the acquisition 
in connection with this acquisition  the company received approximately million in cash that was not able to immediately be deployed into a mix of assets with higher yields consistent with the company s typical mix 
another negative factor on the company s net interest margin over the past two years  which has had a heightened impact from the declining interest rate environment  has been a significant change in the company s loan mix from fixed rate loans to adjustable rate loans 
since december   the company has experienced a shift in its loan portfolio from having fixed rate loans and adjustable rate loans to a mix of adjustable rate and fixed rate 
the primary reason for this shift has been that with interest rates at a historically low level  the company has more attractively priced adjustable rate loans in order to avoid locking in fixed rate loans at a time when most economists believe that rates will rise 
although the company will benefit from having a higher percentage of adjustable rate loans upon a rise in rates  the shift has negatively impacted the company in the declining rate environment experienced over the past two years 
another factor that positively impacted the company s net interest margin when comparing to was the reinvestment of funds received in the company s acquisitions and the mix of loans and deposits assumed in the acquisitions 
the march acquisition of four branches from first union national bank resulted in the company receiving million in cash 
the company was not able to immediately redeploy the cash received into a mix of higher yielding investments and loans consistent with the company s historic asset mix  and therefore the company s net interest margin was negatively impacted 
in  due to the high loan growth experienced by the company  a significant portion of this cash was redeployed into loans with higher interest rates than the short term investments in which the cash had been invested 
additionally  in connection with the acquisition of century bancorp in may  the company assumed a high mix of residential mortgage loans and time deposits which are generally the lowest yielding type of loan and highest rate type of deposit 
this mix of loans and deposits negatively impacted net interest margins in in  many of century s loans were refinanced by the borrowers and then resold in the secondary market by the company  with the resulting funds used to fund the company s commercial loan growth which generally has higher interest rates than residential mortgages 
in addition  many of century s time deposits also had the opportunity to reprice at lower rates in  thus positively impacting the net interest margin 
see additional information regarding net interest income in the section entitled interest rate risk 
provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses charged to operations is an amount sufficient to bring the allowance for loan losses to an estimated balance considered appropriate to absorb probable losses inherent in the portfolio 
management s determination of the adequacy of the allowance is based on the level of loan growth  an evaluation of the portfolio  current economic conditions  historical loan loss experience and other risk factors 
the company recorded provisions for loan losses of  in compared to  in and  in the increase in the provisions for loan losses in each of the past two years has been primarily related to increases in the company s net internal loan growth  as asset quality ratios have remained fairly stable 
net internal loan growth in was million compared to million in and million in the remaining loan growth of million in  million in  and million in came by way of acquisitions with a preexisting allocation for loan losses already in place 
a specific reserve of  that was established in related to the company s largest nonaccrual loan relationship also impacted the company s provision for loan losses 
see the section entitled allowance for loan losses and loan loss experience below for a more detailed discussion of the allowance for loan losses 
the allowance is monitored and analyzed regularly in conjunction with the company s loan analysis and grading program  and adjustments are made to maintain an adequate allowance for loan losses 
noninterest income noninterest income recorded by the company amounted to  in   in  and  in as shown in table  core noninterest income  which excludes gains and losses from sales of securities  loans  and other assets  amounted to  in  a increase from the  in the core noninterest income of  was higher than the  recorded in see table and the following discussion for an understanding of the components of noninterest income 
service charges on deposit accounts in amounted to  a increase compared to the  recorded in the amount of  was higher than the amount of  the primary factors that have increased the amount of service charges on deposits have been periodic rate increases  service charges earned from internally generated deposit growth  and services charges earned from acquired deposits 
deposit service charge rates are generally increased per year  while internal growth among deposit transaction accounts was in and in the acquisition of ccb on january  contributed approximately  in deposit service charges during  while the acquisition of the four rbc centura branches on october  contributed approximately  in deposit service charges in the  in deposit service charges from these two acquisitions accounted for approximately of the increase in service charges on deposit accounts in the increase in service charges on deposit accounts from to was also impacted by the acquisition of five first union branches during and the introduction of a product in august that charges a fee for allowing customers to overdraw their deposit account 
realizing a full twelve months of income in from the branch acquisitions impacted deposit service charge income by approximately  while having the overdraft product for a full twelve months increased deposit service charges realized in by approximately  over other service charges  commissions and fees amounted to  in  a increase from the  earned in the amount of  was higher than the  recorded in this category of noninterest income includes items such as safety deposit box rentals  fees from sales of personalized checks  check cashing fees  credit card and merchant income  debit card income  and atm charges 
this category of income grew primarily because of increases in these activity related fee services as a result of overall growth in the company s total customer base  including growth achieved from corporate acquisitions 
fees from presold mortgages amounted to  in  a increase from the amount of  the amount was a increase from the  recorded in the increases in the past two years have been primarily attributable to a higher level of mortgage loan refinancings caused by the progressively lower interest rate environment 
in the last months of and continuing into  a rise in mortgage interest rates has significantly slowed mortgage refinancing activity and thus negatively impacted the amount of these fees realized by the company 
commissions from sales of insurance and financial products amounted to  in   in  and  in this line item includes commissions the company receives from three sources sales of credit insurance associated with new loans  commissions from the sales of investment  annuity  and long term care insurance products  and commissions from the sale of property and casualty insurance 
the following table presents the contribution of each of the three sources to the total amount recognized in this line item in thousands commissions earned from sales of credit insurance sales of investments  annuities  and long term care insurance sales of property and casualty insurance total  the variance in the commissions from sales of credit insurance has been primarily due to fluctuations in the annual profit sharing bonus that the company received from the insurance carriers for which the company acts as a broker 
the increase in commissions from sales of investments  annuities  and long term care insurance is primarily due to the hiring of additional staff in this area during as it relates to commissions earned from the sale of property and casualty insurance  the company began realizing these commissions upon the may completion of the purchase of two insurance companies that specialize in such insurance 
the increase in these commissions from to was the result of realizing a full year of commissions  whereas the increase in was a result of the acquisition of uwharrie insurance group  which was completed on january  see the section above entitled merger and acquisition activity for additional discussion 
data processing fees amounted to  in   in  and  in as noted earlier  montgomery data makes its excess data processing capabilities available to area financial institutions for a fee 
these fees have increased as a result of an increase in data processing clients from two clients to four clients in the past three years  as well as an increase in the size and number of transactions generated by those clients 
noninterest income not considered to be core amounted to net gains of  in   in  and  in the net gain of  primarily related to securities gains of  and an  gain from a sale of vacant land located beside one of the company s existing branches 
the  in securities gains related to sales initiated in the third and fourth quarters of in the third quarter of  the company sold a corporate bond at a gain of  in order to realize current income  as well as to lock in a gain on the security  which had an approaching call date 
in the fourth quarter of  the company sold a pool of mortgage backed securities at a total gain of  in order to realize current income  as well as to dispose of the securities before their low  amortizing  principal balance significantly affected their liquidity the securities sold had an average principal balance of  and were paying down by approximately  per month 
the net gain of  primarily related to miscellaneous securities gains of  the net gain of  primarily related to a  gain from the sale of two buildings that the company previously operated as branches that were consolidated with other branches in the same towns  and securities that were sold at a  gain 
noninterest expenses noninterest expenses for were  compared to  in and  in table presents the components of the company s noninterest expense during the past three years 
based on the recorded amounts noted above  noninterest expenses increased in and in the growth rate from to was impacted by a change in accounting for intangible assets  which served to reduce the year to year increase 
as of january  the company ceased to record amortization expense related to its goodwill  which eliminated almost all of the company s amortization expense 
adjusting the reported amount in to exclude amortization expense related to intangible assets that ceased to be amortized beginning on january   the increase in noninterest expenses from to was 
the increases in noninterest expenses over the past two years have occurred in nearly every line item of expense and have been primarily as a result of the significant growth experienced by the company  both internally and by acquisition 
over the past two years  the number of the company s branches has increased from to  and the number of full time part time employees has increased from at december  to at december  additionally  from december  to december   the amount of loans outstanding increased and deposits increased 
income taxes the provision for income taxes was  in   in  and  in the increase in income tax expense over the past two years has been directly correlated with the increase in the company s income before income taxes  as the effective tax rate for each of the years ended december   and was approximately

analysis of financial condition and changes in financial condition overview over the past two years the company has achieved high increases in its levels of loans and deposits through a combination of internal growth and growth from acquisitions 
the following table presents information regarding the nature of the company s growth in and percentage balance at balance at total growth  in thousands beginning of internal growth from end of percentage excluding period growth acquisitions period growth acquisitions loans     deposits noninterest bearing     deposits savings  now  and money market     deposits time      deposits time      total deposits     loans     deposits noninterest bearing     deposits savings  now  and money market     deposits time     deposits time      total deposits     as can be seen in the table above  the company experienced high increases in loans in each of the years and with total growth of and  respectively 
internal loan growth was strong both years  amounting to in and in loans assumed in acquisitions boosted the loan growth rate from to  while acquired loan growth in was insignificant 
deposits increased in and in internally generated deposit growth was modest in both years  amounting to in and in deposits assumed in the ccb acquisition and the purchase of the four rbc centura branches totaling million boosted total deposit growth from to  while acquired deposits in branch acquisition in broadway  nc added million in deposits  increasing the total deposit growth from to 
the company believes the significantly higher internal growth rates for loans compared to deposits over the past two years is largely attributable to the type of customers the company has been able to attract 
most of the company s loan growth has come from small business customers that need loans in order to expand their business  and have few deposits 
additionally  the company has found it difficult to compete for retail deposits in recent years 
the company frequently competes against banks in the marketplace that either are so large that they enjoy better economies of scale over the company and can thus offer higher rates  or are recently started banks that are focused on building market share  and not necessarily positive earnings  by offering high deposit rates 
the company enjoys advantages in the loan marketplace by having seasoned lenders in place that have the experience necessary to oversee the completion of a loan and the autonomy to be able to make timely decisions 
with loan growth exceeding deposit growth over each of the past two years  the company s liquidity has been reduced 
in  the company s liquidity had improved significantly as a result of receiving million in net cash in connection with acquisitions 
these funds served as the primary source of funding needs in in  although the company s acquired deposits exceeded its acquired loans by million  internal loan growth exceeded internal deposit growth by million  which resulted in a reduction in the company s liquidity 
the company increased its borrowings from million to million in in order to fund the excess loan growth 
the company s significant acquisition activity over the past three years has required the company to raise capital in order to maintain its well capitalized capital ratio status 
accordingly  the company raised capital in each of the fourth quarters of and by issuing million each year for a total of million in trust preferred debt securities  which qualify as regulatory capital for the company 
all of the company s capital ratios have significantly exceeded the minimum regulatory thresholds for all periods covered by this report 
although the company s market area  the central piedmont region of north carolina  has experienced recessionary times over the past several years consistent with the national economy  the company s asset quality ratios have remained fairly stable over the past three years with net charges offs to average loans ranging from basis points to basis points and nonperforming assets to total assets ranging from basis points to basis points 
the company does not participate in large syndicated credits that have resulted in large credit losses at several other north carolina based banks 
distribution of assets and liabilities table sets forth the percentage relationships of significant components of the company s balance sheets at december    and the most significant variance in the percentages over the past two years has been the increase in the percentage of loans to total assets  which increased from at december  to at december   and the declining percentage of deposits to total assets which declined from to over that same two year period 
these changes are a result of the high loan growth and lower deposit growth experienced over that same time period that was discussed in the section above 
on the asset side  the increasing loan percentage has been offset by a lower amount of securities and short term investments held by the company  while on the liability side  an increase in borrowings has offset the lower deposit percentage 
although a higher reliance on borrowings negatively impacts the company s net interest margin because of their higher cost compared to deposits  the company has used the proceeds from the borrowings to fund loans  which carry a higher interest rate than the borrowings  and thus the net effect is a positive impact on net interest income 
securities information regarding the company s securities portfolio as of december    and is presented in tables and the composition of the investment securities portfolio reflects the company s investment strategy of maintaining an appropriate level of liquidity while providing a relatively stable source of income 
the investment portfolio also provides a balance to interest rate risk and credit risk in other categories of the balance sheet while providing a vehicle for the investment of available funds  furnishing liquidity  and supplying securities to pledge as required collateral for certain deposits 
total securities available for sale and held to maturity amounted to million  million  and million at december    and  respectively 
the increase in securities available for sale from december  to december  was primarily attributable to security purchases with funds obtained from the october rbc centura branch purchase 
the decrease in securities from december  to december  was primarily attributable to called and maturing bonds  as well as a high level of principal repayments on mortgage backed securities due to the low interest rate environment 
instead of reinvesting the maturities paydowns back into securities  the proceeds were used to fund the high loan growth experienced 
the mix of the types of the company s securities was similar at december  as it was two years earlier 
in the intervening year of  the mix of securities changed due to the above noted variances in the receipt of maturities paydowns of the various categories of investments  as the company purchased very few securities as a result of the proceeds of the maturities paydowns being used to fund loan growth 
upon the company s purchase of the four branches of rbc centura on october   the company received approximately million cash  a significant portion of which was invested in securities 
the company purchased primarily us government agency securities with these funds in order to assure a portfolio mix consistent with the company s investment policy  which limits the amount of mortgage backed securities and corporate bonds in which the company can invest 
the majority of the company s us government agency debt securities are issued by the federal home loan bank and carry one maturity date  often with an issuer call feature  while the mortgage backed securities have been primarily issued by freddie mac and fannie mae and vary in their repayment in correlation with the underlying pools of home mortgage loans 
the company s investment in corporate bonds is primarily comprised of trust preferred securities issued by other north carolina bank holding companies 
included in mortgage backed securities at december  were collateralized mortgage obligations cmos with an amortized cost of  and a fair value of  included in mortgage backed securities at december  were cmos with an amortized cost of  and a fair value of  included in mortgage backed securities at december  were cmos with an amortized cost of  and a fair value of  the cmos that the company has invested in are substantially all early tranche pieces of the cmo  which minimizes long term interest rate risk to the company 
at december   net unrealized gains of  were included in the carrying value of securities classified as available for sale  compared to a net unrealized gain of  at december  and a net unrealized gain of  at december  the increase in the unrealized gain position at each of the past two year ends are a result of the progressively lower interest rate environment in effect at each period end 
management evaluated any unrealized losses on individual securities at each year end and determined them to be of a temporary nature and caused by fluctuations in market interest rates  not by concerns about the ability of the issuers to meet their obligations 
net unrealized gains  net of applicable deferred income taxes  of   and  have been reported as part of a separate component of shareholders equity accumulated other comprehensive income as of december    and  respectively 
the fair value of securities held to maturity  which the company carries at amortized cost  was more than the carrying value at december  and by  and  respectively 
management evaluated any unrealized losses on individual securities at each year end and determined them to be of a temporary nature and caused by fluctuations in market interest rates  not by concerns about the ability of the issuers to meet their obligations 
table provides detail as to scheduled contractual maturities and book yields on securities available for sale and securities held to maturity at december  mortgage backed and other amortizing securities are shown maturing in the time periods consistent with their estimated lives based on expected prepayment speeds 
the weighted average taxable equivalent yield for the securities available for sale portfolio was at december  the expected weighted average life of the available for sale portfolio using the call date for above market callable bonds  the maturity date for all other non mortgage backed securities  and the expected life for mortgage backed securities  was years 
the weighted average taxable equivalent yield for the securities held to maturity portfolio was at december  the expected weighted average life of the held to maturity portfolio using the call date for above market callable bonds and the maturity date for all other securities  was years 
as of december  and  the company held no investment securities of any one issuer  other than us treasury and us government agencies or corporations  in which aggregate book values and market values exceeded of shareholders equity 
loans table provides a summary of the loan portfolio composition at each of the past five year ends 
the loan portfolio is the largest category of the company s earning assets and is comprised of commercial loans  real estate mortgage loans  real estate construction loans  and consumer loans 
the company restricts virtually all of its lending to its county market area  which is located in the central piedmont region of north carolina  and one county each in virginia and south carolina 
the diversity of the region s economic base has historically provided a stable lending environment 
loans outstanding increased million  or  to billion during approximately million of the growth was from net internal loan growth  while million was assumed in acquisitions 
loans outstanding increased million  or  to million during approximately million of the growth was from net internal loan growth  while million was assumed in acquisitions 
the majority of the and loan growth occurred in loans secured by real estate  with approximately million  or in  and million  or  in of the net loan growth occurring in real estate mortgage or real estate construction loans 
over the years  the company s loan mix has remained fairly consistent  with real estate loans mortgage and construction comprising approximately of the loan portfolio  commercial  financial  and agricultural loans comprising  and consumer installment loans comprising approximately of the portfolio 
at december   billion  or  of the company s loan portfolio was secured by liens on real property 
included in this total are million  or of total loans  in loans secured by liens on family residential properties and million  or of total loans  in loans secured by liens on other types of real estate 
at december   billion  or  of the company s loan portfolio was secured by liens on real property 
included in this total were million  or of total loans  in loans secured by liens on family residential properties and million  or of total loans  in loans secured by liens on other types of real estate 
the company s billion in real estate mortgage loans at december  can be further classified as follows for comparison purposes  the classification of the company s million real estate loan portfolio at december  is shown in parenthesis o million  or of total loans vs 
million  or of total loans  are primarily dependent on cash flow from a commercial business for repayment 
o million  or of total loans vs 
million  or of total loans  are traditional residential mortgage loans in which the borrower s personal income is the primary repayment source 
o million  or of total loans vs 
million  or of total loans  are real estate construction loans 
o million  or of total loans vs 
million or of total loans  are home equity loans 
o million  or of total loans vs

table provides a summary of scheduled loan maturities over certain time periods  with fixed rate loans and adjustable rate loans shown separately 
approximately of the company s loans outstanding at december  mature within one year and of total loans mature within five years 
the percentages of variable rate loans and fixed rate loans as compared to total performing loans were and  respectively  as of december  the company intentionally makes a blend of fixed and variable rate loans so as to reduce interest rate risk 
as noted in the section above entitled net interest income  the company has experienced a significant shift in its fixed variable loan mix over the past two years 
nonperforming assets nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans  loans past due or more days and still accruing interest  restructured loans and other real estate 
as a matter of policy the company places all loans that are past due or more days on nonaccrual basis  and thus there were no loans at any of the past five year ends that were days past due and still accruing interest 
table summarizes the company s nonperforming assets at the dates indicated 
nonaccrual loans are loans on which interest income is no longer being recognized or accrued because management has determined that the collection of interest is doubtful 
placing loans on nonaccrual status negatively impacts earnings because i interest accrued but unpaid as of the date a loan is placed on nonaccrual status is either deducted from interest income or is charged off  ii future accruals of interest income are not recognized until it becomes probable that both principal and interest will be paid and iii principal charged off  if appropriate  may necessitate additional provisions for loan losses that are charged against earnings 
in some cases  where borrowers are experiencing financial difficulties  loans may be restructured to provide terms significantly different from the originally contracted terms 
nonperforming loans which includes nonaccrual loans and restructured loans as of december   and totaled   and  respectively 
nonperforming loans as a percentage of total loans amounted to   and  at december    and  respectively 
the variances in nonperforming loans over the past two years have been primarily due to changes in nonaccrual loans  as restructured loans have not changed significantly 
the increase in nonaccrual loans from december  to december  relates primarily to the company placing five loans totaling million on nonaccrual basis during the year 
each of these unrelated loans has an outstanding loan balance of between  and  and each loan is secured by real estate 
the company believes that any losses related to these loans will not be material 
the decrease in nonaccrual loans from december  to december  relates primarily to a decrease in the outstanding balance of the company s largest nonaccrual loan relationship 
during  the company placed a loan relationship on nonaccrual status that had an outstanding balance of million at december  this relationship  secured primarily by real estate  was placed on nonaccrual status due to liquidity problems experienced by the borrower 
the borrower has been actively working to sell real estate to pay down the balance  and during several sales were completed that resulted in the company receiving paydowns of approximately  at december   the company had accepted a nonbinding proposal from a third party that would result in the receipt of approximately  of the million balance 
accordingly  in the fourth quarter of  the company established a specific impaired loan valuation allowance of  for this relationship 
during the first quarter of  because the company believed that there was a high likelihood that the terms of the nonbinding proposal would occur  the company charged off the  specific reserve that had been established  resulting in a  balance 
over the course of the remainder of  numerous delays occurred relating to the pay off proposal  and management of the company is no longer sure whether it will occur 
the company continues to actively seek collection of the loan 
during the third quarter of  the borrower sold a piece of real estate  the net proceeds of which were used to pay down the principal balance by  resulting in a remaining balance of  at december  the company has assigned a specific impaired loan valuation allowance of  to the remaining balance at december  if the nonaccrual loans and restructured loans as of december   and had been current in accordance with their original terms and had been outstanding throughout the period or since origination if held for part of the period  gross interest income in the amounts of approximately   and  for nonaccrual loans and   and  for restructured loans would have been recorded for  and  respectively 
interest income on such loans that was actually collected and included in net income in  and amounted to approximately   and  for nonaccrual loans prior to their being placed on nonaccrual status and   and  for restructured loans  respectively 
management routinely monitors the status of certain large loans that  in management s opinion  have credit weaknesses that could cause them to become nonperforming loans 
in addition to the nonperforming loan amounts discussed above  management believes that an estimated million of loans that were performing in accordance with their contractual terms at december  have the potential to develop problems depending upon the particular financial situations of the borrowers and economic conditions in general 
management has taken these potential problem loans into consideration when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses at december  see discussion below 
loans classified for regulatory purposes as loss  doubtful  substandard  or special mention that have not been disclosed in the problem loan amounts and the potential problem loan amounts discussed above do not represent or result from trends or uncertainties that management reasonably expects will materially impact future operating results  liquidity  or capital resources  or represent material credits about which management is aware of any information that causes management to have serious doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with the loan repayment terms 
other real estate includes foreclosed  repossessed  and idled properties 
other real estate has not varied materially at any of the past three year ends  amounting to  at december    at december   and  at december  other real estate represented   and of total assets at the end of   and  respectively 
the company s management believes that the fair values of the items of other real estate  less estimated costs to sell  equal or exceed their respective carrying values at the dates presented 
allowance for loan losses and loan loss experience the allowance for loan losses is created by direct charges to operations 
losses on loans are charged against the allowance in the period in which such loans  in management s opinion  become uncollectible 
the recoveries realized during the period are credited to this allowance 
the company considers its procedures for recording the amount of the allowance for loan losses and the related provision for loan losses to be a critical accounting policy 
see the heading critical accounting policies above for further discussion 
the factors that influence management s judgment in determining the amount charged to operating expense include past loan loss experience  composition of the loan portfolio  evaluation of probable inherent losses and current economic conditions 
the company uses a loan analysis and grading program to facilitate its evaluation of probable inherent loan losses and the adequacy of its allowance for loan losses 
in this program  risk grades are assigned by management and tested by the company s internal audit department and an independent third party consulting firm 
the testing program includes an evaluation of a sample of new loans  loans that management identifies as having potential credit weaknesses  loans past due days or more  nonaccrual loans and any other loans identified during previous regulatory and other examinations 
the company strives to maintain its loan portfolio in accordance with what management believes are conservative loan underwriting policies that result in loans specifically tailored to the needs of the company s market areas 
every effort is made to identify and minimize the credit risks associated with such lending strategies 
the company has no foreign loans  few agricultural loans and does not engage in significant lease financing or highly leveraged transactions 
commercial loans are diversified among a variety of industries 
the majority of loans captioned in the tables discussed below as real estate loans are primarily various personal and commercial loans where real estate provides additional security for the loan 
collateral for virtually all of these loans is located within the company s principal market area 
the allowance for loan losses amounted to  at december  compared to  as of december  and  at december  this represented   and  of loans outstanding as of december    and  respectively 
the slight increases in this percentage is primarily a result of a slight shift in the composition of the company s loan portfolio from residential mortgage loans to commercial loans commercial loans carry a higher reserve percentage in the company s allowance for loan loss model than do residential mortgage loans 
the slight shift from residential mortgage loans to commercial loans has been intentional 
two of the company s recent bank acquisitions first savings bancorp in september and century bancorp in may had loan portfolios that were highly concentrated in residential mortgage loans 
as many of those loans have refinanced at lower rates over the past months  the company chose to sell them in the secondary market instead of holding them in the company s loan portfolio 
this strategy was implemented in an effort to shift the company s loan portfolio to having a higher percentage of commercial loans  which are generally shorter term in nature and have higher interest rates 
as noted in table  the company s allowance for loan losses as a percentage of nonperforming loans coverage ratio amounted to at december   compared to at december  and at december  the change in the coverage ratio is inversely proportional to the level of nonperforming loans at each period end 
due to the secured nature of virtually all of the company s loans that are on nonaccrual status  the variance in the coverage ratio is not necessarily indicative of the relative adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
table sets forth the allocation of the allowance for loan losses at the dates indicated 
the portion of these reserves that was allocated to specific loan types in the loan portfolio increased to  at december  from  at december  and  at december  the increase in the amount of the allocated allowance during is consistent with the increase in total loans outstanding 
similarly  the increase in the amount of the allocated allowance during is consistent with the increase in total loans outstanding 
the slightly higher increase in the allocated allowance compared to the increase in loan growth for each of the past two years relates to the company s loan mix shifting slightly from residential real estate loans to commercial real estate loans which carry a higher reserve allocation in the company s allowance model as discussed two paragraphs above 
in addition to the allocated portion of the allowance for loan losses  the company maintains an unallocated portion that is not assigned to any specific category of loans  but rather is intended to reserve for the inherent risk in the overall portfolio and the intrinsic inaccuracies associated with the estimation of the allowance for loan losses and its allocation to specific loan categories 
the amount of the unallocated portion of the allowance for loan losses did not vary materially at any of the past three year ends  while the decrease in the unallocated allowance from to was related to the company segregating and assigning higher reserve percentages to particular loan types that were identified during as having inherently higher risk this resulted in a portion of the allowance for loan losses shifting from unallocated to allocated 
these additional risk characteristics were noted by management as a part of its ongoing analysis and review of its loan portfolio and historical charge off experience  and did not result from any deterioration of the portfolio during management considers the allowance for loan losses adequate to cover probable loan losses on the loans outstanding as of each reporting date 
it must by emphasized  however  that the determination of the allowance using the company s procedures and methods rests upon various judgments and assumptions about economic conditions and other factors affecting loans 
no assurance can be given that the company will not in any particular period sustain loan losses that are sizable in relation to the amount reserved or that subsequent evaluations of the loan portfolio  in light of conditions and factors then prevailing  will not require significant changes in the allowance for loan losses or future charges to earnings 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the allowances for loan losses and losses on foreclosed real estate 
such agencies may require the company to recognize additions to the allowances based on the examiners judgments about information available to them at the time of their examinations 
for the years indicated  table summarizes the company s balances of loans outstanding  average loans outstanding  and a detailed rollforward of the allowance for loan losses 
in addition to the increases to the allowance for loan losses related to normal provisions  the increases in the dollar amounts of the allowance for loan losses in each of the most recent three years were also affected by amounts recorded to provide for loans assumed in corporate acquisitions 
in  the company recorded  to the allowance for loan losses related to loans assumed in two corporate acquisitions 
approximately  of the  related to million in loans assumed in the october rbc centura branch acquisition  while  related to the ccb acquisition 
the  addition related to ccb represented the book value of ccb s allowance for loan losses on the date of the acquisition 
in   was recorded for loans assumed in the broadway branch acquisition in which the company assumed approximately million in loans 
in  the company recorded  to the allowance for loan losses related to loans assumed in two corporate acquisitions 
approximately  of the  related to million in mostly consumer loans assumed in the march and december branch acquisitions  while  related to the century acquisition 
the  addition related to century represented the book value of century s allowance for loan losses on the date of the acquisition 
the company s net loan charge offs did not fluctuate significantly in any of the past three years  amounting to approximately  in   in  and  in this represents   and of average loans during   and respectively 
deposits the average amounts of deposits of the company and the average yield paid for those deposits for the years ended december   and are presented in table average deposits grew to billion in  an increase of million  or 
in  the company s average deposits experienced growth of million  or 
approximately half of the increase in average deposits in was a result of deposits assumed via acquisition during the year ccb s deposit base of million was assumed by the company on january   while the assumption of the million in deposits in the rbc branch purchase acquisition on october  increased average balances for the year by approximately million during the months they were owned by the company in most of the remainder of the growth in average deposits related to the internal deposit growth of million experienced during the year  as well as the full year s effect of the million in internally generated deposit growth in  nearly all of which was experienced in the second half of the year 
approximately half of the increase in average deposits in related to corporate acquisitions completed in the previous year  which increased deposits outstanding a total of million over the course of the year 
the effect of having the acquired deposits for all months in coupled with the increase in the year end balance at december  compared to december  resulted in the increase in average deposits for the year 
the increase in average deposits in occurred in all categories of deposits  with interest bearing demand deposits increasing by  savings deposits increasing by  time deposits  time deposits greater than  increasing by and noninterest bearing deposits experiencing the highest growth at 
the higher percentage growth in the non time deposit categories  except time deposits greater than  continued the trend the company noted in in which many time deposit customers deposited their maturing time deposits into other categories of deposits rather than renew their time deposits at the historically low rates in effect 
the increase in time deposits greater than  was largely a result of the company offering competitive interest rates on this product in order to fund the strong loan growth experienced 
the increase in average deposits in was primarily driven by increases in the non time deposit categories 
during  average noninterest bearing demand deposits increased  interest bearing demand deposits increased  and savings deposits increased 
average time deposits and time deposits greater than  increased at lower rates of and respectively 
the higher increases in non time deposits were primarily a result of the mix of the company s deposit acquisitions and the mix of the company s deposit growth 
the company s acquisitions were comprised of a high mix of non time deposits  while in the company noted that many customers deposited their maturing time deposits into other categories of deposits rather than renewing their time deposits at the historically low rates in effect 
as of december   the company held approximately million in time deposits of  or more and other time deposits of million 
table is a maturity schedule of time deposits of  or more as of december  this table shows that of the company s time deposits greater than  mature within one year 
at each of the past three year ends  the company had no brokered deposits  nor had the company issued any time deposits through foreign offices  nor did the company believe that it held any deposits by foreign depositors 
borrowings at december   the company has three sources of readily available borrowing capacity an approximately million line of credit with the fhlb  of which million was outstanding at december  and million was outstanding at december   a million overnight federal funds line of credit with a correspondent bank  none of which was outstanding at december  or  and an approximately million line of credit through the federal reserve bank of richmond s frb discount window  none of which was outstanding at december  or the company s line of credit with the fhlb totaling approximately million can be structured as either short term or long term borrowings  depending on the particular funding or liquidity need and is secured by the company s fhlb stock and a blanket lien on its one to four family residential loan portfolio 
the company had million outstanding under this line of credit at december   with million outstanding on an overnight basis and the other million maturing in million to million increments in each of the years from to the company s correspondent bank relationship allows the company to purchase up to million in federal funds on an overnight  unsecured basis 
this line of credit was not drawn upon during any of the past three years 
the company also has a line of credit with the frb discount window 
this line is secured by a blanket lien on a portion of the company s commercial  consumer and real estate portfolio excluding family 
based on the collateral owned by the company as of december   the available line of credit is approximately million 
this line of credit was established primarily in connection with the company s yk liquidity contingency plan and has not been drawn on since inception 
the frb has indicated that it would not expect lines of credit that have been granted to financial institutions to be a primary borrowing source 
the company plans to maintain this line of credit  although it is not expected that it will be drawn upon except in unusual circumstances 
in addition to the lines of credit described above  in which the company has million outstanding  the company also had a total of million in trust preferred security debt outstanding at december  the company issued million of this debt on october  and an additional million on december  these borrowings each have year final maturities and were structured as trust preferred capital securities that qualify as tier i capital for regulatory capital adequacy requirements 
these debt securities are callable by the company at par on any quarterly interest payment date five years after their issue date 
the interest rate on these debt securities adjusts on a quarterly basis at a rate of three month libor plus for the securities issued in and libor plus for the securities issued in average short term borrowings for each of the past five years were less than thirty percent of total shareholders equity at all times during each period 
liquidity  commitments  and contingencies the company s liquidity is determined by its ability to convert assets to cash or acquire alternative sources of funds to meet the needs of its customers who are withdrawing or borrowing funds  and to maintain required reserve levels  pay expenses and operate the company on an ongoing basis 
the company s primary liquidity sources are net income from operations  cash and due from banks  federal funds sold and other short term investments 
the company s securities portfolio is comprised almost entirely of readily marketable securities which could also be sold to provide cash 
as noted above  in addition to internally generated liquidity sources  the company has the ability to obtain borrowings from the following three sources an approximately million line of credit with the fhlb  a million overnight federal funds line of credit with a correspondent bank  and an approximately million line of credit through the federal reserve bank of richmond s discount window 
the company s on balance sheet liquidity declined in both and as a result of the strong loan growth that outpaced deposit growth during each year 
the imbalance in the loan growth compared to the deposit growth increased the loan to deposit ratio from at december  to at december  to at december  additionally  the percentage of balance sheet assets that are generally regarded as being liquid consisting of cash  due from banks  federal funds sold  presold mortgages in process of settlement and securities decreased from of total deposits and borrowings at december  to at december  to at december  in the normal course of business there are various outstanding contractual obligations of the company that will require future cash outflows 
in addition  there are commitments and contingent liabilities  such as commitments to extend credit  that may or may not require future cash outflows 
table reflects the contractual obligations and other commercial commitments of the company outstanding as of december  of the million in borrowings maturing in more than five years  million relates to fhlb debt that has a call option whereby the fhlb may call the debt in based on the interest rates in effect at december   the company does not expect this borrowing to be called by the fhlb 
also  any of the company s million in outstanding borrowings with the fhlb may be accelerated immediately by the fhlb in certain circumstances  including material adverse changes in the condition of the company or if the company s qualifying collateral amounts to less than times the amount of borrowings outstanding 
at december   the company s qualifying collateral amounted to times the amount of borrowings outstanding 
in the normal course of business there are various outstanding commitments and contingent liabilities  such as commitments to extend credit  which are not reflected in the financial statements 
table also reflects other commercial commitments of the company outstanding as of december  this table reflects that as of december   the company had outstanding loan commitments of  the sum of credit cards and lines of credit and loan commitments line items 
of that amount   were at variable rates and  were at fixed rates 
included in outstanding loan commitments were unfunded commitments of  on revolving credit plans  of which  were at variable rates and  were at fixed rates 
in addition to the credit card and other loan commitments described above  at december  and  the company had  and  in standby letters of credit outstanding  respectively 
the company has no carrying amount for these standby letters of credit 
the nature of the standby letters of credit is a guarantee made on behalf the company s customers to suppliers of the customers to guarantee payments owed to the supplier by the customer 
the standby letters of credit have two to three year terms  and the payment of the guarantees would generally be triggered by a continued nonpayment of an obligation owed by the customer to the supplier 
the maximum potential amount of future payments undiscounted the company could be required to make under the guarantees in the event of nonperformance by the parties to whom credit or financial guarantees have been extended is represented by the contractual amount of the financial instruments discussed above 
in the event that the company is required to honor a standby letter of credit  a note  already executed with the customer  is triggered which provides repayment terms and any collateral 
over the past ten years  the company has had to honor one standby letter of credit  which was repaid by the borrower without any loss to the company 
it has been the experience of the company that deposit withdrawals are generally replaced with new deposits  thus not requiring any net cash outflow 
based on that assumption  management believes that it can meet its contractual cash obligations and existing commitments from normal operations 
the company is not involved in any legal proceedings that  in management s opinion  could have a material effect on the consolidated financial position of the company 
despite the decline in on balance sheet liquidity levels in and discussed above  the company s management believes its liquidity sources  including unused lines of credit  are at an acceptable level and remain adequate to meet its operating needs in the foreseeable future 
the company will continue to monitor its liquidity position carefully and will explore and implement strategies to increase liquidity if deemed appropriate 
off balance sheet arrangements and derivative financial instruments off balance sheet arrangements include transactions  agreements  or other contractual arrangements in which the company has obligations or provides guarantees on behalf of an unconsolidated entity 
the company has no off balance sheet arrangements of this kind 
derivative financial instruments include futures  forwards  interest rate swaps  options contracts  and other financial instruments with similar characteristics 
the company has not engaged in derivatives activities through december  and has no current plans to do so 
interest rate risk including quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk item a 
net interest income is the company s most significant component of earnings 
notwithstanding changes in volumes of loans and deposits  the company s level of net interest income is continually at risk due to the effect that changes in general market interest rate trends have on interest yields earned and paid with respect to the various categories of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
it is the company s policy to maintain portfolios of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities with maturities and repricing opportunities that will afford protection  to the extent practical  against wide interest rate fluctuations 
the company s exposure to interest rate risk is analyzed on a regular basis by management using standard gap reports  maturity reports  and an asset liability software model that simulates future levels of interest income and expense based on current interest rates  expected future interest rates  and various intervals of shock interest rates 
over the years  the company has been able to maintain a fairly consistent yield on average earning assets net interest margin 
over the past five calendar years the company s net interest margin has ranged from a low of realized in to a high of realized in 
during that five year period the prime rate of interest has ranged from a low of to a high of 
in  the company experienced downward pressure on its net interest margin  primarily as a result of the significant decreases in the interest rate environment the company s interest earning assets adjusted downwards quicker and by a greater amount than did the company s interest bearing liabilities 
in the first quarter of  the company s net interest margin was the highest it had been since the fourth quarter of  primarily as a result of the stable interest rate environment  when for the first time in five quarters  there were no decreases in rates initiated by the federal reserve 
this allowed a significant portion of the company s time deposits that were originated during periods of higher interest rates and matured during the quarter to reprice at lower levels  whereas the company s rate sensitive interest earning assets had repriced lower immediately upon the rate cuts by the federal reserve in  and thus did not experience further rate reductions 
there were also no changes in rates in the second or third quarters of  which allowed the company s time deposits to continue to mature and reprice at lower levels 
as a result  the company s net interest margin for the third quarter of was  its highest level since the company s merger with first savings bancorp in consistent with what occurred in  the basis point rate cut initiated by the federal reserve on november  negatively impacted the company s net interest margin as interest sensitive assets repriced downwards sooner and by a greater amount than did the company s interest sensitive liabilities 
the company s net interest margin for the fourth quarter of was  a basis point decrease from the third quarter of in  although the company s deposits continued to reprice downward  the basis point rate cut in november and the subsequent june  rate cut of basis points had a more pronounced and a longer lasting negative impact on the company s net interest margin than previous rate cuts because of the inability of the company to reset deposit rates by an amount because of their already near zero rates that would offset the negative impact of the rate cut on the yields earned on the company s interest earning assets 
despite the relatively stable interest rate environment in  with just the one rate cut in june  this factor was largely responsible for preventing a rebound in net interest margin similar to that realized in for the first three quarters of  the company s net interest margin was within six basis points of the margin realized in the fourth quarter of the company s net interest margin of in the fourth quarter of was negatively impacted by the acquisition of four rbc centura bank branches in october as a result of the high mix of cash assumed in the acquisition as opposed to higher yielding assets 
in connection with this acquisition  the company received approximately million in cash that was not able to immediately be deployed into a mix of assets with higher yields consistent with the company s typical mix 
additionally  as discussed in more detail in the section net interest income above  the company has experienced a shift in its loan portfolio from having more fixed rate loans to having more adjustable rate loans  which has also negatively impacted the company s net interest margin 
table sets forth the company s interest rate sensitivity analysis as of december   using stated maturities for all instruments except mortgage backed securities which are allocated in the periods of their expected payback and securities and borrowings with call features that are expected to be called which are shown in the period of their expected call 
as illustrated by this table  the company had million more in interest bearing liabilities that are subject to interest rate changes within one year than earning assets 
this generally would indicate that net interest income would experience downward pressure in a rising interest rate environment and would benefit from a declining interest rate environment 
however  this method of analyzing interest sensitivity only measures the magnitude of the timing differences and does not address earnings  market value  or management actions 
also  interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
in addition to the effects of when various rate sensitive products reprice  market rate changes may not result in uniform changes in rates among all products 
for example  included in interest bearing liabilities at december  subject to interest rate changes within one year are deposits totaling million comprised of now  savings  and certain types of money market deposits with interest rates set by management 
these types of deposits historically have not repriced coincidentally with or in the same proportion as general market indicators 
thus  the company believes that in the near term twelve months  net interest income would not likely experience significant downward pressure from rising interest rates 
similarly  management would not expect a significant increase in near term net interest income from falling interest rates in fact  it has been the company s experience that each interest rate cut occurring during the past three years has negatively impacted at least temporarily the company s net interest margin 
generally  as discussed above  when rates change  the company s interest sensitive assets that are subject to adjustment reprice immediately at the full amount of the change  while the company s interest sensitive liabilities that are subject to adjustment reprice at a lag to the rate change and typically not to the full extent of the rate change 
the net effect is that in the twelve month horizon  as rates change  the impact of having a higher level of interest sensitive liabilities is substantially negated by the later and typically lower proportionate change these liabilities experience compared to interest sensitive assets 
however  as previously discussed  recent rate cuts  particularly the two rate cuts totaling basis points that have occurred since september   may have a more pronounced and a longer lasting negative impact on the company s net interest margin than previous rate cuts because of the inability of the company to reset deposit rates by an amount because of their already near zero rates that would offset the negative impact of the rate cut on the yields earned on the company s interest earning assets 
additionally  as previously discussed  over the past two years  the company has originated significantly more adjustable rate loans compared to fixed rate loans 
in the current interest rate environment  adjustable rate loans generally carry lower initial interest rates than fixed rate loans 
if the trend of originating more adjustable rate loans than fixed rate loans continues into  which the company expects will occur  the company s net interest margin will continue to be negatively impacted 
accordingly  under the assumption of a stable interest rate environment in  the company would not expect its net interest margin to rebound as it did in when rates were stable  but instead projects that its net interest margin would decline slightly to approximately due to the factors just discussed 
if interest rates were to further decline  the company expects that its net interest margin would decline further in  whereas if interest rates were to increase  the company expects that its net interest margin would be positively impacted 
the company has no market risk sensitive instruments held for trading purposes  nor does it maintain any foreign currency positions 
table presents the expected maturities of the company s other than trading market risk sensitive financial instruments 
table also presents the estimated fair values of market risk sensitive instruments as estimated in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 disclosures about fair value of financial instruments 
the company s assets and liabilities each have estimated fair values that are slightly higher than their carrying value 
this is due to the yields on these portfolios being higher than market yields at december  for instruments with maturities similar to the remaining term of the portfolios  due to the declining interest rate environment

return on assets and equity table shows return on assets net income divided by average total assets  return on equity net income divided by average shareholders equity  dividend payout ratio dividends per share divided by net income per share and shareholders equity to assets ratio average shareholders equity divided by average total assets for each of the years in the three year period ended december  capital resources and shareholders equity shareholders equity at december  amounted to million compared to million at december  the two basic components typically affecting the company s shareholders equity are net income  which increases shareholders equity  and dividends declared  which decreases shareholders equity 
in  net income of  increased equity  while dividends declared of  reduced equity 
two other items significantly impacted shareholders equity in in connection with the company s acquisition of ccb in january  the company issued shares of stock for each share of ccb stock outstanding  which resulted in the company issuing a total of  shares of stock valued at million  which increased shareholders equity 
also  the company continued to actively manage its capital and number of common shares outstanding through stock repurchases 
in  the company repurchased a total of  shares of its common stock at an average price of  which reduced shareholders equity by million 
at december   the company had a remaining authorization from its board of directors to repurchase  shares of stock 
other items affecting shareholders equity in were proceeds of  received from common stock issued as a result of stock option exercises  proceeds of  received from the issuance of stock into the company s dividend reinvestment plan  a  increase to equity related to the tax benefit that the company realized due to exercises of nonqualified stock options  and other comprehensive income of  which was comprised of the  increase in the net unrealized gain  net of taxes  of the company s available for sale securities that was reduced by an adjustment to the company s pension liability of  net of taxes 
in  in addition to repurchasing  shares of stock totaling  which reduced equity  other items affecting shareholders equity were proceeds of  received from common stock issued as a result of stock option exercises  proceeds of  received from the issuance of stock into the company s dividend reinvestment plan  a  increase to equity related to the tax benefit that the company realized due to exercises of nonqualified stock options  and other comprehensive income of  which was comprised of the  increase in the net unrealized gain  net of taxes  of the company s available for sale securities that was reduced by an adjustment to the company s pension liability of  net of taxes 
in  in addition to repurchasing  shares of stock at a cost of  which reduced equity  one other item had a significant effect on shareholders equity common stock issued in acquisitions  which primarily related to the company s may acquisition of century in which approximately  shares of common stock were issued 
the issuance of stock in connection with the company s acquisitions increased shareholders equity by million in other items affecting shareholders equity in were proceeds of  received from common stock issued as a result of stock option exercises  proceeds of  received from the issuance of stock into the company s dividend reinvestment plan  and other comprehensive income  which was comprised entirely of the change in the unrealized gain or loss  net of taxes  of the company s available for sale securities and amounted to  in the company is not aware of any recommendations of regulatory authorities or otherwise which  if they were to be implemented  would have a material effect on its liquidity  capital resources  or operations 
the company and the bank must comply with regulatory capital requirements established by the fed and fdic 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory  and possibly additional discretionary  actions by regulators that  if undertaken  could have a direct material effect on the company s financial statements 
under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action  the company and the bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the company s assets  liabilities  and certain off balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
the company s and bank s capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components  risk weightings  and other factors 
these capital standards require the company and the bank to maintain minimum ratios of tier capital to total risk weighted assets tier i capital ratio and total capital to risk weighted assets total capital ratio of and  respectively 
tier capital is comprised of total shareholders equity  excluding unrealized gains or losses from the securities available for sale  less intangible assets  and total capital is comprised of tier capital plus certain adjustments  the largest of which for the company and the bank is the allowance for loan losses 
risk weighted assets refer to the on and off balance sheet exposures of the company and the bank  adjusted for their related risk levels using formulas set forth in federal reserve board and fdic regulations 
in addition to the risk based capital requirements described above  the company and the bank are subject to a leverage capital requirement  which calls for a minimum ratio of tier capital as defined above to quarterly average total assets leverage ratio of to  depending upon the institution s composite ratings as determined by its regulators 
the fed has not advised the company of any requirement specifically applicable to it 
table presents the company s regulatory capital ratios as of december    and in  as a result of the company forecasting that its strategic growth goals would likely result in the need for additional capital  the company issued million in debt structured as trust preferred capital securities that qualify as capital for regulatory capital adequacy requirements see borrowings above for further discussion 
as a result of the issuance of the trust preferred securities  the company s capital ratios increased significantly at december  compared to december  in  while at all times the company s regulatory capital ratios far exceeded regulatory minimums  the ratios decreased significantly as a result of the company s acquisitions  which increased assets and decreased tangible capital 
the company s issuance of an additional million in trust preferred securities in december partially offset the decrease in regulatory capital ratios resulting from the effects of the acquisitions 
because of limitations on the amount of tier i capital that can be comprised of trust preferred securities  only million of the million in trust preferred securities outstanding is includable as tier i capital for the company at december   with the remaining million being included as tier ii capital 
in addition to the minimum capital requirements described above  the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action also contains specific capital guidelines for a bank s classification as well capitalized 
the specific guidelines are as follows tier i capital ratio of at least  total capital ratio of at least  and a leverage ratio of at least 
the bank s regulatory ratios exceeded the threshold for well capitalized status at december   and the company s goal is to maintain its well capitalized status at all times 
based on the company s capital position at december  and considering that there are no pending acquisitions  the company does not anticipate needing to raise capital in the foreseeable future 
the company estimates  based on criteria provided by trust preferred security pool underwriters  that it has the credit capacity to issue approximately million more in trust preferred securities 
the company also believes that it has the ability to raise capital in a secondary stock offering should the need arise 
see supervision and regulation under business above and note to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of other matters that may affect the company s capital resources 
inflation because the assets and liabilities of a bank are primarily monetary in nature payable in fixed determinable amounts  the performance of a bank is affected more by changes in interest rates than by inflation 
interest rates generally increase as the rate of inflation increases  but the magnitude of the change in rates may not be the same 
the effect of inflation on banks is normally not as significant as its influence on those businesses that have large investments in plant and inventories 
during periods of high inflation  there are normally corresponding increases in the money supply  and banks will normally experience above average growth in assets  loans and deposits 
also  general increases in the price of goods and services will result in increased operating expenses 
current accounting matters the company prepares its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with standards established by  among others  the financial accounting standards board the fasb 
because the information needed by users of financial reports is dynamic  the fasb frequently issues new rules and proposes new rules for companies to apply in reporting their activities 
the following paragraphs contain information regarding recently adopted accounting standards that affected the company and new standards that have not yet been adopted that have the potential to affect the company 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations statement  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets statement 
statement requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june  statement also specifies criteria that intangible assets acquired in a purchase method business combination must meet in order to be recognized and reported apart from goodwill 
the company adopted this statement july  statement requires that all goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of statement statement also requires that identifiable intangible assets with estimable useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values  and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
certain provisions of statement relating to business combinations consummated after june  were adopted by the company on july  the remaining provisions were adopted on january  in connection with statement s transitional goodwill impairment evaluation  the statement required the company to perform an assessment of whether there was an indication that goodwill is impaired as of the date of adoption 
the company completed this assessment during the first quarter of and determined that there was no goodwill impairment 
the company has also performed annual impairment tests since the date of adoption  and the company determined for each of those tests that there was no goodwill impairment 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional disclosures related to statement in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets statement  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this standard provides guidance on differentiating between long lived assets to be held and used  long lived assets to be disposed of other than by sale and long lived assets to be disposed of by sale

 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
under eitf issue no 
 an entity recognized a liability for an exit cost on the date that the entity committed itself to an exit plan 
in statement  the board acknowledges that an entity s commitment to a plan does not  by itself  create a present obligation to other parties that meets the definition of a liability 
an obligation becomes a present obligation when a transaction or event occurs that leaves an entity little or no discretion to avoid the future transfer or use of assets to settle the liability 
statement also establishes that fair value is the objective for the initial measurement of the liability 
statement will be effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  the company adopted the provisions of this statement effective january  and will apply the provisions to any exit or disposal activities initiated after that date 
the company did not have exit or disposal activities that were subject to accounting under statement in in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
 acquisitions of certain financial institutions statement  which addresses the financial accounting and reporting for the acquisition of all or part of a financial institution 
this standard removes certain acquisitions of financial institutions from the scope of sfas no 
 accounting for certain acquisitions of bank or thrift institutions statement 
this statement requires financial institutions to reclassify goodwill arising from a qualified business acquisition from statement goodwill to goodwill subject to the provisions of statement the reclassified goodwill is no longer amortized but is subject to an annual impairment test  pursuant to statement the company adopted statement in the fourth quarter of  but effective as of january  statement required the company to retroactively restate its previously issued interim consolidated financial statements to reverse reclassified statement goodwill amortization expense recorded in the first three quarters of the fiscal year 
accordingly   in amortization expense that had been recorded during the first nine months of was retroactively reversed by reducing the respective quarters amortization expense and increasing intangible assets 
the associated income tax expense recorded related to the reversal of amortization expense amounted to  for that same nine month period 
in november  the fasb issued financial interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  which addresses the disclosure to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under guarantees 
fin requires the guarantor to recognize a liability for the non contingent component of the guarantee  such as the obligation to stand ready to perform in the event that specified triggering events or conditions occur 
the initial measurement of this liability is the fair value of the guarantee at inception 
the recognition of the liability is required even if it is not probable that payments will be required under the guarantee or if the guarantee was issued with a premium payment or as part of a transaction with multiple events 
the disclosure requirements were effective for interim and annual financial statements ending after december  and are contained in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the initial recognition and measurement provisions were effective for all guarantees within the scope of fin issued or modified after december   the impacts of which were not material to the company 
the company issues standby letters of credit whereby the company guarantees performance if a specified triggering event or condition occurs  primarily nonpayment by the company s customer to their supplier 
the standby letters of credit are generally for terms for one year  at which time they may be renewed for another year if both parties agree 
see note to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements 
in december  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure fas an amendment of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation fas  which provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  fas amends the disclosure requirements of fas to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
the transition provisions of the statement are effective for financial statements for fiscal years ending after december  while the disclosure requirements are effective for interim periods beginning after december   with early application encouraged 
the adoption of sfas required enhanced disclosures for the company s stock based employee compensation plan for the year ended december  the company does not have any plans to change its method of accounting for stock based employee compensation  but has furnished the expanded disclosures in note k in the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued financial interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  which was subsequently revised in december fin addresses the consolidation by business enterprises of certain variable interest entities 
the provisions of this interpretation became effective for the company on january  as it relates to variable interest entities created or purchased after that date 
in october  the fasb issued guidance that provided for a deferral of the effective date of applying fin to entities created before february   to no later than december  in addition  the deferral permitted a company to apply fin as of july   to some or all of the variable interest entities in which it holds an interest  and the rest on december  in december  the fasb issued a revision to fin r  which clarified and interpreted certain of the provisions of fin  without changing the basic accounting model in fin the provisions of fin r are effective no later than march  however  companies must apply either fin or fin r to those entities considered special purpose entities no later than december  the adoption of fin did not have an impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
the company has identified no investments in variable interest entities that would require consolidation under fin for the company  beginning with the first quarter of  the application of fin r will result in the de consolidation of the trusts that have issued the trust preferred capital securities currently reported in the consolidated financial statements 
the trust preferred capital securities are currently disclosed as long term borrowings within the consolidated financial statements 
the de consolidation of the trust will instead cause the disclosure of junior subordinated debentures between the company and the trust subsidiary 
currently  the junior subordinated debentures are eliminated in consolidation  resulting in the disclosure of long term borrowings 
the impact of this change will not have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
treatment of trust preferred securities within the company s capital ratio calculations in light of fin is pending further guidance from the banking regulators 
if the banking regulators change the capital treatment for trust preferred securities  the company s tier and total capital could be reduced by the amount of outstanding trust preferred securities  but the company believes that its capital classifications would not fall below the level of adequately capitalized and that the company has other options available to raise capital  including but not limited to a secondary stock offering 
additional information regarding the company s trust preferred securities is included in note in the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements 
in april  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no

statement  accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity  which establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
it requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability or an asset in some circumstances 
this statement is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  it is to be implemented by reporting the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for financial instruments created before the issuance date of the statement and still existing at the beginning of the interim period of adoption 
adoption of statement on july  did not have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in november  the fasb ratified a consensus reached by its emerging issues task force eitf regarding quantitative and qualitative disclosures required by eitf issue no
