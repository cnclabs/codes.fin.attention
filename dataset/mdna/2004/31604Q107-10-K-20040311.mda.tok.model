item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this discussion and analysis reflects fidelity bankshares  inc s consolidated financial statements and other relevant statistical data and is intended to enhance your understanding of our financial condition and results of operations 
you should read the information in this section in conjunction with fidelity bankshares  inc s consolidated financial statements and their notes beginning on page f  and the other statistical data provided in this report 
this report contains certain forward looking statements which may be identified by the use of such words as believe  expect  intend  anticipate  should  planned  estimated and potential 
examples of forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  estimates with respect to our financial condition  results of operations and business that are subject to various factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from these estimates and most other statements that are not historical in nature 
these factors include  but are not limited to  general and local economic conditions  changes in interest rates  deposit flows  demand for mortgage and other loans  real estate values  and competition  changes in accounting principles policies  or guidelines  changes in legislation or regulations  and other economic  competitive  governmental  regulatory  and technological factors affecting our operations  pricing  products and services 
we conduct no business other than holding the common stock of fidelity federal bank trust 
consequently  our net income depends on the net income of fidelity federal bank trust 
the net income of fidelity federal bank trust is derived primarily from its net interest income  which is the difference between the interest income we receive on loans  mortgage backed securities and investments and our cost of funds  consisting of interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
fidelity federal bank trust s net income also is affected by its provision for loan losses  as well as by the amount of other income  including income from fees and service charges  net gains and losses on sales of investments  and operating expenses such as employee compensation and benefits  deposit insurance premiums  occupancy and equipment costs  and income taxes 
in addition  earnings are affected significantly by general economic and competitive conditions  particularly changes in market interest rates  government policies and actions of regulatory authorities  which events are beyond our control 
in particular  the general level of market interest rates tends to be highly cyclical 
critical accounting policies the accounting and reporting policies of fidelity bankshares  inc and its subsidiaries conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and general practices within the financial services industry 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
a summary of our significant accounting policies is contained in note to the consolidated financial statements 
one of our more critical accounting policies relates to establishing an allowance for loan losses 
allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses represents management s best estimate of inherent losses in the existing loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses is increased by the provision for loan losses charged to expense and reduced by loans charged off  net of recoveries 
the provision for loan losses is determined based on management s assessment of several factors reviews and evaluations of specific loans  changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio  current and anticipated economic conditions and the related impact on specific borrowers and industry groups  historical loan loss experience  the level of classified and nonperforming loans and the results of regulatory examinations 
a periodic review of selected credits based on loan size and type is conducted to identify loans with heightened risk or inherent losses and to assign risk grades 
the primary responsibility for this review rests with the management personnel who are responsible for overseeing the credit relationship 
this review is supplemented with periodic reviews by our credit review function  as well as periodic examination of both selected credits and the credit review process by the applicable regulatory agencies 
the information from these reviews assists management in the timely identification of problems and potential problems  and provides a basis for deciding whether the credit represents a probable loss or risk that should be recognized 
changes in the financial condition of individual borrowers  in economic conditions  in historical loss experience and in the conditions of the various markets in which collateral may be sold may all affect the required level of the allowance for loan losses and the associated provision for loan losses 
changes in financial position comparison of financial position at december  and december  our assets increased by million from billion at december  to billion at december  cash and cash equivalents declined by million  as a result of a decline of million in interest earning deposits 
assets available for sale consisting of municipal bonds and government agency securities  mortgage backed securities and corporate debt securities increased by million 
loans receivable increased by million 
while our new loan production reached record levels  growth of loans receivable was limited by high levels of loan prepayments  as borrowers refinanced their loans in order to take advantage of the current low interest rate environment 
as a result  surplus cash was invested in mortgage backed securities  as well as government and agency securities  causing the increase in assets available for sale 
all other assets increased by million 
funds for asset growth were provided by an increase in deposits of million and an increase in borrowings of million 
million of the increase in borrowings resulted from our issuance of floating rate junior subordinated debt securities pursuant to our participation in a pooled trust preferred securities offering 
all other liabilities declined by  net income of million  offset by dividends paid to stockholders  provided the remaining funds for asset growth 
stockholders equity totaled million at december  as compared to million at december  results of operations results of operations for the years ended december  and general 
our net income for the year ended december  was million 
or basic and diluted earnings per share 
by comparison  our net income for the year ended december  was million  or basic and diluted earnings per share 
a number of factors contributed to the million increase in net income for the year ended december  interest income increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  and was accompanied by a million decrease in interest expense from million in to million in this resulted in an increase of net interest income before loan losses of million  or  from million in to million in the provision for loan losses increased for the year ended december  by million from million in to million in our portfolio of commercial mortgage loans  consumer loans and commercial business loans increased as a percentage of our total loan portfolio 
other income increased by million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  our operating expenses for the year ended december  increased by million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million 
interest income 
interest income increased by million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  while average interest earning assets increased by million  or  the yield on our assets declined to during  compared to during the decline in yield resulted from originating loans during the year s low interest rate environment  borrower prepayment of higher interest bearing loans and our increased investment in mortgage backed securities bearing lower interest rates 
interest income from mortgage loans increased by  or million  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  although the average balance of mortgage loans increased by million  or  it was accompanied by a decline in average yield on these assets from in to in the average balance of consumer and commercial business loans increased by million  or  but was offset by a decline in average yield from in to in as a result  interest income from consumer and commercial business loans declined by  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  our average investment in mortgage backed securities increased by  as a result of funds provided by our strong deposit growth  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  because the average yield on these investments declined from during to during  income from mortgage backed securities increased by only million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the average balance of our investment securities declined by million  or  from million during to million during  and the average yield on these investments declined from during to during accordingly  our interest income from investment securities declined by million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  our average balance of other investments declined by million  or  from million during the year ended december  to million during the year ended december   and the average yield on these investments declined from during to during this resulted in a decline in interest income from other investments of million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  interest expense 
interest expense declined by million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  interest expense on deposits decreased by million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  while average deposits increased by million  or  from billion to billion  the composition of average deposit balances included a higher percentage of lower cost transaction and savings accounts  as well as a decrease of million in higher cost certificates of deposit 
consequently  the average cost of our deposits declined from during to during the average balance of our borrowings declined by million  or  from million during the year ended december  to million during the year ended december   and the average cost of these borrowings declined from during to during as a result  interest expense on our borrowings was million for the year ended december   or million and lower than our interest expense on borrowings of million during the year ended december  net interest income 
our net interest income increased by million  or  from million for to million for while our net interest rate spread declined from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december   the average balance of our interest earning assets increased by million or  resulting in the increase in net interest income 
provision for loan losses 
our provision for loan losses increased by million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  during  the percentage of our portfolio comprised of non residential loans  which are deemed to have a greater risk of loss than one to four family loans  increased from at december  to of total loans 
our total allowance for loan losses as of december  was million  and is maintained at a level that represents our best estimate of losses in our loan portfolio at the balance sheet date which were both probable and reasonably estimable 
at december  our ratio of non performing loans to total loans was our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
accordingly  allowances for loan losses are based on management s estimate of losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
we provide both general valuation allowances for unspecified  probable losses and specific valuation allowances for known losses in our portfolio 
general valuation allowances are added to our capital for purposes of calculating our regulatory risk based capital 
we conduct a monthly review of our loan portfolio  including impaired loans  to determine whether any loans require classification or the establishment of appropriate valuation allowances 
as we continue to increase our origination of commercial business loans  consumer loans and commercial real estate loans  and such loans traditionally have a higher risk of loss than residential mortgage loans  our provision for loan losses is likely to increase in future periods 
other income 
other income increased by  or million  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  
income from fees on deposit accounts increased by million  largely as a result of our increase in transaction deposit accounts 
fees for other banking services  which is comprised of insurance and annuity sales  trust fee income and appraisal income increased by million 
gains on the sale of loans  which included a one time gain of million on the sale of a million group of loans  increased by million  as we began selling loans in the secondary market during offsetting these increases in other income was a million loss on the sale of securities as a result of restructuring our investment portfolio and a decline in miscellaneous other income of  operating expense 
operating expense increased by million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  of this increase  million is attributable to employee compensation and benefits 
employee health care costs increased by  pension costs increased by million and stock based compensation increased by  the remainder of the increase  million  was primarily attributable increased commissions paid to loan personnel due to increased loan production  increased commissions on increased insurance sales  normal salary increases and compensation paid to new employees 
during the year we hired new employees  bringing the total to full time equivalent employees at december  most of these employees are loan officers and related support personnel and customer service employees needed for our expanding branch network 
occupancy and equipment expense increased by million as we continue to expand the number of our branches and improve our technology 
miscellaneous expense increased by million 
included in this increase are additional costs of  for legal expense   for communications expense   in uncollected deposit overdrafts and fees  and  of additional loan closing costs absorbed to increase loan production 
income taxes 
our provision for income taxes for the year ended december  was million  an increase of  from million for the year ended december  our provision reflects our current rate applied to income before taxes 
results of operations for the years ended december  and general 
we had net income of million  or basic earnings per share of for the year ended december  this compares to net income of million  or basic earnings per share of  for the year ended december  the increase in net income of million for the year ended december   as compared to  is due to a number of factors 
while interest income decreased from million in to million in  interest expense also declined in from million in to million  resulting in a increase in net interest income  before provision for loan losses  from million in to million for the year ended december  our provision for loan losses decreased from million in to million in other income for the year ended december  improved to million from million in our operating expenses for the year ended december  increased by million  or  from million to million 
included in operating expenses for was a one time charge of million relating to our computer system conversion 
interest income 
interest income decreased by  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  although the average balance of interest earning assets increased by million  or  in  this was offset by a decline in the average yield of these assets from in to in the decline in average yield on our interest earning assets resulted primarily from the rapidly declining interest rate environment we experienced in and interest income from mortgage loans increased by million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this increase is attributable to an increase in the average balance of mortgage loans from billion to billion  which was offset by a modest decline in the average yield on these assets from to 
interest income on consumer and commercial business loans increased slightly by  or from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the average balance of consumer and commercial business loans increased by million  or  from million to million  this was offset by a significant decline in average yield on these assets from in to in our average balance of mortgage backed securities declined from million in to million in as we continue to allocate repayments on these assets to higher yielding loans 
as a result of this decline and a decline in the average yield on mortgage backed securities from in to in  income from mortgage backed securities declined million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  interest income on securities decreased by million from million in to million in while the average balance of these assets increased million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   we incurred a significant decline in the average yield on these assets from for to for resulting in a decrease in interest income from these securities 
interest income on other investments  which consists of income from our investment in fhlb stock and from interest earning deposits  declined by  from million in to million in although the average balance of these assets increased by million  or  the average yield declined from in to in interest expense 
interest expense decreased by million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the decrease in expense is attributable to a decline in the average cost of our deposits from in to in the average balance of our deposits increased by million during from billion for the year ended december  to billion for the year ended december   reflecting an increase in savings and checking accounts  offset by a decline in higher cost certificate of deposit balances of million 
the increase in interest expense on borrowed funds of  resulted from an increase in the average balance of borrowed funds from million in to million in  however this impact was partially offset by a decline in the average cost of these borrowings from to 
net interest income 
our net interest income increased by million from million for to million in the increase reflects an increase in our net interest spread from in to in the ratio of our average interest earning assets to interest bearing liabilities decreased from in to in provision for loan losses 
our provision for loan losses decreased by  from million in to million in our total allowance for loan losses as of december  was million  and is maintained at a level that represents management s best estimate of losses in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date which were both probable and reasonably estimable 
at december   our ratio of non performing loans to total loans was 
our financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
accordingly  allowances for loan losses are based on management s estimate of losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
we provide both general valuation allowances for unspecified  probable losses and specific valuation allowances for known losses in our loan portfolio 
general valuation allowances are added to our capital for purposes of computing our regulatory risk based capital 
we conduct a monthly review of our loan portfolio  including impaired loans  to determine whether any loans require classification or the establishment of appropriate valuation allowances 
as we are increasing our origination of commercial business loans  consumer loans and commercial real estate loans  and such loans traditionally have a higher risk of loss than residential mortgage loans  our provision for loan losses is likely to increase in future periods 
other income 
other income increased by million  or  from million in to million in million of this increase was from service charges on deposit accounts  which resulted from the growth of core deposits consisting of all deposits except for certificates of deposit from of total deposits at december  to of total deposits at december  fees from other banking services  which include insurance annuity sales  trust income and appraisal services  increased by million 
these amounts were slightly offset by declines in gains on loan and securities sales of  and miscellaneous income of 
operating expense 
operating expense for the year ended december  increased by million from million for the year ended december  to million 
of this increase  million related to compensation and benefits  million related to occupancy and equipment  and other expense increased by million 
with respect to the increase in compensation and benefit costs  million resulted from stock based compensation  including the management recognition program approved by stockholders in may employee benefits increased by million  primarily for health and pension costs 
the remaining increase of million included normal  annual compensation increases and compensation costs relating to the increase in full time equivalent employees  principally in the areas of customer service and lending  from at december  to at december  the increase in occupancy and equipment expense resulted principally from increased depreciation  maintenance and taxes related to our ongoing branch expansion activities as well as the computer system upgrade  which occurred in november of the remaining increase in operating expense of million   of the increase was for telecommunications and postage expense and  was passed through to our appraisal subsidiary 
both of these cost increases related to increased loan production and increases in other income 
income taxes 
our provision for income taxes for the year ended december  of million  an increase of million from million for the year ended december   reflected our current rate applied to significantly higher income before taxes

as stated above  the majority of our interest bearing liabilities and nearly all of our interest earning assets are held by fidelity federal bank trust and  therefore  nearly all of our interest rate risk is at the fidelity federal bank trust level 
we monitor interest rate risk by various methods  including gap analysis and analyzing changes in the net present value of our assets  liabilities and off balance sheet items our net portfolio value or npv which analysis  is reviewed with the board of directors on a quarterly basis 
we use an internal model that generates estimates of our npv over a range of interest rate scenarios 
the model calculates npv essentially by discounting the cash flows from our assets and liabilities to present value using current market rates  and adjusting those discount rates accordingly for various interest rate scenarios 
the following table sets forth our estimated internal calculations of npv as of december   for instantaneous and parallel shifts in the yield curve in basis point increments up and down 
due to the low interest rate environment that existed at december   an analysis of a basis point downward shift in interest rates is not shown 
changes in rates net portfolio value basis points amount change change dollars in thousands bp bp bp fidelity federal bank trust s internal calculation of npv at december  shows the negative effects of rate caps and floors in certain interest earning assets and particularly interest bearing liabilities in both rising and falling interest rate scenarios 
as shown in the previous table  npv was negatively affected in both rising and falling rate scenarios as a result of these interest rate caps and floors 
in preparing the npv table above  we have estimated prepayment rates for our loans ranging from to  depending on the interest rate scenario and loan type 
these rates are management s best estimate based on prior repayment experience 
decay rates for liabilities indicate an assumed annual rate at which an interest bearing liability will be withdrawn in favor of an account with a more favorable interest rate 
decay rates have been assumed for interest bearing checking accounts  passbook and money market deposits 
the purpose of this analysis was to obtain an estimate of the actual deposit balance trends over various interest rate scenarios during the previous five years and to use that data to provide a forecast of future balance trends over various interest rate scenarios 
the following decay rates were used for this analysis and the gap analysis which follows 
within months months through year year through years years through years years through years over years interest bearing checking accounts passbook  club accounts money market deposit accounts the above assumptions are estimates of annual percentages based on remaining balances 
although management believes these deposit decay rates are a reasonable estimate of future deposit trends based on past performance  they should not be regarded as indicative of the actual prepayments and withdrawals that may be experienced by us in any given period 
certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodology used in the above interest rate risk measurements 
modeling changes in npv requires the making of certain assumptions that may or may not reflect how actual yields and costs respond to changes in market rates 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react differently to changes in market interest rates 
also  the changes in the contractual interest rates of our assets and liabilities may not occur at the same time as changes in market interest rates 
additionally  certain assets  such as adjustable rate arm loans  have features that restrict changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the assets 
moreover  in the event of a change in interest rates  prepayment and early withdrawal levels may deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the above table 
management also has made estimates of fair value discount rates that it believes to be reasonable 
however  because there is no quoted market for many of the assets and liabilities  there can be no assurance that the fair values presented would be indicative of the value negotiated in an actual sale 
while the above table provides an estimate of our interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time  it is not intended to provide a precise forecast of the effect of market changes on our npv  as actual results may vary 
at december   we were not required by the office of thrift supervision to hold additional risk based capital for interest rate risk purposes 
the company also monitors the matching of its assets and liabilities through gap analysis 
gap analysis attempts to measure the difference between the amount of interest earning assets expected to mature or reprice within a specific time period compared to the amount of interest bearing liabilities expected to mature or reprice within that period 
an interest rate sensitive gap is considered positive when the amount of interest earning assets exceeds the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within a specified period of time 
an interest rate sensitive gap is considered negative when the amount of interest bearing liabilities exceeds the amount of interest earnings assets maturing or repricing within a specified period of time 
gap analysis involves the use of numerous assumptions  as does npv 
generally  company s with a positive gap can expect net interest income to increase during periods of rising interest rates and decline in periods of falling interest rates 
the table below provides information about the company s financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
as shown in the following table  the company s cumulative one year interest rate sensitivity gap at december  was a positive 
within three months four to twelve months more than one year to three years more than three years to five years over five years dollars in thousands interest earning assets residential mortgage loans fixed rate adjustable rate commercial mortgage loans fixed rate adjustable rate other loans fixed rate adjustable rate mortgage backed securities fixed rate adjustable rate municipal bonds and government and agency securities fixed rate other interest earning assets adjustable total interest bearing liabilities deposits checking and funds transfer accounts passbook accounts money market accounts certificate accounts borrowings total excess deficiency of interest earning assets over interest bearing liabilities cumulative excess of interest earning assets over interest bearing liabilities cumulative excess of interest earning assets over interest bearing liabilities as a percent of total assets adjustable and floating rate assets are included in the period in which interest rates are next scheduled to adjust rather than in the period in which they are due 
fixed rate assets are included in the periods in which they are scheduled to be repaid based on scheduled amortization 
in both cases  amounts are adjusted to reflect estimated prepayments 
for this table  all loans and mortgage backed securities were assigned a prepayment rate 
balances are shown net of loans in process and are not adjusted for premiums  discounts  reserves and unearned fees 
all of the company s non certificate deposits are generally subject to immediate withdrawal 
however  management considers a significant portion of these accounts to be core deposits having longer effective maturities based on the company s actual retention of such deposit accounts in various interest rate environments 
in the year  we contracted with a third party consultant to perform an analysis of the core deposit accounts to obtain an estimate of the actual deposit balance trends over various interest rates scenarios over the previous five years 
we then used the information obtained to provide a forecast of future balance trends 
we then used the information obtained to provide a forecast of future balance trends 
management does not feel that the deposit trends have changed materially since certificate accounts and borrowings are assumed to have no prepayments and are shown in the period in which they contractually mature 
certain shortcomings are inherent in any methodology used to calculate interest rate sensitivity 
the asset prepayment speed and deposit decay rate assumptions are based on past experience and should not be regarded as indicative of the actual prepayments and withdrawals that may be experienced in any given period 
in the event of changes in interest rates  prepayment and early withdrawal would possibly deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the above table 
also  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react differently to changes in market interest rates 
certain assets such as adjustable rate mortgage loans have features that restrict changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
in recent years our policy has been to reduce our exposure to interest rate risk generally by better matching the maturities of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities  and by originating arm loans and other adjustable rate or short term loans  as well as by purchasing short term investments 
however  particularly in a low interest rate environment  borrowers typically prefer fixed rate loans to arm loans 
we do not solicit high rate jumbo certificates or brokered funds 
liquidity and capital resources fidelity federal bank trust is required to maintain liquid assets at levels considered safe and sound by the office of thrift supervision 
our liquidity ratio averaged  and during the months ended december   and  respectively 
our liquidity ratio averaged  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we adjust our liquidity levels to fund deposit outflows  pay real estate taxes on mortgage loans  repay our borrowings and loan to fund commitments 
we also adjust liquidity as appropriate to meet asset and liability management objectives 
our primary sources of funds are deposits  amortization and prepayment of loans and mortgage backed securities  maturities of investment securities and other short term investments  and earnings and funds provided from operations 
while scheduled principal repayments on loans and mortgage backed securities are a relatively predictable source of funds  deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions  and competition 
we set the interest rates on our deposits to maintain a desired level of total deposits 
in addition  we invest excess funds in short term interest earning and other assets  which provide liquidity to meet lending requirements 
short term interest bearing deposits with the federal home loan bank of atlanta amounted to million  million and million at december   and  respectively 
other assets qualifying for liquidity purposes at december   and  totaled million  million and million  respectively 
for additional information about cash flows from our operating  financing  and investing activities  see consolidated statements of cash flows included in the consolidated financial statements 
a major portion of our liquidity consists of cash and cash equivalents  which are a product of our operating  investing and financing activities 
our primary sources of cash are net income  principal repayments on loans and mortgage backed securities  and increases in deposit accounts  along with advances from the federal home loan bank of atlanta 
liquidity management is both a daily and long term function of business management 
if we require funds beyond our ability to generate them internally  borrowing agreements exist with the federal home loan bank of atlanta which provides an additional source of funds 
at december   we had million in advances from the federal home loan bank of atlanta 
we borrow from the federal home loan bank of atlanta in order to reduce interest rate risk  and for liquidity purposes 
at december   we had outstanding loan commitments of million to originate and or purchase mortgage loans 
this amount does not include the unfunded portion of loans in process 
at december   certificates of deposit scheduled to mature in less than one year  totaled million 
based on prior experience  management believes that a significant portion of such deposits will remain with fidelity federal bank trust  although there can be no assurance that this will be the case or that the cost of such deposits could be significantly higher 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments our long term debt  which in the aggregate totals million  consists of obligations to the fhlb totaling million and million in obligations resulting from the issuance of trust preferred securities from fidelity capital trust i in january  as well as fidelity capital trust ii in december the obligations arising from the issuance of trust preferred securities  presented as guaranteed preferred beneficial interests in company debentures in our balance sheet at december  are due in the amount of million in january  and million in january in addition  we have leasehold obligations totaling million 
these contractual obligations are set forth in the table below as of december  the tables below summarize the company s contractual obligations  commercial and other commitments at december total less than year years years after years in thousands long term debt capital lease obligations operating lease obligations total contractual cash obligations includes advances from the federal home loan bank and guaranteed preferred beneficial interests in debentures 
commercial and other commitments total less than year years years after years in thousands lines of credit standby letters of credit other commercial commitments other commitments total contractual cash obligations includes million in undisbursed lines of credit 
pension plans 
we maintain a qualified defined benefit plan the qualified plan  which covers substantially all employees who were hired prior to january  and a supplemental retirement plan to provide additional benefits to executives selected for the plan that are in excess of amounts permitted to be paid under the provisions of tax law to participants in the qualified plan 
we also sponsor a non qualified defined benefit plan for its directors 
our pension costs for all pension plans  excluding our k deferred savings plan  approximated million and million for and respectively  and is calculated based on a number of actuarial assumptions  including an expected long term rate of return on our qualified plan assets of 
in developing our expected long term rate of return assumption  we evaluated input from our actuaries and our investment advisors  including their review of asset class return expectations from respected sources and authorities 
we also evaluated the long term rate of expected inflation 
projected returns by these sources are based on broad equity and bond indices 
we also considered our historical returns in comparison to various market indices 
our expected long term rate of return is based on a target asset allocation of in equities and in fixed income 
we adopted this change in target allocation in early previously  our target allocation was equities and in fixed income investments 
at the end of  our pension committee decided to change asset managers for the defined benefit plan from security trust company  na to charles schwab trust company 
at december   of the million in plan assets  million were in cash and cash equivalents awaiting transfer to charles schwab trust company while the remaining million was in a debt securities mutual fund which transferred to charles schwab in kind 
after the transfer of assets was completed  the assets were invested in an allocation of approximately equity securities and debt securities 
we periodically rebalance the actual asset allocation to match the target asset allocation 
we expect a long term rate of return on equities of and a long term rate of return on fixed income investments of 
we believe this is a reasonable long term rate of return for our qualified plan assets 
we will continue to evaluate our actuarial assumptions  including our expected rate of return  at least annually  and will adjust as necessary 
we base our determination of pension cost on the market value of assets without adjustments or smoothing to reduce year to year volatility 
actuarial gains and losses are recognized into pension cost  to the extent they exceed the amount allowed in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  that can be excluded in determining the amount to be amortized the corridor 
the amount of gain and loss in excess of the corridor is amortized over the remaining average expected working lifetime of plan participants  which was years for as of december   we had cumulative actuarial losses of million that had not yet been recognized into pension cost
