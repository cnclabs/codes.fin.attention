industry background communications technology has evolved from simple analog voice signals transmitted over networks of copper telephone lines to complex analog and digital voice  video and data signals transmitted over hybrid networks of media  such as copper  coaxial and fiber optic cables 
this evolution has been driven by large increases in the number of users and the complexity and variety of the data transmitted over networks resulting from the substantial growth in the internet and its transformation from a text based medium to a multimedia platform containing images  video and sound  the growth of wireless communications  and the increased demand for remote network access and higher speed  higher bandwidth communication between local area networks lans  metropolitan area networks mans and wide area networks wans 
the majority of installed communications systems were designed to transmit only voice communication  and  therefore  are inadequate for the high bandwidth transmission of both voice and data 
access to the public network is typically based on asynchronous technologies  such as t e carrier over copper wire 
the demand for greater bandwidth is driving a migration from lower speed t e to higher speed t e transmission rates 
the t e standard permits the transmission of data at mbps mbps  and the t e standard permits the transmission of data at mbps mbps 
the backbone of the public network is built on an optical fiber transmission medium that employs synchronous technologies such as sonet sdh 
similar to the utilization of faster transmission rates over copper wire  sonet sdh protocols such as oc mbps are being upgraded to oc mbps  oc gbps and oc gbps to increase the bandwidth over a single optical fiber 
the market dynamics of the communications industry have changed significantly since many carriers that spent billions of dollars building out their networks in and prior years were not successful in executing their business model  and  consequently  were sold or declared bankruptcy 
incumbent telephone companies such as at t corp  sprint corporation and mci  inc and regional bell operating companies such as bellsouth corporation  verizon communications inc and sbc communications inc have substantially reduced their capital expenditures in line with current revenues 
this dynamic severely impacted exar s customers during the period of calendar years through many oems underwent extensive restructuring to eliminate excess inventory and to reduce expenses by significantly downsizing their organizations 
during calendar  the company noted increased development activity within the telecommunications industry oems 
at the same time  the company s oem customers are and will continue to come under tremendous pressure to develop new products for access and man markets that will enable carriers to leverage their current network infrastructure 
to address these evolving requirements of the communications industry  oems must develop and introduce increasingly sophisticated systems with fewer engineering resources 
to achieve the performance and functionality required of these systems  communications oems are using increasingly complex communications ics  which now account for a significant portion of the value added proprietary content of these systems 
as a result of new equipment introductions  coupled with the reduction in their technical staff  the proliferation of transmission standards and the difficulty of designing and producing communications ics  equipment suppliers are increasingly outsourcing the design and production of the ics incorporated into their systems 

table of contents the key ics contained in a typical communications system include physical interface  access control  clocks  network processor  traffic manager and switch fabric devices 
the physical interface device consists of a transmitter and receiver that  when integrated  is called a transceiver 
transceivers interface with the physical transmission media  such as copper wire or optical fiber 
most of these high speed  mixed signal ics convert parallel digital signals into a single analog bit stream that is up to times faster than the original signal 
transceivers therefore serve as a bridge between analog transmission media and the digital devices that process data 
access control circuits are digital ics that format  or frame  the data  perform error checking and in some applications aggregate signals by mapping multiple lower speed data streams to a single higher speed stream 
the traffic manager manages the transfer of data between the network processor and the switch fabric  which work together to shape  route and control the data 
because physical interface and access control ics interface with the transmission media and are critical to increasing bandwidth  these ics must offer high speed and robust performance 
therefore  communications equipment oems seek ic suppliers that possess extensive analog and digital expertise to provide high speed  mixed signal solutions to bridge the analog physical world and the digital computing environment 
this must be coupled with system level expertise so that a supplier can quickly bring to market high performance  highly reliable ics with optimal feature sets

competition the semiconductor industry is intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change and a history of price reductions as production efficiencies are achieved in successive generations of products 
although the market for analog and mixed signal integrated circuits is generally characterized by longer product life cycles and less dramatic price reductions than the market for digital integrated circuits  the company faces substantial competition in each market in which it participates 
competition in the company s markets is based principally on technical innovation  product features  timely introduction of new products  quality and reliability  performance  price  technical support and service 
the company believes that it competes favorably in all of these areas

the company s business and  to a large extent  that of the entire communication semiconductor industry  is currently characterized by shortened order to shipment schedules 
sales are made pursuant to either purchase orders for current delivery of standard items or agreements covering purchases over a period of time  which are frequently subject to revision and cancellation 
lead times for the release of purchase orders depend on the scheduling practices of the individual customer  and the company s rate of bookings varies from month to month 
in addition  exar s domestic distributor agreements generally permit the return of up to of purchases of the preceding quarter for purposes of stock rotation and also provide for credits to distributors in the event that exar reduces the price of any inventoried product 
since orders constituting the company s backlog are subject to changes in delivery schedules or to cancellation at the option of the customer without significant penalty  backlog is not necessarily an indication of future sales 
the company believes that its backlog as of any particular date may not be representative of actual sales for any succeeding six month period
