item management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the selected consolidated financial data and our financial statements and the related notes appearing elsewhere in this report 
this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of many factors  including but not limited to those under the heading factors that may affect our future performance 
regulation g  conditions for use of non gaap financial measures  and other provisions of the securities exchange act of  as amended  define and prescribe the conditions for the use of certain non gaap financial information 
in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  we provide information regarding growth in product revenues excluding recently acquired product lines  which is a non gaap financial measure 
a reconciliation of this non gaap financial measure to the most comparable gaap measure is provided in this annual report 
this non gaap financial measure should not be relied upon to the exclusion of gaap financial measures 
management believes that this non gaap financial measure constitutes important supplemental information to investors which reflects an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that  when viewed with our gaap results and the accompanying reconciliations  provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our ongoing business and operations 
management strongly encourages investors to review our financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirely and to not rely on any single financial measure 
because non gaap financial measures are not standardized  it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies non gaap financial measures having the same or similar names 
general integra develops  manufactures  and markets medical devices for use in neuro trauma  neurosurgery  plastic and reconstructive surgery  and general surgery 
our business is organized into product groups and distribution channels 
our product groups include implants and other devices for use in the operating room  monitoring systems for the measurement of various parameters in tissue such as pressure  temperature  and oxygen  hand held and ultrasonic surgical instruments  and private label products that we manufacture for other medical device companies 
our distribution channels include a sales organization that we employ to call on neurosurgeons  another employed sales force to call on plastic and reconstructive surgeons  and networks of third party distributors that we manage 
we invest substantial resources and management effort to develop our sales organizations  and we believe that we compete very effectively in this aspect of our business 
we manufacture most of the operating room  monitoring and private label products that we sell in various plants located in the united states  puerto rico  france  the united kingdom and germany 
we also manufacture the ultrasonic surgical instruments that we sell  but we source most of our hand held surgical instruments through specialized third party vendors 
we believe that we have a particular advantage in the development  manufacture and sale of specialty tissue repair products derived from bovine collagen 
we develop and build these products in our manufacturing facility in plainsboro  new jersey 
taken together  these products accounted for approximately  and of product revenues in the years ended december   and  respectively 
we manage these multiple product groups and distribution channels on a centralized basis 
accordingly  we report our financial results under a single operating segment the development  manufacturing  and distribution of medical devices 
our objective is to build a customer focused and profitable medical device company by developing or acquiring innovative medical devices and other products to sell through our sales channels 
our strategy therefore entails substantial growth in product revenues both through internal means through launching new and innovative products and selling existing products more intensively and by acquiring existing businesses or already successful product lines 
we aim to achieve this growth in revenues while maintaining strong financial results 
while we pay attention to any meaningful trend in our financial results  we pay particular attention to measurements that tend to support the view that our profitability can grow for a period of years 
these measurements include revenue growth from products developed internally or acquired more than a year before the reporting period in question  gross margins on products revenues  which we hope to increase to more than over a period of several years  operating margins for the entire company  which we hope to increase substantially from the level we reported in  and earnings per fully diluted share of common stock 
acquisitions our strategy for growing our business includes the acquisition of complementary product lines and companies 
our recent acquisitions of businesses  assets and product lines may make our financial results for the year ended december  not directly comparable to those of the corresponding prior year periods 
since the beginning of  we have acquired the following businesses  assets and product lines in december  we acquired the assets of reconstructive technologies  inc for  in cash and an agreement to make future payments based on product sales 
reconstructive technologies is the developer of the automated cyclic expansion system ace system tm  a tissue expansion device 
as the ace system is not yet approved  we recorded an in process research and development charge in connection with this acquisition 
once approved  we plan to market the system through our plastic and reconstructive sales force 
in november  we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of spinal specialties  inc from i flow corporation for approximately million in cash  subject to a working capital adjustment 
spinal specialties assembles and sells custom kits and products for chronic pain management  including the osteoject tm bone cement delivery system and the accu disc tm pressure monitoring system 
spinal specialties markets its products to anesthesiologists and interventional radiologists through an in house telemarketing team and a network of distributors 
we report sales of spinal specialties products as instrument revenues 
in august  we acquired the assets of tissue technologies  inc  the manufacturer and distributor of the ultrasoft tm line of facial implants for soft tissue augmentation of the facial area 
we market the ultrasoft products directly to cosmetic and reconstructive surgeons through our plastic and reconstructive surgery sales force 
in march  we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of j 
jamner surgical instruments  inc doing business as jarit r surgical instruments for million in cash 
jarit sells its products to more than  hospitals and surgery centers worldwide 
jarit generates its domestic product sales primarily through sales to hospitals that are members of group purchasing organizations 
group purchasing organizations use the combined leverage of their member hospitals to obtain better prices for medical products for the participating hospitals and other health care providers than might otherwise be available to these institutions individually 
the acquisition of jarit broadened integra s customer base and surgical instrument product offering and facilitated the procurement of integra s ruggles tm and padgett instrument products directly from the instrument manufacturers 
in december  we acquired the epilepsy monitoring and neurosurgical shunt business of the radionics division of tyco healthcare group for million in cash 
we moved the manufacturing of the acquired lines to our facility in biot  france and are selling the acquired products through our integra neurosciences sales force 
in october  we acquired padgett instruments  inc r  a marketer of instruments used in reconstructive and plastic surgery  for million in cash 
our acquisition of padgett instruments broadened our existing surgical customer base and allowed us to expand into new market segments 
we consolidated padgett s operations into our distribution center located in cranbury  new jersey in march in august  we acquired certain assets  including the neurosensor r monitor and rights to certain intellectual property  from novus monitoring limited of the united kingdom novus and entered into a related development agreement pursuant to which novus will  at its own cost  conduct certain clinical studies  continue development of an additional monitoring product  and design and transfer to us a validated manufacturing process for these products 
we paid novus million in cash at closing and agreed to pay an additional million upon novus achievement of a development milestone and up to an additional million based upon revenues from novus products 
we expect the novus products to complement our existing line of brain parameter monitoring products 
we expect to introduce the novus neurosensor r cerebral blood flow monitoring system in the second half of the novus monitoring system measures both intracranial pressure and cerebral blood flow using a single combined probe and an electronic monitor for data display 
cerebral blood flow is considered to be an important parameter for monitoring cerebral auto regulation and  when combined with the measurement of intracranial pressure  is expected to facilitate improved patient care and clinical management with applications in neuro trauma  cerebrovascular disease  and post operative neurosurgical treatment 
in connection with the novus acquisition  we recorded a million in process research and development charge for the value associated with the development of a next generation monitoring system 
novus remains responsible for the costs to complete development and obtain regulatory clearance for this project  the value of which we recorded as prepaid research and development 
we estimated the value of the in process research and development with the assistance of a third party appraiser using probability weighted cash flow projections with factors for successful development ranging from to and a discount rate 
in august  we acquired the neurosciences division of nmt medical  inc for million in cash 
through this acquisition  we added a range of leading differential pressure valves  including the orbis sigma r  integra hakim r and horizontal vertical lumbar valves  and external ventricular drainage products to our neurosurgical product line 
the acquired operations included a facility located in biot  france that manufactures  packages and distributes shunting  catheter and drainage products 
in july  we acquired the assets of signature technologies  inc  a specialty manufacturer of titanium and stainless steel implants for the neurosurgical and spinal markets  and certain other intellectual property assets 
the purchase price consisted of million in cash  million of deferred consideration  and royalties on future sales of products to be developed 
our acquisition of signature technologies gave us the capability of developing and manufacturing metal implants for our strategic partners and for our direct sale 
signature technologies currently manufactures cranial fixation systems for sale primarily under a single contract manufacturing agreement that expires in june in connection with the signature technologies acquisition  we recorded a million in process research and development charge for the value associated with a project for the development of an enhanced cranial fixation system using patented technology for improved identification and delivery of certain components of the system 
in december  we acquired neurosupplies  inc  a specialty distributor of disposables and supplies for neurologists  pulmonologists and other physicians  for million 
the purchase price consisted of million in cash  a million note paid in january  and  shares of integra common stock 
integra neurosupplies markets a wide variety of supplies to neurologists  hospitals  sleep clinics  and other physicians in the united states as well as to original equipment manufacturers and distributors 
in  we relocated the neurosupplies operations to our facility in pembroke  massachusetts 
in april  we acquired satelec medical  a manufacturer and marketer of the dissectron r ultrasonic surgical aspirator console and a line of related handpieces  for million in cash 
we completed the consolidation of the satelec operations into our andover  england and biot  france facilities in in april  we acquired gmsmbh  the german manufacturer of the licox r product  for million 
the purchase price consisted of million in cash  the forgiveness of million in notes receivable from gmsmbh  and million of future minimum royalty payments to the seller 
prior to the acquisition  we had exclusive marketing rights to the licox r products in the united states and certain other markets 
results of operations net income in was million  or per diluted share  as compared to net income of million or per diluted share in  and net income of million or per diluted share in included in these amounts are certain revenues  charges  or gains resulting from facts and circumstances that  based on our recent history and future expectations  may not recur with similar materiality or impact on continuing operations 
we believe that the identification of all revenues  charges  and gains that meet these criteria promotes comparability of reported financial results 
the following revenues  charges  and gains were included in net income and net income per diluted share recorded in we recorded million of other revenue related to the acceleration of the recognition of unused minimum purchase payments and unamortized license fee revenue from ethicon following the termination of the supply  distribution and collaboration agreement in december we incurred million of expenses related to the closing of our san diego research center  consolidation of the research activities into our other facilities and the discontinuation of certain research programs 
we recorded an acquired in process research and development charge of  in connection with an acquisition 
we made a million donation to the integra foundation  which is included in general and administrative expenses 
we received a million payment from ethicon from the termination of our agreement with them  which is included in other income 
recorded in we recorded a million deferred income tax benefit primarily from the reduction of the valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets associated with net operating loss carryforwards 
we recorded acquired in process research and development charges of million in connection with acquisitions 
recorded in we recorded an million deferred income tax benefit from the reduction of a portion of the valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets associated with net operating loss carryforwards 
we recorded a  loss from the early retirement of debt

domestic product revenues increased million in to million  or of total product revenues 
sales of monitoring and operating room products  which reported a and increase  respectively  in sales over  led our growth in product revenues in reported product revenues for and included the following amounts in revenues from acquired product lines revenues revenues change in thousands monitoring products acquired during   all other product revenues   total monitoring product revenues   operating room products acquired during   all other product revenues   total operating room product revenues   instruments products acquired during  n a products acquired during   all other product revenues   total instruments product revenues   private label products acquired during   all other product revenues   total private label product revenues   consolidated products acquired during  n a products acquired during   all other product revenues   total product revenues   product line revenues excluding and acquisitions grew at for the year ended december  as compared to increased sales of our duragen r dural graft matrix  neuragen tm nerve guide  intracranial monitoring and drainage systems  and neurosurgical systems accounted for most of this growth in revenue from sales of drainage product lines acquired in and the integra neurosupplies tm products acquired in december and increased sales of our intracranial monitoring systems and existing drainage systems all contributed significantly to the growth in our monitoring product revenues in revenue from sales of the padgett instruments product line acquired in and a full year of sales of the dissectron r ultrasonic aspirator product line acquired in april contributed to the growth in instruments product revenues in growth in private label product revenues in was generated primarily by increased revenues from the absorbable collagen sponge component of medtronic s recently approved infuse tm bone graft product and million in sales of product lines acquired in in  we expanded our dural repair product offering with the introduction through our integra neurosciences sales force of the duragen plus tm dural graft matrix and endura tm no react r dural substitute in the united states 
the duragen plus product represents the second generation in integra s line of absorbable and sutureless onlay collagen matrix grafts for cranial and spinal dural repair 
the endura tm product is a new suturable product for the repair of the dura mater 
in addition  through our plastic and reconstructive sales force we launched the dermatome model s 
designed specifically for burn surgeons  it is lighter  more ergonomic and more powerful than the other dermatomes in integra s padgett instrument line 
through ethicon  we also launched the integra tm bi layer matrix wound dressing 
this product is used for the management of wounds  including partial and full thickness wounds  as well as chronic wounds and trauma wounds 
following the termination of the ethicon agreement in december  we now market these products through our plastic and reconstructive sales force 
we have generated our product revenue growth through acquisitions  new product launches and increased direct sales and marketing efforts both domestically and in europe 
we expect that our future growth will derive from our expanded domestic sales force  the continued implementation of our direct sales strategy in europe and from internally developed and acquired products 
we also intend to continue to acquire businesses that complement our existing businesses and products 
gross margin as a percentage of product revenues was in and in and cost of product revenues included   and  in fair value inventory purchase accounting adjustments recorded in connection with acquisitions in  and  respectively 
during  the gross margin was negatively affected by acquisitions of lower margin products and the impact of foreign exchange rates on the cost of products that we manufacture or purchase in europe 
we expect our future gross margins to benefit as we resume the direct sales of the integra r dermal regeneration template and related products and as sales of the higher margin products continue to grow faster than other products 
we currently do not hedge our exposure to foreign currency risk 
in  the cost of products we manufacture in or purchase in europe exceeded our foreign currency denominated revenues 
we expect this imbalance to continue into a further weakening of the dollar against the euro and british pound could negatively affect future gross margins 
other revenue consists of research and development funding from strategic partners and government grants  and license  distribution  and other event related revenues from strategic partners and other third parties 
other revenue increased in by million primarily due to the accelerated recognition of million of license and distribution fee revenue due to the termination of the ethicon agreement 
the  decline in resulted from a decline in government grant funding and the expiration of a technology royalty agreement  although the receipt in of million in event related payments partially offset those negative factors 
since our agreement with ethicon was the main source of our other revenue  we expect it to significantly decrease in other operating expenses the following is a summary of other operating expenses as a percent of product revenues research and development selling and marketing general and administrative we recorded  and million of in process research and development charges in connection with acquisitions in and  respectively 
other research and development expenses increased in both and as a result of increased headcount and spending on product development focused on our neuro products 
we incurred additional expenses of  in related to the consolidation of our san diego research center with our other facilities 
during  we also increased spending on clinical research relationships with research institutions related to markets in which we compete 
we expect our research and development expenses as a percentage of product revenues to decline further in because of the significant increase in hand held instrument product revenues as a proportion of our total revenues 
by their nature  our hand held instrument product lines require less research and development and depend on sales and marketing efforts to support continued growth 
sales and marketing expenses increased significantly in both and with the expansion of our domestic and international sales and marketing organization and increased trade show activities 
in  the increase included sales support for jarit instruments and the expansion of the plastic and reconstructive sales force in anticipation of the termination of the ethicon agreement 
we also hired more experienced marketing professionals and spent more on advertising 
in  we expect to continue to expand our neuro and plastic and reconstructive sales forces 
general and administrative expenses increased million in  million of which is related to operating costs associated with recently acquired businesses that were not reflected in our results for the full year in in addition  in we donated million to the integra foundation and incurred additional costs to consolidate several facilities 
general and administrative expenses increased million in  million of which was related to operating costs associated with acquired businesses that were not reflected in our results for the full year in the remaining increase in general and administrative expenses in consisted primarily of increased rent at our expanded corporate headquarters and higher insurance and legal costs 
we initiated and completed a number of activities in the fourth quarter of  including the expansion of our marketing capability  the doubling of our plastic and reconstructive surgery sales organization  the consolidation of our san diego research and manufacturing facilities  and making a significant contribution to the integra foundation 
these activities resulted in higher operating costs compared to our recent trend 
we anticipate our operating costs as a percentage of product revenues to decrease compared to the levels incurred in the fourth quarter of amortization expense increased in primarily because of amortization on additional intangible assets acquired through our business acquisitions 
annual amortization expense is expected to be approximately million in  million in  million in  million in  and million in non operating income and expenses in  we received approximately million of net proceeds from the sale of million of our contingent convertible subordinated notes due in march we have recorded million for the interest expense associated with the notes  which was offset by million of interest income on our invested cash and marketable debt securities 
we will pay additional interest contingent interest on our convertible notes if  at thirty days prior to maturity  integra s common stock price is greater than per share 
the fair value of this contingent interest obligation is marked to its fair value at each balance sheet date  with changes in the fair value recorded to interest expense 
we recorded a  liability related to the estimated fair value of the contingent interest obligation at the time the notes were issued 
at december   the estimated fair value of the contingent interest obligation was  in august  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a million notional amount to hedge the risk of changes in fair value attributable to interest rate risk with respect to a portion of our fixed rate convertible notes 
we receive a fixed rate from the counterparty  payable on a semi annual basis  and pay to the counterparty a floating rate based on month libor minus basis points  payable on a quarterly basis 
the interest rate swap agreement terminates in march  subject to early termination upon the occurrence of certain events  including redemption or conversion of the convertible notes 
the interest rate swap agreement qualifies as a fair value hedge under sfas no 
 as amended accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the net amount to be paid or received under the interest rate swap agreement is recorded as a component of interest expense 
interest expense for the year ended december  reflects a  reduction associated with the interest rate swap 
the net fair value of the interest rate swap at inception was  at december   the net fair value of the interest rate swap increased  to million  and this amount is included in other liabilities 
in connection with this fair value hedge transaction  we recorded a  net decrease in the carrying value of our convertible notes 
the net  difference between changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap and the convertible notes represents the ineffective portion of the hedging relationship  and this amount is recorded in other income 
our net other income expense increased by million in this increase consisted primarily of the million termination payment received from ethicon and foreign currency transaction gains 
in august  we raised million from a follow on public offering of million shares of common stock 
accordingly  net interest income in increased to million  as compared to net interest income of million in income taxes since  we have generated positive taxable income on a cumulative basis 
in light of this trend  our projections for future taxable earnings  and the expected timing of the reversal of deductible temporary differences  we concluded in the fourth quarter of that we no longer needed to maintain a portion of the valuation allowance recorded against federal and state net operating loss carryforwards and certain other temporary differences 
we reduced the valuation allowance by million in because we believed that it was more likely than not that we would realize the benefit of that portion of the deferred tax assets recorded at december  in the fourth quarter of  we reduced the remaining valuation allowance recorded against net operating loss carryforwards by million  which reflected our estimate of additional tax benefits that we expected to realize in the future 
a valuation allowance of million is recorded against the remaining million of net deferred tax assets recorded at december  this valuation allowance relates to deferred tax assets for certain expenses which will be deductible for tax purposes in very limited circumstances and for which we believe it is unlikely that we will recognize the associated tax benefit 
we do not anticipate additional income tax benefits through future reductions in the valuation allowance 
however  if we determine that we would be able to realize more or less than the recorded amount of net deferred tax assets  we will record an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance in the period such a determination is made 
in  our effective income tax rate was of income before income taxes 
the increase as compared to and resulted from the income tax benefits related to the reduction of deferred tax asset valuation allowances recorded in and and a larger proportion of our taxable income being generated in higher tax jurisdictions in the net change in the company s valuation allowance was million  million  and million  in  and  respectively 
at december   we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million for federal and state income tax purposes  respectively  to offset future taxable income 
the federal and state net operating loss carryforwards expire through and  respectively 
new jersey has imposed a moratorium on the ability of corporations to use their net operating loss carryforwards to reduce their new jersey state tax obligations 
at december   several of our subsidiaries had unused net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards arising from periods prior to our ownership which expire through the internal revenue code limits the timing and manner in which we may use any acquired net operating losses or tax credits 
international product revenues and operations because we have operations based in europe and we generate revenues and incur operating expenses in euros and british pounds  we will experience currency exchange risk with respect to those foreign currency denominated revenues or expenses 
in  the cost of products we manufactured in our european facilities or purchased in foreign currencies exceeded our foreign currency denominated revenues 
we expect this imbalance to continue into we currently do not hedge our exposure to foreign currency risk 
accordingly  a further weakening of the dollar against the euro and british pound could negatively affect future gross margins and operating margins 
we will continue to assess the potential effects that changes in foreign currency exchange rates could have on our business 
if we believe this potential impact presents a significant risk to our business  we may enter into derivative financial instruments to mitigate this risk 
additionally  we generate significant revenues outside the united states  a portion of which are us dollar denominated transactions conducted with customers who generate revenue in currencies other than the us dollar 
as a result  currency fluctuations between the us dollar and the currencies in which those customers do business may have an impact on the demand for our products in foreign countries 
our sales to foreign markets may be affected by local economic conditions  regulatory or political considerations  the effectiveness of our sales representatives and distributors  local competition  and changes in local medical practice 
relationships with customers and effective terms of sale frequently vary by country  often with longer term receivables than are typical in the united states 
product revenues by major geographic area are summarized below united asia other states europe pacific foreign consolidated in thousands in  product revenues from customers outside the united states totaled million  or of consolidated product revenues  of which approximately were to european customers 
of this amount  million of these revenues were generated in foreign currencies 
in  product revenues from customers outside the united states totaled million  or of consolidated product revenues  of which approximately were to european customers 
of this amount  million of these revenues were generated in foreign currencies 
in  revenues from customers outside the united states totaled million  or of consolidated product revenues  of which approximately were to european customers 
of this amount  million of these revenues were generated in foreign currencies 
liquidity and capital resources cash and marketable securities at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling million 
investments consist almost entirely of highly liquid  interest bearing debt securities 
cash flows we generated positive operating cash flows of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
operating cash flows improved in and primarily as a result of higher pre tax income and the benefits from the continued utilization of our net operating loss carryforwards and tax deductions generated by employee stock option exercises 
based on our current unused net operating loss carryforward position and various other future potential tax deductions  we expect our operating cash flows to continue to benefit from actual cash tax payments being lower than our effective book income tax rate for at least the next two years 
in  we also generated million from the issuance of common stock under employee benefit plans and million of net proceeds from the sale of million of our contingent convertible subordinated notes 
our principal uses of funds in were million for acquisitions  million for the net purchases of marketable debt securities  million for the repurchase of approximately million shares our common stock and million for capital expenditures 
the significant repurchase of our common stock in was made simultaneously with the issuance of our convertible notes 
in  our principal sources of funds were million of operating cash flow and million from the issuance of common stock 
in  our principal uses of funds were million for acquisitions  the repayment of a million note and million for capital expenditures 
in august  we issued million shares of common stock in a public offering at per share 
the net proceeds generated by the offering  after expenses  were million 
with the proceeds from the public offering of common stock  we repaid all outstanding debt  including million of bank loans and million payable under the terms of a promissory note  in additionally  a related term loan and revolving credit facility was terminated in working capital at december  and  working capital was million and million  respectively 
the increase in working capital in was primarily due to a decrease in the overall maturity of our marketable securities portfolio  additional investments in inventory to support our growth in product revenues  higher accounts receivable balances related to increased sales  and the recognition of significant amounts of deferred revenue and customer advances as revenue in convertible debt and related hedging activities in  we generated million of net proceeds from the sale of million of our contingent convertible subordinated notes due in march we pay interest on the convertible notes at an annual rate of each september th and march th 
we will also pay contingent interest on the notes if  at thirty days prior to maturity  integra s common stock price is greater than 
the contingent interest will be payable for each of the last three years the notes remain outstanding in an amount equal to the greater of i of the face amount of the notes and ii the amount of regular cash dividends paid during each such year on the number of shares of common stock into which each note is convertible 
holders of the notes may convert the notes into shares of our common stock under certain circumstances  including when the market price of our common stock on the previous trading day is more than per share  based on an initial conversion price of per share 
the notes are general  unsecured obligations of integra and will be subordinate to any future senior indebtedness 
we cannot redeem the notes prior to their maturity  and the notes holders may compel us to repurchase the notes upon a change of control 
there are no financial covenants associated with the convertible notes 
in august  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a million notional amount to hedge the risk of changes in fair value attributable to interest rate risk with respect to a portion of the notes 
we receive a fixed rate from the counterparty  payable on a semi annual basis  and pay to the counterparty a floating rate based on month libor minus basis points  payable on a quarterly basis 
the interest rate swap agreement terminates in march  subject to early termination upon the occurrence of certain events  including redemption or conversion of the contingent convertible notes 
share repurchase plans in march  our board of directors authorized us to repurchase up to an additional million shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price not to exceed million 
we may repurchase shares under this program through march either in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions 
during and  respectively  we repurchased approximately million and  shares of our common stock under previously authorized share repurchase programs 
dividend policy we have not paid any cash dividends on our common stock since our formation 
any future determinations to pay cash dividends on our common stock will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon our financial condition  results of operations  cash flows  and other factors deemed relevant by the board of directors 
requirements and capital resources we believe that our cash and marketable securities are sufficient to finance our operations and capital expenditures in the near term 
in  we expect to increase cash outlays for capital expenditures as compared to  primarily because of an estimated million of expenditures associated with information system upgrades 
given the significant level of liquid assets and our objective to grow by acquisition and alliances  our financial position could change significantly if we were to complete a business acquisition by utilizing a significant portion of our liquid assets 
currently  we do not have any existing borrowing capacity or other credit facilities in place to raise significant amounts of capital if such a need arises 
contractual obligations and commitments we are obligated to pay the following amounts under various agreements less than more than total year years years years in millions long term debt interest on long term debt operating leases purchase obligations pension contribution other long term liabilities 
total pension contributions after cannot be reasonably estimated 
in addition  under other agreements we are required to make payments based on sales levels of certain products or if specific development milestones are achieved 
in january  the company acquired the r b instrument business from r b surgical solutions  llc for approximately million in cash 
the r b instrument line is a complete line of high quality handheld surgical instruments used in neuro and spinal surgery 
the acquired business generated approximately million in revenues for the twelve months ended december  the company plans to market these products through its jarit sales force 
in january  the company acquired the sparta disposable critical care devices and surgical instruments business from fleetwood medical  inc for approximately million in cash 
the sparta product line includes products used in plastic and reconstructive  ear  nose and throat ent  neuro  ophthalmic and general surgery 
prior to the acquisition  fleetwood medical marketed these product lines primarily to hospitals and physicians through a catalogue and a network of distributors 
the acquired business generated approximately million in revenues for the twelve months ended december  use of estimates and critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent liabilities  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
significant estimates affecting amounts reported or disclosed in the consolidated financial statements include allowances for doubtful accounts receivable and sales returns  net realizable value of inventories  estimates of future cash flows associated with acquired in process research and development charges  derivatives  amortization periods for acquired intangible assets  and loss contingencies 
these estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the current circumstances 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
we believe the following accounting policies  which form the basis for developing these estimates  are those that are most critical to the presentation of our financial statements and require the most difficult  subjective and complex judgments allowances for doubtful accounts and sales returns we evaluate the collectibility of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where a specific customer is unable to meet its financial obligations to us  we record an allowance against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount that we reasonably expect to collect 
for all other customers  we record allowances for doubtful accounts based on the length of time the receivables are past due  the current business environment and our historical experience 
if the financial condition of customers or the length of time that receivables are past due were to change  we may change the recorded amount of allowances for doubtful accounts in the future 
we record a provision for estimated sales returns and allowances on product revenues in the same period as the related revenues are recorded 
we base these estimates on historical sales returns and other known factors 
actual returns could be different from our estimates and the related provisions for sales returns and allowances  resulting in future changes to the sales returns and allowances provision 
inventories inventories  consisting of purchased materials  direct labor and manufacturing overhead  are stated at the lower of cost  the value determined by the first in  first out method  or market 
at each balance sheet date  we evaluate ending inventories for excess quantities  obsolescence or shelf life expiration 
our evaluation includes an analysis of historical sales levels by product and projections of future demand 
to the extent that we determine there are excess  obsolete or expired inventory quantities  we record valuation reserves against all or a portion of the value of the related products 
if future demand or market conditions are different than our projections  a change in recorded inventory valuation reserves may be required and would be reflected in cost of revenues in the period the revision is made 
derivatives we report all derivatives at their estimated fair value and record changes in fair value in current earnings or defer these changes until a related hedged item is recognized in earnings  depending on the nature and effectiveness of the hedging relationship 
the designation of a derivative as a hedge is made on the date the derivative contract is executed 
on an ongoing basis  we assess whether each derivative continues to be highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of hedged items 
if and when a derivative is no longer expected to be highly effective  we discontinue hedge accounting 
all hedge ineffectiveness is included in current period earnings in other income expense  net 
we document all relationships between hedged items and derivatives 
our overall risk management strategy describes the circumstances under which we may undertake hedge transactions and enter into derivatives 
the objective of our current risk management strategy is to hedge the risk of changes in fair value attributable to interest rate risk with respect to a portion of our fixed rate debt 
the determination of fair value of derivatives is based on valuation models that use observable market quotes or projected cash flows and our view of the creditworthiness of the derivative counterparty 
if a derivative is no longer deemed qualify as an effective hedge  changes in the fair value of that derivative could significantly affect our non operating income or expense 
acquired in process research and development charges in process research and development charges are recorded in connection with acquisitions and represent the value assigned to acquired assets which have not yet reached technological feasibility and for which there is no alternative use 
fair value is generally assigned to these assets based on the net present value of the projected cash flows expected to be generated by those assets 
significant assumptions underlying these cash flows include our assessment of the timing and our ability to successfully complete the in process research and development project  projected cash flows associated with the successful completion of the project  and interest rates used to discount these cash flows to their present value 
amortization periods we provide for amortization using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of acquired intangible assets 
we base the determination of these useful lives on the period over which we expect the related assets to contribute to our cash flows 
if our assessment of the useful lives of intangible assets changes  we may change future amortization expense 
loss contingencies we are subject to claims and lawsuits in the ordinary course of our business  including claims by employees or former employees  with respect to our products and involving commercial disputes 
our financial statements do not reflect any material amounts related to possible unfavorable outcomes of claims and lawsuits to which we are currently a party because we currently believe that such claims and lawsuits are either adequately covered by insurance or otherwise indemnified  and are not expected  individually or in the aggregate  to result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
however  it is possible that our results of operations  financial position and cash flows in a particular period could be materially affected by these contingencies if we change our assessment of the likely outcome of these matters 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to various market risks  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates that could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition 
to manage the volatility relating to these typical business exposures  we may enter into various derivative transactions when appropriate 
we do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading or other speculative purposes 
foreign currency exchange rate risk because we have operations based in europe and we generate revenues and incur operating expenses in euros and british pounds  we will experience currency exchange risk with respect to those foreign currency denominated revenues or expenses 
in  the total cost of products we manufacture in or purchase in foreign currencies and other operating expenses that we incur in foreign currencies exceeded our total foreign currency denominated revenues 
we expect this imbalance to continue into a further weakening of the dollar against the euro and british pound could negatively affect future gross margins and operating margins 
currently  we do not use derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency risk 
as the volume of our business transacted in foreign currencies increases  we will continue to assess the potential effects that changes in foreign currency exchange rates could have on our business 
if we believe this potential impact presents a significant risk to our business  we may enter into derivative financial instruments to mitigate this risk 
interest rate risk marketable debt securities we are exposed to the risk of interest rate fluctuations on the fair value and interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents and investments in available for sale marketable debt securities 
a hypothetical basis point movement in interest rates applicable to our cash and cash equivalents and investments in marketable debt securities outstanding at december  would increase or decrease interest income by approximately million on an annual basis 
we are not subject to material foreign currency exchange risk with respect to these investments 
interest rate risk long term debt and related hedging instruments we are exposed to the risk of interest rate fluctuations on the net interest received or paid under the terms of an interest rate swap 
at december   we had outstanding a million notional amount interest rate swap used to hedge the risk of changes in fair value attributable to interest rate risk with respect to a portion of our million principal amount fixed rate contingent convertible subordinated notes due march our interest rate swap agreement qualifies as a fair value hedge under sfas no 
 as amended  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
at december   the net fair value of the interest rate swap approximated million and is included in other liabilities 
the net fair value of the interest rate swap represents the estimated receipts or payments that would be made to terminate the agreement 
a hypothetical basis point movement in interest rates applicable to the interest rate swap would increase or decrease interest expense by approximately  on an annual basis
