item legal proceedings kaiser litigation by july   kaiser aluminum  its property insurers  kaiser injured workers  nearby businesses and  residents near the kaiser facility in louisiana certified as a class  filed product liability and business interruption cases against the corporation and six other defendants in louisiana state court seeking damages in excess of million 
these cases alleged that a thomas betts cable tie mounting base failed thereby allowing bundled cables to come in contact with a kv energized bus bar 
this alleged electrical fault supposedly initiated a series of events culminating in an explosion  which leveled acres of the kaiser facility 
a seven week trial in the fall resulted in a jury verdict in favor of the corporation 
however  months later  the trial court overturned that verdict in granting plaintiffs judgment notwithstanding the verdict motions 
on december   the trial court judge found the thomas betts product  an adhesive backed mounting base  to be unreasonably dangerous and therefore assigned fault to t b 
the judge set the damages for the injured workers at million and the damages for kaiser at million 
the corporation s allocation is million  plus legal interest 
the corporation has appealed this ruling 
management believes there are meritorious defenses to the claim and intends to contest the litigation vigorously 
the appeal required a bond in the amount of million the judgment plus legal interest 
plaintiffs successfully moved the trial court to increase the bond to million 
nonetheless  the corporation s liability insurers have secured the million bond 
the corporation has not reflected a liability in its financial statements for the kaiser litigation because management believes meritorious defenses exist for this claim and thus management does not believe a loss is probable 
further  until there are new developments in the case that would provide more concrete amounts  management cannot provide any better range of possible losses than zero to the amount of the judgment 
when evaluating the impact of the judgment on the corporation s liquidity  investors should note that the corporation has insurance coverage in excess of the judgment 
asbestos cases the corporation and two subsidiaries  amerace corporation and le mason red dot  acquired respectively in and  are subject to asbestos lawsuits in mississippi  new page of 
table of contents jersey and three other states  related to either undefined and unidentified or historic products 
in all cases  the corporation is investigating these allegations 
amerace is one of hundreds of defendants and red dot and the corporation are one of dozens of defendants 
no product of amerace  red dot or thomas and betts has been identified in these cases to date 
in the amerace litigation  four lawsuits have already been dismissed 
potential exposure at this time  if any  cannot be estimated 
management believes  however  that there is no merit to these claims  that damages  if any  are remote and believes that a loss is not probable in any of these cases 
insurance coverage is available in connection with these claims 
other legal matters the corporation is also involved in legal proceedings and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business 
in those cases where the corporation is the defendant  plaintiffs may seek to recover large and sometimes unspecified amounts or other types of relief and some matters may remain unresolved for several years 
such matters may be subject to many uncertainties and outcomes which are not predictable with assurance 
management considers the gross probable liability when determining whether to accrue for a loss contingency for a legal matter 
the corporation has provided for losses to the extent probable and estimable 
the legal matters that have been recorded in the corporation s consolidated financial statements are based on gross assessments of expected settlement or expected outcome 
additional losses  even though not anticipated  could have a material adverse effect on the corporation s financial position  results of operations or liquidity in any given period 
environmental matters owners and operators of sites containing hazardous substances  as well as generators of hazardous substances  are subject to broad and retroactive liability for investigatory and cleanup costs and damages arising out of past disposal activities 
such liability in many cases may be imposed regardless of fault or the legality of the original disposal activity 
the corporation has received notifications from the united states environmental protection agency epa or similar state environmental regulatory agencies or private parties that the corporation  in many instances along with others  may currently be potentially responsible for the remediation of sites pursuant to the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act of  as amended the superfund act  similar federal and state environmental statutes  or common law theories 
the corporation  along with others  may be held jointly and severally liable for all costs relating to investigation and remediation of sites pursuant to the superfund act or similar state environmental enactments 
the corporation is the owner or operator  or former owner  of various manufacturing locations currently being evaluated by the corporation for the presence of contamination that may require remediation 
these sites include former or inactive facilities or properties in alabama mobile  connecticut monroe  indiana medora  massachusetts attleboro  boston  canton  new hampshire new milford  new jersey butler  elizabeth  garwood  new york horseheads  pennsylvania perkasie  pittsburgh  ohio bucyrus and oklahoma stillwater 
the sites further include active manufacturing locations in new jersey hackettstown  new mexico albuquerque  south carolina lancaster  and wisconsin hager city 
four of these current and former manufacturing locations relate to activities of american electric for the period prior to the acquisition of american electric by the corporation 
these page of 
table of contents four sites are located in hager city  wisconsin  lancaster  south carolina  medora  indiana  and pittsburgh  pennsylvania 
each of these sites except for one pittsburgh is subject to an asset purchase agreement dated june  between american electric and itt corporation itt 
itt and the corporation have shared responsibilities and costs at the four outstanding sites subject to this agreement 
for certain of the sites covered by this agreement  itt agreed to indemnify american electric for environmental liabilities  if any  that occurred prior to the purchase of the facilities by american electric 
the corporation believes that the indemnity of itt is reliable  however  there can be no assurances that any such indemnities will be honored 
in december  the corporation acquired augat inc pursuant to the various environmental laws and regulations described above  augat has evaluated or remediated  and may have liability associated with contamination at a number of sites 
pursuant to a purchase agreement  dated july   between the corporation and tyco group sarl  the corporation agreed to retain certain environmental liabilities  if any  for former augat manufacturing locations in alabama montgomery plants  massachusetts mashpee and south carolina inman  and for three offsite alleged disposal locations 
in november  the corporation acquired kaufel group  ltd 
pursuant to the various environmental laws and regulations described above  the corporation is evaluating  and may have liability associated with contamination at two facilities owned and operated by kaufel in dorval  quebec 
the corporation has provided for liabilities to the extent probable and estimable  but the corporation is not able to predict the extent of its ultimate liability with respect to all of its pending or future environmental matters 
however  the corporation believes that any additional liability with respect to the aforementioned environmental matters will not be material to its financial position or results of operations

table of contents negative economic conditions may adversely affect performance the success of thomas betts business is directly linked to positive economic conditions in the countries where it sells its products 
material adverse changes in economic or industry conditions generally or in the specific markets served by thomas betts could adversely affect the future results of the corporation 
additionally  continued economic slowdown in the us or in thomas betts major foreign markets  including canada and europe  could reduce the corporation s overall net sales 
thomas betts does business in geographically diverse markets 
in fiscal year  approximately of thomas betts net sales were generated outside of the united states 
because these influences are not always foreseeable  there can be no assurance that the business will not be affected by these occurrences 
changes in customer demand as thomas betts works to enhance its product offerings  its competitors will most likely continue to improve their products and will likely develop new offerings with competitive price and performance characteristics 
although thomas betts believes that it has specific technological and other advantages over certain of its competitors  because of the intensity of the competition in the product areas and geographic markets that it serves  thomas betts could experience increased downward pressure on the selling prices for certain of its products 
the activities of the corporation s competitors designed to enhance their own product offerings  coupled with any unforeseeable changes in customer demand for various products of thomas betts  could affect the corporation s overall product mix  pricing  margins  plant utilization levels and asset valuations 
adverse regulatory  environmental  monetary or other governmental policies which may affect profitability thomas betts is subject to governmental regulations throughout the world 
unforeseen changes in these governmental regulations may reduce its profitability 
namely  significant changes in monetary or fiscal policies in the us and abroad could result in currency fluctuations  including fluctuations in the canadian dollar  euro and british pound  which  in turn  could adversely affect thomas betts net sales  costs and expenses 
furthermore  significant changes in any number of governmental policies could create trade restrictions  patent enforcement issues  adverse tax rate changes and changes to tax treatment of items such as tax credits  withholding taxes  transfer pricing and other income and expense recognition for tax purposes  including changes in taxation on income generated in puerto rico 
these changes might limit thomas betts ability to sell its products in certain markets  and could negatively affect its business  operating results and financial condition 
in addition  thomas betts operations are subject to international  federal  state and local laws and regulations governing environmental matters  including emissions to air  discharge to waters and the generation and handling of waste 
thomas betts is also subject to laws relating to occupational health and safety 
the operation of manufacturing plants involves a high level of susceptibility in these areas  and there is no assurance that thomas betts will not incur material costs or liabilities in the future 
moreover  expectations of remediation expenses could be affected by  and potentially significant expenditures could be required to comply with  environmental regulations and health and safety laws that may be page of

future remediation technology advances could adversely impact expectations of remediation expenses 
adequacy of insurance in accordance with its risk management practices  the corporation continually reevaluates risks  their potential cost and the cost of minimizing them 
to reduce the corporation s exposure to material risks  in certain circumstances  it purchases insurance 
certain risks are inherent in the manufacturing of the corporation s products and the corporation s insurance may not be adequate to cover potential claims against it involving its products 
the corporation is also exposed to risks inherent in the packaging and distribution of products 
although the corporation maintains liability insurance  management cannot assure that the coverage limits under these insurance programs will be adequate to protect thomas betts against future claims  or that the corporation can and will maintain this insurance on acceptable terms in the future 
terrorist acts and acts of war terrorist acts and acts of war wherever located around the world may cause damage or disruption to our employees  facilities  suppliers  distributors or customers  which could significantly impact our net sales  costs and expenses and financial condition 
the terrorist attacks that took place in the united states on september  were unprecedented events that have created many economic and political uncertainties  some of which may materially harm our business and results of operations 
the potential for future terrorist attacks  the national and international responses to terrorist attacks  and other acts of war or hostility have created many economic and political uncertainties  which could adversely affect our business and results of operations in ways that cannot presently be predicted 
in addition  as a global company with headquarters and significant operations located in the united states  we may be impacted by actions against the united states 
we are uninsured for losses and interruptions caused by acts of war 
however  our insurers have confirmed coverage for losses caused by terrorist acts within our policy limits

segment results the corporation evaluates its business segments on the basis of segment earnings loss  with segment earnings loss defined as earnings loss from continuing operations before interest  taxes  asset impairments  restructuring charges and certain other charges 
the corporation s segment earnings loss is significantly influenced by the operating performance of its electrical segment that accounts for approximately three fourths of the corporation s net sales and a majority of its segment earnings during each of the three years ended december  during the years presented  the electrical segment s plants operated at the lower range of practical capacity due to weak industry demand

the underlying sales shortfall was mainly due to lower volumes in our core us commercial and utility markets 
the weakness in the utility market for electrical connectors and switchgear was seen primarily in the first half of electrical segment earnings for reflect manufacturing efficiency improvements derived from the manufacturing restructuring program being offset by the impact from lower sales volumes  higher material costs primarily steel and a less favorable sales mix in its us electrical markets 
electrical segment results in included million of charges associated with the manufacturing restructuring program 
both and results reflect the negative impact of running the corporation s manufacturing plants at the lower range of practical capacity utilization due to weak industry demand 
year compared with net sales for the electrical segment decreased in  due in part to continued weakness in us commercial and industrial construction markets  original equipment manufacturing markets and lower across the board capital spending by us manufacturers 
net sales in the prior year included approximately million from divested and discontinued product lines 
electrical segment earnings in improved substantially when compared with despite the impact of lower sales volumes and million in charges associated with the manufacturing restructuring program 
this improvement was due to significantly lower manufacturing costs  primarily as the result of the manufacturing restructure program  lower freight costs  improved selling prices and significantly lower sg a expenses reflecting the efforts to size sales and support function commensurate with market conditions and to tightly manage expenses 
the corporation has continued to strengthen relationships with both distributors and end users of its products  which has helped offset the impact of unfavorable conditions in its core industrial  commercial and utility markets

sales and segment earnings in were adversely impacted by a million charge for exposure associated with the bankruptcy of a large cable tv customer 
during first quarter of and the year  the segment had assets classified as held for sale and consequently suspended depreciation of million and million  respectively 
the corporation s hvac segment net sales increased approximately compared with the increase was due to including a full year of results from a small european acquisition made in late and favorable impacts of foreign currency exchange 
the improvement in segment earnings over was mainly due to reduced manufacturing costs primarily in its north american operations and  to a lessor extent  the impact of the previously mentioned european acquisition 
year compared with steel structures net sales and segment earnings in were adversely impacted by significantly lower sales volumes in late due to delayed spending by utility companies in expanding the power transmission grid and changes in project mix

when adjusted for the elimination of goodwill amortization  segment earnings would have been million in critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements contained in this report requires the use of estimates and assumptions to determine certain amounts reported as net sales  costs  expenses  assets or liabilities and certain amounts disclosed as contingent assets or liabilities 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates or assumptions 
the corporation s significant accounting policies are described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
management believes the corporation s critical accounting policies include revenue recognition  inventory valuation  goodwill and other intangible assets  long lived assets  income taxes  and environmental costs 
page of 
table of contents revenue recognition the corporation recognizes revenue in accordance with the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
the corporation recognizes revenue when finished products are shipped to unaffiliated customers and both title and risks of ownership are transferred 
sales discounts  quantity and price rebates  and allowances are estimated based on contractual commitments and experience and recorded in the period as a reduction of revenue in which the sale is recognized 
a number of distributors  primarily in the electrical segment  have the right to return goods under certain circumstances and those returns  which are reasonably estimable  are accrued as a reduction of revenue at the time of shipment 
management analyzes historical returns and allowances  current economic trends and specific customer circumstances when evaluating the adequacy of accounts receivable related reserves and accruals 
inventory valuation inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined using the first in  first out fifo method 
to ensure inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market  the corporation periodically evaluates the carrying value of its inventories 
the corporation also periodically performs an evaluation of inventory for excess and obsolete items 
such evaluations are based on management s judgment and use of estimates 
such estimates incorporate inventory quantities on hand  aging of the inventory  sales forecasts for particular product groupings  planned dispositions of product lines and overall industry trends 
goodwill and other intangible assets the corporation follows the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires a transitional and annual test of goodwill and indefinite lived assets associated with reporting units for indications of impairment 
the corporation performs its annual impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of each year  unless circumstances dictate more frequent assessments 
under the provisions of sfas no 
 each test of goodwill requires the corporation to determine the fair value of each reporting unit  and compare the fair value to the reporting unit s carrying amount 
to the extent a reporting unit s carrying amount exceeds its fair value  an indication exists that the reporting unit s goodwill may be impaired and the corporation must perform a second more detailed impairment assessment 
the second impairment assessment involves allocating the reporting unit s fair value to all of its recognized and unrecognized assets and liabilities in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill as of the assessment date 
the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill is then compared to the carrying amount of goodwill to quantify an impairment charge as of the assessment date 
see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding the impairment charge of million recorded in as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
and other transitional disclosure information 
long lived assets the corporation follows the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
establishes accounting standards for the impairment of long lived assets such as property  plant and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization 
for purposes of recognizing and measuring impairment of long lived assets  the corporation evaluates assets for associated product groups 
the corporation reviews long lived assets to be held and used for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
if the sum of the undiscounted expected future cash flows over the remaining useful life of the primary page of 
table of contents asset in the associated product groups is less than the carrying amount of the assets  the assets are considered to be impaired 
impairment losses are measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
when fair values are not available  the corporation estimates fair value using the expected future cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risks associated with the recovery of the assets 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
income taxes the corporation uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
this method recognizes the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between book and tax bases of assets and liabilities and provides a valuation allowance based on a more likely than not criteria 
the corporation has valuation allowances for deferred tax assets primarily associated with operating loss carryforwards  tax credit carryforwards and deferred state income tax assets 
realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent upon the corporation s ability to generate sufficient future taxable income and  if necessary  execution of its tax planning strategies 
management believes that it is more likely than not that future taxable income  based on enacted tax law in effect as of december   will be sufficient to realize the recorded deferred tax assets net of existing valuation allowances 
management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies  which involve estimates and uncertainties  in making this assessment 
tax planning strategies include primarily sales of non core assets 
projected future taxable income is based on management s forecast of the operating results of the corporation 
management periodically reviews such forecasts in comparison with actual results and expected trends 
in the event management determines that sufficient future taxable income  in light of tax planning strategies  may not be generated to fully realize net deferred tax assets  the corporation will increase valuation allowances by a charge to income tax expense in the period of such determination 
environmental costs environmental expenditures that relate to current operations are expensed or capitalized  as appropriate 
remediation costs that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations are accrued when it is probable that those costs will be incurred and can be reasonably estimated based on evaluations of current available facts related to each site
