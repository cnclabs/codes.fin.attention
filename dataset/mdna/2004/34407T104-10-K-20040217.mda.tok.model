outlook the company expects to begin operation of its low fare airline  independence air  during the timing and terms of the company s commencement of operations as independence air depend  among other things  on the terms and timing of its disengagement as a united express carrier  which cannot be projected at this time 
if united were to affirm the existing code share agreement with the company  the company would continue to pursue its plans to operate independence air using the narrowbody jets that the company is in the process of acquiring and any regional jets that are not deployed in the united express operations 
the company expects that first quarter operating results relative to operating results for the fourth quarter for may be affected by reduced aircraft utilization and reduced operational performance in the company s united express operations at chicago o hare international airport due to high traffic congestion and united controlled cancellation and delays of flights and in the company s delta connection operation due to schedule adjustments necessary to accommodate maintenance on the engines of its jets 
in  other operating expenses and capital expenditures will also be affected by increased expenditures that the company incurs in preparation of the commencement of operations of independence air and by professional fees 
the company may incur unexpected expenses in connection with any termination of its united express and or delta connection code share operations 
the company expects to incur operating losses for at least the first three quarters after it commences operations of independence air 
the extent and duration of such losses depends upon the terms and timing of the company s disengagement as a united express carrier  including whether the company experiences an extended period without conducting any revenue operations 
the company s past financial performance and operating results under its united express and delta connection operations will have no effect and no bearing on the financial performance or operating results of independence air

net cash provided by financing activities was mainly related to proceeds from exercise of stock options 
capital commitments and off balance sheet arrangements the company s business is very capital intensive  requiring significant amounts of capital to fund the acquisition of assets  particularly aircraft 
the company historically has funded the acquisition of its aircraft by entering into off balance sheet financing arrangements known as leveraged leases  in which third parties provide equity and debt financing to purchase the aircraft and simultaneously enter into long term agreements to lease the aircraft to the company 
the company has entered into memoranda of understanding for the lease of airbus a aircraft and the purchase of airbus a or a aircraft 
the leased aircraft will be obtained from traditional aircraft lessors on operating leases with terms ranging from five to twelve years 
the company also often enters into long term lease commitments to ensure access to terminal  cargo  maintenance and other similar facilities 
as can be seen in the table below setting forth information as of december   these operating lease commitments  including amounts to be due for the airbus aircraft which are subject to execution of definitive lease and purchase agreements  are significant 
in millions thereafter total long term debt capital lease obligations guaranteed simulator usage commitments operating lease commitments aircraft purchase commitments other purchase commitments total contractual capital commitments includes estimated amounts to be due for the airbus narrowbody aircraft which are subject to execution of definitive lease or purchase agreements 
includes commitments for crj aircraft which are subject to certain conditions which  unless waived by the company  would not be satisfied unless the company has an agreement with united to operate these aircraft in the united express program 
also see note debt  note obligations under capital leases  note operating leases  note commitments and contingencies  and note recent accounting pronouncements in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of these items and off balance sheet arrangements 
during the year ended december   the company accepted deliveries of crjs  five of which were leveraged lease transactions  six were purchased with debt financing  and two were purchased outright by the company 
the company also has a variety of other long term contractual commitments that are of a nature that  under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  are not required to be reflected on the company s balance sheet  and that are not generally viewed as off balance sheet financing arrangements  such as commitments for major overhaul maintenance on the company s aircraft  and pilot training 
see liquidity and capital resources other commitments below and business pilot training above  and note summary of accounting policies k maintenance and note commitments and contingencies training in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of these items 
other financing on september   the company entered into an asset based lending agreement with wachovia bank  na wachovia that initially provided the company with a line of credit for up to million 
under the terms of the line of credit  it was necessary for the company to request a covenant waiver as a result of the chapter bankruptcy filing by united airlines 
in order to obtain this waiver  the company agreed to reduce the size of the line of credit to million and to revise certain covenants 
on july   the company entered into a new agreement with wachovia which replaced the line of credit 
this new agreement  which has no expiration date  provides for the issuance of letters of credit  and is collateralized by certificates of deposit 
under this agreement  the company has million on deposit with wachovia as collateral for letters of credit issued on behalf of the company 
the amounts on deposit with wachovia are shown as restricted cash on the company s balance sheet as of december  in september  approximately million of pass through certificates were issued in a private placement by separate pass through trusts  which purchased with the proceeds  equipment notes the equipment notes issued in connection with i leveraged lease transactions relating to four j s and six crjs  all of which were leased to the company the leased aircraft  and ii the financing of four j s owned by the company the owned aircraft 
the equipment notes issued with respect to the owned aircraft are direct obligations of aca  guaranteed by acai and are included as debt obligations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and in the table above 
the equipment notes issued with respect to the leased aircraft are not obligations of aca or guaranteed by acai 
aircraft the company has significant lease obligations for aircraft that are classified as operating leases and  therefore  are not reflected as liabilities on the company s balance sheet 
the remaining terms of such leases range from one to sixteen and three quarters years 
the company s total rent expense in under all non cancelable aircraft operating leases was approximately million 
as of december   the company s minimum annual rental payments for under all non cancelable aircraft operating leases with remaining terms of more than one year were approximately million 
in order to minimize the total aircraft rental expense over the entire life of the related aircraft leveraged lease transactions  the company has uneven semiannual lease payment dates of january and july for its crj and jet aircraft 
approximately of the company s annual lease payments for its crj and jet aircraft are due in january and are due in july 
as such  the company made lease payments for its crj and jet aircraft totaling million in january as of february   the company had firm orders for bombardier crjs crjs in addition to the previously delivered  and options for additional crjs 
due to the united bankruptcy  the effect of the war with iraq  and the state of the financing markets  the company entered into an agreement with bombardier during the second quarter of regarding financing assistance and aircraft delivery schedules 
under the revised agreement  the company took delivery of six crjs in may and two crjs in october the company also has future commitments for six crjs to be delivered in late and crjs to be delivered in these post commitments are subject to certain conditions which  unless waived by the company  would not be satisfied unless the company has an agreement with united to operate these aircraft in the united express program 
in the event these conditions are not met and not waived by the company by april  deposits and progress payments for any then undelivered aircraft would be first used to repay any outstanding debt on the two crjs delivered in october with any remaining balance converted into credit memoranda for the purchase of other aircraft  goods and services from bombardier 
currently  the company has million on deposit with bombardier for aircraft orders 
in november  the company signed memoranda of understanding mous for the lease of ten airbus a aircraft from two separate operating lessors and the purchase of a and or a aircraft directly from an affiliate of the manufacturer 
the company has finalized the lease agreements for four of the a aircraft and is currently negotiating the final lease and purchase agreements for the remaining aircraft 
the first a aircraft is scheduled to be delivered in september with three more to follow  one each succeeding month  for the remainder of sixteen are scheduled to be delivered in  and the five a aircraft are scheduled to be delivered in the company has the option to convert the a aircraft orders into orders for five a aircraft at the option of the company with certain notice required prior to delivery 
the ten leased aircraft will be delivered under operating leases with initial lease terms ranging from five to twelve years 
these operating leases will require the company to place security deposits with the lessors  of which the company has already placed million  and to make monthly rent and airframe and engine maintenance reserve payments to the lessors 
the aircraft being purchased directly from an affiliate the manufacturer will require progress payment deposits to be made to said affiliate prior to delivery that will peak at million  for which the company has arranged financing for million 
the company has made deposits totaling million to date 
the aircraft also have backstop financing being provided by the manufacturer if the company is unable to secure commercial financing or sale leaseback financing under certain conditions 
as part of the airbus order  the company is also committed to purchase three spare v a engines for the a from international aero engines beginning in capital equipment and debt service in  the company anticipates capital spending of approximately million consisting of approximately million for rotable spare parts and flight equipment  million for facilities  million for ground and maintenance equipment  million for computer equipment  and million for other capital assets  and expects to fund these capital expenditures out of working capital 
these amounts include the company s estimates of capital spending for independence air transition and start up costs and the initial build up of a spare parts inventory for the airbus aircraft 
the foregoing amount does not include additional debt that may be required for the financing of new as or additional spare parts and spare engines 
principal payments on long term debt for are estimated to be approximately million reflecting borrowings related to the purchase of five j s acquired in and  four crjs acquired in and  and six crjs acquired in other commitments the company s regional jet fleet is comprised of new aircraft with an average age of three years 
since maintenance expense on new aircraft is lower in the early years of operation due to manufacturers warranties and the generally lower failure rates of major components  the company s maintenance expense for regional jet aircraft will increase in future periods 
in  the company executed a seven year engine services agreement with ge engine services  inc ge covering the scheduled and unscheduled repair of aca s crj jet engines  operated on the crjs already delivered or on order at that time for the united express operation 
this agreement was amended in july to cover additional crj aircraft  bringing the total number of crj aircraft covered under the agreement to under the terms of the agreement  the company pays a set dollar amount per engine hour flown on a monthly basis to ge and ge assumes the responsibility to repair the engines when required at no additional expense to the company  subject to certain exclusions 
the company s future maintenance expense on crj engines covered under the agreement will escalate based on contractual rate increases  intended to match the timing of actual maintenance events that are due pursuant to the terms 
the company expenses aircraft maintenance based upon the amount paid to ge under the agreement  as engine hours are flown 
effective september  the company entered a maintenance agreement with air canada covering maintenance  repair and overhaul services for airframe components on its crj aircraft 
under the terms of this agreement  the company pays a varying amount per flight hour each month  based on the age of the aircraft 
the company expenses the amount paid to air canada based on the rates stipulated in the agreement and the hours flown each month 
in february  the company entered into an agreement with air canada covering the scheduled airframe c check overhaul of its crj aircraft 
the company expenses this cost as the overhaul is completed 
effective january  the company entered into an agreement with bae systems holdings  inc covering repair and overhaul of airframe rotable parts on the company s j aircraft through the remaining service life of the j fleet 
under the terms of this agreement  the company pays a fixed amount per flight hour each month 
the company expenses the amount paid to bae systems holdings  inc based on the rates stipulated in the agreement and the hours flown each month 
the company has entered into agreements with pan am international flight academy paifa  which allow the company to train crj  j and jet pilots at paifa s facility near washington dulles 
this facility currently houses three crj simulators  a jet simulator  and a j simulator 
the company has agreements to purchase an annual minimum number of crj simulator training hours at agreed rates through the company s payment obligations for crj simulator usage over the remaining years of the agreements total approximately million 
in  paifa  cae schreiner and the company executed a simulator provision and service agreement providing for jet training at the paifa facility 
under this agreement  the company has committed to purchase all of its jet simulator time from paifa at agreed upon rates  with no minimum number of simulator hours guaranteed 
the company has committed to provide its senior executive officers a deferred compensation plan which utilizes split dollar life insurance policies  and for a certain officer  a make whole provision for taxes  post retirement salary based on ending salary  and post retirement benefits based on benefits similar to those currently provided to the executive while actively employed 
the company has estimated the cost of the deferred compensation and tax gross up feature  future salary and future benefits and is accruing this cost over the remaining required service time of the executive officers 
the company expensed million and million for these benefits for the year ending december  and  respectively 
the company expects to recognize similar costs annually over the remaining service life of the senior executives 
the company s board of directors has approved the repurchase of up to million of the company s outstanding common stock in open market or private transactions 
during the company purchased  shares from employees to satisfy income taxes due resulting from the vesting of restricted shares 
the company has no plans to repurchase stock in the company s industry environment is highly uncertain and volatile at this time 
future events could affect the industry or the company in ways that are not presently anticipated that could adversely affect the company s liquidity 
the company believes that its cash balances and cash flow from operations together with operating lease financing and other available equipment financing will be sufficient to enable the company to meet its working capital needs  expected operating lease financing commitments  other capital expenditures  and debt service requirements as they come due for the remainder of and into when the prepaid aircraft deposits required for the airbus order peak 
nevertheless  we continually evaluate opportunities to finance the acquisition of aircraft  engage in other financing transactions  sell additional equity or debt securities  enter into credit facilities with lenders  or sell underutilized assets  all for either strategic reasons or to further strengthen our financial position 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities would likely be dilutive to our stockholders 
inflation inflation has not had a material effect on the company s operations because the company s agreements with united and delta provide for its fee for service rates to be adjusted annually and for it to be reimbursed for the cost of fuel 
inflation  and in particular changes in the costs of fuel  could affect the company s independence air operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of the company s financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the company s management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
the us securities and exchange commission has defined a company s most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results  and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
based on this definition  the company has identified its critical accounting policies as including those addressed below 
the company also has other key accounting policies  which involve the use of estimates  judgments and assumptions 
see note summary of accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of these items 
management believes that its estimates and assumptions are reasonable  based upon information presently available  however  actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition under the proration of fare arrangement in effect with united until november of  the company recognized passenger revenue when a flight was completed 
this required various estimates about passenger fares and other factors that were subject to subsequent adjustment and settlement with united and other carriers 
following certain changes in estimates  which resulted in adjustments in as described in results of operations  the company does not expect any further adjustments attributable to the former proration of fare arrangement 
under the fee per departure and fee per block hour contracts currently in place with united and delta  respectively  revenue is the product of the agreed upon rate and the number of departures or the number of block hours flown 
rates are generally agreed to on an annual basis and are subject to adjustments upon certain specified events  such as changes in cities served or in aircraft utilization levels 
until rates are agreed to each year with united and delta or are adjusted in response to specified events  the company may be required to estimate these rates and record revenue based upon such estimates until final rates are agreed to by either united or delta 
in addition  certain incentive payments are recorded based upon the company s assessment of its satisfaction of operational performance criteria and are subject to review by united or delta 
major maintenance costs the company has executed long term agreements with the engine manufacturers and other service providers covering the repair and overhaul of its engines  airframe and avionics components  and landing gear 
these agreements generally include escalating rates per flight hour over the term of the agreement 
the escalating rates are intended to reflect the approximate actual maintenance cost increases as the aircraft age 
the company expenses costs based upon the current rate per hour and the number of aircraft and engines hours for the period 
as a result  maintenance costs for the company s existing aircraft fleet are expected to increase in future years 
the engines delivered with the last crj aircraft are not currently covered by a maintenance agreement due to the disagreement with ge engine services on the existing maintenance agreement covering the first crj aircraft 
for the uncovered aircraft  the company is expensing actual costs incurred for maintenance which is not representative of future costs as these aircraft are still under the manufacturer s warranty 
aircraft leases the majority of the company s aircraft are leased from third parties 
in order to determine the proper classification of a lease as either an operating lease or a capital lease  the company must make certain estimates at the inception of the lease relating to the economic useful life and the fair value of an asset as well as select an appropriate discount rate to be used in discounting future lease payments 
these estimates are utilized by management in making computations as required by existing accounting standards that determine whether the lease is classified as an operating lease or a capital lease 
substantially all of the company s aircraft leases have been classified as operating leases  which results in rental payments being charged to expense over the terms of the related leases 
additionally  operating leases are not reflected in the balance sheet and accordingly  neither a lease asset nor an obligation for future lease payments are reflected in the company s consolidated balance sheet 
aircraft early retirement costs in determining the cost of the early retirement of leased aircraft and thus in determining the amount of the aircraft early retirement charge  the company must estimate  among other things  market lease rates  future sub lease income  the cost of maintenance return provisions  future interest and inflation rates  and the duration and cost of aircraft storage 
as the associated leases may extend over several years  these costs estimates are subject to change 
prior to the company s adoption of fasb statement  the company recorded estimated early retirement charges for aircraft expected to be retired in the coming twelve months under an approved retirement plan 
with the adoption of fasb  effective january   the company now records early retirement costs at the present value of costs and future sub lease income noted above for its j aircraft as they are removed from service 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s principal market risk results from changes in interest rates 
the company s exposure to market risk associated with changes in interest rates relates to the company s commitment to acquire regional jets 
the company has periodically entered into a series of put and call contracts as an interest rate hedge designed to limit its exposure to interest rate changes on the anticipated issuance of permanent financing relating to the delivery of the crj aircraft 
during  the company settled one hedge transaction  paying the counterparty  the company had no interest rate hedge transactions in or the company is in the process of finalizing commitments to acquire airbus aircraft under operating leases and by acquisition from an affiliate of the manufacturer 
the aircraft to be acquired by operating leases will not require further financing 
financing arrangements will need to be arranged for the aircraft to be acquired from an affiliate of the manufacturer 
the company anticipates that if necessary it will be able to finance these aircraft through debt financing with approximately a downpayment requirement  and that it will continue to explore alternative sources of financing prior to delivery 
as of february   the company had firm commitments to purchase additional crj aircraft
