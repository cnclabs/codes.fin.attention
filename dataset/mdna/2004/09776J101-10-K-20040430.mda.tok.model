item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
results of operations the company is a traditional department store retailer with a year history of providing high quality merchandise to its customers in secondary markets 
on october   the company acquired the elder beerman stores corp  nearly doubling its number of stores and adding million square feet of retail space 
as a result of the acquisition  the company operates department stores and two furniture stores in sixteen states  from the northeast to the midwest  under the bon ton and elder beerman names 
the stores carry a broad assortment of quality  brand name and private label fashion apparel and accessories for women  men and children  as well as distinctive cosmetics and home furnishings 
the company s strategy is to profitably sell merchandise by providing its customers with differentiated fashion merchandise at compelling value in the secondary markets the company serves 
the company s revenues are generated through sales in existing stores and through sales from new stores opened through expansion and acquisition 
during fiscal  the company s total sales increased to million  including million from the acquired elder beerman stores 
comparable store sales  which do not include elder beerman stores  decreased in fiscal as compared to fiscal the retail industry is highly competitive and was no exception as evidenced by comparable store sales decreases throughout the industry and  in particular  among the company s department store peer group 
like the company  numerous department store retailers experienced comparable store sales decreases over the past three years as economic downturn and declining consumer confidence have unfavorably impacted retail businesses 
the entrance of new competitors in its markets further challenged the company 
the company anticipates these competitive pressures and challenges will continue in the future 
as a result  the company will continue its highly promotional posture and emphasis on offering a wider range of value merchandise 
additionally  expansion of the company s private labels and growth of exclusive brands support its strategy of product differentiation and provide opportunity for higher gross margin 
in light of continued economic uncertainty  the company is focusing its efforts on asset and overhead cost management to improve its financial position 
the company is focused on improving its return on inventory investment 
the company has been able to achieve reductions in inventory levels that have resulted in a steadily improving turnover 
lower inventory levels enhance the company s ability to react to fashion trends and replenishment needs on a timely basis 
additionally  through the continuing comprehensive review of store and corporate operating expenses  the company looks for meaningful ways to improve its ratio of expenses to sales 
execution of these initiatives is necessary to achieve earnings growth in light of the company s comparable store sales decreases 
in october  the company added sixty seven department stores and two furniture stores as a result of its acquisition of elder beerman 
the company s consolidated balance sheet and consolidated statements of operations for fiscal include elder beerman operations for the period from october  through january  the company believes that its fiscal results are not indicative of expected operating results for due to the timing of the elder beerman acquisition  the company included elder beerman s most profitable quarter in the company s consolidated results without having to recognize the first three quarters of the year  which traditionally reflect a net loss 
elder beerman operations reflect preliminary purchase accounting  which is subject to future refinement based upon updated valuations of certain assets acquired 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements for disclosure of pro forma results of operations 
the company s challenge in is the successful integration of the two companies into one business unit and ensuring that the new company remains a stable financial performer 
the company is implementing initiatives to capitalize on the inherent economies of scale in merchandising and operations that accompany a merger of this relative magnitude 
achieving these synergies will be critical to the company s ongoing success 
of equal importance is expediting the company s systems integration efforts  the majority of the company s capital expenditures in will be directed towards strategic systems improvements 
the company incurred a charge of million in fiscal for the write off of duplicate information systems software  as a decision was made to install the elder beerman point of sale system in bon ton stores in in the course of its integration efforts  another challenge facing the company will be maintaining its sales base and ensuring customer satisfaction 
as a result of the acquisition  the company has increased its debt levels and  accordingly  its exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
the company opened one new store in the fourth quarter of in  the company s capital projects will focus on information systems and its existing store base 
although the company does not anticipate opening any new stores in  it will continue to explore opportunities for new stores in and beyond  with the goal of capitalizing on its increased geographic presence

merchandise departments recording comparable store sales increases were shoes  intimate apparel and accessories 
the favorable results in these departments were driven by fresh inventories  intensification of key vendors and compelling values 
additionally  the customer responded favorably to open selling in the company s shoe departments 
based on the success of this initiative  the company will continue to roll out open selling in its shoe departments to additional stores in merchandise departments reflecting the sharpest comparable store sales declines were women s clothing particularly dresses and special sizes  men s clothing sportswear  and children s 
these merchandise departments have experienced overall sales declines in each of the last three years 
the company is addressing this trend by focusing on increased product differentiation and improved merchandise assortments in these areas

interest expense in fiscal and included a reduction of interest expense of million and an increase in interest expense of million  respectively  related to fair market value adjustments on interest rate swaps 
this decrease in interest expense was largely offset by increased interest expense and financing fees expense on borrowings incurred to finance the elder beerman acquisition

fiscal corporate expense decreased million versus fiscal driving an overall selling  general and administrative expense rate decrease of percentage point 
the decrease in corporate expense principally reflects an increase in securitization income of million from the company s proprietary credit card program and reduced equipment rental costs

income taxes the effective tax rate decreased percentage point to in fiscal from in fiscal net income net income in fiscal was million  or of net sales  compared to million  or of net sales  in fiscal as discussed above  the increased gross profit rate  decreased selling  general and administrative expenses and decreased interest expense more than offset the impact of decreased sales thus driving the million net income increase over fiscal liquidity and capital resources the following table summarizes material measures of the company s liquidity and capital resources january  february  february  dollars in millions working capital current ratio debt to total capitalization debt plus equity unused availability under lines of credit the company s primary sources of working capital are cash flows from operations  borrowings under its revolving credit facility and proceeds from its accounts receivable facility 
the company had working capital of million  million and million at the end of fiscal  and  respectively 
the company s business follows a seasonal pattern and working capital fluctuates with seasonal variations  reaching its highest level in october or november 
the increase in working capital at the end of fiscal as compared to the end of fiscal was principally due to the acquisition of elder beerman working capital  which was funded with long term debt 
debt to total capitalization ratio increased in fiscal over fiscal due to the additional long term debt assumed to fund the elder beerman acquisition in october net cash provided by operating activities amounted to million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal the million increase in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal relative to fiscal was primarily due to sales of the acquired elder beerman inventory  increased net income and the sale of million of elder beerman accounts receivable in january  partially offset by a reduction of million in bon ton accounts receivable sold during fiscal net cash used in investing activities amounted to million  million  and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the net cash outflow in fiscal increased from fiscal in the amount of million  primarily related to the elder beerman acquisition and the opening of a new store in latham  new york 
capital expenditures amounted to million in fiscal net cash used in financing activities was million  million  and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the net cash outflow in fiscal was principally attributable to the conversion of million of elder beerman s previously existing on balance sheet accounts receivable facility to the company s new off balance sheet accounts receivable facility and increased payments on the revolving credit facility due to incremental fourth quarter sales related to acquired elder beerman inventory  partially offset by additional funds provided by the issuance of common stock and borrowings required to finance the acquisition of elder beerman 
in october  the company amended and restated its revolving credit facility agreement 
the amendment increased the line from million to million and added a term loan in the amount of million 
the amendment modified the formula for determining borrowing availability based on inventory  fixed assets and real estate 
the interest rate  based on libor or an index rate plus an applicable margin  and fee charges are determined by a formula based upon the company s borrowing availability 
the agreement contains restrictions against the incurrence of additional indebtedness  pledging or sale of assets  payment of dividends and other similar restrictions 
financial covenants contained in the amended agreement include a limitation on capital expenditures  minimum borrowing availability and fixed charge coverage ratio 
borrowings at january  were million  inclusive of the million term loan 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for interest rates  terms and principal balances outstanding 
to consummate the acquisition of elder beerman in october  the company amended and restated its million off balance sheet accounts receivable facility 
the amendment modified certain terms  interest and fee calculation elements and extended the agreement expiration date from january to october simultaneously  the company amended elder beerman s accounts receivable facility  decreasing the line of credit from million to million  modifying certain terms and altering the expiration date from july to july in january  the company entered into a new off balance sheet accounts receivable facility which replaced the two existing agreements referred to in the preceding paragraph 
the new agreement is with the same financial institutions  has a funding limit of million and expires october the agreement has substantially the same terms for interest and fee calculations as the previous bon ton accounts receivable facility 
availability under the off balance sheet accounts receivable facility is calculated based on the amount and performance of the company s proprietary credit card portfolio 
at january   accounts receivable in the amount of million were sold under the accounts receivable facility 
the company is exposed to market risk associated with changes in interest rates 
to provide some protection against potential rate increases associated with its variable rate facilities  the company has entered into a derivative financial transaction in the form of an interest rate swap 
the interest rate swap is used to hedge the underlying variable rate facilities 
on february   the company announced a stock repurchase program authorizing the purchase of up to million of the company s common stock from time to time 
during fiscal  the company purchased  common stock shares at a cost of million 
during fiscal  the company purchased  common stock shares at a cost of million 
treasury stock is accounted for by the cost method 
the company declared quarterly cash dividends  each at per share on class a common stock and common stock  payable july   october  and january  cash dividends paid in fiscal totaled million 
the company declared a quarterly cash dividend of per share  payable april  to shareholders of record as of april  the company s board of directors will consider dividends in subsequent periods as it deems appropriate 
the company currently anticipates its capital expenditures for fiscal will be approximately million 
of this amount  approximately million is budgeted for the integration of the point of sale system in bon ton stores and information system enhancements 
the remainder will be directed to remodeling some of the company s existing stores and general operations 
no new stores are currently planned for fiscal aside from planned capital expenditures  the company s primary cash requirements will be to service debt and finance working capital increases during peak selling seasons 
the company anticipates that its cash balances and cash flows from operations  supplemented by borrowings under the revolving credit facility and proceeds from the accounts receivable facility  will be sufficient to satisfy its operating cash requirements for at least the next twelve months 
the accounts receivable facility and revolving credit facility agreements expire in october and october  respectively 
the company anticipates that it will be able to renew or replace these agreements with agreements of substantially comparable terms 
failure to renew or replace these agreements on substantially comparable terms would have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition 
cash flows from operations are impacted by consumer confidence  weather conditions in the geographic markets served by the company  the economic climate and competitive conditions existing in the retail industry 
a downturn in any single factor or a combination of factors could have a material adverse impact upon the company s ability to generate sufficient cash flows to operate its business 
the company has not identified any probable circumstances that would likely impair its ability to meet its cash requirements or trigger a default or acceleration of payment of the company s debt 
contractual obligations and commitments the following tables reflect the company s contractual obligations and commitments contractual obligations payment due by period dollars in thousands total within year years years after years debt      capital leases    operating leases      totals      debt within the years category includes million of amounts currently outstanding under the revolving credit agreement  which expires in commitments amount of expiration per period dollars in thousands total within year years years after years import merchandise letters of credit   standby letters of credit   surety bonds   totals   standby letters of credit are primarily issued as collateral for obligations related to general liability and workers compensation insurance and private brand merchandise purchase agreements 
surety bonds are primarily for previously incurred and expensed obligations related to workers compensation 
in the ordinary course of business  the company enters into arrangements with vendors to purchase merchandise up to twelve months in advance of expected delivery 
these purchase orders do not contain any significant termination payments or other penalties if cancelled 
off balance sheet arrangements the company engages in securitization activities involving the company s proprietary credit card portfolio as a source of funding 
off balance sheet proprietary credit card securitizations provide a significant portion of the company s funding and are one of its primary sources of liquidity 
at january   off balance sheet securitized receivables represented of the company s funding 
gains and losses from securitizations are recognized in the consolidated statements of income when the company relinquishes control of the transferred financial assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities a replacement of fasb statement no 
sfas no 
 and other related pronouncements 
the gain or loss on the sale of financial assets depends in part on the previous carrying amount of the assets involved in the transfer  allocated between the assets sold and the retained interests based upon their respective fair values at the date of sale 
based on the term of the securitization agreement less than one year and the fact that the credit card receivables that comprise the retained interests are short term in nature  the company has classified its retained interests as a current asset 
the company sells undivided percentage ownership interests in certain of its credit card accounts receivable to unrelated third parties under a million accounts receivable securitization facility  which is described in further detail below and in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the unrelated third parties  referred to as the conduit  have purchased a million interest in the accounts receivable under this facility at january  the company is responsible for servicing these accounts  retains a servicing fee and bears the risk of non collection limited to its retained interests in the accounts receivable 
associated off balance sheet assets and related debt were million at january  and million at february  this increase is due to the acquisition and subsequent sale of elder beerman s accounts receivable 
upon the facility s termination  the conduit would be entitled to all cash collections on the accounts receivable until its investment million at january  and accrued discounts are repaid 
accordingly  upon termination of the facility  the assets of the facility would not be available to the company until all amounts due to the conduit have been paid in full 
based upon the terms of the accounts receivable facility  the accounts receivable transactions qualify for sale treatment under generally accepted accounting principles 
this treatment requires the company to account for transactions with the conduit as a sale of accounts receivable instead of reflecting the conduit s net investment as debt with a pledge of accounts receivable as collateral 
absent this sale treatment  the company s balance sheet would reflect additional accounts receivable and debt  which could be a factor in the company s ability to raise capital  however  results of operations would not be significantly impacted 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of its financial statements 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to merchandise returns  bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  income taxes  financings  and contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and could potentially lead to materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
the company believes its critical accounting policies are described below 
for a discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies  see notes to consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and adjusts credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness 
the company continually monitors collections and payments from customers and maintains an allowance for estimated credit losses based upon its historical experience  how delinquent accounts ultimately charge off  aging of accounts and any specific customer collection issues identified eg  bankruptcy 
while such credit losses have historically been within expectations and provisions established  the company cannot guarantee that it will continue to experience the same credit loss rates as in the past 
if circumstances change eg  higher than expected defaults or bankruptcies  the company s estimates of the recoverability of amounts due the company could be materially reduced 
the allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns was million and million as of january  and february   respectively 
inventory valuation as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined using the retail last in  first out lifo method 
under the retail inventory method  the valuation of inventories at cost and resulting gross margin is derived by applying a calculated cost to retail ratio to the retail value of inventories 
the retail inventory method is an averaging method that has been widely used in the retail industry 
use of the retail inventory method will result in valuing inventories at the lower of cost or market if markdowns are taken timely as a reduction of the retail value of inventories 
inherent in the retail inventory method calculation are certain significant management judgments and estimates including  among others  merchandise markups  markdowns and shrinkage  which significantly impact both the ending inventory valuation at cost and resulting gross margin 
these significant estimates  coupled with the fact that the retail inventory method is an averaging process  can  under certain circumstances  result in individual inventory components with cost above related net realizable value 
factors that can lead to this result include applying the retail inventory method to a group of products that is not fairly uniform in terms of its cost  selling price relationship and turnover  or applying the retail inventory method to transactions over a period of time that includes different rates of gross profit  such as those relating to seasonal merchandise 
in addition  failure to take timely markdowns can result in an overstatement of cost under the lower of cost or market principle 
management believes that the company s retail inventory method provides an inventory valuation that approximates cost and results in carrying inventory in the aggregate at the lower of cost or market 
the company regularly reviews inventory quantities on hand and records an adjustment for excess or old inventory based primarily on an estimated forecast of merchandise demand for the selling season 
demand for merchandise can fluctuate greatly 
a significant increase in the demand for merchandise could result in a short term increase in the cost of inventory purchases while a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand 
additionally  estimates of future merchandise demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case the company may have understated or overstated the adjustment required for excess or old inventory 
if the company s inventory is determined to be overvalued in the future  the company would be required to recognize such costs in the costs of goods sold and reduce operating income at the time of such determination 
likewise  if inventory is later determined to be undervalued  the company may have overstated the costs of goods sold in previous periods and would be required to recognize additional operating income when such inventory is sold 
therefore  although every effort is made to ensure the accuracy of forecasts of future merchandise demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or the economy in the company s markets could have a significant impact on the value of the company s inventory and reported operating results 
as is currently the case with many companies in the retail industry  the company s lifo calculations have yielded inventory increases in recent years due to deflation reflected in price indices used 
this is the result of the lifo method whereby merchandise sold is valued at the cost of more recent inventory purchases which the deflationary indices indicate to be lower  resulting in the general inventory on hand being carried at the older  higher costs 
given these higher values and the promotional retail environment  the company reduced the carrying value of its lifo inventories to a net realizable value nrv 
these reductions totaled million at january  inherent in these nrv assessments are significant management judgments and estimates regarding future merchandise selling costs and pricing 
should these estimates prove to be inaccurate  the company may have overstated or understated its inventory carrying value 
in such cases  operating income would ultimately be impacted 
vendor allowances as is standard industry practice  the company receives allowances from merchandise vendors as reimbursement for charges incurred on marked down merchandise 
vendor allowances are generally credited to costs of goods sold  provided the allowance is collectable  for merchandise either permanently marked down or sold  not predicated on a future purchase  not predicated on a future increase in the purchase price from the vendor  and authorized by internal management 
if the aforementioned criteria are not met  the company reflects the allowances as an adjustment to the cost of merchandise capitalized in inventory 
additionally  the company receives allowances from vendors in connection with cooperative advertising programs 
the company reviews advertising allowances received from each vendor to ensure reimbursements are for specific  incremental and identifiable advertising costs incurred by the company to sell the vendor s products 
if a vendor reimbursement exceeds the costs incurred by the company  the excess reimbursement is recorded as a reduction of cost purchases from the vendor and reflected as a reduction of costs of merchandise sold when the related merchandise is sold 
all other amounts are recognized by the company as a reduction of the related advertising costs that have been incurred and reflected in selling  general and administrative expenses 
income taxes significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities  and the valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
the process involves the company summarizing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items eg  allowance for doubtful accounts for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within the consolidated balance sheet 
the company must then assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income or tax carry back availability and  to the extent the company believes recovery is not likely  a valuation allowance must be established 
to the extent the company establishes a valuation allowance in a period  an expense must be recorded within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
pursuant to the acquisition of elder beerman  the company acquired federal and state net operating loss carry forwards of approximately million and million  respectively  which are available to offset future federal and state taxable income subject to certain limitations imposed by section of the internal revenue code section 
these net operating losses will expire at various dates beginning in fiscal through fiscal in addition  pursuant to the acquisition of elder beerman  the company acquired alternative minimum tax credits and general business credits in the amount of million and million  respectively 
both credits are also subject to the limitations imposed by section the alternative minimum tax credits are available indefinitely  and the general business credits expire beginning in fiscal through fiscal net deferred tax assets were million and million as of january  and february   respectively 
pursuant to the acquisition of elder beerman  the company recorded million of net deferred tax assets 
the company s ability to utilize these assets will be limited by section as part of preliminary purchase accounting  a valuation allowance of million was established against these deferred tax assets 
as of january   million and million of this valuation allowance has been classified as current and long term  respectively  pursuant to requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
no valuation allowance was established at february  in assessing the realizability of the deferred tax assets  the company considered whether it is more likely than not that the deferred taxes assets  or a portion thereof  will not be realized 
the company considered the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies  and the limitations of section in making this assessment 
as a result  the company concluded during fiscal that a valuation allowance against a portion of the net deferred tax assets was appropriate 
if actual results differ from these estimates or these estimates are adjusted in future periods  the company may need to adjust its valuation allowance  which could materially impact its financial position and results of operations 
legislative changes currently proposed by certain states in which the company operates could have a materially adverse impact on future operating results of the company 
these legislative changes principally involve state income tax laws 
long lived assets property  fixtures and equipment are recorded at cost and are depreciated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of such assets 
changes in the company s business model or capital strategy can result in the actual useful lives differing from the company s estimates 
in cases where the company determines that the useful life of property  fixtures and equipment should be shortened  the company depreciates the net book value in excess of the salvage value over its revised remaining useful life  thereby increasing depreciation expense 
factors such as changes in the planned use of fixtures or leasehold improvements could also result in shortened useful lives 
net property  fixtures and equipment amounted to million and million as of january  and february   respectively 
the company assesses  on a store by store basis  the impairment of identifiable long lived assets primarily property  fixtures and equipment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors that could trigger an impairment review include the following significant under performance of stores relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of the company s use of assets or overall business strategy  and significant negative industry or economic trends for a sustained period 
the company records impairment losses on long lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount of those items 
cash flow estimates are based on historical results adjusted to reflect the company s best estimate of future market and operating conditions 
the net carrying value of assets not recoverable is reduced to fair value 
estimates of fair value represent the company s best estimate based on industry trends and reference to market rates and transactions 
should cash flow estimates differ significantly from actual results  an impairment could arise and materially impact the company s financial position and results of operations 
given the seasonality of operations  impairment is not conclusive  in many cases  until after the holiday period in the fourth quarter is concluded 
newly opened stores may take time to generate positive operating and cash flow results 
factors such as store type  store location  current marketplace awareness of the company s private label brands  local customer demographic data and current fashion trends are all considered in determining the time frame required for a store to achieve positive financial results 
if economic conditions prove to be substantially different from the company s expectations  the carrying value of new stores may ultimately become impaired 
in fiscal and  the company evaluated the recoverability of its long lived assets 
as a result  impairment losses of million and million were recorded in depreciation and amortization expense in fiscal and  respectively 
additionally  the company has identified assets in various markets that have under performed relative to the company average 
the company has taken steps to address these issues and currently forecasts no impairment charge 
should the company s improvement efforts prove unsuccessful or economic conditions change  the carrying value of these assets may ultimately become impaired 
the company is in the process of refining its preliminary purchase accounting for long lived assets acquired in the acquisition of elder beerman 
the company is in the process of obtaining updated fair valuations for certain assets acquired 
in fiscal  a charge of million was recorded in depreciation and amortization expense for the write off of duplicate information systems software due to the acquisition of elder beerman 
this charge arose due to a decision to use elder beerman s point of sale system in all of the company s stores 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill was million as of january  and february  intangible assets are comprised of lease interests that relate to below market rate leases purchased in store acquisitions completed in fiscal years through  which were adjusted to reflect fair market value 
these leases had average lives of twenty five years 
net intangible assets amounted to million and million as of january  and february   respectively 
as a result of the company s adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
 the company now reviews goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite lives for impairment at least annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values 
the company determines fair value using discounted cash flow analysis  which requires certain assumptions and estimates regarding industry economic factors and future profitability of acquired businesses 
it is the company s policy to conduct impairment testing based on its most current business plans  which reflect anticipated changes in the economy and the industry 
if actual results prove inconsistent with company assumptions and judgments  the company could be exposed to a material impairment charge 
securitizations a significant portion of the company s funding is through off balance sheet credit card securitizations via sales of certain accounts receivable through an accounts receivable facility the facility 
the sale of receivables is to the bon ton receivables partnership  lp btrlp  a special purpose entity as defined by sfas no 
btrlp is a wholly owned subsidiary of the company 
btrlp may sell accounts receivable with a purchase price up to million through the facility to a conduit on a revolving basis 
the company sells accounts receivable through securitizations with servicing retained 
when the company securitizes  it surrenders control over the transferred assets and accounts for the transaction as a sale to the extent that consideration other than beneficial interests in the transferred assets is received in exchange 
the company allocates the previous carrying amount of the securitized receivables between the assets sold and retained interests  based on their relative estimated fair values at the date of sale 
securitization income is recognized at the time of the sale  and is equal to the excess of the fair value of the assets obtained principally cash over the allocated cost of the assets sold and transaction costs 
during the revolving period of each accounts receivable securitization  securitization income is recorded representing estimated gains on the sale of new receivables to the conduit on a continuous basis to replenish the investors interest in securitized receivables that have been repaid by the credit card account holders 
fair value estimates used in the recognition of securitization income require certain assumptions of payment  default  servicing costs direct and indirect and interest rates 
to the extent actual results differ from those estimates  the impact is recognized as a component of securitization income 
the company estimates the fair value of retained interests in securitizations based on a discounted cash flow analysis 
the cash flows of the retained interest only strip are estimated as the excess of the weighted average finance charge yield on each pool of receivables sold over the sum of the interest rate paid to the note holder  the servicing fee and an estimate of future credit losses over the life of the receivables 
cash flows are discounted from the date the cash is expected to become available to the company 
these cash flows are projected over the life of the receivables using payment  default  and interest rate assumptions that the company believes would be used by market participants for similar financial instruments subject to prepayment  credit and interest rate risk 
the cash flows are discounted using an interest rate that the company believes a purchaser unrelated to the seller of the financial instrument would demand 
as all estimates used are influenced by factors outside the company s control  there is uncertainty inherent in these estimates  making it reasonably possible that they could change in the near term 
any adverse change in the company s assumptions could materially impact securitization income 
the company recognized securitization income of million  million and million for fiscal year   and  respectively 
the decrease in income in fiscal relative to fiscal was principally due to decreased sales of accounts receivable through the facility  resulting in a million reduction of finance charge income  partially offset by a million reduction in interest costs 
the increased securitization income in fiscal relative to fiscal was principally a reflection of increased sales of accounts receivable  resulting in a million increase in finance charge income  and a million reduction in interests costs 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk and financial instruments the company is exposed to market risk associated with changes in interest rates 
based on the variable rate facilities outstanding at january   a basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate million charge to interest expense 
to provide some protection against potential rate increases associated with its variable rate facilities  the company entered into a derivative financial transaction in the form of an interest rate swap 
the interest rate swap is used to hedge the underlying variable rate facilities 
the swap is a qualifying hedge and the interest rate differential is reflected as an adjustment to interest expense over the life of the swap 
the company currently holds a variable to fixed rate swap with a notional amount of million with one financial institution 
the notional amount does not represent amounts exchanged by the parties  but it is used as the basis to calculate amounts due and to be received under the rate swap 
during fiscal and  the company did not enter into or hold derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
the following table provides information about the company s derivative financial instruments and other financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  including debt obligations and interest rate swaps 
for debt obligations  the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates as of january  for interest rate swaps  the table presents notional amounts and weighted average pay and receive interest rates by expected maturity date 
for additional discussion of the company s interest rate swaps  see note to the consolidated financial statements

see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for the company s quarterly results for fiscal and due to the fixed nature of certain costs  selling  general and administrative expenses are typically higher as a percentage of net sales during the first half of each fiscal year 
because of the seasonality of the company s business  results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year 
in addition  quarterly operating results are impacted by the timing and amount of revenues and costs associated with the opening of new stores and the closing and remodeling of existing stores 
the company does not believe inflation had a material effect on operating results during the past three years 
however  there can be no assurance that the company s business will not be affected by inflationary adjustments in the future
