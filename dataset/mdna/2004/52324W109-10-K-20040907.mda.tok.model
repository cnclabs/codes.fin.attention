item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the other financial information and consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this form k and the documents incorporated by reference herein 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements as a result of a variety of factors  including those discussed in risk factors and elsewhere in this form k and the documents incorporated by reference herein 
we utilize fiscal years that end on the saturday nearest to june for clarity of presentation  we have described all fiscal years as if they end on june overview we develop  manufacture  sell and license oscilloscopes and related test and measurement equipment 
our oscilloscopes are tools used by designers and engineers to measure and analyze complex electronic signals in the development of high performance systems  to validate electronic designs and to improve time to market 
we currently offer four families of oscilloscopes which address different solutions to the markets we serve wavemaster  our highest performance product family  wavepro  which is targeted at the mid to high performance sector  waverunner  designed for the mid performance sector  and wavesurfer  designed for the lower end of the performance sector of the market 
we were founded in to develop  manufacture and sell high performance signal analysis tools to scientists engaged in high energy physics research and  in  we introduced our first oscilloscope using our core competency of designing signal acquisition and digitizing technology 
we generate revenue in a single segment within the test and measurement market  primarily from the sale of our oscilloscopes  probes  accessories  and applications solutions  and to a lesser extent  our extended warranty contracts and repairs and calibrations we perform on our instruments after the expiration of their warranties 
revenue is recognized when products are shipped or services are rendered to customers net of allowances for anticipated returns 
we defer revenue on shipments of our new wavesurfer family of oscilloscopes until sold by the distributor to their customers sell through method 
we sell our products into a broad range of end markets  including computer and semiconductor  data storage devices  automotive and industrial  and military and aerospace markets 
we believe designers in all of these markets are developing products which rely on increasingly complex electronic signals to provide the features and performance their customers require 
our customers include leading original equipment manufacturers  or oems  such as bae systems  ibm  maxtor  raytheon  robert bosch  seagate  samsung and siemens vdo 
we deploy a direct sales model and employ a highly skilled global sales force where it makes economic sense to do so 
we supplement our direct sales force with a combination of manufacturers representatives and distributors in areas where demand levels do not justify direct distribution by us 
we segment the world into four areas north america  europe middle east  japan and asia pacific 
in north america we sell our products direct in the united states 
in europe  we sell our products direct in switzerland  germany  italy  france  the united kingdom and sweden 
we sell our products direct in japan and in asia pacific 
we sell our products direct in south korea  singapore and in five regions in china 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we began shipping our new wavesurfer family of lower bandwidth oscilloscopes 
one component of our strategy for selling this new family of oscilloscopes is the use of a complementary network of distributors 
generally  we transact revenues and pay our operating expenses in the local currencies of the countries in which we have a direct distribution presence or other operations  with limited exceptions  most notably in china where our sales and operating expenses are denominated in us dollars 
in europe middle east  we transact business in euros  swiss francs  british pounds  swedish krona and us dollars 
in japan  we transact business in japanese yen 
in asia pacific  we transact business in korean won  hong kong dollars  singapore dollars and us dollars 
for a discussion of our foreign currency exchange rate exposure  see item a of this part ii entitled quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk of this form k 
we have historically experienced lower sales activity during our first fiscal quarter than in other fiscal quarters which  we believe  is due principally to the lower level of orders and general market activity during the summer months  particularly in europe 
cost of sales represents manufacturing costs  which primarily comprise materials  labor and factory overhead 
gross margins represent revenues less cost of sales 
additional factors integral to gross margins earned are our products mix  as the average selling prices of our products range from  to  and the effect of foreign currencies  as approximately two thirds of our revenues are derived overseas  much of which are denominated in local currencies while manufacturing costs are us dollar denominated 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist of salaries and related overhead costs for sales  marketing and administrative  personnel  legal  accounting and other professional services 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related overhead costs associated with employees engaged in research  design and development activities  as well as the cost of masks  wafers and other materials and related test services and equipment used in the development process 
restructuring and asset impairment in response to the economic downturn in and  we took steps to change our manufacturing strategy  discontinue older product lines and reduce our operating expenses in an effort to better position our business for the long term 
the resultant charges  net taken to accomplish these efforts  were year ended june  in thousands charges for impaired intangible assets  severance and related costs  cost of sales   charges for severance and related costs research and development charges for severance and related costs   plant closure lease termination costs unused restructuring reserve selling  general and administrative   totals   no similar charges were incurred in fiscal however  we credited million of unused fiscal restructuring reserves to selling  general and administrative expense 
in fiscal  faced with continued difficulties in the marketplace  we implemented a new management operating system designed to improve processes in sales  order management  customer relationship management and financial performance management 
in connection with the implementation of the new management operating system  we made significant business decisions which resulted in a restructuring charge of million 
included in this charge were the effects of closing down our beaverton  oregon facility and a worldwide workforce reduction of employees 
the annualized first year improvement to income from operations from reduced salary and related expenses was approximately million 
the annual savings achievable in rent expense due to the elimination of the oregon facility is approximately million 
as of june   we have paid million of the total million in severance and other related expenses and million of the total million in plant closing costs 
during fiscal and  million and million  respectively  of severance was paid 
cash payments for severance and other related expenses in fiscal  and will be million   and approximately  respectively 
severance and other related expenses will be substantially paid by the end of second quarter of fiscal according to the lease agreement on the oregon facility which continues through the third quarter of fiscal  we will pay  in fiscal and  in fiscal during fiscal  we recorded a million charge for the impairment of technology  manufacturing and distribution rights and a million charge for a related future royalty payment 
the impairment resulted from our strategic decision to exit certain older product lines and to make significant changes to our manufacturing strategy to improve further our operating efficiency 
we estimated the fair value of the impaired asset based on the present value of forecasted future cash inflows using a discount rate commensurate with our weighted average cost of capital 
in response to the continued weakness in the technology sector of the economy  in fiscal  we recorded a million charge for severance and other related expenses 
the annualized first year improvement to income from operations from reduced salary and related expenses was estimated to be approximately million on a pre tax basis  which was substantially achieved 
in connection with this restructuring  we reduced our workforce by employees 
included in these amounts are costs associated with the succession of our chief executive officer in the second quarter of fiscal of the million recorded  million represented a non cash expense for the amendment of employee stock options 
the remaining million was paid in cash in fiscal  and in the amounts of million  million and million  respectively 
we credited million of unused restructuring reserves to selling  general and administrative expense in the second quarter of fiscal these restructuring charges represent our best efforts to respond to the current demands in our industry 
however  these and future cost reductions  or other benefits expected from the restructuring  may be insufficient to align our operations with customer demand and the changes affecting our industry  or may be more costly or extensive than currently anticipated 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial position and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported revenues and expenses during the period 
the accounting policies that we believe are the most critical in understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following revenue recognition 
we enter into agreements to sell products  services  and other arrangements that include combinations of products and services 
revenue from product sales  net of allowances for anticipated returns  is recognized provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
delivery is considered to have occurred when title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer 
we defer revenue on shipments of our new wavesurfer family of oscilloscopes until sold by the distributor to their customers sell through method 
for sales that include customer specified acceptance criteria  revenue is recognized after the acceptance criteria have been met 
revenue from services is deferred and recognized over the contractual period or as services are rendered and accepted by the customer 
when arrangements include multiple elements  we use relative fair values to allocate revenue to the elements and recognize revenue when the criteria for revenue recognition have been met for each element 
the amount of revenue recognized is affected by our judgments as to whether an arrangement includes multiple elements and if so  whether objective and reliable evidence of fair value exists for those elements 
changes to the elements in an arrangement and the ability to establish objective and reliable evidence of fair value for those elements could affect the timing of the revenue recognition 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts relating to the portion of the accounts receivable which we estimate is non collectible 
we analyze historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer creditworthiness  current economic trends and changes in customer payment patterns when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
the allowance for doubtful accounts  which includes the allowance for anticipated returns  was approximately million at june  and changes in the overall economic environment or in the financial condition of our customers may require adjustments to the allowance for doubtful accounts which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
allowance for excess and obsolete inventory 
we assess the valuation of our inventory on a quarterly basis and provide an allowance for the value of estimated excess and obsolete inventory 
our marketing department plays a key role in our inventory review process by providing updated sales forecasts  managing product rollovers and working with our manufacturing department to maximize recovery of excess inventory 
based upon management s forecast  inventory items no longer expected to be used in the future are considered obsolete and the difference between an inventory s quantity and its forecasted usage are classified as excess 
the allowance for excess and obsolete inventory was million and million at june  and  respectively 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory allowances for excess or obsolete inventory may be required 
deferred tax assets 
we have recorded million of net deferred tax assets as of june  for the future tax benefits of certain expenses reported for financial statement purposes that have not yet been deducted on our tax returns 
significant components of our deferred tax assets are federal  state and foreign net operating loss and credit carryforwards  inventory reserves and other reserves 
the recognition of this deferred tax asset is based on the assessment that it is more likely than not that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income within statutory carryforward periods to realize the benefit of these tax deductions 
the factors that management considers in assessing the likelihood of realization include the forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets 
based on this information  we have recorded a valuation allowance of million as of june  to reserve for certain tax credits and foreign net operating loss carryforwards due to the uncertainty surrounding the utilization of these deferred tax assets 
adjustments to the valuation allowance may be made in the future if it is determined that the realizable amount of net operating losses and other deferred tax assets is greater or less than the amount recorded 
such adjustments may be material to our results of operations when made 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets 
we assess the recoverability of our long lived assets and intangible assets with finite lives including technology  manufacturing and distribution rights whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values may not be recoverable 
when such events or changes in circumstances occur  we assess the recoverability of long lived assets by determining whether the carrying values of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted expected future cash flows 
if the undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amounts  an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying amounts exceed the fair value 
factors which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance by us relative to historical or projected operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the assets or the strategy for the overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
we recognized an intangible asset impairment of million in fiscal we estimated the fair value of the impaired asset based on the present value of forecasted future cash inflows using a discount rate commensurate with our weighted average cost of capital 
the cost of technology  manufacturing and distribution rights acquired is amortized primarily on the basis of the higher of units shipped over the contract periods or on a straight line basis not to exceed three years 
management assesses the recoverability of these rights on the basis of actual and forecasted production units as well as the average selling price and standard costs of the related products after the amortization of the rights to determine profitability 
if required  an impairment charge is recorded as described above 
goodwill 
statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  requires goodwill to be tested for impairment annually under a two step approach  or more frequently  if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
impairment is assessed at the reporting unit level by applying a fair value based test 
a reporting unit is defined as the same as or one level below the operating segment level as described in sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
we have one reporting unit for the purposes of sfas no 
the first step is to identify if an impairment of goodwill has occurred by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill test is performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
in this second step  the implied fair value as defined in sfas no 
of the reporting unit s goodwill is compared with the carrying amount of the goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess  not to exceed the carrying amount of the goodwill 
we completed the annual impairment test required under sfas no 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal after completion of our annual financial operating plan and determined that there was no impairment to our recorded goodwill balance of million at june  we use a fair value based test using our market capitalization to estimate our fair value 
there were no impairment indicators during the fiscal year ended june  warranty 
provisions for estimated expenses related to product warranties are made at the time products are sold 
these estimates are derived from historical data of product reliability 
the expected failure is arrived at in terms of units  which are then converted into labor hours to which an average fully burdened cost per hour is applied to derive the amount of accrued warranty required 
on a quarterly basis  we study trends of warranty claims and take action to improve the quality of our products and minimize our warranty exposure 
the warranty reserve was million at june  and june  management believes that the warranty reserve is appropriate  however  actual claims incurred could differ from the original estimates  requiring adjustments to the reserve 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain operating data as a percentage of our total revenues for the fiscal years indicated year ended june  revenues oscilloscopes and related products service and other total revenues cost of sales gross margin operating expenses selling  general and administrative research and development total operating expenses operating income loss other expense income  net income loss from continuing operations before income taxes provision for benefit from income taxes income loss from continuing operations gain from discontinued operations  net of tax net income loss charges related to convertible preferred stock net income loss applicable to common stockholders 
comparison of fiscal years and total revenues were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  an increase of  or million 
revenues from oscilloscopes and related products increased  or million  in fiscal this increase in revenues was primarily due to a increase in total oscilloscope units shipped due to increased customer demand and to higher average selling prices  the combined effect of which contributed million to the increase  and a million increase in probes and accessories 
this increase in revenues was partially offset by a million decrease in sales of discontinued product lines  distributed products and components 
service and other revenues consist primarily of service revenue and license and maintenance fees 
service revenue increased by  or million  from million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal we did not recognize any software license revenue during fiscal compared to fiscal when we recognized a million license of our proprietary maui instrument operating system technology 
service and other revenue in each of fiscal and includes the recognition of million of revenue that was deferred with the adoption of the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements  as of the beginning of fiscal the effect of foreign currency contributed approximately million to the increase in total revenues during fiscal as compared to fiscal our geographic breakdown of revenues by area in total dollars and as a percentage of total revenues is as follows year ended june  year ended june  in thousands north america   north america europe middle east   europe middle east japan   japan asia pacific   asia pacific total revenues   total revenues gross margin was in fiscal compared to in fiscal included in cost of sales in fiscal is a million charge for the impairment of technology  manufacturing and distribution rights  a million charge for a future royalty payment and a million charge for severance expense 
the impairment and royalty cost resulted from our strategic decision to exit certain older product lines and to make significant changes to our manufacturing strategy to improve operating efficiency 
additionally  included in gross margin in fiscal was the positive effect of the million in license revenues included in service and other revenues on the consolidated statement of operations 
the increase in gross margin in fiscal was primarily due to higher margins and higher average selling prices on our high performance wavemaster and mid performance waverunner oscilloscopes  lower manufacturing costs resulting from continued improvements in operational efficiency  positive impact of foreign currency fluctuations on revenues while cost of sales are predominately in us dollars  restructuring savings of million and the ongoing benefit of our shift to a direct sales model in china and singapore 
selling  general and administrative expense increased by  or million  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal selling  general and administrative expense in fiscal includes million of severance charges and million of plant closing costs partially offset by the reversal of an unused restructuring reserve of million 
this increase was primarily due to increased variable selling costs related to higher revenues and the impact of foreign currencies  certain legal and compliance expenses and expenses related to performance bonuses that were suspended in the first three quarters of fiscal due to the weakness in the technology sector of the economy and in lecroy sales 
selling costs increased by million and general and administrative costs increased by million  net of restructuring savings of approximately million  partially offset by the decrease in net restructuring charges of million in fiscal compared to the same period in the prior year 
as a percentage of total revenues  selling  general and administrative expense was in fiscal  compared with in fiscal this decrease as a percentage of total revenues was primarily due to our ability to leverage selling infrastructure over the increased revenues in fiscal in fiscal  we expect selling  general and administrative expense will increase when compared to fiscal due to increased variable selling costs on higher forecasted revenues  the non cash compensation expense associated with restricted stock grants under our new long term incentive program and our intention to continue to defend ourselves vigorously in lawsuits filed against us 
research and development expense decreased by  or million  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease was primarily due to cost savings realized from the consolidation of our probe development activities into our chestnut ridge  new york facility at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal  the full benefit of cost reduction initiatives taken in fiscal of approximately million  a million charge for severance in fiscal and the timing of certain project specific engineering expenses 
as a percentage of total revenues  research and development expense decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal  which reflects our ability to leverage expenses over the higher sales base in fiscal which is consistent with our long term operating model of spending of sales on product development 
in fiscal  we intend to continue to invest a substantial percentage of our revenues in our research and development efforts 
we have development efforts underway and expect to introduce new products over the next year to address customer needs for solutions in market sectors such as ultra wide band and lower bandwidth oscilloscopes 
we believe that our advanced hardware and software technologies incorporated into our core products can be adapted to address additional sectors of the large and diverse test and measurement market where we have not historically focused 
other expense income  net  which consists primarily of net interest income and foreign exchange gains or losses  was an expense of  and  in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
included in other expense income  net in fiscal  was million in transaction costs related to the repurchase of our redeemable convertible preferred stock and higher interest expense due to borrowings under our revolving line of credit  partially offset by foreign exchange gains of million on transactions denominated in other than the functional currency of us or our subsidiaries 
in fiscal  foreign exchange losses of million were partially offset by net interest income of million 
in fiscal  we recorded a tax provision of million  compared to a tax benefit of million in fiscal the company s effective tax rate was in fiscal and fiscal in fiscal and  we recorded million gains on sales of discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations  net of income tax provisions  for the reversal of unused accrued discontinued operations reserves 
in addition  the gain on sale of discontinued operations in fiscal includes the sale of the residual assets and business of digitech industries  inc digitech 
on september   we redeemed all  issued and outstanding shares of our redeemable convertible preferred stock from the holders holders for million in cash the redemption 
in accordance with the securities and exchange commission s position published in an emerging issues task force eitf topic no 
d relating to induced conversions of preferred stock  we recorded the million premium paid to purchase the preferred stock as a charge to arrive at net income applicable to common stockholders in fiscal lecroy and the holders agreed that the redemption would be transacted as of the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal as a result  we accounted for the redemption as though no dividends had accrued in fiscal and that the unaccreted value attributed to the warrants at the point of issue was accelerated and combined with the redemption premium to reflect the total charge related to the redemption in the consolidated statement of operations 
in fiscal  charges related to our redeemable convertible preferred stock  comprising the dividend on the preferred stock and the accretion for the value of fully exercisable warrants granted in connection with the private placement of the preferred stock  were million 
comparison of fiscal years and total revenues were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  a decrease of  or million 
the decrease in revenue was due to a decrease in total oscilloscope units shipped in fiscal the positive impact of foreign currency offset approximately million of the decrease in total revenues during fiscal as compared to fiscal revenues from oscilloscopes and related products decreased  or million  in fiscal lower sales of approximately million from discontinued and older product lines  oem distributed products and components were partially offset by increased sales of approximately million for our application specific serial data analyzer and disk drive analyzer versions of our high end wavemaster product line of oscilloscopes and increased sales of probes and accessory products 
revenues from service and other revenue increased  or million  in fiscal primarily due to a million agreement to license our maui instrument operating system technology and a million increase in service revenue 
revenues from high energy physics products included in service and other revenue declined by million  or  in fiscal as a result of our decision in december to discontinue this product line 
service and other revenue in each of fiscal and includes the recognition of million of revenue that was deferred with the adoption of sab as of the beginning of fiscal our geographic breakdown of revenues by area in total dollars and as a percentage of total revenues is as follows year ended june  year ended june  in thousands north america   north america europe middle east   europe middle east japan   japan asia pacific   asia pacific total revenues   total revenues gross margin was in fiscal compared to in fiscal included in cost of sales in fiscal is a million charge for the impairment of technology  manufacturing and distribution rights  a million charge for a future royalty payment and a million charge for severance expense 
the impairment and royalty cost resulted from our strategic decision to exit certain older product lines and to make significant changes to our manufacturing strategy to improve operating efficiency 
included in cost of sales in fiscal is a million charge for severance and a charge of million to increase our allowance for excess and obsolete inventory 
this inventory charge relates to the cost of inventory associated with discontinued product lines and inventory levels that had been deemed to be in excess of forecasted requirements 
the increase in gross margin in fiscal resulted from the million technology license included in service and other revenue  favorable margins on our high end wavemaster product line of oscilloscopes  more favorable product margins on the existing base of products due to higher average selling prices of our high end products  increased operational efficiency  positive impact of foreign currency fluctuations on revenues while cost of sales are predominately in us dollars and improved cost structure 
selling  general and administrative expense increased by  or million  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal selling  general and administrative expense in fiscal includes million of severance charges and million of plant closing costs partially offset by the reversal of an unused restructuring reserve of million 
selling  general and administrative expense in fiscal includes million of severance charges 
this increase in selling  general and administrative expense is attributable to increased fixed selling costs of approximately million as a result of the conversion  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  of the us sales force from partial coverage by manufacturers representatives to full coverage by our direct sales force  the impact of foreign currencies  establishing a direct presence in singapore and the opening of two new offices in china 
this increase was partially offset by lower general and administrative expenses of approximately million due to improvements in our cost structure and a million incremental decrease in restructuring charges in fiscal as a percentage of total revenues  selling  general and administrative expense was in fiscal  compared with in fiscal this increase as a percentage of total revenues was primarily due to our inability to leverage higher costs of fixed infrastructure over the lower sales base 
research and development expense decreased by  or million  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal included in research and development in fiscal and are severance charges of million and million  respectively  and in fiscal a million technology access fee to ibm 
we are using the access to this next generation silicon germanium technology acquired from ibm to develop components that are expected to deliver higher density  greater speed and reduced power consumption than those currently available 
such components will be used in future high speed oscilloscopes 
as a percentage of sales  research and development expense decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal this decrease as a percentage of total revenues was primarily due to the technology access fee purchased in fiscal  partially offset by increased severance charges 
despite the effects of the difficult economy  we maintained our commitment to product development in fiscal as evidenced by the successful execution of our product strategy of leveraging our high end silicon germanium acquisition technology and our maui operating system  which had been deployed in our wavemaster product line  into our wavepro product line as well 
other expense income  net  which consists primarily of net interest income and foreign exchange gains or losses  was an expense of million in fiscal  compared to income of million in fiscal the decrease in income in fiscal was primarily due to a million increase in foreign exchange losses on transactions denominated in other than the functional currency of us or our subsidiaries and lower net interest income earned on our cash balances due to lower interest rates 
other expense income  net in fiscal  is partially offset by a million loss from the sale of marketable securities 
in fiscal  we recorded a tax benefit of million  or an effective tax rate of  compared to a tax benefit of million  or an effective tax rate of  in fiscal the effective tax rate in fiscal was based on an estimated annual effective tax rate of approximately  increased by the release of a million tax reserve related to a favorable audit settlement in the first quarter of fiscal in fiscal  we recorded a million gain on sale of discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations  net of an income tax provision  for the reversal of unused accrued discontinued operations reserves and the sale of the residual assets and business of digitech

liquidity and capital resources cash and marketable securities at june  improved to million compared to million at june  net cash provided by operating activities increased by million  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this increase was primarily due to the million improvement in net income  the million incremental increase in the utilization of deferred tax assets  the tax benefit of million from the exercise of stock options and reduced cash payments for accounts payable  accrued expenses and other liabilities in fiscal  partially offset by the million incremental increase in accounts receivable 
the increase in accounts receivable was primarily due to a million increase in shipments in the fourth quarter of fiscal as compared to the same period in the prior year and increased shipments to asia where collection terms run longer 
net cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal this increase was primarily due to the purchase of million of marketable securities  an incremental increase of million in capital expenditures and a million net increase of acquisition of technology licenses  partially offset by the net proceeds of million from the sale of property during fiscal the increase in capital expenditures in fiscal was primarily due to million of capital improvements to our principal office and manufacturing facility and increased capital spending on furniture  machinery and equipment 
net cash used in provided by financing activities was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the decrease in cash provided by financing activities in fiscal versus was primarily due to the repurchase of our preferred stock for million partially offset by net proceeds of million from our follow on offering of our common stock and an increase of million in proceeds from employee stock purchases and stock option exercises 
on april   we closed an underwritten public follow on offering of  shares of our common stock at per share less the underwriting discount raising aggregate net proceeds of approximately million  net of million in offering costs and expenses 
we granted the underwriters an option to purchase up to an additional  shares of common stock included in the offering to cover over allotments  if any  within days of the closing 
on april   pursuant to the exercise of this over allotment option  we sold an additional  shares at per share less the underwriting discount  raising additional net proceeds of million  net of expenses 
on april   we used proceeds from this offering to repay million of indebtedness outstanding under our revolving credit facility  and we intend to use the remaining net proceeds for general corporate and working capital purposes 
we may also use a portion of the net proceeds of this offering to acquire or invest in businesses  products  services or technologies complementary to our current business  through mergers  acquisitions  joint ventures or otherwise 
pending application of any of the proceeds to any specific uses  we have invested the net proceeds of this offering in short term  interest bearing investment grade marketable securities 
on november   we amended our existing million revolving credit facility with the bank of new york 
the amended agreement provides us with a million revolving credit facility expiring on november   which can be used to provide funds for general corporate purposes and acquisitions 
borrowings under this line bear interest at an annual rate of prime plus a margin not to exceed  or at the london interbank offering rate libor plus a margin of between and  depending on our leverage ratio  as such term is defined in the credit agreement 
a commitment fee of per annum is payable on any unused amount under the facility 
this revolving credit facility is secured by a lien on substantially all of our domestic assets 
as of june   we are in compliance with our financial covenant requirements and there were no borrowings outstanding under this line of credit 
we have a million capital lease line of credit to fund certain capital expenditures 
as of june   we had million outstanding under this line of credit  million of which was current and the remaining million of which was included in deferred revenue and other non current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet 
this line of credit expires november and outstanding borrowings bear interest at an annual rate of 
in addition to the above us based facilities  we maintain certain short term foreign credit facilities  principally facilities with two japanese banks totaling million yen million as of june  
no amounts were outstanding under these facilities as of june  we believe that our cash on hand  cash flow generated by our continuing operations and availability under our revolving credit lines will be sufficient to fund our operations  working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the foreseeable future and provide funds for potential acquisition opportunities

important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our forward looking statements are set forth in this form k  including under the heading risk factors 
all forward looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements set forth in this form k 
except as required by federal securities laws  we are under no obligation to update any forward looking statement  whether as a result of new information  future events  or otherwise 
risk factors an investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk 
you should carefully consider the risks described below together with all of the other information included in this form k when evaluating the company and its business 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  financial condition  liquidity  or results of operations could suffer 
in that case  the trading price of our common stock could decline and our stockholders may lose all or part of their investment 
risks related to our business our operating results are expected to continue to fluctuate and may not meet our financial guidance or published analyst forecasts  which may cause the price of our common stock to decline significantly 
our past operating results  including our gross margins  have fluctuated from fiscal period to fiscal period 
we expect our future operating results and gross margins will continue to fluctuate from fiscal period to fiscal period due to a number of factors  many of which are outside our control and any of which could cause our stock price to fluctuate 
the primary factors that affect us include the following o changes in overall demand for our products  o the timing of the introduction and market acceptance of new products by us or competing companies  o the timing and magnitude of research and development expenses  o changes in the estimation of the future size and growth rate of our markets  o changes in our production efficiency  o disruptions in operations at any of our facilities or the facilities of any of our contract manufacturers for any reason  o changes in our selling prices  and o changes in foreign currency exchange risks 
in addition  we have historically experienced somewhat lower activity during our first fiscal quarter than in other fiscal quarters which  we believe  is due principally to the lower level of orders and market activity during the summer months  particularly in europe 
we believe this seasonal aspect of our business is likely to continue in the future 
our stock price may be volatile in the future  and our stockholders may not be able to resell their shares at or above the price they paid 
the market price of our common stock fluctuates significantly 
the stock price could fluctuate in the future due to a number of factors  some of which are beyond our control 
these factors include o historically low trading volume in our stock  o announcements of developments related to our business  o announcements of technological innovations or new products or enhancements by us or our competitors  o sales by competitors  including sales to our customers  o sales of common stock into the public market  including those by directors and members of management  o developments in our relationships with our customers  partners  distributors  and suppliers  o shortfalls or changes in revenue  gross margins  earnings or losses  or other financial results from analysts expectations  o regulatory developments  o fluctuations in results of operations  o trends in the seasonality of our sales  and o general conditions in our market or the markets served by our customers 
in addition  in recent years the stock market in general and the market for shares of technology stocks in particular have experienced extreme price fluctuations  which have often been due largely to factors other than the operating performance of the affected companies 
we cannot ensure that the market price of our common stock will not decline substantially  or otherwise continue to experience significant fluctuations in the future  including fluctuations that are unrelated to our operating performance 
if demand for our products does not match manufacturing capacity  we may underutilize our capacity or  alternatively  be unable to fulfill orders in a timely manner  and in either situation our earnings may suffer 
the sale of our products is dependent  to a large degree  on customers whose industries are subject to cyclical trends in the demands for their products 
we may not be able to adapt production capacity and related cost structures to rapidly changing market conditions in a timely manner 
when demand does not meet expectations  manufacturing capacity will likely exceed production requirements 
we have at times increased our production capacity and the overhead that supports production based on anticipated market demand which has not always developed as expected 
as a result  we have periodically underutilized our capacity  which has adversely affected our earnings due to existing fixed costs 
in addition  conversely  if during a market upturn we cannot increase manufacturing capacity to meet product demand  we will not be able to fulfill orders in a timely manner  which in turn may have a negative effect on earnings and our overall business 
if our operating results do not continue to improve in the long term  we may be required to establish a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets 
we evaluate whether our deferred tax assets can be realized and assess the need for a valuation allowance on an ongoing basis 
as of june   we had recorded million of net deferred tax assets related to the future tax benefit of certain expenses reported for financial statement purposes that have not yet been deducted on our tax returns 
realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income 
as of june   we had recorded a valuation allowance of million to reserve for those tax assets we believe are not likely to be realized in future periods 
an additional valuation allowance would be recorded if it were more likely than not that some or all of our net deferred assets will not be realized 
if we establish additional valuation allowances  we might record a tax expense in our condensed consolidated statement of operations  which would have an adverse impact on our operating results 
we may not be successful in the expansion of our business operations in china  which could result in a loss of our investment and thereby harm our operating results 
we intend to continue to expand our business operations and sales in china 
however  we may be unsuccessful in implementing this strategy as planned or at all 
factors that could inhibit our successful expansion into china include its highly cyclical business environment  historically poor recognition of intellectual property rights and poor performance in stopping counterfeiting and piracy activity 
we face numerous risks associated with our international operations  which could cause a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations since approximately two thirds of our revenues are derived from international sales 
we market and sell our products and services outside the united states  and currently have employees located in china  france  germany  italy  hong kong  japan  singapore  south korea  sweden  switzerland and the united kingdom 
many of our customers and licensees are located outside the united states 
as part of our strategy  we intend to expand our international sales  particularly in china 
we face numerous risks in doing business outside the united states  including o dependence on sales representatives or foreign distributors and their sales channels  o longer accounts receivable collection cycles  o less effective and less predictable protection of intellectual property  o trade protection measures  import or export licensing requirements  tariffs and other trade barriers  o unusual or burdensome foreign laws or regulatory requirements or unexpected changes to those laws or requirements  o stronger us dollar makes our product more expensive  o changes in the political or economic condition of a specific country or region  particularly in emerging markets  and o potentially adverse tax consequences 
such factors could cause our future international sales to decline 
our business practices in international markets are also subject to the requirements of the foreign corrupt practices act 
if any of our employees are found to have violated these requirements  we could be subject to significant fines and other penalties 
our products are also subject to united states export control restrictions 
in certain cases  we may not be permitted to export products without obtaining an export license 
us export laws also prohibit the export of our products to a number of countries deemed by the united states to be hostile 
the export of our high performance oscilloscopes from the united states  which accounts for a material portion of our internationally derived revenue  is also subject to regulation under the treaty for nuclear non proliferation 
however  only a small portion of those oscilloscopes are sold in countries where that treaty restricts the end user 
these restrictions may make foreign competitors facing less stringent controls on their products more competitive in the global market 
we cannot be certain that the us government will approve any pending or future export license requests 
in addition  the list of products and countries for which export approval is required  and the regulatory policies with respect thereto  could be revised 
our international sales and  because approximately two thirds of our revenue is derived from sales outside the united states  our sales in general  could be materially harmed by our inability to obtain required licenses or by the costs of compliance 
we may be greatly impacted by the political  economic  and military conditions in china  taiwan  north korea  and south korea 
these countries have recently conducted military exercises in or near the others territorial waters and airspace 
such disputes may continue or escalate  resulting in economic embargoes  disruptions in shipping  or even military hostilities 
this could severely harm our business by interrupting or delaying shipment of our products to or through these areas and or reducing our sales in these areas 
we depend on single source suppliers for some of our products  and the loss of these suppliers could harm our business by interrupting or terminating our manufacture of those products 
we purchase a small number of parts from single source suppliers 
in particular  several key integrated circuits that we use are made by ibm 
although we have not experienced significant production delays attributable to supply changes  we believe that  for integrated circuits in particular  alternative sources of supply would be difficult to develop over a short period of time 
because we have no direct control over our third party suppliers  interruptions or delays in the products and services provided by these third parties may be difficult to remedy in a timely fashion 
in addition  if such suppliers are unable or unwilling to deliver the necessary parts or products  we may be unable to redesign or adapt our technology to work without such parts or find alternative suppliers or manufacturers 
in such events  we could experience interruptions  delays  increased costs  or quality control problems 
we depend upon key personnel and qualified future hires to implement our expansion strategy  and if we are unable to retain or attract personnel we may not be able to manage and operate successfully and we may not be able to meet our strategic objectives 
our success depends on the efforts and abilities of senior management and key employees in the sales  marketing  research and development  and manufacturing areas 
many of these employees would be difficult to replace 
we do not have employment contracts with most of our key personnel 
if we cannot retain existing key managers and employ additional qualified senior employees  our business  financial condition  and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
we do not maintain key man life insurance policies on any of our personnel 
future expansion of operations will require us to attract  train and retain new personnel 
in addition  we may be limited by non solicitation agreements entered into by our key personnel with respect to hiring employees from our competitors 
these factors could increase our operating expenses 
if we are unable to recruit or retain a sufficient number of qualified employees  or the costs of compensation or employee benefits increase substantially  our business  results of operations or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
the actions we took at the end of fiscal through fiscal in response to the reduced demand for our products could have long term adverse effects on our business 
we experienced reduced demand for our products beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal through the fourth quarter of fiscal in an effort to decrease expenses in response to this reduced demand  beginning at the end of fiscal and continuing through fiscal  we consolidated certain operations  reduced the size of our workforce and increased operating efficiencies 
there are several risks inherent in our cost cutting initiatives to transition to a reduced cost structure 
these include the risk that cost cutting initiatives have impaired our ability to develop and market products effectively and remain competitive in the industries in which we compete 
cost reduction measures could have long term adverse effects on our business by reducing our pool of technical talent  decreasing or slowing improvements in our products  making it more difficult for us to respond to customers  limiting our ability to increase production quickly if and when the demand for our products increases and limiting our ability to hire and retain key personnel 
these circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
we may not be successful in protecting our intellectual and proprietary rights  which would deprive us of a competitive advantage and thereby negatively impact our ability to compete 
as a technology based company  our success depends on developing and protecting our intellectual property 
we rely generally on patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws in the united states and abroad 
electronic equipment as complex as most of our products  however  is generally not patentable in its entirety 
we also license intellectual property from third parties and rely on those parties to maintain and protect their technology 
we cannot be certain that actions we take to establish and protect proprietary rights will be adequate  particularly in countries where intellectual property rights are not highly developed or protected 
if we are unable to adequately protect our technology  or if we are unable to continue to obtain or maintain licenses for protected technology from third parties  it may be difficult to design alternatives to such technology without incurring significant costs 
thus  the loss of intellectual property rights to technology could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
we are engaged in intellectual property litigation  including with tektronix 
on april   tektronix filed a complaint against us in the united states district court for the district of oregon claiming that we infringed on eight of its us patents 
in our responsive pleading  we denied that we have infringed  or are infringing  on any of these patents  and contend that the patents are invalid 
four of these patents concern software user interface features for oscilloscopes  two concern circuitry and two concern probes 
on august   we filed a counterclaim in the united states district court for the district of oregon claiming that tektronix is infringing on three of our patents 
from time to time  in the ordinary course of business  we receive notices from third parties regarding intellectual property infringement or take action against others with regard to intellectual property rights 
even where we are successful in defending or pursuing such claims  we may incur significant costs 
in the event of a successful claim against us  we could lose our rights to needed technology or be required to pay license fees for the infringed rights  either of which could have an adverse impact on our business 
we license certain intellectual property from third parties  and the loss of these licenses could delay development of future products or prevent the sale or enhancement of existing products 
we rely on licenses of intellectual property for our businesses  including technology used in our products 
we cannot ensure that these licenses will be available in the future on favorable terms or at all 
the loss of these licenses or the ability to maintain any of them on acceptable terms could delay development of future products or prevent the further sale or enhancement of existing products 
such loss could adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
potential acquisitions  strategic alliances and joint ventures may result in financial results that are different than expected 
in the normal course of business  we engage in discussions with third parties relating to possible acquisitions  strategic alliances and joint ventures 
as a result of transactions which may be consummated  our financial results may differ from the investment community s expectations in a given quarter 
in addition  acquisitions and strategic alliances may require us to integrate a different company culture  management team and business infrastructure 
we may have difficulty developing  manufacturing and marketing the products of a newly acquired company in a way that enhances the performance of our combined businesses or product lines to realize the value from expected synergies 
depending on the size and complexity of an acquisition  our successful integration of the entity depends on a variety of factors  including o the retention of key employees  o the management of facilities and employees in different geographic areas  o the retention of key customers  and o the integration or coordination of different research and development  product manufacturing and sales programs and facilities 
any impairment of the value of purchased assets or goodwill could have a significant negative impact on our future operating results 
all of these efforts require varying levels of management resources  which may divert our attention from other business operations 
further  if market conditions or other factors lead us to change our strategic direction  we may not realize the expected value from such transactions 
if we do not realize the expected benefits or synergies of such transactions  our consolidated financial position  results of operations  cash flows and stock price could be negatively impacted 
we may not be able to obtain the capital we need to maintain or grow our business 
our ability to execute our long term strategy may depend to a significant degree on our ability to obtain long term debt and equity capital 
we have no commitments for additional borrowings  other than our existing credit facility  or for sales of equity  other than under our existing employee benefit plans 
we cannot determine the precise amount and timing of our funding needs at this time 
we may be unable to obtain future additional financing on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
the following factors could affect our ability to obtain additional financing on favorable terms  or at all o our results of operations  o general economic conditions and conditions in our industry  o the perception in the capital markets of our business  o our ratio of debt to equity  o our financial condition  o our business prospects  and o changes in interest rates 
in addition  certain covenants relating to our revolving credit facility impose certain limitations on additional indebtedness 
if we are unable to obtain sufficient capital in the future  we may have to curtail our capital expenditures and reduce research and development expenditures 
any such actions could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
we could incur substantial costs as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental laws 
our operations are subject to laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment  including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the air or water  the management and disposal of hazardous substances or wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites 
some of our operations require environmental permits and controls to prevent and reduce air and water pollution  and these permits are subject to modification  renewal and revocation by issuing authorities 
we could incur substantial costs  including cleanup costs  fines and civil or criminal sanctions and third party claims for property damage and personal injury as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental laws or noncompliance with environmental permits 
our former subsidiary  digitech industries  inc  has been involved in environmental remediation activities  the liability for which was retained by us and entirely reserved for after the sale of the vigilant networks segment and the residual assets of digitech 
any liability beyond what is currently expected and reserved for could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we are subject to laws and regulations governing government contracts  and failure to address these laws and regulations or comply with government contracts could harm our business by leading to a reduction in revenue associated with these customers 
we have agreements relating to the sale of our products to government entities and  as a result  we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government 
the laws governing government contracts differ from the laws governing private contracts 
for example  many government contracts contain pricing terms and conditions that are not applicable to private contracts 
we are also subject to investigation for compliance with the regulations governing government contracts 
a failure to comply with these regulations might result in suspension of these contracts  or administrative penalties 
if we are required to expense the fair value of stock options granted under our employee stock plans  our net income and earnings per share would be significantly reduced 
there has been an increasing public debate about the proper accounting treatment for employee stock options 
in march  the fasb issued an exposure draft entitled share based payment an amendment of fasb statements no 
and no 
 requiring companies to expense the fair value of all employee equity based awards granted  modified or settled 
the tentative requirements would be effective for us in our fiscal year commencing july and would require any options issued or vesting on or after that date to be recognized as compensation expense in accordance with the future statement 
currently  we record compensation expense in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  only in connection with option grants that have an exercise price below fair value 
it is possible that future laws  regulations and accounting pronouncements will require us to record the fair value of all stock options as compensation expense in our consolidated statement of operations  which would have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
we have a revolving credit facility that contains financial covenants  and the failure to comply with these covenants could harm our financial condition because our credit facility may be unavailable to us 
we have a million revolving credit facility with the bank of new york 
we are subject to financial covenants under our credit facility  including interest coverage ratio  minimum total net worth  minimum total tangible net worth and liquidity ratio requirements 
we expect that existing cash and cash equivalents  cash provided from operations  and borrowings pursuant to our existing credit facility with the bank of new york will be sufficient to meet ongoing cash requirements 
failure to generate sufficient cash or comply with the financial covenants under our credit facility may adversely affect our business  results of operations  liquidity and financial condition 
issuance of shares in connection with financing transactions or under stock plans and outstanding warrants will dilute current stockholders 
pursuant to our stock plans  our management is authorized to grant restricted stock awards or stock options to our employees  directors and consultants 
in addition  we also have warrants outstanding to purchase shares of our common stock 
our stockholders will incur dilution upon exercise of any outstanding stock options or warrants 
in addition  if we raise additional funds by issuing additional common stock  or securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for common stock  further dilution to our existing stockholders will result  and new investors could have rights superior to existing stockholders 
anti takeover provisions under our stockholder rights plan  charter documents and delaware law could delay or prevent a change of control and could also limit the market price of our stock 
our stockholder rights plan  certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change of control of our company that our stockholders might consider favorable 
certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws allow us to o authorize the issuance of preferred stock which can be created and issued by the board of directors without prior stockholder approval  with rights senior to those of the common stock  o provide for a classified board of directors  with each director serving a staggered three year term  o prohibit stockholders from filling board vacancies  calling special stockholder meetings  or taking action by written consent  and o require advance written notice of stockholder proposals and director nominations 
in addition  we are governed by the provisions of section of the delaware general corporate law  which may prohibit certain business combinations with stockholders owning or more of our outstanding voting stock 
these and other provisions in our certificate of incorporation  bylaws and stockholder rights plan and delaware law could make it more difficult for stockholders or potential acquirors to obtain control of our board of directors or initiate actions that are opposed by the then current board of directors  including delay or impede a merger  tender offer  or proxy contest involving our company 
moreover  certain provisions of our license agreement with tektronix  which expires in september  could discourage certain companies or other third parties from attempting to acquire control of us or limit the price that such parties might be willing to pay for our common stock until the expiration of such agreement 
any delay or prevention of a change of control transaction or changes in our board of directors could cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
risks related to our industry we operate in highly competitive markets and this competition could reduce our market share and harm our business 
the oscilloscope market is highly competitive and characterized by rapid and continual advances in technology 
our principal competitors in this market are tektronix and agilent 
both of our principal competitors have substantially greater sales and marketing  development and financial resources than we do 
we believe that tektronix  agilent and other competitors each offer a wide range of products that attempt to address most sectors of the oscilloscope market 
we have historically engaged in intense competition with tektronix 
some of our senior managers  including our chief executive officer and chief operating officer  are former employees of tektronix 
in  we settled litigation with tektronix alleging that our oscilloscope products infringed certain patents held by tektronix by entering into a license agreement for the right to use that intellectual property 
we are currently engaged in intellectual property litigation with tektronix in which both sides have claimed that the other is infringing its patents 
this litigation is described in more detail under item  legal proceedings  of part i of this form k 
we believe that the principal bases of competition in the oscilloscope market are a product s performance bandwidth  sample rate  memory length and processing power  its price and quality  the vendor s name recognition and reputation  product availability and the quality of post sale support 
if any of our competitors surpass us or are perceived to have surpassed us with respect to one or more of these factors  we may lose customers 
we also believe that our success will depend in part on our ability to maintain and develop the advanced technology used in our oscilloscope products and our ability to offer high performance products at a favorable price to performance ratio 
we cannot assure that we will continue to compete effectively 
a prolonged economic downturn could materially harm our business by decreasing capital spending 
negative trends in the general economy  including trends resulting from actual or threatened military action by the united states and threats of terrorist attacks on the united states and abroad  could cause a decrease in capital spending in many of the markets we serve 
in particular  a downward cycle affecting the computer and semiconductor  data storage devices  automotive and industrial  and military and aerospace markets would likely result in a reduction in demand for our products and would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
in addition  if customers markets decline  we may not be able to collect outstanding amounts due to us 
such declines could harm our consolidated financial position  results of operations  cash flows and stock price  and could limit our ability to maintain profitability 
we must successfully execute our strategy to introduce new products 
one of our key strategies is to expand our addressable portion of the oscilloscope market by introducing new products such as sampling oscilloscopes and additional oscilloscopes in the lower bandwidth market 
we have in the past withdrawn a product line due to implementation concerns 
in august  we divested our vigilant networks business segment because  while its technology was potentially viable  the additional capital investment required for its commercial success was judged to be too high 
the success of our new product offerings will depend on a number of factors  including our ability to identify customer needs properly  manufacture and deliver products in sufficient volumes on time  differentiate offerings from competitors offerings  price products competitively and anticipate competitors development of new products or technological innovations 
without the timely introduction of competitive products  our products may become technologically obsolete 
we generally sell our products in industries that are characterized by rapid technological changes  frequent new product introductions and changing industry standards 
without the timely introduction of new products  services and enhancements  our products may become technologically obsolete  in which case our revenue and operating results could suffer 
the success of new product offerings will depend on several factors  including our ability to identify customer needs properly  innovate and develop new technologies  manufacture and deliver products in sufficient volumes on time  differentiate offerings from competitors offerings  price products competitively and anticipate competitors development of new products or technological innovations 
we could be affected by government regulation and other legal uncertainties 
we manufacture our products in the united states  and sell our products and purchase parts  components and sub assemblies in a number of countries 
we are therefore subject to various significant international  federal  state and local regulations  including but not limited to health and safety  product content  labor and import export regulations 
for example  the export of high performance oscilloscopes from the united states is subject to regulation under the treaty for nuclear non proliferation 
these regulations are complex  change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time 
we may be required to incur significant expenses to comply with these regulations or to remedy violations of these regulations 
any failure by us to comply with applicable government regulations could also result in cessation of our operations or portions of our operations  product recalls or impositions of fines and restrictions on our ability to carry on or expand our operations 
in addition  because many of our products are regulated or sold into regulated industries  we must comply with additional regulations in marketing our products 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we purchase materials from suppliers and sell our products around the world and maintain investments in foreign subsidiaries  all denominated in a variety of currencies 
as a consequence  we are exposed to risks from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates with respect to a number of currencies  changes in government policies and legal and regulatory requirements  political instability  transportation delays and the imposition of tariffs and export controls 
among the more significant potential risks to us of relative fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates is the relationship among and between the us dollar  the euro  swiss franc  british pound  swedish krona  japanese yen  korean won  singapore dollar and hong kong dollar 
we have a program of entering into foreign exchange forward contracts to minimize the risks associated with currency fluctuations on assets or liabilities denominated in other than the functional currency of us or our subsidiaries 
it cannot be assured  however  that this program will effectively offset all of our foreign currency risk related to these assets or liabilities 
these foreign exchange forward contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative investments and hedging activities 
other than this program  we do not attempt to reduce our foreign currency exchange risks by entering into foreign currency management programs 
as a consequence  there can be no assurance that fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in the future as a result of mismatches between local currency revenues and expenses  the translation of foreign currencies into the us dollar  our financial reporting currency  or otherwise  will not adversely affect our results of operations 
moreover  fluctuations in exchange rates could affect the demand for our products 
during fiscal  and  foreign currency exchange gains losses on assets or liabilities denominated in other than their functional currencies  net of gains losses on related foreign exchange contracts  were million  million and million  respectively 
these net gains losses are included in other income expense  net in the consolidated statements of operations and include gross gains of million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
at june  and june   the notional amounts of the company s open foreign exchange forward contracts  all with maturities of less than six months  were approximately million and million  respectively 
we performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical adverse movement in foreign exchange rates to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above 
as of june   the analysis indicated that these hypothetical market movements would have an immaterial effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
we are exposed to adverse changes in interest rates primarily due to our investment in cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities 
market risk is estimated as the potential change in fair value resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in interest rates  which would have been immaterial to our results of operations  financial position or cash flows
