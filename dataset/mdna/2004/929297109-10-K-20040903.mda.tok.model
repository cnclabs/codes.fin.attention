company overview we design  manufacture and market innovative gaming machines and vlts for the class iii gaming markets  and we manufacture gaming machines under original equipment manufacturing agreements  or oem agreements  with multimedia games  inc for the class ii gaming market 
there are three classes of gaming markets as follows class i gaming includes traditional native american social and ceremonial games 
class i gaming is regulated exclusively at the native american tribe level 
we do not serve this market 
class ii gaming includes bingo  electronic aids to bingo  and  if played at the same location where bingo is offered  pull tabs and other games similar to bingo 
class ii gaming is regulated by the individual native american tribe  with the national indian gaming commission having oversight of the tribal regulatory process 
class iii gaming includes all other forms of gaming that are not included in either class i or class ii  including slot machines 
we seek to develop gaming machines that offer high entertainment value and generate greater revenues for casinos and other gaming machine operators than the gaming machines offered by our competitors 
our gaming machines feature advanced graphics  digital sound and engaging game themes  and most incorporate secondary bonus rounds 
some of our games use licensed  well recognized brands such as monopoly tm  hollywood squares tm and men in black tm 
in designing our gaming machines  our designers  engineers  artists and development personnel build upon our almost years of experience in designing and developing fun  humorous and exciting games 
our gaming machines are installed in all of the major regulated gaming jurisdictions in the united states  as well as in over foreign gaming jurisdictions 
for fiscal  and  we generated million  million and million in total revenue  respectively 
the increase in revenues in fiscal was due to receipt of regulatory approvals and subsequent shipment of our new bluebird video gaming devices and cpu nxt upgrade kits 
we generate revenue in two principal ways 
first  we have product sales of gaming machines and vlts  conversion kits  including theme and or operating system conversions  parts  used equipment and original manufactured equipment to casinos and other licensed gaming machine operators 
for fiscal  and  we generated million  million and million in product sales revenues  respectively 
second  we have gaming operations where we lease participation games and vlt s and earn royalties that we receive from third parties under license agreements to use our games 
participation games  as used throughout this report  refers to gaming machines that we lease based upon any of the following payment methods a percentage of the net win of the gaming machines  fixed daily fees  or in the case of wide area progressive games  a percentage of the amount wagered 
for fiscal  and  we generated million  million and million in gaming operations revenue  respectively 
we offer our vlts either for sale or on a leased basis  but for leased vlt s  we do not include such gaming devices in our installed base of participation games 
in early fiscal  we began offering our customers a new hybrid series of gaming devices where the casino can pay a normal participation rate or has an option to buy the base gaming device at the normal price and to pay a lower daily fee for the software and top box 
our portfolio of participation games includes games based upon the monopoly  hollywood squares  men in black and pac man brands  and under our puzzle pays tm series  the jumble tm  scrabble tm and pictionary tm brands  among others 
we received our first regulatory approvals for our proprietary wide area progressive system in may and have launched the monopoly money tm themed progressive jackpot in nevada and in native american casinos 
we have the ability to place these games on a participation basis because the popularity of branded games generates higher wagering and net win to the casino or gaming machine operator than traditional gaming machines 
our participation game installed base consisted of  participation gaming machines as of june   generated average daily revenue to us of per gaming machine for fiscal  and achieved an gross margin during fiscal  together with our other gaming operations revenue sources 
the products that we offered for sale throughout fiscal consisted primarily of multi coin  multi line video gaming machines 
we are one of the original developers of multi coin  multi line video gaming machines in the us market 
our video gaming machines include engaging themes  advanced graphics and digital sound effects and music 
we have also developed and recently received regulatory approvals for mechanical reel spinning gaming devices and poker games  which we will ship to customers in fiscal as part of our efforts to fully serve the gaming device needs of a casino 
in fiscal  we introduced the first of our participation games  a series of four monopoly themed gaming machines  under our exclusive license to use the widely recognized monopoly trademark on casino style gaming machines 
since then  we have continued to introduce additional monopoly and other themed gaming machines 
in  we experienced software anomalies in the operating system software that drives our gaming devices  and certain of these anomalies permitted player cheating 
as a result of these anomalies and the publicity concerning them  we experienced delays in receiving approvals for new games pending completion of regulatory review of upgrades to our operating system software 
these delays resulted in both lower game sales and lower participation game revenues because we were unable to refresh our installed base of participation games on our planned schedule 
to address the software anomaly issues and to revitalize our technology foundation  in january  we announced a three part technology improvement plan to improve the stability of the operating system software 
in fiscal  we stabilized our existing operating system software and began to receive approvals for new games 
we also met key milestones on the mid term phase of our technology improvement plan  which consisted of developing a new operating system and circuit board called cpu nxt 
in fiscal  we began shipping new games using our new cpu nxt operating system in the bluebird cabinet 
in fiscal  we are expanding our product offerings to include video poker and mechanical reel spinning games  and we intend to offer an increased number of new game themes 
by september  we expect to have received substantially all of the regulatory approvals required in north america to ship cpu nxt  bluebird  video poker games and mechanical reel spinning gaming devices 
we believe that this introduction of an increasing number of games and a broader range of new products will enable us to increase product sales  participation game installations and profitability going forward 
industry overview casino operators continuously seek to increase revenue growth and profitability at their casinos 
the importance of gaming machine revenue to the casino operators profitability has created demand for gaming machines that have the ability to generate superior net win 
as a result  the pace of innovation in game design has accelerated  and gaming equipment manufacturers have increasingly focused on enhancing the overall entertainment value of gaming machines 
we believe that three of the most significant recent developments in gaming machine design have been the development of video gaming machines that simulate mechanical reel spinning slot machines  the introduction of gaming machines with secondary bonus rounds  and cashless gaming 
video gaming machines that simulate a mechanical reel spinning slot machine on a video screen are predominantly multi coin  multi line gaming machines that offer multiple distinct pay lines and allow up to or more coins to be wagered on a single play 
this tends to increase the average wager per play 
secondary bonusing allows a player to advance beyond the primary game into a bonus round if the player attains a specified result in the primary game 
the bonus rounds are designed to create significant player appeal by giving the player more interactive options and a sense of investment in the game 
this encourages the player to continue to play the primary game in an effort to achieve all of the bonus rounds in a game 
in addition  the bonus rounds give game designers an opportunity to incorporate additional entertaining content into the game 
various forms of cashless gaming reduce casino operators costs and machine downtime as coins are no longer dispensed from the gaming device when a casino patron wants to cash out 
instead  the gaming device prints tickets or  through casino systems  banks the payout in an account for the casino patron 
this technology has proved popular with casino patrons 
we expect continued demand for multi coin  multi line video gaming machines and other gaming machines that offer the player secondary bonus rounds and other enhanced entertainment features  which we believe result in higher amounts wagered and net win per machine for casinos 
as casino operators continue to adopt cashless gaming in their casinos  we believe demand for gaming devices that support cashless gaming will continue to increase 
some of the gaming machines with secondary bonusing features and entertaining themes generate significantly more coin in per day than the other gaming machines on the casino floors  allowing gaming machine manufacturers to lease some of the highest earning machines to casino operators as participation games 
this allows gaming machine manufacturers to share in the superior earnings of these games and to generate a recurring revenue stream for themselves 
another revenue sharing model that has been employed by some manufacturers is a wide area progressive system 
a wide area progressive system wap links gaming machines in multiple casinos within a gaming jurisdiction to contribute to and compete for large system wide progressive jackpots 
wap systems are designed to increase gaming machine play for participating casinos by giving the players the opportunity to win a larger jackpot than on a non linked  stand alone gaming machine 
net win per gaming machine on wap systems are generally higher than on non linked gaming machines on a casino floor 
we expect the demand for wide area progressive jackpot games to increase 
vlts include both video and mechanical reel spinning gaming machines 
vlts are sold  leased to  or operated as participation games by government agencies that desire to raise revenue for the jurisdictions in which they operate 
most vlts are linked to a central computer for accounting and security purposes and are monitored by state lotteries or other government authorities 
unlike gaming machines designed for the casino market  most vlts are located in places where casino type gaming is not the principal attraction  such as racetracks  bars and restaurants 
in the last decade  several us states such as new york  delaware  oregon and rhode island have enacted legislation permitting vlts 
business strategy our business strategy is to increase our market penetration in major regulated gaming jurisdictions worldwide by developing entertaining products and providing outstanding service 
this strategy includes the following elements our technology foundation in january  we embarked on a technology improvement plan designed to stabilize and update our existing operating system and position us for future growth 
we have received the requisite regulatory approvals for the upgraded version of our legacy operating system software 
we have also received approvals for cpu nxt  our new operating system and gaming platform  from all north american regulators beginning with our first regulatory approval for this platform in september we continue to work to incorporate new technologies into our software and platforms in anticipation of evolving customer preferences and future regulatory requirements 
leveraging our product development expertise to introduce innovative new games we have almost years of experience developing fun  humorous and exciting games 
over the past three years  we have enhanced our game development efforts by adding key management  design personnel and software engineers to our product development group 
we have renovated our facilities and organized our game development team into a studio format to help promote innovation while maintaining a focused development approach in an effort to maximize the entertainment value of our products 
we believe that our proven game development capabilities  combined with the additional functionalities and enhanced features of our new gaming platform  will enable us to increase our market share 
offering our new bluebird cabinets we have received approvals of our new bluebird cabinets from all north american regulators  beginning with our first regulatory approval of this new cabinet in november the bluebird cabinet is used for our video  mechanical reel spinning  poker and wide area progressive products 
bluebird cabinets incorporate features such as an ergonomically engineered design  inch digital  high resolution flat screen monitors for the video version of the product  sound systems by bose corporation bose and simultaneous coin in coin out and cashless capabilities 
at the american gaming summit in january  industry experts selected the bluebird cabinet as one of the top three most innovative new gaming products 
expanding the breadth of our product offerings we have expanded our product lines to be able to fully serve casino operators gaming machine requirements 
our former product line focused primarily on the multi coin  multi line video based market sector 
our new product offerings also include mechanical reel spinning gaming machines we introduced our first new mechanical reel spinning gaming devices in the spring of as part of our launch of our wide area progressive jackpot system 
our first shipment of a for sale mechanical reel spinning gaming device is expected in september we believe the mechanical reel spinning gaming machine market is an attractive opportunity  as it represents the largest portion of the global installed base of gaming machines 
video poker games we introduced our first proprietary video poker game on our new cpu nxt operating system in july we expect to introduce more video poker games in fiscal the video poker games are offered as a cpu nxt conversion kit to our legacy gaming device or in a new bluebird cabinet 
wide area progressive systems wide area progressive systems are inter casino systems that electronically link gaming machines located in various casinos to a central computer  which controls a progressive jackpot that increases with every wager placed on the linked gaming machines 
by may we received all of the regulatory approvals needed to operate our proprietary wide area progressive system in nevada casinos and for native american casinos and introduced our first proprietary wide area progressive jackpot to our customers 
maximizing the potential of our participation games and exclusive licenses of popular themes as the exclusive licensee of the monopoly brand for use with gaming machines  we have converted a popular board game brand into a successful line of superior earning gaming machines 
we have also licensed additional brands and now have five series of participation game themes with an aggregate installed base of  participation games as of june  we introduced a new branded series  men in black in late june the name recognition and creative game design of our branded products have allowed us to lease them to casino operators as participation games  generating a high margin recurring revenue stream for ourselves  as well as the casinos 
we continue to pursue new licensed brands and additional themes based on the guidance of focus group testing of casino patrons 
continuing our expansion into international markets we are authorized to conduct business in over foreign gaming jurisdictions 
revenues from our foreign customers increased by to million for fiscal from million for fiscal we anticipate continued growth in foreign markets with the continued penetration of cpu nxt  bluebird  and the introduction of mechanical reel spinning gaming machines and video poker games  wide area progressive systems and additional game titles 
to enhance our focus on foreign markets we recently appointed one of our senior executives as managing director of international operations 
we currently have offices in australia  south africa  spain and most recently we have opened an office in the united kingdom 
this new office will house our second internationally focused game development studio and  if gaming regulations are amended in the united kingdom  would also include sales and distribution functions 
the united kingdom continues in its efforts to modify its gaming legislation  which we believe will turn into revenue opportunities in calendar we also view macau and russia as two markets with high growth potential 
we have been an active supplier to the russian market for the past two years  and in may  we launched the first bluebird gaming devices there 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report 
products we offer video and mechanical reel spinning gaming machines and vlts incorporating highly entertaining game themes and innovative gaming features 
our new cpu nxt operating system supports added functionality and increased graphical capability and speed of play 
our bluebird gaming cabinet includes a number of features that we believe improve the experience of players  including the bose free field directed audio system  which reduces peripheral distracting noises  an inch lcd monitor  which can display advanced graphics generated by our new cpu nxt operating system  and a recessed coin tray to provide players with greater comfort 
the bluebird cabinet supports both video and mechanical reel games and is easier and faster to service than our legacy cabinets  with of the internal components interchangeable between upright and slant models 
engaging and humorous themes and a high degree of player interactivity are incorporated into each of our games  particularly in the secondary bonus rounds 
we believe that by designing games and gaming machines that are fun and interesting to play and incorporating the latest gaming technologies  we supply games and gaming machines with superior player appeal 
our games integrate secondary bonus rounds as additions to the basic game to create a game within a game for more exciting and interactive play 
if players achieve various milestones in the game  they move on to play a secondary game without additional wagering for additional bonuses 
the secondary game gives the player a sense of investment in the game 
the player is encouraged to continue wagering on the basic game in the hope of being awarded a secondary bonus game 
the player can win in both the basic game and the secondary game 
in our secondary bonus games  the player has various choices to make regarding the bonus features 
for example  in some games the player can select from a variety of tokens or characters that will be used to obtain or reveal the bonus 
amusing  entertaining or familiar graphics and musical themes add to the player appeal of our games 
games for sale we offer the following products for sale multi coin  multi line video gaming machines 
our line of multi coin  multi line gaming machines combine advanced graphics  digital sound effects and music  and secondary bonus games 
in the basic game  the video screen of these gaming machines simulates traditional mechanical reel spinning slot machines 
in our bonus games  the video screen shows a variety of amusing interactive themed content 
depending on the machine  the player can wager up to coins per play 
mechanical reel spinning slot machines 
following the expiration of the telnaes extended odds technology patent in  we developed and are now introducing a new line of mechanical reel spinning gaming devices in our new bluebird cabinet 
we expect to increase our presence in this market starting in september we did not introduce any new mechanical reel spinning games in fiscal and we introduced one new mechanical reel spinning game in fiscal on our legacy platform 
poker 
for our new poker products  our first poker game  way action tm  was approved by the first regulatory lab in june  and we shipped our first game to customers in july we expect to receive approvals from the other key gaming labs in the september quarter and approval of additional poker games throughout fiscal during fiscal and  we released the following new video games for sale cpu nxt operating system milk money tm rakin it in quackers wild wilderness rich little piggies reel em in instant winner tm money to burn jackpot party fairy s fortune tm robin hood s sherwood treasure life of luxury pick your fortune the jade monkey keepin up with the joneses way action poker legacy operating system legacy operating system life of luxury roll credits aztec adventure tm jackpot stampede tm toast of the town x marks the spot our sales of new gaming machines  primarily video gaming machines  were  units in fiscal compared to  units in fiscal and  units in fiscal the lower unit levels for the previous two fiscal years resulted from the delay of new game approvals and our customers delaying purchases as they scrutinized our progress in implementing our three part technology improvement plan to stabilize our operating system software and awaited our new products on our new platform 
in september  we received the first approvals for nine video games for sale on our new cpu nxt operating system 
we expect to introduce over games for sale in fiscal  subject to regulatory approval 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a discussion of revenues contributed by games for sale and other product sales 
participation games in fiscal  we introduced the first of our participation games  a series of four monopoly themed games under an exclusive license from hasbro  inc our game designers use secondary bonus rounds in combination with the actual elements of the monopoly board game to create the highly entertaining games 
these elements include mr 
monopoly tm  chance tm  community chest tm and the distinctive game board and tokens  some set to a background of big band music 
most of our participation games are multi coin  multi line video games  although some of the earlier games are mechanical reel spinning gaming machines 
in fiscal  we introduced puzzle pays  a second series of participation games  based on popular licensed puzzle game themes 
the first game in the puzzle pays series was jumble tm  based on the popular scrambled word game appearing in newspapers nationwide 
two additional puzzle pays gaming machines followed bee bucks tm  the sequel to jumble  and a scrabble tm themed game 
in fiscal  we launched three new participation game series hollywood squares  based on the popular television game show  in the winter of  pac man  based on the popular classic arcade game  in the spring of  and survivor tm  based on the popular television show in the spring of the survivor themed game was commercialized in association with international game technology  or igt  which placed these games on its megajackpots tm wide area progressive wap system 
wap systems are inter casino systems that electronically link gaming machines located in various casinos to a central computer  which controls a progressive jackpot that increases with every wager placed on the linked gaming machines 
in april  we introduced free parking tm  the eleventh game in the monopoly series 
in fiscal  we had limited introductions of two additional puzzle pays gaming machines  pictionary tm and scrabble winning recipe tm

in addition  we used the monopoly brand for our first wide area progressive jackpot  called monopoly money that we launched in may by may we received all of the regulatory approvals needed to operate our proprietary wap system in nevada casinos and for native american casinos and introduced our first proprietary wap jackpot to our customers 
during fiscal and  we released the following new participation games monopoly moneyline monopoly hot properties monopoly grand hotel monopoly free parking monopoly money s tm hollywood squares the center square tm monopoly wild chance tm pac man frenzy tm monopoly once around deluxe pictionary hollywood squares tour of stars tm scrabble winning recipe hollywood squares prize spin tm men in black after substantially increasing our game development staff over the last months  we expect to launch over new participation games in fiscal  subject to regulatory approval 
our installed base of participation games decreased from  units at june  to  units at june  net win per day per gaming device increased from in fiscal to in fiscal  as we continued to refresh the installed base with new games 
we believe the decline in the installed base of units was due to the removal of our participation games by casinos due to our legacy platform not supporting features and functionality required by the customers and our game performance not meeting operators expectations  and our removal of participation games in low performing casinos  the average installed base decreased from  units in fiscal to  units in fiscal at august  we have issued orders for over  conversions or new units  of which over  are for placement of new games on bluebird gaming devices 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a discussion of revenues contributed by gaming operations 
additional revenue sources in addition to the gaming machine categories described above  we also supply the following products video lottery terminals

our vlts may be operated as stand alone units or may interface with central monitoring computers operated by government agencies 
our vlts typically are located in places where casino type gaming is not the principal attraction  such as racetracks  bars and restaurants 
we expect to offer vlt s with cpu nxt and bluebird in fiscal we do not include the leased vlts in our installed base of participations games 
at june  we had  leased vlts installed 
parts sales  game conversions  oem and used games 
we sell replacement parts and game theme conversions for our gaming machines 
in fiscal  we began selling cpu nxt game conversion kits  which enable casinos to obtain all the features and functionality of the cpu nxt operating system for a lesser price than the purchase of a new bluebird cabinet 
we also sell used games that are acquired on a trade in basis or that were previously placed on a participation basis 
we expect that our revenues from these sources will increase in the future as our installed base of gaming machines sold expands 
in addition  we manufacture and sell gaming stations for multimedia games inc  or multimedia  under original equipment manufacturing  or oem  agreements 
in fiscal and  we manufactured and sold  and  gaming stations  respectively  to multimedia 
effective april  we entered into a strategic two year agreement with multimedia to expand and extend our relationship to address opportunities in class ii and other centrally controlled gaming markets 
licensing 
we entered into new licensing agreements with sierra design group  or sdg  now a wholly owned subsidiary of alliance gaming corporation  and multimedia in fiscal we granted sdg non exclusive rights to distribute the monopoly branded games in washington state  as well as a non exclusive license to commercialize our proprietary game themes in washington state  new york state and the state of florida

our way action poker product and our classic tv game show tm series of products will be distributed in this manner beginning in the september quarter 
design  research and product development in designing our gaming machines  our designers  engineers and artists build upon almost years of experience that our predecessors and we have in designing and developing fun  humorous and exciting games 
we are continually developing new games in order to refresh the installed base of our gaming devices  and implementing new technologies and functionality to enhance player entertainment 
our gaming machines and games are usually designed and programmed by our internal engineering staff and game design studios 
our game design teams operate in a studio environment that encourages creativity  productivity and cooperation among design teams 
each of our eight studios works concurrently on multiple games and is staffed with software developers  graphic artists  mathematicians and game developers 
in some cases  we may outsource testing and graphic design functions to independent designers under contract to us 
games and gaming machines may be tested by regulatory authorities who must approve the product before it can be shipped to gaming jurisdictions

sales and marketing we are authorized to sell or lease our gaming machines to casinos in tribal jurisdictions and other gaming jurisdictions worldwide 
see government regulation general below 
generally  we sell our gaming machines directly  rather than through the use of distributors  which we believe allows us to provide superior customer service and enhances profitability 
in some instances  our gaming machines are installed in casinos on a trial basis  and only after a successful trial period are the machines purchased by the customers 
in addition  we offer some of our most popular game themes on a participation or lease basis 
see company overview above 
we sell or lease vlts  depending on the jurisdictions where they are placed 
since we commenced the sales process last september  as of august   we have issued sales orders or executed agreements to sell  bluebird video gaming devices or cpu nxt upgrade kits representing about of the  wms video units in casinos 
of the  units for which we ve issued sales orders or executed agreements   of them or of the legacy video gaming devices were installed by june  of the remaining units   are bluebird units and  cpu nxt are upgrade kits 
we expect to deliver the balance of these units over the next several quarters 
we sell and lease our gaming machines through salespeople in offices in several united states locations  and six salespeople in our international offices two in our office in spain  two in our office in south africa  and one in each of canada and the united kingdom 
our salespeople earn a salary and commissions 
our gaming machines are primarily marketed through direct sales  trade shows  promotional videotapes  our proprietary website and advertising in trade journals 
no single customer accounted for or more of our revenues in fiscal  or our foreign game sales continued to increase in fiscal with over  games sold abroad compared to  in fiscal and  in fiscal we have translated our most popular domestic game themes into spanish  portuguese  french  russian and italian 
export sales and leases of our products were approximately million  or of revenues  for fiscal  compared with million  or of revenues  for fiscal  and million  or of revenues  for fiscal substantially all foreign sales are made in united states dollars 
revenue from participation games has been primarily limited to north america  and we expect this trend to continue 
since fiscal  we have developed games in australia 
these games are distributed under our cross license agreement with stargames using their pc hardware platform  and we receive a royalty payment for each of our games sold by stargames 
our agreement with stargames was renewed in december and extends through january  we entered into new licensing agreements with sdg  now a wholly owned subsidiary of alliance gaming  and multimedia in fiscal we granted sdg non exclusive rights to distribute the monopoly branded games in washington state  as well as a non exclusive license to commercialize our proprietary game themes in washington state  new york state and the state of florida

competition the gaming machine market is intensely competitive and is characterized by the continuous introduction of new game titles and new technologies 
our ability to compete successfully in this market is based  in large part  upon our ability to create an expanding and constantly refreshed portfolio of games with high earnings performance  offer gaming machines that consistently out perform gaming machines manufactured by our competitors  identify and develop or obtain rights to commercially marketable intellectual properties  and adapt our products for use with new technologies 
in addition  successful competition in this market is also based upon engineering innovation and reliability  mechanical reliability  brand recognition  marketing and customer support  and competitive prices and lease terms 
we estimate that about companies in the world manufacture gaming machines and vlts for legalized gaming markets 
of these companies  we believe that international game technology igt  bally gaming  aristocrat technologies  atronic casino technology  gtech holdings and wms control a majority of this worldwide market 
our competitors vary in size from small companies with limited resources to a few large corporations with greater financial  marketing and product development resources than ours 
the larger competitors  particularly igt  have an advantage in being able to spend greater amounts than us to develop new technologies and features that are attractive to players and customers 
in addition  some of our competitors have developed  sell or otherwise provide to customers security  centralized player tracking and accounting systems which allow casino operators to accumulate slot accounting and performance data about the operation of gaming devices 
we do not currently offer these systems 
several of our competitors pooled their intellectual property patents that provide cashless gaming alternatives  specifically ticket in ticket out technology so that when a casino patron cashes out from a gaming machine they may receive a printed ticket instead of coins

changes in control the nevada legislature has declared that some corporate acquisitions opposed by management  repurchases of voting securities and corporate defense tactics affecting nevada gaming licensees  and publicly traded corporations that are affiliated with those operations  may be injurious to stable and productive corporate gaming 
the nevada gaming commission has established a regulatory framework to guard against the potentially adverse effects of these business practices upon nevada s gaming industry 
approvals are  in certain circumstances  required from the nevada gaming commission before we can make exceptional repurchases of voting securities above their current market price and before a corporate acquisition opposed by management can be consummated

native american gaming regulation numerous native american tribes have become engaged in or have licensed gaming activities on native american tribal lands as a means of generating revenue for tribal governments

furthermore  gaming on native american lands may also be subject to the provisions of statutes relating to contracts with native american tribes  which are also administered by the secretary of the united states department of the interior 
the indian gaming regulatory act of requires that the tribe and the host state enter into a written agreement called a tribal state compact  that specifically authorizes class iii gaming  and that the compact has been approved by the secretary of the united states department of the interior  with the notice of approval published in the federal register 
tribal state compacts vary from state to state 
many require that equipment suppliers meet ongoing registration and licensing requirements of the state and or the tribe and some impose background check requirements on the officers  directors  principals and shareholders of gaming equipment suppliers 
under the indian gaming regulatory act of  tribes are required to regulate all commercial gaming under ordinances approved by the national indian gaming commission 
these ordinances may impose standards and technical requirements on hardware and software and may impose registration  licensing and background check requirements on gaming equipment suppliers and their officers  directors  principals and shareholders 
we have the required licenses to manufacture and distribute our products in the native american jurisdictions in which we do business and to operate our wide area progressive systems 
international regulation many foreign jurisdictions permit the importation  sale and or operation of gaming equipment in casino and non casino environments 
where importation is permitted  some countries prohibit or restrict the payout feature of the traditional slot machine or limit the operation of slot machines to a controlled number of casinos or casino like locations 
each gaming machine must comply with the individual jurisdiction s regulations 
some jurisdictions require the licensing of gaming machine operators and manufacturers 
we manufacture and supply gaming equipment to various international markets including asia  australia  canada  europe  south america and south africa 
we have the required licenses to manufacture and distribute our products in the foreign jurisdictions in which we do business 
seasonality sales of our gaming machines to casinos are generally strongest in the spring and slowest in the summer months 
in addition  quarterly revenues and net income may increase when we receive a larger number of approvals for new games from regulators than in other quarters  when a game or platform that achieves significant player appeal is introduced or if gaming is permitted in a significant new jurisdiction 
employees at august   we employed approximately  persons domestically and abroad 
approximately of our employees were represented by the international brotherhood of electrical workers the ibew at that date 
we have a collective bargaining agreement with the ibew related to our waukegan  illinois manufacturing facility  which expires on june  we believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory 
risk factors the most significant factors that make an investment in our common stock risky or speculative are discussed below 
these factors may cause our operating results to vary from anticipated results or may adversely affect our operating results or the value of our common stock 
software and hardware anomalies and fraudulent manipulation of our gaming machines and associated software could reduce our revenue  increase our costs  burden our engineering and marketing resources  involve us in litigation and adversely affect our gaming licenses 
our success depends on our ability to avoid  detect  replicate and correct software and hardware anomalies and fraudulent manipulation of our gaming machines and associated software 
our gaming machines and software have experienced anomalies and fraudulent manipulation in the past 
gaming machines may be replaced by casinos and other operators if they do not perform according to expectations or may be shut down by regulators 
in the event of such issues with our gaming machines and software  substantial engineering and marketing resources may be diverted from other projects to correct these issues  which may delay our other projects 
in addition  regulators may not approve new games  which may substantially reduce our revenues 
our games are generally subject to rigorous testing  both internally and by various gaming jurisdictions 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to build and maintain software based gaming devices that are free from anomalies or manipulations and satisfy these tests 
our gaming machines have in the past and could in the future be susceptible to software anomalies and manipulation after the gaming software has been widely distributed 
in addition  the occurrence of anomalies in  or fraudulent manipulation of  our gaming machines and software may give rise to claims for lost revenues and related litigation by our customers and may subject us to investigation or other action by gaming regulatory authorities including suspension or revocation of our gaming licenses  or disciplinary action 
our gaming machine business is heavily regulated  and we must obtain and maintain our gaming licenses and regulatory approvals to continue to operate our business and sell our products 
the manufacture and distribution of gaming machines is subject to extensive federal  state  local and foreign regulations and taxes 
the governments of the various gaming jurisdictions amend these regulations from time to time 
virtually all of these jurisdictions require licenses  permits  documentation of qualification  including evidence of financial stability  and other forms of approval for manufacturers and distributors of gaming machines and for their officers  directors  major security holders and key personnel 
the gaming authorities in some jurisdictions may investigate any individual who has a material relationship with us and any security holder to determine whether the individual or security holder is acceptable to those gaming authorities 
any security holder investigated by the gaming authorities must pay the costs of the investigation 
each of our games and gaming machine hardware and software must be approved in each jurisdiction in which it is placed  and we cannot assure you that a particular game or hardware or software will be approved in any jurisdiction 
licenses  approvals or findings of suitability may be revoked  suspended or conditioned 
the revocation or denial of a license in a particular jurisdiction means that we cannot sell our products in that jurisdiction  and could adversely affect our ability to obtain or maintain licenses in other jurisdictions 
if we fail to seek or do not receive a necessary registration  license  approval or finding of suitability  we may be prohibited from selling our games or gaming machines for use in the jurisdiction 
some jurisdictions require gaming manufacturers to obtain government approval before engaging in some transactions  such as business combinations  reorganizations  stock offerings and repurchases 
obtaining licenses and approvals can be time consuming and costly 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain all necessary registrations  licenses  permits  approvals or findings of suitability in a timely manner  or at all 
similarly  we cannot assure you that our current registrations  licenses  approvals or findings of suitability will not be revoked  suspended or conditioned 
our profitability depends heavily on recurring revenue from gaming operations  the loss of which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profitability 
approximately million  or  of our revenues for fiscal  and million  or  of our revenues in fiscal  were derived from gaming operations 
in addition  for fiscal  our gross margin on gaming operations was while our gross margin on product sales was 
for fiscal  our gross margin on gaming operations was  while our gross margin on product sales was 
therefore  our level of revenue from gaming operations has a significant effect on our profitability 
participation games are replaced by casino operators if the gaming machines do not meet and sustain revenue and net win expectations 
therefore  these gaming machines are particularly susceptible to pressure from competitors  declining popularity and changes in economic conditions and increased taxation and are at risk of replacement by the casinos  ending the recurring revenues from these machines 
we cannot assure you that our participation games will continue to meet the casinos revenue requirements 
patent infringement claims could limit or affect our ability to market some of our gaming machines and subject us to liability 
our competitors have been granted patents covering numerous gaming machine features and bonusing techniques 
if our products use processes or other subject matter that is claimed under these existing patents  or if other companies obtain patents claiming subject matter that we use  those companies may bring infringement actions against us 
we might then be forced to discontinue the affected products or be required to obtain licenses from the company holding the patent  if it is willing to give us a license  to develop  manufacture or market our products 
we also might then be limited in our ability to market new products 
we might also be found liable for treble damage claims relating to past use of the patented subject matter 
if we do not obtain and retain licenses to use intellectual properties and licensors approvals of new products on a timely basis  our revenues will be adversely affected 
some of our most popular gaming machines  including our monopoly branded games  are based on trademarks and other intellectual properties licensed from third parties 
our future success may depend upon our ability to obtain and retain licenses for additional popular intellectual properties 
there is competition for these licenses  and we cannot assure you that we will be successful in acquiring or retaining additional intellectual property rights with significant commercial value on acceptable terms 
these intellectual properties are licensed for a fixed term and generally provide for minimum guaranteed royalties and other obligations 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain or renew the intellectual properties that we currently license 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to create games using the intellectual properties that will generate enough revenues for us to cover the minimum guaranteed royalties and other fixed costs 
in the event that we cannot renew our existing licenses  we may be required to discontinue the participation games bearing the licensed marks 
our intellectual property licenses generally require that we submit new products developed under these licenses to the licensor prior to release for approval of our use of the licensed property at their sole discretion 
rejection or delay in approval of a product design by a licensor could have a material adverse effect on our revenues  operating results and financial condition 
if we are unable to protect or retain our intellectual property and proprietary rights  our revenues may be adversely affected 
our success may depend in part on our ability to obtain trademark protection for the names or symbols under which we market our products and to obtain copyright protection and patent protection of our proprietary software and other game innovations 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to build and maintain goodwill in our trademarks or obtain trademark or patent protection  that any trademark  copyright or issued patent will provide competitive advantages for us or that our intellectual properties will not be successfully challenged or circumvented by competitors 
we also rely on trade secrets and proprietary know how 
we enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees regarding our trade secrets and proprietary information  but we cannot assure you that the obligation to maintain the confidentiality of our trade secrets or proprietary information will be honored 
despite various confidentiality agreements and other trade secret protections  our trade secrets and proprietary know how could become known to  or independently developed by  competitors 
if we do not continue to introduce new games and gaming machines that achieve and maintain market acceptance  our revenues and profitability will be adversely affected  and we will not recover our development costs 
our success depends on continually developing and successfully marketing new games and gaming machines with strong and sustained player appeal 
a new game or gaming machine will be accepted by casino operators only if we can show that it is likely to produce more revenues to the operator than competitors products 
gaming machines can be installed in casinos on a trial basis  and only after a successful trial period are the machines purchased by the casinos 
if a new product does not achieve significant market acceptance  we may not recover our development and promotion costs 
we cannot assure you that the new products that we introduce will achieve any significant degree of market acceptance or that the acceptance will be sustained for any meaningful period 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our current schedule of planned introductions 
in addition  if we are unable to successfully re market legacy equipment held in inventory and used in participation gaming operations through secondary markets  we may incur charges to earnings 
if we do not continually adapt to the rapid development of new technologies  we will not be able to successfully compete in our industry 
the gaming machine business is characterized by the rapid development of new technologies and the continuous introduction of new products using such technologies 
we must continually adapt our products to incorporate new technologies 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to develop products using these new technologies or that we will be able to license such technologies if owned by others 
some of our competitors have advantages over us in their ability to finance technology development and in obtaining favorable placement in casinos  which may limit our revenues 
the gaming machine business is intensely competitive 
some of our competitors are large companies with greater financial  marketing and product development resources than ours 
in addition  new competitors may enter our key markets 
obtaining space and favorable placement on casino gaming floors is a competitive factor in our industry 
competitors with a larger installed base of gaming machines than ours have an advantage in retaining the most space and best positions in casinos 
these competitors may also have the advantage of being able to convert their installed machines to newer models in order to maintain their share of casino floor space 
in addition  some of our competitors have developed and sell or otherwise provide to customers wide area progressive systems or centralized player tracking and accounting systems which allow operators to accumulate accounting and performance data about the operation of gaming devices 
we have just begun to offer a proprietary wide area progressive system and do not offer a centralized player tracking and accounting system 
the gaming industry is sensitive to declines in the public acceptance of gaming that may lead to the passage of laws to significantly increase gaming taxes or outlaw gaming in affected jurisdictions 
the gaming industry can be affected by public opinion of gaming 
in the event that there is a decline in public acceptance of gaming  either through unfavorable legislation affecting the introduction of gaming into emerging markets  or through legislative and regulatory changes  including tax increases  in existing gaming markets  our ability to continue to sell and lease our games in those markets and jurisdictions would be adversely affected 
recent tax structure changes and rate increases in two jurisdictions have made gaming in general  and specifically participation games  less profitable in those jurisdictions 
we cannot assure you that public opinion will continue to support legalized gaming 
if we do not effectively operate our manufacturing processes  we may not be able to fulfill customers orders and may incur charges to earnings 
our manufacturing process is impacted by our ability to procure raw materials from our suppliers on a timely basis  effectively manage raw materials during the manufacturing process  accurately configure orders for gaming devices to customers specifications  efficiently utilize our manufacturing capacity  manufacture a quality product with minimal defects and warranty issues  and deliver gaming devices to our customers on time 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to fulfill customers orders timely or at the highest level of quality  and as a result customers could cancel orders and we may incur charges to earnings 
we face risks associated with doing business in foreign markets related to political and economic instability and related foreign currency fluctuations 
we seek to grow through increasing our presence in foreign markets 
potential political and economic instability in foreign markets may adversely affect our ability to enter into or continue to do business in these markets 
unstable governments and changes in current legislation may affect the gaming market with respect to gaming regulation  taxation  and the legality of gaming in some markets 
in addition  fluctuations in foreign exchange rates  tariffs and other barriers may further impede our success in foreign markets 
we cannot assure you that foreign markets will remain politically and economically stable enough to continue as a potential source of revenues and profit to us 
if we do not realize the value of licensed technology commitments  we may incur charges to earnings 
we have entered into several agreements to license intellectual property related to alternative solutions as part of our technology improvement plan that  as of june   had a total potential commitment of million 
if we determine that we may not realize the value of any of the commitments  we would record an immediate charge against earnings up to the full amount of these commitments in the period in which such determination is made 
if we do not realize the value of licensed intellectual property and royalty commitments  we may incur charges to earnings 
we have entered into several agreements to license intellectual property and royalties related to new game development  including an individual license which generated over of our consolidated revenue in fiscal at june   we had a total potential commitment of million  including million of licensed technology commitments 
if we determine that we may not realize the value of any of the commitments  we would record an immediate charge against earnings up to the full amount of these commitments in the period in which such determination is made 
we may have conflicts of interest with midway games inc four of our ten directors  including louis j 
nicastro  our chairman of the board  are directors of midway games inc  our former subsidiary 
tax related agreements remain in effect between midway and wms 
in addition  sumner redstone who owns of our common stock and is our largest stockholder also owns a controlling interest of approximately of midway 
as several of our directors have responsibilities to both entities  conflicts between us and midway may arise  the resolution of which may be less than optimal for us 
sumner redstone owns or controls of our outstanding common stock  and he may dispose of all or a portion of his stock at any time  which could cause our stock price to decrease 
sumner redstone beneficially owns million shares  or  of our common stock  as reported in a form  filed by mr 
redstone with the sec on august  during june and july of  mr 
redstone reported that he entered into five forward transactions under which he will sell million shares of our common stock in several traunches beginning in march and ending in october these transactions  if completed  will reduce his ownership to of our outstanding common stock by october in august  mr 
redstone sold million shares of our common stock in open market transactions 
mr 
redstone could sell any or all of his remaining shares at any time on the open market or to a person who wishes to acquire control of wms 
such a sale may require prior regulatory approval 
we cannot assure you that any such person would agree with our strategy and business goals described in this report 
sales by mr 
redstone of a large number of shares would likely have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
the use of our rights plan or blank check preferred stock would inhibit the acquisition of wms or have a dilutive effect on our stock 
rights plan 
under our rights plan  each share of our common stock has an accompanying right to purchase convertible preferred stock that permits each holder to purchase shares of our common stock at half price 
the rights become exercisable if any person or entity who at the time of the adoption of the rights plan did not own or more of our common stock subsequently acquires beneficial ownership of or more of our common stock without approval of our board of directors 
we can redeem the rights at 
per right  subject to specified conditions  at any time 
the rights expire in april our board of directors could use this agreement as an anti takeover device to discourage  delay or prevent a change in control 
the use of our rights plan may dilute our common stock 
blank check preferred stock 
our certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of five million shares of preferred stock with designations  rights and preferences that may be determined from time to time by the board of directors 
accordingly  our board has broad power  without stockholder approval  to issue preferred stock with dividend  liquidation  conversion  voting or other rights that could adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the holders of our common stock 
our board of directors could use preferred stock to discourage  delay or prevent a change in control 
our board has no current plans  agreements or commitments to issue any shares of preferred stock 
the existence of the blank check preferred stock  however  could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
the substantial number of shares of common stock available for sale in the future could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
we have million authorized shares of common stock 
as of august   million shares were issued  including million shares held in treasury 
on that date  we also had outstanding options to purchase an aggregate of million shares of our common stock issuable at an average exercise price of per share and outstanding warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock issuable at an exercise price of per share 
if all of our issued and outstanding stock options and warrants were exercised as of that date  million shares of our common stock would be outstanding 
if the holders of our convertible subordinated notes converted all of the notes  million additional shares of our common stock would be issued 
if all of the notes were converted to common stock and all of the outstanding options and warrants were exercised  million shares would still be available for issuance 
our board of directors has broad discretion to issue authorized but unissued shares  including discretion to issue shares in compensatory and acquisition transactions 
in addition  if we seek financing through the sale of our securities  our then current stockholders may suffer dilution in their percentage ownership of our common stock 
the future issuance  or even the potential issuance  of shares at a price below the then current market price may have a depressive effect on the future market price of our common stock

no cash dividends were declared or paid on our common stock during fiscal or the payment of future cash dividends will depend upon  among other things  our earnings  anticipated expansion and capital requirements and financial condition 
we do not expect to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
we have agreed to make additional payments of interest on our convertible subordinated notes if we declare a cash dividend on our common stock 
the amount of the payments will be equal to the cash dividends that would be payable to the holders of the notes if the holders had converted their notes into shares of our common stock on the record date for the dividend 
however  no such payment will be made if the dividend that would otherwise trigger the payment causes an adjustment to the note conversion rate 
our loan agreement requires that we maintain a minimum amount of tangible net worth and certain financial ratio covenants which could limit our ability to declare dividends or make any distribution to holders of any shares of capital stock  or redeem or otherwise acquire such shares of the our company 
as of june   approximately million was available for such distributions under the most restrictive of these covenants

the purpose of each of the plans is to encourage our employees and  under some of the plans  non employee directors  consultants and advisors to acquire an ownership interest in our common stock and to enable these individuals to realize benefits from an increase in the value of our common stock 
we believe that this benefit provides these individuals with greater incentive to work to improve our business and encourages their continued provision of services to us and  generally  promotes our interests and those of our stockholders

overview our historical product sales strength has been in the multi line  multi coin video product line  which  together with our vlt product  accounted for substantially all of our new product sales for the past three fiscal years 
an element of our strategy is to become a full service gaming device provider to casinos by developing and obtaining regulatory approval for three additional product lines mechanical reel games  video poker games  and wide area progressive wap jackpot systems 
we believe these new product lines account for approximately of the typical casino slot floor and represent a significant market share growth opportunity for us 
as a result of software anomalies that were present in our legacy operating system that ran our gaming devices  in january  we began to execute a technology improvement plan to first stabilize and then modernize our operating system software 
customers were apprised of this technology improvement plan and our intention to introduce our new bluebird gaming cabinet and new cpu nxt computer circuit board and operating system that would provide features and functionality that our earlier products lacked 
as a result  since january  our product sales revenues have declined from levels experienced in fiscal as we have received regulatory approvals throughout fiscal for our new cpu nxt computer circuit board and operating system  new bluebird cabinet and new games from each of the six north american gaming labs  our product sales revenues have increased  and we expect that they will continue to grow as we receive additional approvals and ship our new games to more jurisdictions 
the most significant accomplishment for us in fiscal was the receipt of necessary regulatory approvals from the six north american gaming labs for our new video and mechanical reel platform  which positioned us to launch our new products and re launch the company 
heading into fiscal  we had dramatically changed the manner in which we dealt with the regulatory agencies 
through this new focus we were able to garner  on schedule  substantially all of the approvals  which included gaming lab and field trial requirements for the new operating systems and gaming cabinets for both our video and mechanical reel products  alternative peripheral equipment approvals and ticket in ticket out cashless gaming system approvals 
with these approvals now in hand  we expect fiscal  and will mark a period during which we expand our market share on casino floors due to the launch of our new video  wap and poker products and the impending shipment of our first mechanical reel products 
technology improvement plan in the first phase of our three part technology improvement plan  we improved the stability of our operating system by introducing two software upgrades  version for hopper based games which pay out in coins and version for printer based games which pay out in printed tickets 
version has been approved by all six of the north american gaming labs  and we were required to and completed an upgrade of our hopper game operating system to version in four jurisdictions 
gaming laboratories international  inc gli has recently required us to complete an upgrade of hopper based games to version by december for all the jurisdictions that it covers 
the gli lab tests product for all of the native american casinos and the midwest riverboat casinos  among others  where in the aggregate we believe about of our existing gaming devices are deployed 
other jurisdictions may require upgrades in the future 
version is available in other jurisdictions as an optional upgrade 
gli approved version  our printer upgrade version  in march the nevada gaming authorities approved version in september we have installed version in several riverboat and native american casinos  which use gli  and will be upgrading all of our printer gaming machines installed in casinos in nevada and gli to version 
nevada and gli are currently the only jurisdictions requiring all printer games be upgraded to version 
other jurisdictions may require upgrades in the future  and version is available in other approved jurisdictions as an optional upgrade 
the second phase of our technology improvement plan consisted of the development  approval and introduction of our new cpu nxt computer circuit board and operating system 
the commercial version of cpu nxt was approved by gli in september when we also received gli approval for nine game themes on this new system 
we subsequently received regulatory approvals from the other five north american gaming labs 
we also have received ticket in ticket out approvals and alternative peripheral equipment approvals from most north american gaming labs 
we are evaluating specifications and requirements and acquiring intellectual property rights for an even more advanced gaming system that will be developed during the third phase of the technology improvement plan 
we continue to refine the design and specifications to incorporate additional features we desire for this platform and continue to allocate resources to this longer term effort 
bluebird and cpu nxt commercialization our focus in the near term is to refresh our existing installed base of more than  video gaming devices in casinos through either replacement with new bluebird video gaming devices or through cpu nxt upgrade kits 
we received the first approval from gli for the marketable version of the bluebird video cabinet at the end of november we have now received approvals from the other five north american gaming labs 
each gaming lab approval of the cpu nxt operating system also allows us to submit new games designed for use with that system to the regulators for approval  which enables us to sell and ship additional bluebird video gaming devices and cpu nxt upgrade kits 
by september  we expect to have the approvals for all hardware peripheral options  such as alternative coin handling  printing and bill accepting equipment 
customer acceptance of bluebird video gaming devices and our new game themes continues to be very favorable 
since we started selling bluebird video gaming devices in september  we have executed corporate agreements or issued sales orders for  bluebird video gaming devices and cpu nxt kits  addressing roughly of the  plus wms legacy video gaming devices in casinos 
through june    of these orders had been shipped  or approximately of the  wms legacy gaming devices 
these corporate agreements are with multi jurisdictional casino operators such as harrah s  argosy  ameristar  boyd  caesar s  stations  majestic star  pinnacle  aztar  mandalay bay and isle of capri  along with a number of tribal and individual casino properties 
we expect order levels to continue at a strong pace now that the first bluebird video gaming devices and new game themes are generating strong performance data  and we have all necessary regulatory approvals 
we also expect strength in game conversion revenues over the next several quarters  as operators see the value and performance benefits of our cpu nxt upgrade kits and printer upgrades 
product line expansion plan in january  we received nevada regulatory approval for our new mechanical reel product and three new game themes  including two wide area progressive system game themes and one for sale game theme 
we received gli approval for our mechanical reel product and three new game themes in march we have now received regulatory approvals for the mechanical reel operating system and the modifications for the bluebird gaming cabinet in all six of the north american gaming labs 
after receiving customer feedback  however  we delayed the launch of this product line until september in order to be able to offer six initial game themes at once 
we believe it is prudent for us to cluster six new titles together to successfully launch this important new product line 
in nevada  we expect to complete field trials and receive approvals of the ticket in ticket out systems on the mechanical reel spinning product in time for this important product launch 
for our new poker products  our first poker game  way action  was approved by gli in june  and we shipped our first game to customers in gli territories in july we expect to receive approvals from the other five gaming labs in the september quarter 
in may  we received nevada gaming control board approval and nevada gaming commission approvals for our wap 
we launched the product in nevada in late may  one month earlier than our original expectation 
we received gli approval for our new progressive jackpot system also in may and launched the product in two native american casinos in june brand licenses during the september quarter  we extended our agreement with hasbro  inc for the use of their monopoly brand through calendar year as a result of the extension  we intend to continue to devote development efforts and intellectual property to the monopoly brand in the coming years 
we launched five new monopoly themed participation games in fiscal including our first proprietary wap system featuring the monopoly money progressive jackpot 
in the march quarter  we launched the fifth game in the hollywood squares themed series of participation games called tour of stars  and in july  we launched the sixth game in the series  prize spin 
in september  we announced our agreement with sony pictures consumer products to develop  market and distribute men in black branded games 
we introduced this new series of participation games in our new bluebird cabinet in june we launched match game tm as a hybrid game in our new bluebird cabinet in july match game will be the first game in our new classic tv game show series of hybrid games 
in october  we entered into an exclusive agreement to develop  market and distribute games using the lottery brand powerball that we are developing as a wide area progressive game for launch in the fall of class ii gaming effective april   we executed an agreement with multimedia to expand and extend our relationship to address opportunities in class ii  charitable gaming and tribal instant lottery gaming markets 
through this new two year agreement  multimedia will license additional wms game themes  and we will serve as multimedia s primary original equipment manufacturer of gaming cabinets 
the expanded relationship will address the native american class ii  emerging charitable gaming markets and certain compacted markets including washington state and oklahoma  if legislation permitting gaming is enacted throughout north america as well as california tribal instant lottery game c tilg opportunities 
additionally  the companies will jointly pursue central determinant based video lottery markets outside of north america 
this expanded relationship combines multimedia s leadership in central determination gaming technology with our game content strengths and gaming cabinet manufacturing expertise to fully leverage multimedia s industry leading market share in class ii gaming markets 
pursuant to the terms of the agreement  we will license to multimedia our extensive game content library  including branded participation games  for exclusive placement subject to our existing commitments in multimedia s central determination system based venues offering class ii  washington state class iii  charity  and c tilg products 
multimedia has agreed to purchase a specified minimum number of game licenses annually during the two year term of the agreement 
additionally  multimedia will purchase minimum quantities of our new gaming cabinets for placement in the above noted markets in the form of either legacy cabinets or our bluebird gaming cabinet  including slim line versions of both cabinet styles 
critical accounting policies revenue recognition the application of revenue recognition policies is critical due to the nature of product sales contracts entered into during fiscal we record revenue on product sales  net of rebates  discounts and allowances  when persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  the sales price is fixed or determinable  the product is delivered and collectibility is reasonably assured 
when multiple product deliverables are included under a sales contract  we allocate revenue to each product based upon their respective fair values against the total contract value and defer revenue recognition on those deliverables where we have not met all requirements of revenue recognition 
gaming operations revenues under operating type lease agreements are estimated and recognized as earned when collectibility is reasonably assured 
lease agreements are based on either a pre determined percentage of the daily net win of each gaming machine or a fixed daily rental fee 
wap revenues are recognized based upon a percentage of amounts wagered  called coin in  on each gaming machine and are recognized as earned when collectibility is reasonably assured 
under agreements with licensees who are generally located in geographic areas or operate in markets where we are not active  we are paid royalties based upon our licensees purchase or placement of gaming devices with our licensed themes  artwork and other intellectual property 
royalties are recorded as earned when collectibility is reasonably assured 
the application of this policy affects the level of our sales revenue  cost of product sold  accounts receivable  deferred revenue and accrued expenses 
in fiscal  and  we had no material changes in the critical accounting estimates arising from the application of this policy 
income tax accounting we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method 
under this method  income taxes are provided for amounts currently payable and for amounts deferred as tax assets and liabilities based upon differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities 
deferred income taxes are measured using the enacted tax rates that are assumed will be in effect when the differences reverse 
at june   we had million of research and development tax credit carry forwards expiring from through  million of foreign tax credit carry forwards expiring from through  million of state net operating loss carry forwards expiring from through  million of federal net operating loss carry forwards expiring in and and million of foreign net operating loss with unlimited carry forward 
at june   we believe it is more likely than not that we will realize substantially all of the benefit of these net deferred tax assets  including the net operating loss carry forwards and research and development tax credit carry forwards 
accordingly  we only provided a minimal valuation allowance against these deferred tax assets 
in determining the level of required valuation allowance  we considered the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
however  additional valuation allowances could be recorded against these deferred tax assets and charged against income in future periods if our future estimates of amounts realizable are reduced or if the timing of such realization extends beyond our current expectations 
the application of this policy affects the level of our tax expense  current income tax receivables and liabilities  and current and non current deferred tax assets and liabilities 
in fiscal  and  we had no material changes in the critical accounting estimates arising from the application of this policy 
inventory obsolescence we value inventory based on estimates of potentially excess and obsolete inventory after considering forecasted demand and forecasted average selling prices 
however  forecasts are subject to revisions  cancellations and rescheduling 
in fiscal  we introduced a new gaming platform  and it is reasonably possible that this will accelerate the obsolescence of existing product lines 
in addition  demand for parts inventory is subject to technical obsolescence 
inventory on hand in excess of forecasted demand is written down to net realizable value 
actual demand may differ from anticipated demand  and such differences may have a material effect on our financial statements 
the application of this policy affects the level of our inventory and cost of product sales 
in fiscal  and we had no material changes in the critical accounting estimates arising from the application of this policy 
participation gaming machine depreciation historically  we depreciated our legacy participation gaming machines and top boxes over a two year useful life to a small salvage value 
we introduced our new bluebird cabinet participation games in june we are depreciating the bluebird gaming devices over three years with a small salvage value  and the top box over one year 
a material adverse impact could occur if the actual useful life of the participation games or top boxes is less than what was used in estimating depreciation expense  or if actual salvage value is less than the anticipated salvage value 
the application of this policy affects the level of our gaming operations machines  accumulated depreciation on gaming operations machines and depreciation expense 
in fiscal  and  we had no material changes in the critical accounting estimates arising from the application of this policy  and the depreciable life for the bluebird product will not have a material impact on our financial statements in fiscal intellectual property valuation we license intellectual property from third parties that we use in some of our games and gaming machines 
in addition  we have licensed technologies from third parties 
as part of our contracts with the licensors  we typically provide a guaranteed minimum and prepayment of royalties and license fees  usually at the time the contract is signed  even though the product may not be introduced until months or years later 
we capitalize the prepaid royalty and license fees as other assets 
at june   the minimum guaranteed royalty payments totaled million  including million of minimum commitments for licensed technology  of which million has been paid and the balance is payable over various periods up to five years 
in addition  the contracts provide for an additional million of contingent royalty payments based upon future events occurring 
total prepaid royalties at june  were million of which million is in other current assets and million is in other assets 
when the products using the licensed intellectual property or technology begin to generate revenue  we begin amortization of the amount advanced 
in cases where the advance represents a paid up license  the advance is amortized based on the estimated life of the asset 
in those cases where the license agreement provides for a royalty to be earned by the licensor for each gaming device sold or placed on a lease  the advance is amortized based on the royalty rates provided in the license agreement 
in both cases the amortization of the advances are included in cost of product sales if related to a product sale or cost of gaming operations if related to placement or lease of gaming operations 
to the extent that we determine that the products developed would not fully recover the guaranteed minimum amounts  we would record an immediate charge against earnings at the time of such determination 
the application of this policy affects the level of our current assets  non current assets  cost of products sales and cost of gaming operations 
in fiscal  we expensed million pre tax related to an estimated impairment of the survivor intellectual property license  and we recorded a pre tax write down of approximately million  to reduce the carrying value of survivor inventory to net realizable value 
in addition  in fiscal  we announced that we would allow our agreement  with stargames corporation pty ltd 
for exclusive north american distributorship rights to their rapid roulette table gaming product  to expire 
we encountered several significant obstacles in bringing this product to market  including regulatory  technical  and customer acceptance issues 
as a result of the expiration of the agreement  we recorded a non cash pre tax charge of million  or million after tax in fiscal to write down rapid roulette inventory to net realizable value and write off distribution rights assets 
in fiscal and  we had no material changes in the critical accounting estimates arising from the application of this policy 
licensed technology valuation as part of our technology improvement plan  as discussed above  we have pursued alternative strategies for each phase of our plan  including licensing technologies from third parties 
at june   our minimum guaranteed payments related to technology alternatives totaled million  which had been paid as advances  and million has been expensed  with an additional million of contingent royalty payments subject to future events 
if we determine that we will not realize the value of the guaranteed commitment for a particular licensed technology alternative  we will record an immediate charge against earnings  at the time of our determination  of up to million if all of the alternatives were to have no further value to us 
the application of this policy affects the level of our non current assets  research and development expense and selling and general expense 
as part of our technology improvement plan  we have pursued alternative strategies for each phase of the plan  including licensing technologies from third parties 
as a result of our successful implementation of upgrades to our legacy platform in  we determined that we no longer intended to use an alternative operating system  which was originally licensed  among other uses  to serve as a back up during the short term phase of the plan 
accordingly  in fiscal  we recorded a pre tax charge of million  or million after tax to write off this license agreement obligation 
in fiscal and  we had no material changes in the critical accounting estimates arising from the application of this policy 
accrued liabilities we accrue expenses related to employee benefits  software anomalies  litigation and other contingencies based upon our best estimates of the costs that are probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable 
these estimates are updated monthly based on current information 
however  changes in estimates or actual expenses may exceed accrued amounts 
the application of this policy affects the level of our current liabilities  research and development expense and selling and general expense 
in fiscal  and  we had no material changes in the critical accounting estimates arising from the application of this policy 
recently issued accounting standards in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas no 
affects the classification  measurement and disclosure requirements of the following three types of freestanding financial instruments  mandatory redeemable shares  which the issuing company is obligated to buy back with cash or other assets  instruments that do or may require the issuer to buy back some of its shares in exchange for cash or other assets  which includes put options and forward purchase contracts  and obligations that can be settled with shares  the monetary value of which is fixed  tied solely or predominately to a variable such as a market index  or varies inversely with the value of the issuer s shares 
in general  sfas no 
is effective for all financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  the adoption of sfas no 
did not have an impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  cash flows or related disclosures 
in december  the fasb issued a revision to sfas no 
 employers disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits 
this statement revises the requirements for employers disclosures about pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
the statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we have two frozen defined benefit pension plans related to former businesses that we have previously accounted for as discontinued operations 
we adopted sfas no 
effective january  and such adoption did not have an impact on our disclosures as the provisions of sfas no 
indicate it should not be applied to immaterial amounts 
in march  the fasb published an exposure draft  share based payment  an amendment of fasb statement and 
this proposed standard would impact the accounting for stock based payments 
the standard  which is proposed to be effective for fiscal years beginning after december   would require that we recognize an expense for our stock based payment programs  including stock options 
we are currently evaluating the provisions of this proposed standard to determine its impact on our future financial statements if adopted 
off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations we are not dependent on off balance sheet financing arrangements to fund our operations 
we utilize financing arrangements for operating leases of equipment and facilities  none of which are in excess of our current needs 
we also have minimum guaranteed royalty payments for intellectual property used in our gaming machines that are not recorded on our balance sheet 
typically  we are obligated to make minimum guaranteed royalty payments over the term of our license and to advance payment against those guarantees 
the licensor typically has the right to inspect and approve any use of the licensed property 
in addition  each license typically provides that the licensor retains the right to exploit the licensed property for all other purposes  including the right to license the property for use with any products not related to gaming machines 
our obligations under these arrangements and under our convertible subordinated notes  at june   were as follows payment due by period in millions less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years operating leases royalty payments  excluding contingent payments convertible subordinated notes other  including guaranteed minimums in employment agreements total the total potential royalty commitments  including payments already made and those contingent upon future events  increased from million at june  to million at june  due to new and amended brand licensing agreements 
potential royalty commitments could continue to increase in the future as we enter into new brand licensing agreements 
we do not have any special purpose entities for investment or the conduct of our operations 
we have not entered into any derivative financial instruments  although we have granted stock options and restricted stock to our employees  officers  directors and consultants and warrants to a licensor  and we have issued convertible subordinated notes 
we do not currently have any significant firm purchase commitments for raw material inventory 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity as of june  june  increase decrease in millions total cash  cash equivalents and short term investments total current assets total assets total current liabilities long term debt stockholders equity net working capital our sources of liquidity for the year ended june  were existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  million cash received from the issuance of additional convertible subordinated notes in july  non cash expenses of million more than offsetting our net loss of million  and proceeds from stock option exercises of million  excluding related tax benefits 
we believe that cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of million at june   inclusive of million of restricted cash  will be adequate to fund our anticipated level of expenses  capital expenditures  cash to be invested in gaming operations machines  and the levels of inventories and receivables required in the operation of our business 
for the next twelve months  we do not expect to be dependent on cash flow from operations and we do not expect to borrow any money under our revolving credit line 
in fiscal  and  we expect cash flow from operations to increase significantly as we seek to increase our market share in our new product lines mechanical reel  poker and wide area progressive systems 
we do not believe we will need to raise additional capital in the short term or long term  however we will assess market opportunities as they arise 
we renegotiated our unused line of credit for million under a revolving credit agreement for a new one year term to may  we did not borrow any amounts on our line of credit during fiscal or our short term investments primarily consist of auction market preferred stocks stated at cost  which approximates market value 
these investments generally have no fixed maturity date but most have dividend reset dates every days or longer 
these investments can be liquidated under an auction process on the dividend reset dates subject to a sufficient number of bids being submitted 
our policy is to invest cash with issuers that have high credit ratings and to limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
during fiscal  our net working capital increased primarily due to proceeds received from the issuance of million of additional convertible subordinated notes in july accounts and notes receivable  net  increased by million due to higher new unit sales levels during fiscal inventory at june  increased by million due to higher levels of raw materials as we prepared for an increasing volume of business and growth in the installed base of gaming operations machines 
royalty advances increased by million due to new technology and brand license agreements we entered into or amended during fiscal income tax receivables decreased by million primarily due to receipt of prior year tax refunds 
current liabilities increased by million due to higher accounts payable reflecting higher inventory levels  partially offset by our payment to midway games inc midway of a million advance 
we have not experienced significant bad debt expense in any of the periods presented 
we expect to continue to invest in working capital through fiscal and albeit at a slower growth rate than we experienced in fiscal due to our operating losses in fiscal and  we have recorded million and million of current income tax receivables on our balance sheets as of june  and june   respectively 
this tax receivable is based on our ability to receive tax refunds from applying our fiscal and tax losses against prior years income and for refunds of tax payments made in fiscal and we also have million of deferred tax assets on our balance sheet as of june   an increase of million from june  these represent taxable temporary differences expected to reverse in future years  and tax credits and tax operating losses generated in fiscal and that can be claimed on future income tax returns to reduce current tax due in those years 
we believe it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefits of these deferred tax assets 
we made this determination primarily based on our projection of future taxable income which we believe will be sufficient to allow us to realize these deferred tax assets 
on this basis  we have provided a minimal valuation allowance related to realizability of such assets as of june  however  additional valuation allowances could be recorded against these deferred tax assets and charged against income in future periods if our future estimates of amounts realizable are reduced or if the timing of such realization extends beyond our current expectations 
we have no material commitments for capital expenditures at june  we utilize financing arrangements for operating leases of regional office facilities and for some equipment 
we have royalty commitments for brand and technology licenses that are not recorded in our balance sheet 
our total potential royalty commitments  including payments of million contingent upon future events  increased from million at june  to million at june   of which million has been paid 
please refer to the table under off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations above and note to our consolidated financial statements 
in june  we issued million of convertible subordinated notes bearing interest at maturing on july  in july  we issued an additional million of convertible subordinated notes under identical terms to cover an over allotment option granted to the initial purchasers of the notes 
the notes are convertible at any time into an aggregate of million shares of our common stock at a conversion price of per share  subject to adjustment 
the notes are not callable 
we pay interest on the notes semi annually on january and july of each year aggregating million annually  which commenced on january  conversion of the convertible subordinated notes into shares of common stock would reduce our annual interest expense 
the conversion of the convertible subordinated notes to common stock is dependent on individual holders choices to convert  which is dependent on the spread of the market price of our stock above the conversion strike price of per share 
none of the holders have converted any of their convertible subordinated notes into our common stock 
capital resources the following table summarizes our sources and uses of cash for the periods shown in millions of dollars for the fiscal year ended june  increase decrease cash provided used by operating activities investing activities financing activities effect of exchange rates on cash increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents cash used by operating activities was million for fiscal  as compared to cash provided of million for fiscal the current year s decrease relative to the comparable prior year was due to an increase of million of cash invested in operating assets and liabilities due to growth of our business  compared to a decrease of million of cash invested in operating assets and liabilities in fiscal depreciation expense totalled million for fiscal  as compared to million for fiscal we anticipate cash to be provided by operations over the next twelve months  due to anticipated higher revenues from increased new unit sales  partially offset by higher research and development expenses related to the ongoing execution of our technology improvement plan  product approval costs  product line expansion costs and increased game offerings  as well as higher selling and administrative costs due to the execution of the re emergence plan 
in addition  we expect in fiscal and fiscal that our cash invested in operating assets and liabilities will not continue to increase at the rate experienced in fiscal components of the million increase and million decrease in net investment in operating assets and liabilities for fiscal and  respectively  are as follows in millions of dollars for the year ended june  increase decrease changes in operating assets and liabilities decrease increase in operating assets restricted cash accounts and notes receivable income tax receivable raw material and finished goods inventories other current assets all other operating assets increase in operating liabilities current liabilities net decrease increase in operating assets and liabilities for fiscal  the million increase in accounts and notes receivable reflects an increasing trend in new unit sales  and slightly extended payment terms  while inventories increased million as we prepared for an increased volume of business and growth in the installed base of gaming operations machines 
the decrease in income tax receivable was primarily due to receipt of prior year tax refunds 
the increase in other current assets is primarily due to million of the current portion of royalty advances for new technology and brand license agreements entered into or amended during fiscal and million of additional current deferred tax assets 
the million increase in all other operating assets was due to increases in non current deferred tax assets and increases in non current royalty advances for new technology and brand license agreements entered into or amended during fiscal the increase of current liabilities is due to higher accounts payable reflecting higher inventory levels  partially offset by our payment to midway of a million tax advance 
for fiscal  the decrease in income taxes receivable was due to receipt of prior years refunds 
the decrease in inventories reflects lower sales levels and activity during the period 
the cash invested in all other operating assets was primarily due to a million increase in long term royalty advances due to new and amended technology and brand license agreements entered into during fiscal the increase of current liabilities was due to the midway tax advance  partially offset by a slightly lower level of business 
cash used by investing activities was million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
cash used for the purchase of property  plant and equipment for fiscal was million compared with million for the comparable prior year 
we are currently planning an expansion of our technology campus or the purchase and renovation of additional space in fiscal and an expansion of our waukegan manufacturing facility that will begin in fiscal however  on an overall expenditure basis  we do not anticipate any significant changes in the general trend of our capital expenditures for property  plant and equipment in fiscal  or cash used for additions to gaming operation machines was million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
the current period investment in gaming operation machines is lower because we have delayed investment until we received regulatory approval for new participation games installed in our new bluebird cabinet 
we expect this investment to increase in fiscal  and as we roll out new participation games installed in our bluebird cabinet 
net cash of million was provided by the net redemption of short term investments for fiscal  compared to million provided by the redemption of such investments in the comparable prior year 
presently  we do not anticipate any significant changes in the general trend of the redemption of investments during fiscal  and cash provided by financing activities was million for fiscal compared with cash provided of million for the prior year 
we received net cash of million in july from the exercise of the over allotment option relating to our convertible subordinated notes 
in june of  we received net cash of million from the offering of our convertible subordinated notes 
we also received million and million from the exercise of stock options in fiscal and  respectively 
the amount we receive from the exercise of stock options is dependent on individuals choices to exercise options  which are dependent on the spread of the market price of our stock above the strike price of vested options 
during fiscal  we repurchased million shares of our common stock for treasury for million 
in fiscal  we repurchased million shares of our common stock for an aggregate price of million  all of which was purchased in the quarter ended september  since the inception of our common stock repurchase programs in january through june   we purchased million or of our previously outstanding shares for an aggregate price of million  or per share

new unit sales increased by to  units  as we shipped our new bluebird video gaming devices after receiving regulatory approvals and as we offered a higher number of new game themes 
in fiscal  revenues from parts  used games  conversions and oem revenues increased compared to the prior fiscal year due to an increase of  units sold under oem agreements in the current fiscal year  and higher levels of game conversion revenues as we received approvals to sell our new games and conversion kits with the cpu nxt operating system over the last six months of fiscal the average sales price per new unit increased as higher priced bluebird units more than offset lower priced video lottery terminal sales during fiscal the average selling price of bluebird units was  in fiscal we expect continued growth in the average selling price over the next two quarters  as the percentage of bluebird units sold becomes a higher percentage of our overall sales mix 
the average installed base of participation gaming devices decreased to  units in fiscal from  units in fiscal  while the net revenue per day increased by per day from the prior fiscal year to per day as we continued to refresh the installed base with our new games 
the installed base declined from fiscal due to the fact that our legacy operating system does not support key features and functionality that casino operators demanded such as cashless gaming options  multi denomination and tokenization  and the performance of certain of our older participation series has decreased 
in january  the last survivor themed wide area progressive jackpot was terminated 
we expect growth in our installed base of participation games as we continue to install a new participation series  complete with cashless technology men in black on our new bluebird cabinet coupled with the launch of our first wide area progressive games in nevada and native american casinos 
gaming operations revenues benefited from a increase in royalty  vlts and other lease revenues in fiscal from fiscal  due to our licensees increased purchases or placement of wms games 
total gross profit increased to million for fiscal from million in fiscal while total gross margin was in fiscal compared to in fiscal higher margin gaming operations revenues were only of total revenues in fiscal  compared to of total revenues in fiscal due to the increase of new unit sales and an overall decline of gaming operations revenues in the current year 
the gross margin on product sales was for fiscal  up from in the prior year  reflecting higher margin on the mix of products sold 
we expect that the gross margin on the bluebird gaming devices will improve as production volume increases  because we should be able to obtain larger volume discounts from our suppliers  and we anticipate that the cost of electrical components will decrease over time 
the gross profit margin on gaming operations increased to in fiscal compared to in the prior fiscal year  as an increase in the average net revenue per day and higher royalties received from licensees was only partly offset by higher royalty rates payable to licensors 
fiscal operating results for gaming operations also included million of charges due to inventory write downs 
operating expenses in millions of dollars fiscal year ended june  as of as of increase revenue revenue decrease change research and development selling and administrative depreciation and amortization research and development expenses increased million  or to million in fiscal compared to million in the prior fiscal year  due to ongoing execution of our technology improvement plan  product approval costs  product line expansion costs and increased game offerings 
with higher regulatory approval costs and a greater number of product lines and game theme offerings planned throughout fiscal  we expect quarterly research and development expenses to continue to exceed levels in the comparable prior year quarters 
during fiscal  we introduced new games for sale and new participation games  and in fiscal we introduced new games for sale and new participation games 
selling and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  due to the ongoing execution of our re emergence plan and the implementation of an oracle resource planning system 
selling and administrative expense in fiscal included a million charge for the purchase of rights to restricted stock at a discount from market value and a million write off of rapid roulette distribution rights 
we expect that selling and administration expenses will increase as we continue to commercialize the cpu nxt operating system and bluebird cabinet  and continue our product line expansion efforts 
depreciation and amortization expense increased by million  due to additional property  plant and equipment additions  partially offset by the level of investment in gaming devices for gaming operations which was lower than in prior fiscal years as we awaited regulatory approvals for new games on bluebird cabinets 
we expect such investment to increase in fiscal as we roll out new participation games installed in our new bluebird cabinet  including our wide area progressive jackpot games 
we incurred an operating loss of million in fiscal  compared to an operating loss of million in fiscal the improved operating performance in fiscal resulted from the million increase in gross profit  partially offset by a million increase in research and development expenses and million increase in selling and administrative expenses 
we incurred interest expense of million in fiscal related to our convertible subordinated notes issued in june and july of this was partially offset by million of other income  primarily interest and investment income earned on cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  which at june  amounted to million 
our consolidated statement of operations for fiscal reflected a write off of a million tax advance to midway 
we have reclassified this amount from income tax expense to interest and other income and expense in this year s presentation of our consolidated statement of operations 
the write off was due to the uncertainty of the payback period from midway of the amount advanced 
the benefit for income taxes  which includes both current and deferred taxes  was at an effective tax rate of  largely due to a lower net loss and higher research and development  foreign tax credits  export sales  dividend investment income and foreign income in fiscal the effective income tax rate for fiscal was reflecting a benefit of million from a reduction in prior year taxes  which were less than amounts previously provided and the beneficial tax treatment of increased export sales  dividend investment income and increased research and development tax credits  offset by the impact of the non deductible advance to midway pursuant to tax sharing and separation agreements 
our net loss was million or per diluted share for the current fiscal year compared to net loss of million  or per diluted share  for the prior fiscal year 
fiscal year ended june  compared with fiscal year ended june  revenues  gross margins and key performance indicators in millions of dollars  except unit and gross margin data fiscal year ended june  increase decrease change product sales new unit sales revenue parts  used games  conversions  and oem revenue total product sales revenue total new units sold average sales price per new unit total oem units sold   na gross profit on product sales revenue gross margin on product sales revenue gaming operations participation revenue royalty  vlt and other lease revenue total gaming operations revenues average installed base installed base at period end net revenue per day per machine royalty  vlt lease and hybrid revenue gross profit on gaming operations revenue gross margin on gaming operations revenue total revenues total gross profit total gross margin total revenues increased million due to million in higher parts sales and oem revenue  partially offset by a million reduction in gaming operations revenue and a million reduction in new unit sales revenue 
we shipped  video and mechanical reel spinning games in fiscal  resulting in product sales revenues of million versus  gaming devices shipped and million of product sales revenues in fiscal gaming device sales were flat as higher sales to customers outside north america were offset by lower domestic sales  as we believe some customers delayed purchases until we introduced our new game platform and cabinet in fiscal the average sales price decreased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal  primarily due to a change in our mix of products sold 
parts  used games  oem and game conversion revenues  which are included in product sales revenues  increased in fiscal to million  compared to million in fiscal  due to higher parts sales and  oem units sold compared to none in fiscal the decrease in gaming operations revenue was due to a decrease in the average installed base of participation games to a total of  units in fiscal  compared to  units installed in fiscal  while the actual installed base declined from  units at june  to  units at june  we believe the decline in the installed base resulted from three factors 
first  in the first half of fiscal  the average net win of our participation games decreased and casino operators removed games as we were unable to obtain approvals for new games as gaming regulators reviewed upgrades to our legacy operating system 
second  we removed participation games from locations that had low net revenue per day 
third  the decline in the installed base resulted from our existing gaming platform not supporting key features and functionality that casino operators demanded  such as some cashless gaming options  multi denomination and tokenization  as well as an increasingly competitive environment 
for fiscal  the net revenue per day decreased to from 
total gross profit decreased by million to million for fiscal from million in fiscal while total gross margin was in fiscal compared to in fiscal higher margin gaming operations revenues were only of total revenues in fiscal  compared to in fiscal the gross margin on product sales increased from in fiscal to in fiscal due to higher production volumes and higher margin products representing a greater percentage of product sales revenue  partially offset by a decrease in the average sales price per unit 
the gross profit margin on gaming operations revenues decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal due to a million write down of survivor inventory  a million write down of rapid roulette inventory upon the expiration of the distribution agreement  higher royalty rates payable to licensors and the decrease in the average net revenue per day for participation games 
operating expenses in millions of dollars fiscal year ended june  as of as of increase revenue revenue decrease change research and development selling and administrative depreciation and amortization research and development expenses increased million  or  in fiscal to million from million in fiscal due to the ongoing execution of our technology improvement plan  while we prepared to expand our product offerings and increase the number of games we offered our customers 
the increase was due to increased headcount and higher engineering project and prototype expenditures  and included costs to adapt our games for distribution to international markets 
during fiscal  we introduced four new games for sale and six new participation games 
during fiscal  we introduced new games for sale and new participation games 
selling and administrative expenses increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the fiscal amount includes a million pre tax charge for the purchase of rights to restricted stock at a discount from market value  a million write off of the rapid roulette distribution rights and higher costs incurred related to our re emergence and the implementation of a new enterprise resource planning information system 
depreciation and amortization increased during fiscal to million from million in the prior fiscal year 
the increase in depreciation expense reflects higher depreciation on our recently renovated chicago technology campus  higher equipment cost per participation game unit  and increased depreciation on video lottery terminals under contract with state lotteries  partially offset by the decrease in the average installed base of participation games 
operating loss was million in fiscal  compared to operating income of million in the prior fiscal year 
the financial results of the current fiscal year reflect lower gross profit of million  including a million write down of survivor inventory and a million write down of rapid roulette inventory upon the expiration of the distribution agreement  million increase in research and development spending  and a million increase in selling and administrative expense  including a million charge from the costs associated with the purchase of rights to restricted stock at a discount from market and a million write off of the rapid roulette distribution rights 
the operating income for fiscal reflects million of employee separation costs 
our consolidated statement of operations for fiscal reflects a million tax advance to midway 
we have reclassified this amount from income tax expense to interest and other income and expense in this year s presentation of our consolidated statement of operations 
the write off was due to the uncertainty of the payback period from midway of the amount advanced 
the benefit for income taxes was million in fiscal  in contrast to a provision for income taxes of million in the prior fiscal year 
the benefit was due to the pre tax loss and a benefit of million from a reduction in fiscal taxes as compared to amounts previously provided  partially offset by a million provision stemming from the settlement of prior year income tax returns with the internal revenue service 
the effective tax rate was in fiscal  compared to in fiscal this effective tax rate reflects the beneficial tax treatment of increased export sales  dividend investment income and increased research and development tax credits offset by the impact of the non deductible advance to midway pursuant to tax sharing and separation agreements 
our net loss was million  or per diluted share  in fiscal  compared to net income of million  or per diluted share  in the prior fiscal year 
diluted shares outstanding decreased by  due to our repurchase of common stock outstanding 
impact of inflation during the past three years  the general level of inflation affecting us has been relatively low 
our ability to pass on future cost increases in the form of higher sales prices will depend on the prevailing competitive environment and the acceptance of our products in the marketplace 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to market risks in the ordinary course of our business  primarily associated with interest rate and foreign currency fluctuations 
we do not currently hedge either of these risks  or utilize financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes 
interest rate risk we have exposure to interest rate risk from our convertible subordinated notes and short term line of credit 
the notes are at a fixed rate and the short term line of credit is at a variable rate 
as of june   we had million of convertible fixed rate debt with an interest rate of and a fair value of million 
using a discounted cash flow model  and assuming no change in the market price of our common stock into which the debt is convertible  we currently estimate that a basis point change in the prevailing market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately million  but would not be material to our cash flows or future results of operations 
however  the fair value of our convertible fixed rate debt is more significantly dependent on the market price of our common stock into which it can be converted 
in may  we renewed a million day revolving line of credit to provide us with additional liquidity to meet our short term financing needs 
borrowings under this facility bear interest at a certain percentage above the agent s prime rate 
there were no outstanding borrowings under this facility as of june  foreign currency risk we have subsidiaries in spain  canada  south africa  united kingdom and australia for distribution and development operations 
these subsidiaries transact business in their respective foreign currencies and are exposed to risks resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
we estimate that a hypothetical strengthening or weakening of the us dollar for fiscal would have resulted in a pretax loss or gain of about million 
the net assets of these subsidiaries are exposed to foreign currency translation gains and losses  which are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders equity 
such translation resulted in unrealized gains losses of million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
in addition  foreign governments could impose restrictions on currency movements that might make it costly or impossible to repatriate earnings to the us
