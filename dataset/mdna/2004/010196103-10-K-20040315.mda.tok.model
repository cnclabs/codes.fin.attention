item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview since our inception in january  we have been engaged in the development of hemodialysis products and services for patients suffering from esrd 
we have developed an automated personal hemodialysis system  known as the aksys phd personal hemodialysis system the phd system  which is designed to enable patients to perform frequent hemodialysis at alternate sites such as their own homes and to thereby improve clinical outcomes  reduce total esrd treatment costs and enhance the quality of life of patients 
during the quarter ended september   we commenced commercial activities and are no longer considered to be in the development stage 
we have not been profitable since we commenced operations and we expect to incur additional losses in the foreseeable future 
on march   we announced receipt of fda clearance to market the phd system in the united states 
the fda clearance had no restrictions and included authorization to use the product in the home 
the fda required k clearance prior to the commercialization of the phd system in the united states 
on october   we announced receipt of ec certification for ce mark approval pursuant to the medical device directive of the european economic area 
the certification approved the phd system for home use 
such approval was required prior to the commercialization of the phd system in the european economic area 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition  and its related interpretations 
revenue is recognized when the following conditions exist there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the product has been delivered and installed or services and supplies have been provided to the customer  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
during the quarter ended september   we adopted emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  which did not have an impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
we recognize revenue from product sales at the time of installation of the phd system 
services and supplies are sold to customers in a monthly service agreement  not dependent on service time incurred or materials used 
services and supplies revenue is recognized uniformly over the term of the agreement 
we also lease the phd system to customers on a short term basis months or less and long term basis up to months and recognize revenue on these contracts on a straight line basis over the lease term 
we have no contracts with distributors and sell our product directly to our customers through our own sales force 
accrued liabilities and contingencies we are required to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts recorded as accrued liabilities and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors such as changing business conditions and management expectations  that we believe to be reasonable to determine the amount of accrued liabilities and contingencies to be recorded 
if actual results differ from these estimates  additional expenses might be recorded 
net deferred tax assets valuation we record our net deferred tax assets in the amount that we expect to realize based on projected future taxable income 
in assessing the appropriateness of our valuation  assumptions and estimates are required such as our ability to generate future taxable income 
in the event that we were to determine that we would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase our income in the period such determination was made 
given our historical losses and uncertainty with respect to our ability to generate taxable income  we have established a full valuation allowance at december  and to reduce the net deferred tax asset to zero 
contractual obligations the following table reflects a summary of our contractual cash obligations as of december  contractual cash obligations total less than year years years operating leases    royalties purchase obligations total contractual cash obligations off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements  as such term is defined in recently enacted rules by the sec  that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors 
note on forward looking information certain statements in this annual report on form k and in future filings made by us with the securities and exchange commission and in our written and oral statements made by or with the approval of an officer of ours constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of  and we intend that such forward looking statements be subject to the safe harbors created thereby 
the words believes  expects  estimates  anticipates  and will be  and similar words or expressions identify forward looking statements made by us or on our behalf 
these forward looking statements reflect our views as of the date they are made with respect to future events and financial performance  but are subject to many uncertainties and factors that may cause our actual results to be materially different from any future results expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
factors that could cause such a difference include  but are not limited to  the following i uncertainty about the acceptance of the phd system by both potential users and purchasers  including without limitation patients  clinics and other health care providers  ii risks related to uncertain unit pricing and product cost  which may not be at levels that permit us to be profitable  iii market  regulatory  reimbursement and competitive conditions  iv risks related to a failure to meet additional development and manufacturing milestones  including  without limitation  cost reduction efforts  for the phd system on a timely basis  v our ability to obtain sufficient capital on acceptable terms to run our business  vi risks inherent in relying on a third party to manufacture the phd system  vii changes in qsr requirements  and viii risks related to the disposition of our common stock by durus life sciences master fund  ltd 
and its affiliates 
the forward looking statements made in this report speak only as of the date that they are made 
we do not undertake to publicly update or revise our forward looking statements even if experience or future changes make it clear that any projected results or events expressed or implied therein will not be realized 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  net loss for the year ended december  was million per share  compared with million per share  for the year ended december  our cost to manufacture the phd system exceeds its selling price  and our cost to service and supply active machines on a per unit basis exceeds the per unit revenue generated by those machines 
the first full year in which we recorded sales was as volumes increased from seven active machines at year end to active machines at year end  our net loss also increased 
we completed cost reductions to the phd system in late that reduced the cost of the machine from approximately  to approximately  we plan to reduce the cost to below the selling price of approximately  by the end of we expect to rely primarily on reductions in the production and service costs of the phd system in order to realize a positive gross margin on sales 
we continue to work diligently to achieve manufacturing and service cost reductions on the phd system 
however  no assurance can be given that such cost reduction plans or efforts will be successful  or that we will be able to achieve a positive gross margin on product sales or service of the phd system in the future 
additional details as to our financial performance are discussed below 
clinic partnership agreements 
we added clinic partnership agreements in the year ended december   bringing the total number of signed partnership agreements to a typical clinic relationship may include an initial market assessment of the phd system and allows a clinic to lease phd systems on a long term basis or purchase multiple units over time  with the additional option to purchase service and supplies at an additional charge 
a customer may also enter into a short term rental agreement with the expectation that a long term lease or purchase arrangement will follow 
the clinics and we will jointly determine the number of phd systems that a clinic buys  leases or rents over time 
for reimbursement  medicare requires that the clinic be home certified 
we provide training to the clinic  which then provides training to patients 
we have technicians available to support clinics or patients hours a day  seven days a week 
revenue 
for the year ended december   revenue was million  a increase from revenue of million for the year ended december  product revenue of million resulted primarily from the sale or lease of phd systems 
this is an increase of million  or  over when seven machines were sold 
twenty six of the product sales recorded in fiscal were for phd systems sold in the united states 
two sales were made in the united kingdom 
the sales recorded were made pursuant to an agreement with a third party leasing provider or through direct sales to customers 
we also recognized revenue under short term and long term operating leases in we placed units under operating leases  in the united states and one in the united kingdom 
we maintain ownership of the units and classify them as fixed assets 
depreciation expense is recorded monthly 
our largest customers  the northwest kidney center  dialysis centers of lincoln  berkshire medical dialysis center and satellite healthcare  inc accounted for   and  respectively  of our revenues by dollar volume for fiscal year on october   we announced that we had signed a market assessment agreement with gambro healthcare  inc  a national chain of dialysis clinics serving over  patients in the united states 
the revenues generated by this agreement in fiscal year were not material to us 
service and supplies sold during fiscal specifically relate to the phd systems in use 
service and supply revenue is contracted under a separate agreement with a dialysis center at an established monthly amount 
supplies  such as blood tubing sets  dialyzers and acid and bicarbonate preparations  are required to perform dialysis treatments 
service on the phd system is for scheduled and unscheduled maintenance and repairs  and is provided by our service technicians hours a day  seven days a week 
service and supplies revenue totaled  for fiscal  an increase of  or  from  in the increase in revenue is attributed to the growth in product placement and service and supply agreements 
we are not dependent upon reimbursement from insurance providers as a source of revenue 
rather  we generate revenue from dialysis centers  which provide dialysis services through the use of the phd system 
the dialysis center is reimbursed on a per treatment basis by the insurance provider 
accordingly  reimbursement rates may influence customers demand for our product and our pricing of the phd system and related supplies and service 
cost of sales 
total cost of sales for fiscal was million compared to million in fiscal  an increase of 
product cost of sales for were million compared to million in  an increase 
the increase is due to additional machines produced and sold during specifically  machines were produced in and machines were produced during included in product cost of sales for is an inventory adjustment in the amount of million  in order to value the phd machines in inventory at the lower of cost or market 
the inventory cost adjustment was million 
while the number of units produced has increased  the production cost per unit decreased during service and supplies costs were million in  a increase from million in the increase is due to additional units in service during the current year compared to the prior year 
the majority of these costs are for field service personnel to install and service the phd machines and for clinical support staff necessary to train the customers nursing staff 
research and development expenses 
for the year ended december   research and development expenses increased to million from million for the year ended december  the increase of million in was primarily attributable to the donation of two phd units to be used for clinical research and costs associated with improving phd performance 
sales and marketing expenses 
during  sales and marketing expenses increased or million  to million in  from million in the increase is attributable to personnel additions  advertising and marketing promotions in associated with the scaling up of the commercialization of the phd system

service and supplies revenue totaled  for fiscal the product sales recorded in fiscal were for phd systems sold in the united states

we are not dependent upon reimbursement from insurance providers as a source of revenue 
rather  we generate revenue from dialysis centers  which provide dialysis services through the use of the phd system 
the dialysis center is reimbursed on a per treatment basis by the insurance provider 
accordingly  reimbursement rates may influence customers demand for our product and our pricing of the phd system and related supplies and service 
service and supplies sold during fiscal specifically relate to the phd systems placed during the year 
service and supply revenue is contracted under a separate agreement with a dialysis center at an established monthly amount 
supplies  such as blood tubing sets  dialyzers and acid and bicarbonate solutions  are required to perform dialysis treatments 
service on the phd system is for scheduled and unscheduled maintenance and repairs and is provided by our service technicians hours a day  seven days a week

included in product cost of sales is an inventory adjustment of million  in order to value the phd machines in inventory at the lower of cost or market 
service and supplies costs for the year ended december  were million compared to no service and supplies costs for the year ended december  the majority of these costs are for field service personnel to install and service the phd machines and for clinical support staff necessary to train the customers nursing staff during the early phases of the product launch 
research and development expenses 
for the year ended december   research and development expenses decreased to million from million for the year ended december  the decrease of million in was attributable to reduced research and development activities due to receipt of fda approval in march and our related shift in focus from product development to commercialization and sales activities 
sales and marketing expenses 
during  sales and marketing expenses increased million  from million in to million in the increase is attributable to personnel additions and other costs in associated with the scaling up of the commercialization of the phd system 
general and administrative expenses 
for the year ended december   general and administrative expenses increased million to million 
the increase is primarily a result of personnel additions necessary to support the commercialization efforts 
interest income 
for the year ended december   interest income was million  compared with million for the year ended december   a decrease of million 
the decrease is primarily attributable to lower interest rates on investments and our use of cash and cash equivalents to fund operations during liquidity and capital resources cash flows we have financed our operations to date primarily through public and private sales of equity securities 
at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  short term investments of million  working capital of million and restricted long term investments of million 
we believe that inflation generally has not had a material impact on our operations or liquidity to date 
net cash used in operating activities was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal the increase in compared to is primarily due to increased expenditures relating to commercialization and an increase in inventory in anticipation of increased sales 
the increase in inventory of million in compared to is attributable to the production of phase ii phd machines during the last quarter of  and an increase throughout the year of parts and consumables inventory required to service additional machines in use 
accounts payable also increased million in compared to due to increased phd production in the last quarter of payment for these machines was not made until accrued and other liabilities increased in by million compared to this increase is due to an increase in accrued vacation and bonuses relating to additional employees at december  compared to december  other sources and uses of cash were consistent in compared to net cash provided by investing activities was million in fiscal compared to cash used of million in fiscal in  we had increased our investments in marketable securities  primarily as a result of a private placement of common stock in may that netted million 
in  we used cash from investments to fund operations 
net cash provided by financing activities was million and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
cash provided from financing activities resulted from the issuance of common stock 
recent financing activities on january   we entered into a million equity line of credit arrangement with kingsbridge capital limited kingsbridge 
pursuant to the terms of our amended and restated common stock purchase agreement with kingsbridge  we could sell common stock at our sole discretion over a month period on a when and if needed basis  and kingsbridge was required under the terms of the agreement to purchase this stock  subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions contained in the agreement 
we had no obligation to draw down all or any portion of the commitment 
as partial consideration for entering into the equity line arrangement  we issued warrants to kingsbridge to purchase  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share 
these warrants had a fair value of  using the black scholes pricing model 
we filed a registration statement with the sec covering the equity line arrangement that was declared effective by the sec on february  during  we issued  shares of common stock to kingsbridge under the equity line arrangement and received million in proceeds 
as of december   we had fully drawn the equity line with kingsbridge and do not currently have a similar arrangement with kingsbridge or any other entity 
on june  we issued  shares of common stock and a warrant to purchase  shares of stock at an exercise price of per share to a single investor and received net proceeds of million dollars 
this warrant had a fair value of  using the black scholes pricing model 
we also issued a warrant to purchase  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share to an investment banking firm that acted as placement agent in this transaction as partial consideration for their services 
this warrant had a fair value of  using the black scholes pricing model 
we offered the foregoing securities in a public offering 
financing needs we estimate that during fiscal we will spend approximately million for operations  including us and international commercialization activities of the phd system 
we expect to substantially increase our cash outlays related to manufacturing scale up and commercialization of the phd system 
we believe that cash and short term investments as of december  coupled with the million from the durus settlement already received through february are sufficient to finance our commercial and operating plans through december  other than the million settlement payment that we will receive from the master fund upon the effectiveness of the registration statement covering shares of our common stock held by the master fund and artal that we are required to file under the registration rights agreement  we currently have no committed sources of  or other arrangement with respect to  additional financing 
see legal proceedings durus settlement for more information regarding the settlement and our receipt of funds as a result of it 
our future funding needs will depend on many factors  including the timing and costs associated with continued progress in research and development  manufacturing scale up  increased sales and marketing activities  the cost involved in filing and enforcing patent claims and the status of competitive products 
in the event that our plans change  our assumptions change or prove inaccurate or we are unable to obtain financing on commercially reasonable terms  we could be required to seek additional financing 
the additional capital required may not be available on acceptable terms or may not be available at all 
we have not generated taxable income to date 
at december   the net operating losses available to offset future taxable income were approximately million 
because we have experienced ownership changes  future utilization of the carryforwards may be limited in any one fiscal year pursuant to internal revenue code regulations 
the carryforwards expire at various dates beginning in as a result of the annual limitation  a portion of these carryforwards may expire before becoming available to reduce federal income tax liabilities 
given our historical losses and uncertainty with respect to our ability to generate taxable income  management has established a full valuation allowance at december  and  respectively 
recent accounting pronouncements in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liability and equity 
sfas no 
establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
it also requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability or an asset in some circumstances 
many of those instruments were previously classified as equity 
sfas no 
is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june   except for mandatorily redeemable financial for certain mandatorily redeemable financial instruments 
for certain mandatorily redeemable financial instruments the statement will be effective on january  the effective date has been deferred indefinitely for certain other types of mandatorily redeemable financial instruments 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position or results from operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk our investments are not made for trading purposes 
interest rate risk with respect to our investments is not significant as substantially all such investments are in us dollar cash equivalents and short term investments with maturities of less than months  which are by their nature less sensitive to interest rate movements
