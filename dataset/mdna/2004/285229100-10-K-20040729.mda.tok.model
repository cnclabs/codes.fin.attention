additionally  we produce high speed test  inspection and termination equipment used in the high volume production of multi layer ceramic passives mlcps and other passive components 
electronics industry overview in the highly competitive  cost sensitive environment of today s electronics industry  microelectronics and semiconductor manufacturing are driven by ever more complex processes that require every facet of the technology to be fully optimized in order to ensure the highest possible performance and yields 
this encompasses everything from discrete passive components the increasingly tiny capacitors and resistors essential to smooth flow of electrical current to the complex memory and logic semiconductors and highly advanced device packaging solutions designed to address today s most stringent functionality  performance and cost parameters 
because electronic devices and components are produced in large volumes and their production and testing is highly automated  manufacturers are continually looking to reduce costs by improving the throughput  yield and quality of device and component production 
these manufacturers are also developing new materials to improve device performance and costs  further challenging equipment suppliers to develop innovative manufacturing process equipment and solutions 
for example  semiconductor device manufacturers are continuing to transition from the use of mm and smaller silicon wafers to mm wafers 
this enables manufacturers to fit significantly more electronic devices on a single silicon wafer 
in addition  decreasing circuit densities enables more devices to be produced on a silicon wafer by reducing the size of each device on the wafer 
the use of larger wafers and the design of smaller devices increase the effective throughput and capacity of semiconductor manufacturing facilities  or fabs 
increasing circuit densities  as the result of shrinking line widths and faster operating speeds  requires the use of newer materials  such as copper  to create these miniaturized and higher performance electronic circuits 
our industry leading  application specific laser systems help customers achieve the compelling yield and productivity gains essential to their productivity by enabling fine tuning of device microfeatures to enhance performance in three key electronic sectors semiconductors  passive components  and electronic interconnect 
on the semiconductor side  to improve production yield  or the number of acceptable devices produced per silicon wafer  device manufacturers are utilizing our advanced laser memory repair systems to boost final yields in the manufacture of devices 
this includes dynamic random access memory  or dram  and non memory devices  such as logic with embedded memory  digital signal processors dsps and high end electronic game chips 
as semiconductor manufacturers move toward higher densities and more complex architectures  machine vision has also emerged as a critical technology 
by allowing manufacturers to achieve greater precision  increased equipment speed and fewer errors  machine vision is enabling technology in the semiconductor manufacturing process  from wafer production through final assembly and packaging 
variations of these advanced technologies and manufacturing processes that are routinely used in semiconductor fabs are increasingly being employed in the production of passive components  hdi circuit boards and advanced semiconductor packages 
an example is the use of machine vision in passive component inspection 
as device sizes are becoming ever smaller and the critical dimensions of the electrical contacts become more precise  machine vision  incorporated with high speed handling and real time software  allows for inspection 
the previous technique utilized human inspection at a much slower rate with poorer inspection results 
in the case of hdi circuit boards  consumers desire for faster  lighter  ultimately less expensive products with longer battery life drives cell phone producers and other consumer product manufacturers to design products in which the discrete circuits are closer together 
the same increased density concept used in semiconductor manufacturing is also pursued in printed circuit board production

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview electro scientific industries  inc and its subsidiaries esi provide high technology manufacturing equipment to the global electronics market  including advanced laser systems that are used to microengineer electronic device features in high volume production environments 
our customers are primarily manufacturers of semiconductors  passive components and electronic interconnect devices 
our equipment enables these manufacturers to achieve the yield and productivity gains in their manufacturing processes that can be critical to their profitability 
the components and devices manufactured by our customers are used in a wide variety of end products in the computer  consumer electronics and communications industries 
we supply advanced laser microengineering systems that allow electronics manufacturers to physically alter select device features during high volume production  in order to heighten performance and boost production yields of semiconductor devices  passive components and circuitry  high density interconnect hdi circuit boards and advanced semiconductor packaging 
laser microengineering comprises a set of precise fine tuning processes laser trimming  link cutting and via drilling that require application specific laser systems able to meet semiconductor and microelectronics manufacturers exacting performance and productivity requirements 
additionally  we produce high speed test  inspection and termination equipment used in the high volume production of multi layer ceramic passives mlcps and other passive components  as well as original equipment manufacturer oem machine vision products 
in fiscal  the electronics industry  and in particular the semiconductor subset of this industry  was at the peak of an extended period of expansion 
during fiscal  the slowing worldwide demand for electronics and semiconductors resulted in a rapid decline in demand for manufacturing equipment 
this sudden and steep decline in demand for manufacturing equipment continued to deepen throughout fiscal in response to the prolonged downturn  we implemented cost reduction plans to better align our infrastructure and operating costs with decreasing demand  while continuing to invest in research and development and customer support 
these plans included discontinuing certain products  consolidating facilities  relocating employees  reducing headcount  freezing salaries and wages and reducing discretionary spending 
in fiscal we experienced increases in demand  as evidenced by increases in orders 
orders increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal shipments increased in fiscal compared to fiscal despite the increase in shipments  backlog increased million to million at the end of fiscal compared to fiscal as a result of strong order levels 
consistent with the increase in shipments and revenue  gross margins improved steadily over fiscal  from in the first quarter to in the fourth quarter 
increasing gross profits  combined with improvements in operating expenses resulting from our cost management plans and other economies of scale and efficiencies  led to sequential improvements in both operating and net income over the course of fiscal this steady improvement in operating results resulted in pretax income of million and  combined with a net benefit for income taxes  net income of million in fiscal results of operations the following table sets forth results of operations data as a percentage of net sales

this trend began in the second quarter and continued through the remainder of fiscal the increase in sg revenues was also driven by new products introduced in the model line that received rapid acceptance with customers 
the significant increase in sg sales was complimented by stronger sales in our other markets  the pcg market saw end user demand improve in the latter half of fiscal for products that require the use of mlccs processed by our laser systems 
eig sales levels increased compared to the prior year driven by sales to manufacturers of flex circuits and ic packages that require the use of uv laser drills to produce highly precise manufacturing results 
this market continues to demand the fine line and feature geometries made possible by our system laser processing 
revenues in the fourth quarter of fiscal were million  an increase of million from the prior quarter 
we expect revenues to be in the range of to million in the first quarter of fiscal deferred revenue was million at may  compared to million at may  our revenue recognition policy is to defer revenue on shipments of significantly new products until customer acceptance has been received 
shipments in fiscal increased substantially compared to fiscal  however  deferred revenue decreased due to acceptance criteria being met on several new products in the fourth quarter of fiscal changes in deferred revenue for the year ended may  were as follows deferred revenue  beginning of fiscal year revenue deferred revenue recognized deferred revenue  end of fiscal year gross profit gross profit was million of net sales for fiscal compared to million of net sales for fiscal shipments in fiscal increased compared to fiscal gross margin improvements over fiscal were due to these higher shipment levels  lower material costs as well as more favorable product sales mix 
in particular  the semiconductor group introduced multiple new systems to the market from the product line 
these higher margin products gained acceptance with customers rapidly  thus contributing to the gross margin improvement in fiscal the increase in shipments also allowed for volume based manufacturing efficiencies which resulted in lower costs per unit during the year 
quarterly shipment volumes steadily increased throughout fiscal  driving increases in gross margin each quarter  from in the first quarter of fiscal to in the fourth quarter of fiscal during fiscal  we realized a benefit to gross profit of million of net sales resulting from sales of previously reserved inventory 
we expect gross margins will be approximately in the first quarter of fiscal year the increase in fiscal gross profit compared to fiscal was also due to the significant negative impact to fiscal gross profit of charges related to the cost management plans discussed below 
charges related to cost management plans recorded in cost of sales for fiscal and fiscal totaled million and million  respectively 
the fiscal charges were for employee severance payments related to the headcount reductions at the beginning of fiscal cost of sales in fiscal included million in inventory write downs  million in employee severance  relocation and related costs and million in facilities consolidation costs for the closure of our escondido  california facility 
additionally  downward revisions to previously projected product demand resulted in inventory and asset write offs of million and million in charges related to open purchase order commitments in fiscal we recorded significant write downs to inventory in fiscal and fiscal as a result of cost management plans and evaluation of the forecasted demand for our products 
at may   approximately million of the inventory amounts subject to write down as a result of restructuring activities implemented in prior fiscal years had not been disposed of 
we are actively working to dispose of these materials 
these disposals are not expected to materially affect gross margin in future years because the reduced value of these materials has been substantially reserved for and the current carrying value of the materials approximates the expected sale or disposal value 
operating expenses selling  service and administrative expenses selling  service and administrative expenses were million of net sales in fiscal  a decrease of million compared to million of net sales in fiscal the primary items included in selling  service and administrative expenses are labor and other employee related expenses  travel expenses  professional fees and facilities costs 
included in selling  service and administrative expenses for fiscal are charges related to our cost management plans of million  consisting of employee severance  relocation and related costs of million and facilities consolidation costs of million 
fiscal expenses of million included million in expenses related to cost management plans  comprised of million in employee severance  relocation and related costs  million in facilities consolidation costs and fixed asset write downs of million 
selling  service and administrative expenses also decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal as the result of reduced employee expenses related to our cost management plans implemented during fiscal and the decrease in selling  service and administrative expenses was partially offset by legal and professional fees related to the audit committee investigation and securities litigation which increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal research  development and engineering expenses future operating results are highly dependent on our ability to maintain a competitive advantage in the products and services we provide 
to protect this advantage we continue to make investments in research and development 
research  development and engineering expenses are primarily comprised of labor and other employee related expenses  professional fees  project materials  equipment and facilities costs 
expenses associated with research  development and engineering totaled million for fiscal  representing a million decrease from expenses of million for fiscal included in research and development expenses for fiscal is million in severance and other employee related expenses resulting from our fiscal cost management plan implemented during the first quarter of fiscal for fiscal  these expenses included million in severance and other employee related expenses and million in facilities consolidation costs for a total of million related to cost management plans 
excluding these charges  the overall decrease in research and development spending was million during fiscal and can be attributed to overall headcount reductions as well as decreases in project spending 
research and development spending often fluctuates from year to year as engineering projects move through their product development life cycles 
we continue to invest in development projects that we believe are important to our future 
we estimate both selling  service and administrative expenses and research  development and engineering expenses in the first quarter of fiscal will be approximately flat with those in the fourth quarter of fiscal  excluding the class action settlement discussed below 
long lived asset impairment operating expenses in fiscal decreased by million from the prior year as a result of the asset impairment charge recorded in fiscal based on our annual review of long lived assets  no impairment charges were required in fiscal settlement of class action and derivative lawsuits in fiscal we recorded a charge of million for the settlement of the class action and derivative lawsuits arising from the restatement of earnings announced in fiscal the estimated settlement  which is subject to court approval  calls for the payment of million  of which approximately million will be paid by us and approximately million will be paid by our insurance carrier 
see part i  item legal proceedings 
restructuring and cost management plans in response to the economic climate and resulting decrease in demand for our products  we initiated restructuring and other cost management plans in early fiscal  and in the first quarter of fiscal we initiated a reduction of employees  impacting all employee groups  in order to reduce expenditures 
charges related to the fiscal plan of approximately million were comprised of severance and other employee related charges 
based on the function of the employees subject to the headcount reduction  million was recorded in cost of goods sold  million was recorded in selling  service and administrative expenses and million was recorded in research  development and engineering expenses 
the headcount reductions primarily occurred in the first quarter of fiscal and were substantially complete in the second quarter of fiscal as a result  the expense savings realized from those actions were included in the expenditure rate for most of fiscal  but were partially offset by headcount additions in the latter part of the year as we increased our ability to meet increasing product demand 
we started the year with employees and ended the year with employees  representing a net decrease of employees 
the fiscal actions primarily related to relocating the manufacturing of our electronic component product line from escondido  california to our headquarters in portland  oregon 
this action resulted in a reduction of employees and the relocation of employees to our headquarters  which were substantially completed by december  total charges related to the fiscal actions were million in fiscal and million in fiscal a detail of the expenses by type for the fiscal cost management plan is presented below in thousands cost of goods sold selling  service and administration research  development and engineering total for the year ended may  severance  relocation and other employee related charges facilities consolidation costs for the year ended may  severance  relocation and other employee related charges facilities consolidation costs inventory and other asset write offs the fiscal actions reduced our work force by a total of employees in june and august  with an additional employee reduction in october these reductions impacted all employee groups 
the actions also included vacating buildings located in california  massachusetts  michigan  minnesota and texas  as well as exiting the mechanical drill business and discontinuing the manufacturing of certain other products 
anticipated future lease costs of million  net of future sublease revenue  are reflected as a component of other accrued liabilities at may  a detail of the expenses by type for the fiscal cost management plan is presented below in thousands cost of goods sold selling  service and administration research  development and engineering total for the year ended may  severance  relocation and other employee related charges facilities consolidation costs for the year ended may  severance  relocation and other employee related charges facilities consolidation costs for the year ended june  severance  relocation and other employee related charges facilities consolidation costs inventory write offs intangible asset write offs  net other income expense interest income was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the decrease is primarily due to lower interest rates earned during fiscal compared to fiscal on a slightly lower average amount of invested assets  which consist primarily of mortgage backed debt securities and corporate debt securities 
in addition to slightly lower average investment balances  and consistent with market conditions  our investment rates of return steadily declined on all assets in our portfolio during fiscal year in the coming year  market conditions for investments may continue to yield less than historically favorable rates 
our investment income could also be impacted by changes in average investment balances during the coming year depending on our ability to generateand invest cash from operations 
interest expense was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal annual interest expense related to the convertible subordinated notes of approximately million includes million for the accretion of underwriting discounts 
net other expense of million for fiscal increased million when compared with million in other net income in fiscal for fiscal  other net expense of million is primarily comprised of bank fees 
net other income of million in fiscal is primarily comprised of million of bank charges  offset by a gain of million related to legal settlements  a gain on sale of securities of million and a million gain related to the repurchase of million principal amount of convertible subordinated notes 
income taxes the income tax benefit recorded for fiscal year was million on pretax income of million 
the tax benefit in fiscal results primarily from export tax incentives of approximately million and million in research and foreign tax credits  respectively  for current and prior periods  resulting from tax returns filed in the current year 
to a lesser extent  the net tax benefit was also impacted by the effect of foreign income taxed at rates lower than us federal statutory income tax rates  and the recording of temporary differences previously not recognized 
the income tax benefit recorded for fiscal of million resulted in an effective benefit rate of 
we estimate that our effective tax rate for fiscal will be approximately 
in october of  the internal revenue service began an audit of our tax returns for the tax years ending in through during the examination period  we filed our fiscal year tax return and this return has also been included in the current examination cycle 
although the final outcome of the federal tax audit is uncertain  we believe the ultimate resolutions will not have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position 
net income loss as a result of the factors discussed above  net income was million  or per basic and diluted share  for fiscal compared to a net loss of million  or per basic and diluted share  for fiscal fiscal year compared to fiscal year net sales net sales for fiscal decreased million or to million compared to million in fiscal net sales by product group is as follows net sales in thousands net sales percent of total net sales net sales percent of total net sales semiconductor sg passive components pcg electronic interconnect eig the decrease in fiscal net sales compared to fiscal was primarily due to decreasing volume in both the sg and pcg groups 
the decreases in volume were due to continued softness in the global economy and competitive pressures 
in particular  pcg experienced increased competition for consumable products  primarily from asia 
the increase in eig net sales was largely due to acceptance of products in fiscal that were shipped to one customer in fiscal at the end of fiscal  these shipments were included in deferred revenue 
deferred revenue was million at may  compared to million at june  our revenue recognition policy is to defer revenue on shipments of significantly new products until customer acceptance has been received 
the increase in deferred revenue was primarily due to an increased level of shipments of substantially new products by our semiconductor group 
changes in deferred revenues for the year ended may  were as follows deferred revenue  beginning of fiscal year revenue deferred revenue recognized deferred revenue  end of fiscal year gross profit gross profit was million of net sales for fiscal compared to million of net sales for fiscal as a result of the economic climate and reduction in demand for our products  fiscal gross margins compared to fiscal were impacted by under absorption of factory overhead due to reduced product manufacturing 
this resulted in higher overhead burden costs included in cost of sales 
that factor  as well as pricing pressures  higher warranty costs and unfavorable product mix contributed to the overall decline in gross profit 
cost of sales in fiscal included million in inventory write downs  million in employee severance  relocation and related costs and million in facilities consolidation costs for the closure of our escondido  california facility 
additionally  downward revisions to previously projected product demand resulted in inventory and asset write offs of million and million in charges related to open purchase order commitments 
fiscal cost of sales included million of such charges  including million related to the fiscal cost management plan and million related to our decision to exit the mechanical drill business 
operating expenses selling  service and administrative expenses selling  service and administrative expenses were million of net sales in fiscal compared to million of net sales in fiscal the principal items included in selling  service and administrative expenses are labor and other employee related expenses  travel expenses  professional fees and facilities costs 
included in selling  service and administrative expenses in fiscal are charges related to the restructuring and other cost management activities of million  primarily employee severance  relocation and related costs of million  facilities consolidation costs of million and fixed asset write downs of million 
fiscal included million of such charges  primarily comprised of employee severance  relocation and related costs of million  facilities consolidation costs of million and amortization of intangible assets of million  which was partially offset by a gain on the disposal of impaired assets of million 
fiscal also benefited from restructuring and other cost management efforts that were implemented at various times during fiscal and that reduced spending levels 
research  development and engineering expenses research  development and engineering expenses were million in fiscal of net sales compared to million of net sales in fiscal research  development and engineering expenses are primarily comprised of labor and other employee related expenses  professional fees  project materials  equipment and facilities costs 
included in research  development and engineering expenses in fiscal were charges related to restructuring and other cost management activities of million  primarily related to employee severance and related costs and facilities consolidation costs 
fiscal included million of such charges consisting of employee severance and related costs of million and facilities consolidation costs of million 
excluding these charges  the decrease in research  development and engineering expenses of million is primarily due to lower headcount 
long lived asset impairment long lived asset impairment of million in fiscal includes million related to the write down of our klamath falls  oregon components manufacturing site and related equipment  and million related to the write down of land in taiwan 
the market for the consumable products manufactured by our klamath falls operation experienced a significant reduction in demand in fiscal as well as significantly increased competition from foreign manufacturers 
accordingly  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we determined that the book value of these assets exceeded the estimated undiscounted future cash flows 
pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we wrote down the assets to their estimated fair values 
other income expense interest income was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase was due to a full year of interest earned on the increase in our investment balances as a result of our sale of million aggregate principal amount of convertible subordinated notes in december and january this increase was partially offset by lower interest rates in fiscal compared to fiscal interest expense was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase is primarily due to a full year of interest expense of million related to the sale in december and january of million aggregate principal amount of convertible subordinated notes plus million for the accretion of underwriting discounts 
net other income of million in fiscal was primarily comprised of million of bank charges  offset by a gain of million related to legal settlements  a gain on sale of securities of million and a million gain related to the repurchase of million principal amount of convertible subordinated notes 
net other income of million in fiscal was primarily comprised of million of bank charges  offset by million of foreign exchange gains 
income taxes the effective income tax benefit rate for fiscal was compared to a benefit rate for fiscal the rate in fiscal includes the effect of a million tax credit due to a reevaluation of our application of the research and development tax credit for the years through net loss as a result of the factors discussed above  net loss was million  or per basic and diluted share for fiscal compared to million  or per basic and diluted share for fiscal restructuring costs and charges related to the investigation and litigation in fiscal were million  an increase of million compared to million recorded for restructuring charges in fiscal financial condition and liquidity at may   our principal sources of liquidity consisted of existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable and restricted securities of million and accounts receivable of million 
at may   we had a current ratio of and long term debt of million 
working capital increased million to million at may  from million at may  we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities are adequate to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months 
trade receivables increased million to million at may  from million at may  primarily due to the increase in sales in the latter half of fiscal compared to fiscal income tax refund receivable decreased million from million to million primarily due to tax refunds received during fiscal of million  partially offset by income tax payments made of million 
inventory increased million to million at may  from million at may   primarily due to increases to support higher sales levels achieved in the latter half of fiscal and sales levels expected in  based on the order backlog at may  assets held for sale of million at may  relate to an undeveloped parcel of land in taiwan 
we entered into a cash sales contract with a buyer in may and completed the sales transaction in june purchases of property  plant and equipment of million in fiscal were primarily for tooling purchases at our klamath falls facility and purchases of computer equipment and software 
deferred revenue was million at may  compared to million at may  although sales in fiscal increased substantially compared to fiscal  deferred revenue decreased moderately due to acceptance criteria being met on new products in the fourth quarter of fiscal at may   we had million recorded on our balance sheet related to our convertible subordinated notes due in december the difference between the remaining million face value and the million balance at may  relates to underwriting discounts  which originally totaled million and are being amortized as additional interest expense over the life of the subordinated notes at a rate of million per year 
a summary of our contractual commitments and obligations as of may  is as follows in thousands payments due by period contractual obligation total less than year years years more than years convertible subordinated debt purchase commitments derivative financial instruments  net operating leases derivative financial instruments represent various forward exchange contracts to hedge foreign currency transactions 
amounts are presented above in us dollars  translated at the exchange rate on may  and are a net presentation of amounts expected to be received and paid upon settlement of these contracts 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
our estimates are based on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates form the basis for judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
refer to part ii  item note summary of significant accounting policies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
our critical accounting policies and estimates include the following revenue recognition  inventory write downs  product warranty reserves  allowance for doubtful accounts  income tax benefits  expenses and deferred taxes  loss contingencies  and long lived asset valuations 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition sab 
revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or the services have been rendered  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
title and risk of loss generally pass to the customer at the time of delivery of the product to a common carrier 
revenue is recognized upon delivery  provided that fulfillment of acceptance criteria can be demonstrated prior to shipment 
where the acceptance criteria cannot be demonstrated prior to shipment  or in the case of substantially new products  revenue is deferred until acceptance has been received 
for multiple element arrangements  the fair values of any undelivered elements  estimated based on the list price of such elements  are deferred until the elements are delivered and acceptance criteria are met 
installation services are not essential to the functionality of the delivered equipment 
beginning in fiscal  and in accordance with sab  installation revenue is deferred until installation is complete 
prior to fiscal  and in accordance with sab  revenue recognition in financial statements  the costs of installation service were accrued at the time the revenue was recorded 
historically  neither the costs of installation accrued nor the fair value of installation service revenue deferred has been significant 
revenues associated with sales to customers under local contracts in japan are recognized upon title transfer  which generally occurs upon customer acceptance  with the exception of sales to our distributor in japan  where revenues are recognized upon title transfer to the distributor 
we have no distributor relationships outside of japan 
revenues related to spare parts and consumable sales are recognized upon shipment 
revenues related to maintenance and service contracts are recognized ratably over the duration of the contracts 
revenues are difficult to predict  due in part to our reliance on customer acceptance for a portion of our revenues 
any shortfall in revenue or delay in recognizing revenue could cause our operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter and could result in future operating losses 
inventory write downs we regularly evaluate the value of our inventory based on a combination of factors including  but not limited to  the following forecasted sales or usage  historical usage rates  estimated service period  product end of life dates  estimated current and future market values  service inventory requirements and new product introductions 
purchasing requirements and alternative uses for the inventory are explored within these processes to mitigate inventory exposure 
raw materials with quantities in excess of forecasted usage are reviewed quarterly for obsolescence by our engineering and operating personnel 
raw material obsolescence write downs are typically caused by engineering change orders or product end of life adjustments in the market 
finished goods are reviewed quarterly by product marketing and operating personnel to determine if inventory carrying costs exceed market selling prices 
we record inventory write downs  when necessary  as an increase to cost of sales based on the above factors and take into account worldwide quantities and demand into our analysis 
if circumstances related to our inventories change  our estimates of the value of inventory could materially change 
product warranty reserves we provide warranties on installed systems generally for a period of up to twelve months from the date of customer acceptance 
upon revenue recognition  a provision for the estimated cost related to warranty is recorded and included in cost of sales 
warranty costs include labor to repair the system and replacement parts for defective items  as well as other costs incidental to warranty repairs 
any credits for defective parts repaired and returned to inventory or cost recoveries from our suppliers covering defective components under warranty are also considered 
this data is then utilized to determine the estimated warranty reserve required for products remaining under warranty 
if circumstances change  or if a dramatic change in warranty related incidents occurs  our estimate of the warranty reserve could change significantly 
we record estimated warranties quarterly as an adjustment to cost of sales 
our warranty expense in fiscal totaled million 
allowance for doubtful accounts credit limits are established by reviewing the financial history and stability of each customer 
where appropriate  we obtain credit rating reports and financial statements of the customer to initiate and modify their credit limits 
on certain foreign sales  we require letters of credit 
we regularly evaluate the collectibility of our trade receivable balances based on a combination of factors 
when a customer s account becomes past due  we talk with the customer to determine the cause 
if we determine that the customer will be unable to fully meet its financial obligation to us  such as in the case of a bankruptcy filing or other material events impacting its business  we record a specific reserve for bad debt to reduce the related receivable to the amount we expect to recover given all information then available 
if circumstances related to specific customers change  our estimates of the recoverability of receivables could materially change 
we record estimated bad debts quarterly as an increase to selling  service and administrative expenses 
at may   our allowance for doubtful accounts totaled million and our bad debt expense in fiscal was million 
deferred taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those assets and liabilities are expected to be recovered or settled 
under sfas no 
accounting for income taxes  the effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
when management determines that it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be fully realized  a valuation allowance is established to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
should management s assumptions and expectations be inaccurate  our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected in future periods 
at may   our net deferred tax assets totaled million  which included a valuation allowance of million 
loss contingencies in addition to intellectual property litigation  we have been  from time to time  subject to legal proceedings and claims  including a purported securities class action lawsuit and other securities related litigation 
see part i  item legal proceedings 
where we can make a reasonable estimate of the liability relating to pending litigation  we record a liability 
as additional information becomes available  we assess the potential liability and revise estimates as appropriate 
because of uncertainties relating to litigation  however  the amount of our estimates could be wrong 
moreover  plaintiffs may not specify an amount of damages sought 
at may   we had million accrued for anticipated costs related to defending and or settling current litigation  including million accrued in the fourth quarter of fiscal for the estimated settlement of the class action and derivative lawsuits 
long lived asset valuations long lived assets  principally property and equipment and identifiable intangibles held and used by us are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable in accordance with sfas no 
we evaluate recoverability of assets to be held and used by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to estimated future net undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
factors that may affect future results the statements contained in this report that are not statements of historical fact  including without limitation  statements containing the words believes  expects and similar words  constitute forward looking statements that are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties 
from time to time we may make other forward looking statements 
investors are cautioned that such forward looking statements are subject to an inherent risk that actual results may materially differ 
the following information highlights some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results expressed or implied by our forward looking statements 
forward looking statements should be considered in light of these factors 
factors that may result in such variances include  but are not limited to the following the industries that comprise our primary markets are volatile and unpredictable 
our business depends upon the capital expenditures of manufacturers of components and circuitry used in wireless communications  computers and other electronic products 
in the past  the markets for electronic devices have experienced sharp downturns 
during these downturns  electronics manufacturers  including our customers  have delayed or canceled capital expenditures  which has had a negative impact on our financial results 
during any downturn it will be difficult for us to maintain our sales levels 
as a consequence  to maintain profitability we will need to reduce our operating expenses 
however  because there is a lag between actions we take to reduce expense and the actual reductions of the costs  our ability to quickly reduce these fixed operating expenses is limited 
moreover  we may be unable to defer capital expenditures  and we will need to continue to invest in certain areas such as research and development 
an economic downturn may also cause us to incur charges related to impairment of assets and inventory write offs and we may also experience delays in payments from our customers  which would have a negative effect on our financial results 
although we have recently experienced an increase in demand  we cannot assure you that demand for our products will continue to increase 
even if demand for our products does increase  there may be significant fluctuations in our profitability and net sales 
the proposed settlement of our securities related litigation may not receive court approval  which could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition 
in april we reached an agreement in principle to settle the class action lawsuit and other securities related litigation arising out of the restatement of our earnings announced in fiscal see part i  item legal proceedings 
the class action lawsuit alleged that we and six of our current and or former officers and directors violated the anti fraud provisions of the securities laws by making false and misleading statements regarding our business prospects and operations 
the other securities related litigation was a shareholder derivative suit alleging that certain current and or former officers and directors violated their fiduciary duties to us and were unjustly enriched 
the settlement is subject to court approval 
if the court does not approve the settlement  proceeding with the litigation could divert management s attention and resources from the operation of our business 
in addition  amounts  if any  ultimately paid by us in the litigation could exceed the amounts to be paid under the proposed settlement 
we face risks relating to governmental inquiries and the results of our internal investigation of accounting matters 
on march   we contacted the sec in connection with our issuance of a press release announcing the need to restate our financial results for the quarters ended august  and november  in march  the audit committee of our board of directors  with the assistance of outside legal counsel and independent forensic accountants  commenced an internal investigation of certain accounting matters 
the investigation involved the review of the circumstances surrounding the reversal of an accrual for employee benefits  unsupported accounting adjustments and clerical errors primarily relating to inventory and cost of goods sold  and certain other areas where potential accounting errors could have occurred  including revenue recognition and restructuring reserves 
as a result of the investigation  we determined that our unaudited consolidated condensed financial statements for the three months ended august  and november   and our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended june  and the quarters contained therein required restatement 
we will cooperate with all government investigations into the matters addressed by the internal investigation 
depending on the scope  timing and result of any governmental investigation  management s attention and our resources could be diverted from operations  which could adversely affect our operating results and contribute to future stock price volatility 
governmental investigations also could lead to further restatement of our prior period financial statements or require that we take other actions not currently contemplated 
in addition  if any proceeding is brought against us as a result of any governmental investigation  it could divert resources and management s attention from the operation of our business and result in increased legal costs and possibly the imposition of fines  which could cause our operating results and financial condition to suffer 
we have entered into indemnification agreements in the ordinary course of business with our current and former officers and directors  some of whom may be the subject of any governmental investigation or party to proceedings brought as a result of any investigation 
in addition  our bylaws contain indemnification provisions with respect to our directors  officers and employees 
we may be obligated throughout any investigation or proceeding to advance payment of legal fees and costs incurred by any current and former directors  officers  employees and agents pursuant to the indemnification agreements  our bylaws and applicable oregon law 
we may also be obligated to indemnify any former and or current directors  officers  employees and agents for judgments  fines and amounts paid in settlement if the person acted in good faith and in a manner reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to our best interests 
payments made by us under these obligations  to the extent not reimbursed by insurance carriers  could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition 
our operating results could suffer as we have recently experienced significant changes in our senior management and plan to add new members to our management team 
we have appointed five new members of senior management since january barry l 
harmon  who served as president and chief executive officer from april until succeeded by nicholas konidaris in january  j 
michael dodson  senior vice president of administration  chief financial officer and secretary  robert chamberlain  senior vice president  customer operations  and kerry mustoe  corporate controller and chief accounting officer 
in april we appointed jon d 
tompkins  who is a non employee director  chairman of the board 
since june we have added three new independent directors to our board richard j 
faubert  frederick a 
ball and robert r 
walker 
in october  two of our directors  david f 
bolender and vernon b 
ryles  jr  left the board in accordance with the board s retirement policy 
in january mr 
konidaris became a member of esi s board of directors 
mr 
harmon continues to serve as a member of the board of directors 
we intend to continue to add new members to our senior management team 
changes in management may be disruptive to our business and negatively impact our operating results and may result in the departure of existing employees or customers 
further  it could take an extended period of time to locate  retain and integrate qualified management personnel 
our inability to attract and retain sufficient numbers of managerial  financial  engineering and other technical personnel could have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations 
our continued success depends  in part  upon key managerial  financial  engineering and technical personnel as well as our ability to continue to attract and retain additional personnel 
the loss of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations 
on january   we announced the appointment of nicholas konidaris as president and chief executive officer 
our chief financial officer has been in that position since may  and the position of corporate controller was vacant from march until filled in september we cannot be certain that the employees hired to fulfill these duties will perform at the level necessary to ensure that our internal controls are not compromised 
in addition  we may not be able to retain our key managerial  financial  engineering and technical employees 
our growth may be affected by our ability to hire new managerial personnel  highly skilled and qualified technical personnel  and personnel that can implement and monitor our financial controls and reporting systems 
attracting and retaining qualified personnel is difficult  and our recruiting efforts to attract and retain these personnel may not be successful 
our ability to reduce costs is limited by our need to invest in research and development 
our industry is characterized by the need for continued investment in research and development 
because of intense competition in the industries in which we compete  if we were to fail to invest sufficiently in research and development  our products could become less attractive to potential customers  and our business and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
as a result of our need to maintain our spending levels in this area  our operating results could be materially harmed if our net sales fall below expectations 
in addition  as a result of our emphasis on research and development and technological innovation  our operating costs may increase further in the future  and research and development expenses may increase as a percentage of total operating expenses and as a percentage of net sales 
we depend on a few significant customers and we do not have long term contracts with any of our customers 
our top ten customers for fiscal accounted for approximately of total net sales in fiscal  with one customer  samsung  accounting for approximately and of total net sales in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
no other customer in fiscal  fiscal or fiscal accounted for more than of total net sales 
in addition  none of our customers has any long term obligation to continue to buy our products or services  and any customer could delay  reduce or cease ordering our products or services at any time 
delays in manufacturing  shipment or customer acceptance of our products could substantially decrease our sales for a period 
we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from the sale of a relatively small number of products with high average selling prices  some with prices in excess of million per unit 
we depend on manufacturing flexibility to meet the changing demands of our customers 
any significant delay or interruption in receiving raw materials or in our manufacturing operations as a result of software deficiencies  natural disasters  or other causes could result in reduced manufacturing capabilities or delayed product deliveries  any or all of which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations 
shipment and or customer acceptance delays could significantly impact our recognition of revenue and could be further magnified by announcements from us or our competitors of new products and technologies  which announcements could cause our customers to defer purchases of our existing systems or purchase products from our competitors 
any of these delays could result in a material adverse change in our results of operations for any particular period 
failure of critical suppliers of parts  components and manufacturing equipment to deliver sufficient quantities to us in a timely and cost effective manner could negatively affect our business 
we use a wide range of materials in the production of our products  including custom electronic and mechanical components  and we use numerous suppliers for those materials 
we generally do not have guaranteed supply arrangements with our suppliers 
we seek to reduce the risk of production and service interruptions and shortages of key parts by selecting and qualifying alternative suppliers for key parts  monitoring the financial stability of key suppliers and maintaining appropriate inventories of key parts 
although we make reasonable efforts to ensure that parts are available from multiple suppliers  key parts are available only from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers in the short term 
operations at our suppliers facilities are subject to disruption for a variety of reasons  including changes in business relationships  competitive factors  work stoppages  fire  earthquake  flooding or other natural disasters 
such disruption could interrupt our manufacturing 
our business may be harmed if we do not receive sufficient parts to meet our production requirements in a timely and cost effective manner 
we may make additional acquisitions in the future  and these acquisitions may subject us to risks associated with integrating these businesses into our current business 
although we have no commitments or agreements for any acquisitions  we have made  and plan in the future to make  acquisitions of  or significant investments in  businesses with complementary products  services or technologies 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  many of which are unpredictable and beyond our control  including difficulties and increased costs in connection with integration of the personnel  operations  technologies and products of acquired companies  diversion of management s attention from other operational matters  the potential loss of key employees of acquired companies  lack of synergy  or inability to realize expected synergies  resulting from the acquisition  the risk that the issuance of our common stock in a transaction could be dilutive to our shareholders if anticipated synergies are not realized  and acquired assets becoming impaired as a result of technological advancements or worse than expected performance by the acquired company 
our inability to effectively manage these acquisition risks could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  if we issue equity securities to pay for an acquisition the ownership percentage of our existing shareholders would be reduced and the value of the shares held by our existing shareholders could be diluted 
if we use cash to pay for an acquisition the payment could significantly reduce the cash that would be available to fund our operations or to use for other purposes 
in addition  the accounting for future acquisitions could result in significant charges resulting from amortization of intangible assets related to such acquisitions 
our markets are subject to rapid technological change  and to compete effectively we must continually introduce new products that achieve market acceptance 
the markets for our products are characterized by rapid technological change and innovation  frequent new product introductions  changes in customer requirements and evolving industry standards 
our future performance will depend on the successful development  introduction and market acceptance of new and enhanced products that address technological changes as well as current and potential customer requirements 
the introduction by us or by our competitors of new and enhanced products may cause our customers to defer or cancel orders for our existing products  which may harm our operating results 
we have in the past experienced a slowdown in demand for our existing products and delays in new product development  and similar delays may occur in the future 
we also may not be able to develop the underlying core technologies necessary to create new products and enhancements or  where necessary  to license these technologies from others 
product development delays may result from numerous factors  including changing product specifications and customer requirements  difficulties in hiring and retaining necessary technical personnel  difficulties in reallocating engineering resources and overcoming resource limitations  difficulties with contract manufacturers  changing market or competitive product requirements  and unanticipated engineering complexities 
the development of new  technologically advanced products is a complex and uncertain process  requiring high levels of innovation and highly skilled engineering and development personnel  as well as the accurate anticipation of technological and market trends 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify  develop  manufacture  market or support new or enhanced products successfully  if at all  or on a timely basis 
further  we cannot assure you that our new products will gain market acceptance or that we will be able to respond effectively to product announcements by competitors  technological changes or emerging industry standards 
any failure to respond to technological change that may render our current products or technologies obsolete could significantly harm our business 
we are exposed to the risks that others may violate our proprietary rights  and our intellectual property rights may not be well protected in foreign countries 
our success is dependent upon the protection of our proprietary rights 
in the high technology industry  intellectual property is an important asset that is always at risk of infringement 
we incur substantial costs to obtain and maintain patents and defend our intellectual property 
for example  we have initiated litigation alleging that certain parties have violated various patents of ours 
we rely upon the laws of the united states and of foreign countries in which we develop  manufacture or sell our products to protect our proprietary rights 
however  these proprietary rights may not provide the competitive advantages that we expect or other parties may challenge  invalidate or circumvent these rights 
further  our efforts to protect our intellectual property may be less effective in some foreign countries where intellectual property rights are not as well protected as in the united states 
many us companies have encountered substantial problems in protecting their proprietary rights against infringement in foreign countries 
if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property in these countries  it could be easier for our competitors to sell competing products in foreign countries 
we may be subject to claims of intellectual property infringement 
several of our competitors hold patents covering a variety of technologies  applications and methods of use similar to some of those used in our products 
from time to time  we and our customers have received correspondence from our competitors claiming that some of our products  as used by our customers  may be infringing one or more of these patents 
for example  in february and august  cognex corporation and gsi lumonics  respectively  filed lawsuits against us claiming we infringed patents owned by each of them 
see part i  item legal proceedings 
competitors or others may assert infringement claims against our customers or us in the future with respect to current or future products or uses  and these assertions may result in costly litigation or require us to obtain a license to use intellectual property rights of others 
if claims of infringement are asserted against our customers  those customers may seek indemnification from us for damages or expenses they incur 
if we become subject to infringement claims  we will evaluate our position and consider the available alternatives  which may include seeking licenses to use the technology in question or defending our position 
these licenses  however  may not be available on satisfactory terms or at all 
if we are not able to negotiate the necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms or successfully defend our position  our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
we are exposed to the risks of operating a global business  including risks associated with exchange rate fluctuations  legal and regulatory changes and the impact of regional and global economic disruptions 
international shipments accounted for of net sales for fiscal  with of our net sales to customers in asia 
we expect that international shipments will continue to represent a significant percentage of net sales in the future 
our non us sales and operations are subject to risks inherent in conducting business abroad  many of which are outside our control  including the following periodic local or geographic economic downturns and unstable political conditions  price and currency exchange controls  fluctuation in the relative values of currencies  difficulties protecting intellectual property  unexpected changes in trading policies  regulatory requirements  tariffs and other barriers  and difficulties in managing a global enterprise  including staffing  collecting accounts receivable  managing distributors and representatives and repatriation of earnings 
our business and operating results are subject to uncertainties arising out of the possibility of regional or global economic disruptions  the economic consequences of military action or terrorist activities and associated political instability  and the impact of heightened security concerns on domestic and international travel and commerce 
in particular  due to these uncertainties we are subject to the risk that future tightening of immigration controls may adversely affect the residence status of non us engineers and other key technical employees in our us facilities or our ability to hire new non us employees in such facilities  the risk of more frequent instances of shipping delays  and the risk that demand for our products may not increase or may decrease 
our worldwide direct sales and service operations expose us to employer related risks in foreign countries 
we have established direct sales and service organizations throughout the world 
a worldwide direct sales and service model in foreign countries involves certain risks 
we are subject to compliance with the labor laws and other laws governing employers in the countries where our operations are located and as a result we may incur additional costs to comply with these local regulations 
additionally  we may encounter labor shortages or disputes that could inhibit our ability to effectively sell  market and service our products 
if we cannot effectively manage the risks related to employing persons in foreign countries  our operating results could be adversely affected 
our business is highly competitive  and if we fail to compete effectively  our business will be harmed 
the industries in which we operate are highly competitive 
we face substantial competition from established competitors  some of which have greater financial  engineering  manufacturing and marketing resources than we do 
if we are unable to compete effectively with these companies  our market share may decline and our business could be harmed 
our competitors can be expected to continue to improve the design and performance of their products and to introduce new products 
new companies may enter the markets in which we compete  or industry consolidation may occur  further increasing competition in those markets 
furthermore  our technological advantages may be reduced or lost as a result of technological advances by our competitors 
their greater resources in these areas may enable them to better withstand periodic downturns  compete more effectively on the basis of price and technology  and more quickly develop enhancements to and new generations of products 
we believe that our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors  including performance of our products  quality of our products  reliability of our products  cost of using our products  consistent availability of critical components  our ability to ship products on the schedule required  quality of the technical service we provide  timeliness of the services we provide  our success in developing new products and enhancements  existing market and economic conditions  and price of our products as compared to our competitors products 
we may not be able to compete successfully in the future  and increased competition may result in price reductions  reduced profit margins and loss of market share

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk as of may   our investment portfolio includes marketable debt securities of million 
these securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if interest rates increase 
these securities are classified as securities available for sale  therefore  the impact of interest rate changes is reflected as a separate component of shareholder s equity 
due to the short duration of our investment portfolio  an immediate increase in interest rates would not have a material effect on our financial condition or the results of our operations 
our million aggregate principal amount of convertible subordinated notes are at a fixed interest rate 
therefore  there is no associated volatility 
the fair value of the convertible subordinated notes at may   based on recent open market trades  was million 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we have limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and do not use them for trading purposes 
we do  however  use derivatives to manage well defined foreign currency risks 
we enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge forecasted japanese sales commitments and the value of accounts receivable primarily denominated in japanese yen and other material non functional monetary asset and liability balances 
the effect of an immediate change in exchange rates on the forward exchange contracts and the underlying hedged positions would not be material to our financial position or the results of our operations 
the table below summarizes  by major currency  the notional amounts of our forward exchange contracts in us dollars as of may  and may  the bought amounts represent the net us dollar equivalents of commitments to purchase foreign currencies  and the sold amounts represent the net us dollar equivalent of commitments to sell foreign currencies 
the foreign currency amounts have been translated into a us dollar equivalent value using the exchange rate at the reporting date
