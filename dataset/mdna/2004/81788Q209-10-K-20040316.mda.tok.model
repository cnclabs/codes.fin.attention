item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis should be read together with our audited annual consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  and accompanying notes set forth elsewhere in this report 
all financial information is presented in us dollars 
some of the statements set forth in this section are forward looking statements relating to our future results of operations 
our actual results may vary from the results anticipated by these statements 
please see information regarding forward looking statements 
overview solutions inc is a leading provider of next generation ip based network and data services 
we were incorporated in  and in we introduced our initial products and solutions for the financial services industry fi 
in  following the acquisition of tantau software  we began offering our products to mobile network operators mno s 
during  we concluded that the adoption of wireless technologies by the financial services industry had slowed considerably and that such organizations would remain conservative about this type of investment for the next two to three years 
at the same time  our analysis indicated that the opportunity in the mno sector was potentially larger and also likely to develop sooner 
we therefore made the decision to principally focus on the mno market  with a corresponding diminished focus on the delivery of financial services applications 
accordingly  we made the decision to adjust the size of the investment that we were making in each of these two market segments  substantially reducing the level for the fi market  while bolstering that for the mno market 
we continue to monitor our cost structure to ensure that the investments we make on a product by product basis are appropriate to the revenue opportunities we believe exist 
we believe that mno s planning next generation data networks face two distinct challenges 
firstly  it is important that data networks are designed to support a wide variety of new revenue opportunities  partnerships and technologies so that the mobile operators can adjust their strategies quickly 
secondly  it is equally important that mobile operators deploy data networks that can grow smoothly and reliably  without creating economic barriers or compromising return on investment 
solutions designed the x treme mobility suite xms of products to address the challenges that mobile operators face in deploying next generation data networks 
our xms gateway products enable mobile operators to implement solutions based on emerging open standards technologies including wap  mms  sms and jme 
xms application enablers support a wide variety of commerce initiatives and third party content initiatives 
the x treme mobility suite provides the flexibility  scalability and total cost of ownership metrics that help ensure both the short term and long term success of next generation mobile data networks 
our customers currently include leading mobile network operators 
with our corporate office in santa barbara  california  we have development and sales offices around the world  including hong kong  switzerland  germany  canada  the united kingdom and the united states 
developments in restructuring and other charges during  we continued the cost reduction initiatives that we began in these efforts were implemented in order to reduce our overall operating costs and to realign our operating expenses and investments with a view to achieving operational profitability 
we reduced our worldwide work force by approximately people and closed redundant facilities 
as a result of these transactions  we recorded  in restructuring charges related to severance and lease exit costs 
these charges were mostly offset by a reduction to our hosting reserve of  as actual hosting related costs were lower than our original estimate see note a to our consolidated financial statements 
write down of goodwill sfas no 
and cica handbook section require goodwill to be assessed for impairment only  rather than being amortized  on a prospective basis starting january  see significant accounting policies  note to our consolidated financial statements 
we assessed the value of goodwill at december  and recorded a write down of million 
as described in note b of our consolidated financial statements  at the end of  the carrying value of goodwill was nil 
reverse stock split on april   our shareholders approved a ten for one reverse stock split of our common shares 
as a result  the historic number of shares  historic loss per share and the weighted average number of shares used in compiling basic and diluted loss per share have been restated for all periods presented to reflect the reverse stock split 
stock based compensation prior to january   we applied the intrinsic method of accounting to employee stock options 
under this method  deferred stock based compensation is recorded only if the current market value of the underlying common share exceeds the exercise price per share on the date of grant 
the cica accounting standards board has amended handbook section  stock based compensation and other stock based payments hb to require entities to account for employee stock options using the fair value based method beginning january   and encouraged companies to adopt early in we have chosen to early adopt the fair value based method on a prospective basis in under both hb in canada and fas for us gaap reporting 
since the total stock option expense for using the fair value based method is only  we have determined that it is not necessary to restate our quarterly results 
critical accounting policies we periodically review our financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies to ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment 
as part of this process  we have reviewed our selection  application and communication of critical accounting policies and financial disclosures 
we have determined that our critical accounting policies relating to our core ongoing business activities are primarily those that relate to revenue recognition 
other important accounting policies are described in note to our audited annual consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  revenue recognition sources of revenue we derive revenue from licensing our products and providing related services  including installation  integration  training  maintenance and support  and application hosting services 
we recognize revenue from our license agreements when all the following conditions are met we have an executed license agreement with the customer  we have delivered the software product to the customer  the amount of the fees to be paid by the customer is fixed and determinable  and collection of these fees is deemed probable 
typically  software license agreements are multiple element arrangements that include related maintenance and implementation fees 
accordingly  the fee is allocated to each element in the arrangement based on the respective vendor specific objective evidence of value vsoe of each element 
for those contracts for which we do not have sufficient vsoe  we use the residual method to record revenues 
under this method  if we have vsoe for all undelivered elements typically  services and maintenance we can record the remaining value of the contract as license revenue after allocating full value to the undelivered elements 
for license and services agreements that provide significant commitments to refunds and or penalties on the services and or license components should the system not perform according to documented specifications  we defer recognition of revenue for the amount subject to refund or penalty on unproven products until we achieve contractually defined milestones or until customer acceptance has occurred  as the case may be for such agreements 
product revenue product revenue consists of the following fixed license fee arrangement a one time license fee for a fixed number of copies or unlimited use of the software with a perpetual term 
we typically recognize the upfront fees in the period the contract is executed or shortly thereafter 
variable license fee arrangement a variable license fee based on the numbers of users in a period 
revenue is recognized on an ongoing basis and will vary with the number of our customers end users 
reseller arrangement the reseller typically pays a non refundable licensing fee for our software and or a royalty fee based on the related number of users 
we recognize revenue associated with non refundable license fees when we have met our revenue recognition criteria for license agreements as outlined above 
service revenue implementation and customer service fees revenue from implementation and customer services includes fees for implementation of our product offerings  consulting and training services 
customers are charged a fee based on time and expenses 
revenue from implementation and customer service fees is recognized as the services are performed or deferred until we achieve contractually defined milestones or until customer acceptance has occurred  as the case may be  for such contracts 
maintenance fees we receive revenue from maintaining and servicing our products for customers 
the maintenance fee is typically equal to a specified percentage of the customer s license fee 
if associated with the fixed fee license model  the maintenance revenues received will be recorded as deferred revenue and recognized on a straight line basis over the contract period 
when associated with the variable fee license model  any maintenance payments will be recognized on a monthly basis as earned 
hosting fees we no longer provide hosting services directly 
instead  we have arranged an alliance with computer sciences corporation csc  whereby csc is our preferred hosting partner for current and future customer deployments where hosting is or will be required 
under our existing hosting contracts  we typically charge customers a monthly flat fee or a monthly fee based on the number of users 
the fees are recognized on a monthly basis 
for a more detailed description of our revenue recognition policies  please refer to note c of our annual audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with canadian generally accepted accounting principles 
as applied to our financial statements  these principles conform in all material respects with us generally accepted accounting principles

service revenue service revenue decreased to million for the year ended december  from million in the decrease was a result of changing our customer focus to mno s and our product focus to the x treme mobility suite of products 
in  service revenue from our xms suite of products decreased to million from million in while the number of installations in the mno sector increased significantly in  the scope of the services performed was much narrower because we enhanced our core products  thus making it unnecessary for new mno customers to incur significant customization charges 
service revenue from the financial services industry was million in  down from million in operating expenses cost of revenue cost of revenue cor consists primarily of personnel costs associated with customer support  training and implementations  as well as amounts paid to third party consulting firms for those services  together with an allocation of expenses for our facilities and administration 
cost of revenue was million for the year ended december   compared to million in cor decreased in because we completed fewer projects and they tended to be narrower in scope than those completed in and because we eliminated costs not essential to our focus on mobile network operators

these expenses also include the cost of retaining independent contractors and consultants  software licensing expenses  and allocated operating expenses 
research and development r d expenses decreased to million for the year ended december   compared to million in the decrease is a result of our restructuring initiatives through which we reduced our r d headcount and developed a more streamlined  integrated and focused product road map that reduced duplication in the r d process 
we continue to evaluate our r d expenditure needs based on our new product architecture and services and the current market environment

stock based compensation prior to january   we applied the fair value based method of accounting prescribed by cica handbook section  stock based compensation and other stock based payments hb  only to employee stock appreciation rights  and applied the intrinsic method of accounting to employee stock options 
under the intrinsic method  deferred stock based compensation is recorded if  on the date of grant of the stock option to an employee  the current market value of the underlying common share exceeds the exercise price per share 
the cica accounting standards board has amended hb to require entities to account for employee stock options using the fair value based method beginning january   and encouraged companies to adopt early in we have chosen to early adopt the fair value based method on a prospective basis in under both hb in canada and fas for us gaap reporting 
under the fair value based method  compensation cost is measured at fair value at the date of grant and is expensed over the award s vesting period 
in accordance with the prospective transitional option permitted under amended hb and fas  we have retroactively applied the fair value based method to all employee stock options granted on or after january  since the total stock option expense for using the fair value based method is only  we have determined that it is not necessary to restate our quarterly results 
historically  our stock based compensation has primarily represented the amortization of deferred stock based compensation recorded as a result of assuming  through acquisitions  stock option plans that included unvested options and common shares 
this stock based compensation was amortized on a straight line basis over the vesting period of these options  and was fully amortized by june  also included in stock based compensation is the immediate recognition of stock compensation expense for those terminated employees who had options that immediately vested upon their termination  and the immediate recognition of the unamortized portion of the deferred stock compensation for those employees who tendered their options as part of our stock option exchange initiative in january stock based compensation decreased to million for the year ended december   including  related to the fair value of options granted in  compared to million in the comparative period in the expense included significant charges related to the immediate recognition of deferred stock based compensation associated with employees who were terminated as part of our restructuring plan as well as the immediate recognition of the unamortized portion of the deferred stock compensation for those employees who tendered their options as part of our stock option exchange initiative in january in addition  the deferred stock compensation associated with the tantau acquisition was higher in as it was fully amortized by the end of january restructuring costs in the second quarter of  we began to identify areas to reduce costs by eliminating duplicate resources and positions  narrowing our product offerings and streamlining our operating processes 
we continue to evaluate costs on an ongoing basis 
in the year ended december   we recorded net restructuring costs of  compared to million in the expense included  related to severance costs and  related to lease exit costs 
these charges were mostly offset by a reduction to our hosting reserve of  as actual hosting related costs were lower than our original estimate

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk impact of interest rate exposure as of december   we had approximately million in cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and restricted cash  of which million consisted of short term investments 
a significant portion of the cash earns interest at variable rates 
in addition  although our short term investments are fixed rate instruments  the average term is short 
accordingly  our interest income is effectively sensitive to changes in the level of prevailing interest rates 
impact of foreign exchange rate exposure our functional currency is the us dollar 
in the past  the majority of our non us dollar denominated expenses were incurred in canadian dollars 
as a result of our recent restructuring efforts  in the foreseeable future the majority of our non us dollar denominated expenses will be incurred in euros 
changes in the value of these currencies relative to the us dollar may result in currency gains and losses  which could affect our operating results 
in the year ended december   we incurred realized and unrealized foreign currency losses relating to the translation of our non us denominated monetary assets and liabilities of approximately
