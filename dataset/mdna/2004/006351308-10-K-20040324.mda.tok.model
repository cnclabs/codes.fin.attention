item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations marketing marketing segment revenues and operating earnings were as follows in thousands revenues    operating earnings loss    depreciation    marketing segment operating statistics were as follows wellhead purchases per day crude oil  bbls  bbls  bbls natural gas  mmbtu  mmbtu  mmbtu average price crude oil bbl bbl bbl natural gas mmbtu mmbtu mmbtu reflects the volume purchased from third parties by the company at the lease level and pipeline pooling points 
commodity purchases and sales associated with the company s natural gas marketing activities qualify as derivative instruments under statement of financial accounting standards no 
therefore  natural gas purchases and sales are recorded on a net revenue basis in the accompanying financial statements 
in contrast  substantially all purchases and sales of crude oil qualify  and have been designated as  normal purchases and sales 
therefore  crude oil purchases and sales are recorded on a gross revenue basis in the accompanying financial statements 
as a result  variations in gross revenues are primarily a function of crude oil volumes and prices while operating earnings fluctuate with both crude oil and natural gas margins and volumes 
gross revenues for the marketing operation were essentially flat for compared to as crude oil price increases were offset by reductions in crude oil purchase volumes 
in contrast  gross revenues for the marketing division decreased by billion or percent for relative to revenues 
this trend resulted because during and  management was reducing its scope of operations including the october sale of the company s onshore texas crude oil pipeline and related withdrawal from a six county area 
the strategy to reduce the size of operations was originally implemented because management believed its capital structure was not sufficient to safely support the expanded level of business existing at the time 
with enron corp 
filing for bankruptcy in december ii  credit support for the crude oil and natural gas industries became of paramount importance 
numerous industry participants either withdrew or significantly curtailed their activities within the crude oil and natural gas marketplace 
spurred by the fallout from enron  the contraction in volumes and revenues continued during in response  the company concentrated its crude oil operation in its areas of strength including central and south texas  the onshore louisiana gulf coast and the state of michigan 
for natural gas  the company continues to focus on offshore gulf of mexico supply and those pipeline pooling points with multiple delivery connections in order to increase flexibility and end market options 
management believes the contraction of volumes has stabilized at present levels 
while volume growth is not anticipated for  management believes that profitability can be maintained within the present  more manageable level of activity 
the million or percent operating earnings increase for resulted from improved per unit margins for both crude oil and natural gas 
most notably in the first half of the year  the war in iraq caused elevated demand for near term or prompt month crude oil prices 
this presented premium value opportunities for resale of the crude oil being acquired by the company 
in addition  per unit margins for natural gas also improved during as a result of reduced competition in this sector of the marketplace 
also during  the company reduced marketing operating expenses by million from the reversal of previously recorded accrual items  resulting from the final true up of the accounting for such items 
comparing marketing earnings relative to  the market conditions for crude oil purchase and sale margins were significantly improved due to iraqi war fears and production problems in venezuela 
these issues caused a significant prompt or current month premium and led to increased margins 
in addition to margin improvement  domestic crude oil prices rose from the per barrel range at year end to the range by year end as part of the company s strategy to reduce its exposure to price fluctuation  during  the company chose to liquidate lower priced inventory into a relatively high value market which increased operating margins by million 
in contrast with  prompt month prices became exceptionally weak and normal margins narrowed 
further  due to declining crude oil prices that were accelerated by the events of september   the company recognized approximately million in charges related to crude oil inventory liquidations and valuation write downs 
operating earnings for were also adversely impacted by a million bad debt provision resulting from the enron bankruptcy 
of particular significant effect on operating earnings was the earning of fee income totaling  during the first six months of this fee originated pursuant to the terms of the agreement to dissolve the williams gulfmark joint venture 
effective with november business  the company began to earn fees approximating  per month based on the quantity of crude oil being purchased by the former co venture participant in the offshore gulf of mexico region 
unfortunately  effective with july business  credit constraints caused the former venture participant to substantially curtail and ultimately cease its purchases of the crude oil in the region 
as a result  the company recorded no fee income during the remainder of and no such fee is anticipated in future periods 
the company and the co venture participant continue to cooperate in the final wind down and settlement of open trade account items 
as of december  the venture s remaining trade accounts due totaled approximately million and trade accounts payable totaled approximately million 
as the venture either collects or funds cash proceeds in settlement of such accounts  the company will receive or pay its pro rata percent share of such cash proceeds or requirements

ii transportation the transportation segment continued to face a generally stagnant marketplace in both and  as has been the situation since the second quarter of revenues and operating earnings were as follows in thousands amount change amount change amount change revenues    operating earnings   depreciation    represents the percentage increase decrease from the prior year 
results from the transportation segment are closely tied to trends for the united states economy in general and more specifically  to the domestic petrochemical industry 
as a common carrier transporter of bulk liquid chemicals  demand for the company s services is closely tied to the economic activity of domestic manufacturers of petrochemicals 
for most of  a weak us economy and high natural gas feedstock costs served to suppress demand 
the reduced demand picture was aggravated by high maintenance costs of an aging fleet  driver recruitment and retention issues  inflated insurance costs  fuel cost increases  heightened security concerns and low competitive freight rates 
there was however  a spark in demand during portions of the fourth quarter of that has carried forward in due to the fixed cost component of the trucking operation  as revenues are reduced  operating earnings decline at a faster rate 
operating earnings were reduced in because of higher diesel fuel prices and insurance cost increases 
fuel costs increased by  or percent for  consistent with higher average crude oil prices 
insurance expense increased by  or percent consistent with the general trend of escalating insurance costs 
partially offsetting increased costs and reduced demand was a  gain recorded upon the sale of used truck tractors 
these units were replaced with new units obtained under an operating lease 
based on its current infrastructures  the company s transportation segment is designed to maximize efficiency and earnings at a level of revenues approaching million per year 
when profitable demand is short of designed capacity  earnings are reduced and become a function of the current level of demand and the company s ability to control costs 
because of the fixed cost component of operating expenses  operating earnings when expressed as a percentage change will increase or decrease relatively faster than the rate of increase or decrease existing for revenues 
management believes that if escalating insurance and fuel costs subside  is potentially a turnaround year for this operation 
further  since a number of weaker competitors have left the industry  a demand surge should create positive upward pressure on freight rates 
all of this should enhance profitability in ii oil and gas oil and gas segment revenues and operating earnings are primarily derived from crude oil and natural gas production volumes and prices 
comparative amounts are as follows in thousands revenues    operating earnings loss  depreciation and depletion    production volumes and price information is as follows production volumes crude oil  bbls  bbls  bbls natural gas  mcf  mcf  mcf average price crude oil bbl bbl bbl natural gas mcf mcf mcf as shown above  improved oil and gas division revenues and operating earnings in resulted from increased crude oil and natural gas production volumes as well as higher prices for both crude oil and natural gas 
recent results from exploration efforts caused the production volume increases 
during  the company participated in the drilling of thirty six wells 
twenty three wells were successfully completed with twelve dry holes and one well in process at year end 
in addition to the completions of wells spud in  the company also successfully brought on production three wells that were drilling at year end the well in process at december  was subsequently brought on production in the first quarter of oil and gas revenues and operating earnings for were reduced relative to primarily because of declining natural gas prices from an average of mcf in to mcf in an additional factor contributing to reduced earnings were dry hole and other exploration expenses totaling  in as compared to  for and  for the results of exploration efforts yielded estimated reserve additions totaling  barrels of oil and  mcf of gas 
with the company s production for being  barrels of oil and  mcf of gas  the estimated reserve additions for represent more than a complete replacement of current production 
estimated future net cash flow before income taxes from oil and gas properties was increased from  at year end to  at year end justified by improved commodity prices  was the company s most active year of drilling since the early s 
during the year  in fort bend county  texas  the company participated in the drilling of fifteen wells with ten productive and five dry holes 
the success in this area is the result of the culmination of work done on two large d seismic acquisitions made in together with its joint interest partners  the company plans to expand exploration in this area in by acquiring additional existing seismic data and applying the same techniques that were successful in ii in calcasieu parish  louisiana  the company drilled eight wells in with two dry holes 
with its joint interest partners  the company hopes to continue this success by exploiting a large d survey that was completed in the data obtained from this survey was processed and is yielding multiple prospects to drill in the first of these is scheduled to spud in april for the austin chalk field of central texas  drilling continued in with four wells being successfully completed and two wells scheduled for in alabama  fieldwork on a large d seismic survey began in october recording of data began in and is expected to conclude by mid year 
the alabama d survey should confirm several prospect leads and the first well could spud as early as the upcoming fourth quarter 
the company is also participating in the drilling of a rank wildcat well in edwards county  texas 
although high in risk with a low chance of success  if this well is successful  the company will be participating with a three percent working interest in the exploitation of approximately  acres 
the company has obtained a percent equity interest in an offshore block in the central sector of the uk north sea 
the block  b  was awarded in august as a new promote license being offered by the department of trade and industry in the recently completed st round 
as a participant in this block together with its joint interest partners  the company has two years to acquire existing d seismic and reprocess it in order to develop a drillable prospect 
the terms of the license do not include a well commitment 
this project has large upside potential with minimal up front cost 
work on reprocessing the seismic began in january with results anticipated by the end of the second quarter 
if a prospect is confirmed  the company and its joint interest partners will seek an additional participant to drill the well on a promoted basis in order to provide limited capital exposure on the initial exploratory well 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses decreased  or percent  for relative to this savings resulted in part because  was incurred in for a due diligence review of the company s operations following the collapse of enron corp  a trading counterparty of the company 
while the review produced no adverse findings  continuous improvement in practices and procedures remains an important goal of the company 
in  the company also incurred  of audit expense in connection with a review of the activities of the company s former marketing joint venture

discontinued operations during  the company s management decided to withdraw from its new england region retail natural gas marketing business  which was included in the marketing segment 
this business unit caused after tax losses totaling  during with  occurring in the first quarter 
such losses resulted from certain full requirements contracts with weather sensitive end use customers 
under these contracts  the company bears the risk associated with any differences between expected volumes and actual usage 
january through march was abnormally cold and  due to strong demand conditions  natural gas prices were elevated 
as a result  during that period  this category of customer caused the company to purchase supplemental quantities of natural gas at prices greater than the contracted sales realization 
because of the losses sustained and the desire to reduce working capital requirements  management decided to exit this region and type of account 
ii presently  the company has ceased entering into new england region contracts 
existing contract requirements are being met in accordance with their original terms 
expiring contracts were not renewed and substantially all contracts expired prior to december  additionally  effective november   the company entered into an agreement with a third party to hire the company s personnel and assume associated office operating lease obligations 
management believes that no significant severance or shutdown costs will be incurred as a result of discontinuance of this operation 
activity in consists of collecting accounts receivable and honoring the remaining less than percent of contracts that extended into the new year 
with the reduction in volume requirements for  the company does not anticipate further significant losses from this operation 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
outlook with the issue of the new england operation resolved  looks to be a promising year 
a current problem is the ever increasing cost of all forms of insurance  including general liability  automobile  workers compensation and employee medical insurance 
in  the company s insurance cost totaled million  a percent increase in just two years 
the absorption of insurance increases has suppressed earnings with no tangible solution presently in sight 
the company is hopeful  however  that the insurance marketplace has at least stabilized as the company strives to find the means to factor the new cost structure into its business planning 
looking ahead for the marketing operation  management believes the exceptionally strong margin conditions that existed during are not likely to remain 
however  sound profitable operation should continue 
for transportation  the company presently has excess facilities capacity and management is hopeful of continued strengthened demand 
in the case of oil and gas exploration  there exists a strong price environment and the company has a number of very exciting opportunities 
the company has the following major objectives for maintain marketing operating earnings at the million level 
restore transportation operating earnings to the million level 
maintain oil and gas operating earnings at million while growing the oil and gas reserve base by percent 
liquidity and capital resources management s practice is to generally balance the cash flow requirements of the company s investment activity with available cash generated from operations 
during  the company s cash flow from operations totaled  and such funds were utilized to make  in capital expenditures and pay  in common stock dividends 
over time  cash utilized for property and equipment additions  tends to track with the non cash provision for depreciation  depletion and amortization 
a summary of this relationship follows in thousands ii years ended december  total depreciation  depletion and amortization     property and equipment additions     other sources uses of cash    presently  management intends to restrict investment decisions to available cash flow 
significant  if any  additions to debt are not anticipated 
banking relationships the company s primary bank loan agreement with bank of america provides for two separate lines of credit with interest at the bank s prime rate minus of percent 
the working capital loan provides for borrowings up to  based on percent of eligible accounts receivable and percent of eligible inventories 
available capacity under the line is calculated monthly and as of december  was established at  the oil and gas production loan provides for flexible borrowings subject to a borrowing base established semi annually by the bank 
the borrowing base was established at  as of december  the line of credit loans are scheduled to expire on october   with the then present balance outstanding converting to a term loan payable in equal quarterly installments 
as of december   bank debt outstanding under the company s two revolving credit facilities totaled  the bank of america revolving loan agreement  among other things  places certain restrictions with respect to additional borrowings and the purchase or sale of assets  as well as requiring the company to comply with certain financial covenants  including maintaining a to ratio of consolidated current assets to consolidated current liabilities  maintaining a to ratio of pre tax net income to interest expense  and consolidated net worth in excess of  the company s gulfmark energy  inc subsidiary maintains a separate banking relationship with bnp paribas in order to support its crude oil purchasing activities 
in addition to providing up to million in letters of credit  the facility also finances up to million of crude oil inventory and certain accounts receivable associated with crude oil sales 
such financing is provided on a demand note basis with interest at the bank s prime rate plus percent 
as of december   the company had million of eligible borrowing capacity under this facility 
no working capital advances were outstanding as of december  letters of credit outstanding under this facility totaled approximately million as of december  the letter of credit and demand note facilities are secured by substantially all of gulfmark s and arm s assets 
under this facility  bnp paribas has the right to discontinue the issuance of letters of credit without prior notification to the company 
the company s adams resources marketing subsidiary also maintains a separate banking relationship with bnp paribas in order to support its natural gas purchasing activities 
in addition to providing up to million in letters of credit  the facility finances up to million of general working capital needs on a demand note basis 
such financing is provided on a demand note basis with interest at the bank s prime rate plus per cent 
no working capital advances were outstanding under this facility as of december  letters of credit outstanding under this facility totaled approximately million as of december  the letter of credit and demand note facilities are secured by substantially all of gulfmark s and arm s assets 
under this facility  bnp paribas has the right to discontinue the issuance of letters of credit without prior notification to the company 
ii management maintains that the greatest uncertainty facing a marketing company is the banking community s continued willingness to support commodity credit facilities 
the events leading to enron s bankruptcy support this belief 
the company remains positioned to operate the commodity portions of its business without bank support should such a need develop 
off balance sheet arrangements the company maintains certain operating lease arrangements to provide tractor and trailer equipment for the company s truck fleet 
all such operating lease commitments qualify for off balance sheet treatment as provided by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for leases 
the company has operating lease arrangements for tractors  trailers  office space  and other equipment and facilities 
rental expense for the years ended december    and was   and  respectively 
at december   commitments under long term noncancelable operating leases for the next five years and thereafter are payable as follows and thereafter  contractual cash obligations in addition to its banking relationships and obligations  the company enters into certain operating leasing arrangements for tractors  trailers  office space and other equipment and facilities 
a summary of contractual debt and lease obligations is as follows in thousands payment period thereafter total long term debt     operating leases       total       in addition to its bank debt and lease financing obligations  the company is also committed to purchase certain quantities of crude oil and natural gas in connection with its marketing activities 
such commodity purchase obligations are the basis for commodity sales  which generate the cash flow necessary to meet such purchase obligations 
see also note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
approximate commodity purchase obligations as of december  are as follows in thousands january remaining thereafter total crude oil    natural gas    refined products ii investment activities during  the company invested approximately  in oil and gas projects   for replacement equipment for its petrochemical trucking fleet and  in equipment for the company s marketing operations 
oil and gas exploration and development efforts continue  and the company plans to invest approximately million toward such projects in including  of seismic costs to be expensed during the year 
an additional approximate million is projected in for the purchase of transportation equipment as present lease financing arrangements mature 
certain items of cash flow interest paid totaled   and  during the years ended december   and  respectively 
interest expense was reduced in as a result of a reduced prime bank rate and reduced average loan amount outstanding 
income taxes paid during these same periods totaled   and  respectively 
federal tax refunds received during totaled  and  during and  respectively 
there were no significant non cash investing or financing activities in any of the periods reported 
insurance the marketplace for all forms of insurance has entered a period of severe cost increases 
in the past  during such cyclical periods  the company has seen cost increases to the point where desired levels of insurance were either unavailable or unaffordable 
the company s primary insurance needs are in the area of automobile and umbrella coverage for its trucking fleet and medical insurance for employees 
during  the company s insurance expense totaled million  a percent increase over based on insurance renewals in  the company is anticipating further insurance increases for the company has no effective way to pass on such cost increases and any increase will thus need to be absorbed by existing operations 
competition in all phases of its operations  the company encounters strong competition from a number of entities 
many of these competitors possess financial resources substantially in excess of those of the company 
the company faces competition principally in establishing trade credit  pricing of available materials and quality of service 
in its oil and gas operation  the company also competes for the acquisition of mineral properties 
the company s marketing division competes with major oil companies and other large industrial concerns that own or control significant refining and marketing facilities 
these major oil companies may offer their products to others on more favorable terms than those available to the company 
from time to time in recent years  there have been supply imbalances for crude oil and natural gas in the marketplace 
this in turn has led to significant fluctuations in prices for crude oil and natural gas 
as a result  there is a high degree of uncertainty regarding both the future market price for crude oil and natural gas and the available margin spread between wholesale acquisition costs and sales realization 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates fair value accounting as an integral part of its marketing operation  the company enters into certain forward commodity contracts that are required to be recorded at fair value in accordance with statement of ii financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities and related accounting pronouncements 
management believes this required accounting  commonly called mark to market accounting  creates variations in reported earnings and the reported earnings trend 
under mark to market accounting  significant levels of earnings are recognized in the period of contract initiation rather than the period when the service is provided and title passes from supplier to customer 
as it affects the company s operation  management believes mark to market accounting impacts reported earnings and the presentation of financial condition in three important ways 
gross margins  derived from certain aspects of the company s ongoing business  are front ended into the period in which contracts are executed 
meanwhile  personnel and other costs associated with servicing accounts as well as the substantially all risks associated with the execution of contracts are incurred during the period of physical product flow and title passage 
mark to market earnings are calculated based on stated contract volumes 
a significant risk associated with the company s business is the conversion of stated contract or planned volumes into actual physical commodity movement volumes without a loss of margin 
again  any planned profit from such commodity contracts is bunched and front ended into one period while the risk of loss associated with the difference between actual versus planned production or usage volumes falls in a subsequent period 
cash flows  by their nature  match physical movements and passage of title 
mark to market accounting  on the other hand  creates a mismatch between reported earnings and cash flows 
this complicates and confuses the picture of stated financial conditions and liquidity 
the company attempts to mitigate the identified risks by only entering into contracts where current market quotes in actively traded  liquid markets are available to determine the fair value of contracts 
in addition  substantially all of the company s forward contracts are less than months in duration 
however  the reader is cautioned to develop a full understanding of how fair value or mark to market accounting creates reported results that differ from those presented under conventional accrual accounting 
trade accounts accounts receivable and accounts payable typically represent the single most significant assets and liabilities of the company 
particularly within the company s energy marketing and oil and gas exploration and production operations  there is a high degree of interdependence with and reliance upon third parties  including transaction counterparties to provide adequate information for the proper recording of amounts receivable or payable 
substantially all such third parties are larger firms providing the company with the source documents for recording trade activity 
it is commonplace for these entities to retroactively adjust or correct such documents 
this typically requires the company to either absorb  benefit from  or pass along such corrections to another third party 
due to a the volume of transactions  b the complexity of transactions and c the high degree of interdependence with third parties  this is a difficult area to control and manage 
the company manages this process by participating in a monthly settlement process with each of its counterparties 
ongoing account balances are monitored monthly and the company attempts to gain the cooperation of such counterparties to reconcile outstanding balances 
the company also places great emphasis on ii collecting cash balance due and paying only bonafide properly supported claims 
in addition  the company maintains and monitors its bad debt allowance 
a degree of risk remains  however  due to the custom and practices of the industry 
oil and gas reserve estimate the value of capitalized cost of oil and gas exploration and production related assets are dependent on underlying oil and gas reserve estimates 
reserve estimates are based on many subjective factors 
the accuracy of reserve estimates depends on the quantity and quality of geological data  production performance data and reservoir engineering data  changed prices  as well as the skill and judgment of petroleum engineers in interpreting such data 
the process of estimating reserves requires frequent revision of estimates usually on an annual basis as additional information becomes available 
estimated future oil and gas revenue calculations are also based on estimates by petroleum engineers as to the timing of oil and gas production  and there is no assurance that the actual timing of production will conform to or approximate such estimates 
also  certain assumptions must be made with respect to pricing 
the company s estimates assume prices will remain constant from the date of the engineer s estimates  except for changes reflected under natural gas sales contracts 
there can be no assurance that actual future prices will not vary as industry conditions  governmental regulation and other factors impact the market price for oil and gas 
the company follows the successful efforts method of accounting  so only costs including development dry hole costs associated with producing oil and gas wells are capitalized 
estimated oil and gas reserve quantities are the basis for the rate of amortization under the company s units of production method for depreciating  depleting and amortizing of oil and gas properties 
estimated oil and gas reserve values also provide the standard for the company s periodic review of oil and gas properties for impairment 
contingencies from time to time as incident to its operations  the company becomes involved in various accidents  lawsuits and or disputes 
primarily as an operator of an extensive trucking fleet  the company is a party to motor vehicle accidents  worker compensation claims or other items of general liability as are typical for the industry 
in addition  the company has extensive operations that must comply with a wide variety of tax laws  environmental laws and labor laws  among others 
should an incident occur  management evaluates the claim based on its nature  the facts and circumstances and the applicability of insurance coverage 
to the extent management believes that such event may impact the financial condition of the company  management will estimate the monetary value of the claim and make appropriate accruals or disclosure as provided in the guidelines of statement of financial accounting standards no 
revenue recognition the company s natural gas and crude oil marketing customers are invoiced based on contractually agreed upon terms on a monthly basis 
revenue is recognized in the month in which the physical product is delivered to the customer 
where required  the company also recognizes fair value or mark to market gains and losses related to its natural gas and crude oil trading activities 
a detailed discussion of the company s risk management activities is included in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
ii customers of the company s petroleum products marketing subsidiary are invoiced and revenue is recognized in the period when the customer physically takes possession and title to the product upon delivery at their facility 
transportation customers are invoiced  and the related revenue is recognized as the service is provided 
oil and gas revenue from the company s interests in producing wells is recognized as title and physical possession of the oil and gas passes to the purchaser 
new accounting pronouncements on january   the company adopted sfas no 
accounting for asset retirement obligations 
the objective of sfas no 
is to establish an accounting model for accounting and reporting obligations associated with retirement of tangible long lived assets and associated retirement costs 
sfas no 
requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset s retirement obligation be recorded in the period in which it is incurred and the corresponding cost capitalized by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
the liability is accreted to its then present value each period  and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset 
if the liability is settled for an amount other than the recorded amount  a gain or loss is recognized 
the company completed its assessment of sfas no 
and  as of january   the company estimated the present value of its future asset retirement obligations is approximately  the cumulative effect of adoption of sfas no 
and the change in accounting principle resulted in a charge to net income during the first quarter of of approximately  or  net of taxes 
on april   the fasb issued sfas no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement amends and clarifies accounting for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities under sfas no 
this statement is effective for contracts entered into or modified after june   for hedging relationships designated after june   and to certain preexisting contracts 
the company adopted sfas no 
on july  in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas no 
establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain freestanding instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas no 
requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability or asset in some circumstances 
the company adopted sfas no 
effective july  the adoption of this statement did not have a material effect on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in january  the fasb issued fin no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of accounting research bulletin 
fin addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities vies and the primary objective is to provide guidance on the identification of  and financial reporting for  entities over which control is achieved through means other than voting rights  such entities are known as vies 
fin requires an entity to consolidate a vie if the entity has a variable interest or combination of variable interests that will absorb a majority of the entity s expected losses if they occur  receive a majority of the entity s expected residual returns if they occur or both 
the guidance applies immediately to vies created after january   and to vies in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date 
consolidation of previously existing vies is required in the company s december  financial statements 
the company has no vies to consolidate as of december  in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations  requiring the purchase method of accounting for business combinations initiated after june   which eliminates the pooling of interests method 
in july  the fasb also issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other ii intangible assets  which discontinues the practice of amortizing goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets and initiates an annual review for impairment 
intangible assets with a determinable useful life will continue to be amortized over that period 
the amortization provisions apply to goodwill and intangible assets acquired after june  sfas no 
and clarify that more assets should be distinguished and classified between tangible and intangible 
the company did not change or reclassify contractual mineral rights included in oil and gas properties on the balance sheet upon adoption of sfas no 
the company believes the treatment of such mineral rights as tangible assets under the successful efforts method of accounting for crude oil and natural gas properties is appropriate 
an issue has arisen regarding whether contractual mineral rights should be classified as intangible rather than tangible assets 
if it is determined that reclassification is necessary  the company s net property  plant and equipment would be reduced by approximately million and million and intangible assets would have increased by a like amount at december  and  respectively  representing unamortized cost incurred since inception 
the provisions of sfas no 
and impact only the balance sheet and associated footnote disclosure  and reclassifications necessary would not impact the company s cash flows or results of operations 
ii item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s exposure to market risk includes potential adverse changes in interest rates and commodity prices 
interest rate risk total long term debt at december  included  of floating rate debt 
as a result  the company s annual interest costs fluctuate based on interest rate changes 
because the interest rate on the company s long term debt is a floating rate  the fair value approximates carrying value as of december  a hypothetical percent adverse change in the floating rate would not have had a material effect on the company s results of operations for the fiscal year ended december  commodity price risk the company s major market risk exposure is in the pricing applicable to its marketing and production of crude oil and natural gas 
realized pricing is primarily driven by the prevailing spot prices applicable to oil and gas 
commodity price risk in the company s marketing operations represents the potential loss that may result from a change in the market value of an asset or a commitment 
from time to time  the company enters into forward contracts to minimize or hedge the impact of market fluctuations on its purchases of crude oil and natural gas 
the company may also enter into price support contracts with certain customers to secure a floor price on the purchase of certain supply 
in each instance  the company locks in a separate matching price support contract with a third party in order to minimize the risk of these financial instruments 
substantially all forward contracts fall within a month to year term with no contracts extending longer than two years in duration 
the company monitors all commitments and positions and endeavors to maintain a balanced portfolio 
certain forward contracts are recorded at fair value  depending on management s assessments of numerous accounting standards and positions that comply with generally accepted accounting principles 
the undiscounted fair value of such contracts is reflected on the company s balance sheet as risk management assets and liabilities 
the revaluation of such contracts is recognized on a net basis in the company s results of operations 
current market price quotes from actively traded liquid markets are used in all cases to determine the contracts undiscounted fair value 
regarding net risk management assets  percent of presented values as of december  and were based on readily available market quotations 
risk management assets and liabilities are classified as short term or long term depending on contract terms 
the estimated future net cash inflow based on year end market prices is  all to be received in the estimated future cash inflow approximates the net fair value recorded in the company s risk management assets and liabilities 
ii the following table illustrates the factors impacting the change in the net value of the company s risk management assets and liabilities for the year ended december  in thousands net fair value on january  activity during cash received from settled contracts net realized loss from prior years contracts net unrealized gain from prior years contracts net unrealized gain from current year contracts net fair value on december  historically  prices received for oil and gas production have been volatile and unpredictable 
price volatility is expected to continue 
from january  through december  natural gas price realizations ranged from a monthly low of mmbtu to a monthly high of per mmbtu 
oil prices ranged from a low of per barrel to a high of per barrel during the same period 
a hypothetical percent adverse change in average natural gas and crude oil prices  assuming no changes in volume levels  would have reduced earnings by approximately  and  respectively  for the comparative years ended december  and ii
