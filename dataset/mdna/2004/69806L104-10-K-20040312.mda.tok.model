item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations revision of consolidated statements of income and consolidated statements of cash flows our consolidated statements of income and consolidated statements of cash flows have been revised  pursuant to sfas no 
 from those originally reported for the years ended december  and to separately reflect the results of discontinued operations for properties that were sold during the year ended december  the revision had no impact on our consolidated balance sheets 
the revision had no impact on net income or net income per share of common stock for the years ended december  and see the discussions of discontinued operations in the results of operations section below 
cautionary language the discussions in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contain forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of which reflect management s current views with respect to future events and financial performance 
forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties 
factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations include market valuations of our stock  financial performance and operations of our shopping centers  real estate conditions  execution of shopping center development programs  successful completion of renovations  completion of pending acquisitions  integration of completed acquisitions  changes in the availability of additional acquisitions  changes in local or national economic conditions  acts of terrorism or war and other risks detailed from time to time in reports filed with the securities and exchange commission 
critical accounting policies the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  and the notes thereto  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors and circumstances 
we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable for our current circumstances  however  actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions under different future conditions 
we believe that the estimates and assumptions that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations  in that they require our most subjective judgments  form the basis for the accounting policies deemed to be most critical 
these critical accounting policies include our estimates of useful lives in calculating depreciation expense on our shopping center properties and the ultimate recoverability  or impairment  of each shopping center asset 
if actual useful lives are different from our estimates this could result in changes to the results of our operations 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of our shopping center properties could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the properties that may not be reflected in the properties current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
overview we receive income primarily from rental revenue from shopping center properties  including recoveries from tenants  offset by operating and overhead expenses 
primarily as a result of our acquisition program  including the acquisition of center trust described below  the financial data shows increases in total revenue and total expenses from period to period 
during the year ended december   nine non strategic assets were sold 
the cash proceeds were used toward the purchase of two shopping center assets and to pay down our revolving credit facility 
during the year ended december   nine non strategic assets were sold  the proceeds of which were used to purchase six shopping center assets 
during the year ended december   eight non strategic assets were sold  the proceeds of which were used to purchase four shopping center assets 
on november   we entered into an agreement and plan of merger with center trust  inc  a maryland corporation 
the transaction  which closed january   included interests in shopping centers  two regional malls and two single tenant assets 
the transaction was a stock for stock exchange  including assumption of 
table of contents  of debt  whereby each share of center trust common stock was exchanged for newly issued shares of our common stock 
as a result  we issued  shares of our common stock to center trust stockholders and as of december  we may issue up to  shares of our common stock to limited partners of ct operating partnership  lp upon the exchange of operating partnership units held by them 
on november   we acquired western properties trust  a california real estate investment trust 
the transaction was a stock for stock exchange whereby western common shares and units were exchanged for newly issued shares of our common stock and operating subsidiary units  based upon a fixed exchange ratio of of a share of our common stock per western share or operating subsidiary unit 
as a result  we issued  shares of our common stock to holders of western common shares 
we are also currently obligated to issue  shares of our common stock upon the exchange of operating subsidiary units held by limited partners of pan pacific pinecreek  lp  formerly western pinecreek  lp  or pay a cash amount  at our discretion 
in connection with this transaction  we assumed  of western s debt obligations 
we expect that the more significant part of our growth in the next year or two will come from rent increases from the re leasing and re tenanting initiatives of the assets acquired in the center trust acquisition  from the stabilization of the two other properties acquired during as well as from additional acquisitions 
results of operations comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december total revenue increased by  or  to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december rental revenue  which includes base rent and percentage rent  increased by  or  to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december  the increase in rental revenue resulted principally from the acquisition of the center trust portfolio 
recoveries from tenants  which represents reimbursements from tenants for property operating expenses and property taxes  increased by  or  to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december  this increase resulted primarily from the acquisition of the center trust portfolio 
in addition  recoveries from tenants increased because recoverable expenses increased 
recoveries from tenants were for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the decrease in recovery percentage compared to the prior year period reflects the impact of the acquisition of the center trust portfolio in that center trust s historical recovery rate was lower than pan pacific s recovery rate 
we expect that the recovery percentage will increase over time as occupancy is increased in the acquired assets 
other income decreased by  or  to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december  the decrease resulted principally from a reduction of interest income on our plaza escuela corporate note receivable which was repaid in the third quarter of this decrease was partially offset by interest income recorded on other notes receivable issued during related to property sales as well as interest on notes receivable we assumed upon the acquisition of the center trust portfolio 
property operating expenses increased by  or  to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december  this increase resulted primarily from our acquisition of the center trust portfolio

depreciation and amortization increased by  or  to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december  this was primarily due to the acquisition of the center trust portfolio 
interest expense increased by  or  to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december  the increase was primarily the result of the debt we assumed in the center trust acquisition as well as amounts we borrowed on our revolving credit facility to repay center trust s line of credit and to pay off certain notes payable 
the increase was also a result of additional amounts drawn on our revolving credit facility to finance properties acquired during interest expense also 
table of contents increased as a result of our issuance of  in aggregate principal amount of senior notes in june  our issuance of  in aggregate principal amount of senior notes in december and our issuance of  in aggregate principal amount of senior notes in june the stated interest rates of  and on the senior note issuances  respectively  are higher than our cost to borrow funds under our revolving credit facility which were paid down with the net proceeds of the notes offerings 
general and administrative expenses increased by  or  to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december  this increase resulted primarily from increased staffing required as a result of the acquisition of center trust  annual compensation increases during  accrued compensation for bonuses and costs associated with the implementation of new corporate governance initiatives 
as a percentage of total revenue  general and administrative expenses were for the year ended december  as compared to for the year ended december  discontinued operations for the year ended december  of  reflects the operating results of eight of the nine non strategic assets that were sold during the year 
included in this amount is gain on sale of  discontinued operations for the year ended december  of  reflects the operating results of three of the nine non strategic assets that were sold during the year ended december  and were owned in and nine non strategic assets that were sold during the second half of included in this amount is gain on sale of comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december total revenue increased by  or  to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december rental revenue  which includes base rent and percentage rent  increased by  or  to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december  the increase in rental revenue resulted principally from portfolio occupancy increases and re leasing and re tenanting initiatives of six property acquisitions in  four property acquisitions in and the properties acquired through the western transaction in november recoveries from tenants  which represents reimbursements from tenants for property operating expenses and property taxes  increased by  or  to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december  this increase resulted primarily from portfolio occupancy increases and re leasing and re tenanting initiatives of six property acquisitions in  four property acquisitions in and the properties acquired through the western transaction in november in addition  recoveries from tenants increased because recoverable expenses increased 
recoveries from tenants were for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  other income decreased by  or  to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december  the decrease resulted principally from a reduction of interest income on corporate notes receivable as certain notes were repaid in the fourth quarter of and during as well as a reduction in management fees which resulted from an increase in our ownership percentage of certain subsidiary entities 
the decrease also resulted from a reduction in lease termination fee income compared to the prior year and an increase in common area maintenance billing adjustments for that were credited back to tenants 
property operating expenses increased by  or  to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december  this increase resulted primarily from six property acquisitions in  four property acquisitions in as well as an increase in insurance costs as a result of added coverage 
property taxes increased by  or  to  from  for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the increase in property taxes was primarily the result of property tax re assessments on the assets acquired in the western transaction as well as property tax expense for the assets acquired in and 
table of contents depreciation and amortization increased by  or  to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december  this was primarily due to additional depreciation expense on tenant improvements  building renovations and pad build out expenditures incurred during and as well as depreciation expense on the assets acquired during and interest expense decreased by  or  to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily the result of a reduction in the libor component of our borrowing cost under our revolving credit facility over the comparable period in the prior year 
this decrease in our borrowing cost was partially offset by an increase in interest expense as a result of additional amounts drawn on our revolving credit facility to finance properties acquired during and interest expense also increased as a result of our issuance of  in aggregate principal amount of senior notes in april  our issuance of  in aggregate principal amount of senior notes in june and our issuance of  in aggregate principal amount of senior notes in december the stated interest rates of  and on the senior note issuances  respectively  are higher than our cost to borrow funds under our revolving credit facility and term credit loan which were paid down with the net proceeds of the notes offerings 
general and administrative expenses increased by  or  to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december  this increase resulted primarily from annual compensation increases during as a percentage of total revenue  general and administrative expenses were for the year ended december  as compared to for the year ended december  gain on sale of real estate totaling  in resulted from the sale of eight non strategic assets during the year ended december  gain on sales of non strategic assets in are reported under discontinued operations 
discontinued operations for the years ended december  and of  and  respectively  reflect the operating results of the nine non strategic assets that were sold during the year ended december  included in the discontinued operations of  for are gains on sales of real estate of  funds from operations the white paper on funds from operations approved by the board of governors of the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit in april the white paper defines funds from operations as net income computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  gaap  excluding gains or losses on sales of property  plus depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
we believe that funds from operations ffo is an important supplemental measure of operating performance for a real estate investment trust 
because the historical cost accounting convention used for real estate assets requires straight line depreciation except on land  the accounting presentation implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
since real estate values instead have historically risen and fallen with market conditions  presentations of operating results for a real estate investment trust that uses historical cost accounting for depreciation could be less informative 
the term ffo was designed by the real estate investment trust industry to address this issue 
we compute funds from operations in accordance with standards established by the white paper 
our computation of funds from operations may  however  differ from the methodology for calculating funds from operations used by other equity reits and  therefore  may not be comparable to these other reits 
ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap  is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs and should not be considered as an alternative to gaap net income 
ffo  as defined by us  may not be comparable to similarly entitled items reported by other real estate investment trusts that do not define it exactly as the nareit definition

net cash provided by investing activities increased by  to  for the year ended december   as compared to net cash used in investing activities of  for the year ended december  the increase was primarily the result of proceeds from the sale of real estate  the receipt of equity repayments from an unconsolidated entity  a decrease in acquisitions of and additions to properties  a decrease in funds held in escrow pending property acquisitions and a decrease in the issuance of notes receivable offset by cash used in the acquisition of center trust and a decrease in collections of notes receivable 
net cash used in financing activities increased by  to  for the year ended december   as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of  for the year ended december  the increase primarily resulted from a decrease in notes payable proceeds  an increase in notes payable payments  an increase in line of credit payments  a decrease in the issuance of senior notes  a decrease in issuance of common shares and an increase in distributions paid 
these increases were partially offset by an increase in line of credit proceeds 
comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december net cash provided by operating activities increased by  to  for the year ended december   as compared to  for the year ended december  the increase was primarily the result of an increase in operating income due to property acquisitions

these increases were offset by an increase in line of credit payments and an increase in distributions paid 
liquidity and capital resources our total market capitalization at december  was approximately  based on the market closing price of our common stock at december  of per share assuming the conversion of  operating subsidiary units to common stock and our debt outstanding of approximately  exclusive of accounts payable and accrued expenses 
as a result  our debt to total market capitalization ratio was approximately at december  our board of directors adopted a policy of limiting our indebtedness to approximately of our total market capitalization 
however  our board of directors may from time to time modify our debt policy in light of current economic or market conditions including  but not limited to  the relative costs of debt and equity capital  market conditions for debt and equity securities and fluctuations in the market price of our common stock 
accordingly  we may increase or decrease our debt to market capitalization ratio beyond the limit described above 
in march  we entered into a new  revolving credit facility with a maturity date of march at december   we had  drawn on our revolving credit facility leaving  available to borrow 
at our option  amounts borrowed under our revolving credit facility bear interest at either libor plus or a reference rate 
the weighted average interest rate for short term libor contracts under our revolving credit facility at december  was 
we will continue to use our revolving credit facility to take advantage of select acquisition opportunities as well as to provide funds for general corporate purposes 
in september  we drew down  on our revolving credit facility to pay off the mortgage note on the mineral king property and the construction loan on the olympia place development 
during  nine non strategic assets were sold  including two regional malls that were acquired as part of the center trust acquisition  which generated net cash proceeds of approximately  which were used primarily to repay borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
in june  we issued  of senior notes due june  in december  we issued  of senior notes due january  in june  we issued  of senior notes due june  the net proceeds from these offerings were used to repay borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
we may in the future enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps  caps and treasury locks in order to mitigate our interest rate risk on a related financial instrument  however we are not a party to any derivative financial instruments at december  further  we do not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative or trading purposes nor do we enter into energy or commodity contracts 
we have entered into certain related party transactions with executive officers and affiliates of the company 
information on these related party transactions can be found in our consolidated financial statements  and the notes thereto  appearing elsewhere in this report 
we expect to make distributions from net cash provided by operations 
operating cash flows in excess of amounts to be used for distributions will be invested primarily in short term investments such as collateralized securities of the united states government or its agencies  high grade commercial paper and bank deposits or be used to pay down outstanding balances on our revolving credit facility  if any 

table of contents the following table provides recent historical distribution information quarter ended date declared record date date paid distribution per share march  january  february  march  june  may  may  june  september  august  august  september  december  november  november  december  march  february  february  march  june  may  may  june  september  august  august  september  december  october  november  december  march  january  january  february  june  may  may  june  september  august  august  september  december  november  november  december  we expect to meet our short term liquidity requirements generally through our current working capital and net cash provided by operations 
we believe that our net cash provided by operations will be sufficient to allow us to make the distributions necessary to enable us to continue to qualify as a reit 
we also believe that the foregoing sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund our short term liquidity needs for the foreseeable future 
we expect to meet our long term liquidity requirements such as property acquisitions and developments  scheduled debt maturities  renovations  expansions and other non recurring capital improvements through long term secured and unsecured indebtedness  the issuance of additional equity or debt securities and the use of net proceeds from the disposition of non strategic assets 
we also expect to use funds available under our revolving credit facility to finance acquisition and development activities and capital improvements on an interim basis 
off balance sheet arrangements on september   plaza escuela holding co  llc completed a financing transaction with an initial funding of  bearing interest at  wherein we received a partial payoff of  on our note receivable of  on the plaza escuela property in walnut creek  california 
the remaining balance of our note of  was converted to a non managing member interest in plaza escuela holding co  llc  the entity that owns the property 
in january  we received a return of capital of  in may  we received a return of capital of  in august  we received a return of capital of  our remaining equity position of  continues to earn a preferred return of 
in addition  we are entitled to receive of the operating cash flows from the property through november proceeds from the returns of capital and cash flow participation were used primarily to repay borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
at december   the balance of the plaza escuela holding co  llc loan was  the loan is secured by the property and is not guaranteed by us 
we account for this joint venture under the equity method 
this unconsolidated debt is one of two off balance sheet financings to which we are a party 
we are a general partner of a joint venture that owns north coast health center  a medical office building in encinitas  california 
during the second quarter of  the joint venture entered into a loan agreement for  bearing interest at  to purchase the building on the property 
at december   the balance of the loan was  the loan is secured by the property and is not guaranteed by us 
we account for this joint venture under the equity method 
this unconsolidated debt is one of two off balance sheet financings to which we are a party 

table of contents contractual obligations and contingent liabilities all of our indebtedness is disclosed in our consolidated financial statements  and the notes thereto  appearing elsewhere in this report 
our indebtedness outstanding at december   which includes regularly scheduled principal reductions  balloon payments  scheduled senior note redemptions and amounts due on our revolving credit facility  is as follows year amount and thereafter payments due in the year include senior note redemptions of  payments due in the year include the balance drawn on our revolving credit facility at december  of  and senior note redemptions of  payments due in    and include senior note redemptions of     and  respectively 
payments due in and thereafter include property level bonds due of  with regard to the payments noted above  it is likely that we will not have sufficient funds on hand to repay these amounts at maturity 
therefore  we expect to refinance this debt either through additional debt financings secured by individual properties or groups of properties  by unsecured private or public debt offerings or by additional equity offerings 
we have future obligations relating to construction contracts and leases for real estate and office equipment under operating leases expiring at various dates through rental expense was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
committed amounts under construction contracts and minimum rentals under noncancellable operating leases in effect at december  were as follows and subsequent inflation substantially all of our leases provide for the recovery of real estate taxes and operating expenses we incur 
in addition  many of the leases provide for fixed base rent increases or indexed escalations based on the consumer price index or other measures and percentage rent 
we believe that inflationary increases in expenses will be substantially offset by expense reimbursements  contractual rent increases and percentage rent 
our revolving credit facility bears interest at a variable rate  which will be influenced by changes in short term interest rates  and will be sensitive to inflation

controls and procedures evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures we maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our exchange act reports is recorded  processed  summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the securities and exchange commission s rules and forms  and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management  including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer  as appropriate  to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 
in designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures  management recognized that any controls and procedures  no matter how well designed and operated  can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives  and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures 
also  we have investments in certain unconsolidated entities 
as we do not control or manage these entities  our disclosure controls and procedures with respect to such entities are necessarily substantially more limited than those we maintain with respect to our consolidated subsidiaries 
as required by rule a b under the securities exchange act of  we carried out an evaluation  under the supervision and with the participation of management  including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer  of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures 
based on the foregoing  our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that  as of the end of the period covered by this report  our disclosure controls and procedures were effective and were operating at the reasonable assurance level 
there have been no significant changes in our internal controls or in other factors that could significantly affect these controls subsequent to the date of their evaluation 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of our credit agreements and long term debt used to maintain liquidity and fund capital expenditures and expansion of our real estate investment portfolio and operations 
our interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs 
to achieve our objectives  we borrow primarily at fixed rates  although we use our line of credit for short term borrowing purposes  and could enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps  caps and treasury locks in order to mitigate our interest rate risk on a related financial instrument 
we are not a party to any derivative financial instruments at december  we do not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative or trading purposes nor do we enter into energy or commodity contracts 
additionally  we do not believe that the interest rate risk represented by our floating rate debt is material as of december  in relation to total assets of  and a market capitalization of  our interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques 
the table below presents the principal amounts  weighted average interest rates  fair values and other terms required by year of expected maturity to evaluate the expected cash flows and sensitivity to interest rate changes 
thereafter total fair value fixed rate debt average interest rate variable rate debt average interest rate principal amounts shown are in thousands 
excludes unamortized discounts on senior notes  net of unamortized premiums on notes payable  of  the fair value of notes payable  line of credit and senior notes payable approximates the carrying amount based on the current rates offered for loans with similar risks and maturities 
the table incorporates only those exposures that exist as of december   and does not consider those exposures or positions which could arise after that date 
moreover  because firm commitments are not presented in the table above  the information presented therein has limited predictive value 
as a result  our interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during the period and interest rates
