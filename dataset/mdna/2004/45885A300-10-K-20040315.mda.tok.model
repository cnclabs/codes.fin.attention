item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes provided under part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
overview we provide high performance  managed internet connectivity solutions to business customers who require guaranteed network availability and high performance levels for business critical applications  such as e commerce  video and audio streaming  voice over internet protocol  virtual private networks and supply chain management 
we deliver services through our network access points  which feature multiple direct high speed connections to major internet networks 
our proprietary route optimization technology monitors the performance of these internet networks and allows us to intelligently route our customers internet traffic over the optimal internet path in a way that minimizes data loss and network delay 
we believe this approach provides better performance  control  predictability and reliability than conventional internet connectivity providers 
our service level agreements guarantee performance across the entire internet in the united states  excluding local connections  whereas conventional internet connectivity providers typically only guarantee performance on their own network 
we provide services to customers in various industry verticals  including financial services  entertainment and media  travel  e commerce and retail and technology 
as of december   we provided our services to over  customers in the united states and abroad  including approximately customers in the fortune companies 
at december   we operated network access points in metropolitan market areas 
during  our total number of network access points were reduced from to  with nine network access points relocated during the year to lower operating cost  enhance customer connectivity and improve our technology 
due to the nature of the services we provide  we generally price our internet connectivity services at a premium to the services offered by conventional internet connectivity service providers 
we believe customers with business critical internet applications will continue to demand the highest quality of service as their internet connectivity needs grow and become even more complex and  as such  will continue to pay a premium for our high performance managed internet connectivity services 
our success in executing our premium pricing strategy depends  to a significant degree  on our ability to differentiate our connectivity solutions from lower cost alternatives 
the key measures of our success in achieving this differentiation are revenue and customer growth 
during  our net new customers increased by to over  enterprise customers as of december  revenue for the year ended december  increased to million  compared to revenue of million for the year ended december  we intend to increase revenue by leveraging the capabilities of our existing network access points 
in our existing markets  we realize incremental margin as new customers are added 
additional volume in an existing market allows improved utilization of existing facilities and an improved ability to cost effectively predict and acquire additional network capacity 
conversely  decreases in the number of customers in an established market lead to decreased facility utilization and increase the possibility that direct network resources are not cost efficiently employed 
these factors have a direct bearing on our financial position and results of operations 

table of contents we also intend to increase revenue by expanding our geographic coverage in key markets in the united states and abroad 
as we enter new geographic markets  operating results will be affected by increased expenses for hiring  training and managing new employees  acquiring and implementing new systems and expenses for new facilities 
our ability to generate increased revenues depends on the success of our cost control measures as we expand our geographic coverage 
finally  we intend to increase revenue by expanding our complementary managed internet service product offerings 
these services include  but are not limited to  content distribution  virtual private networking  colocation services  managed security  managed storage  video conferencing and voice over internet protocol services 
business combinations on october   we completed our acquisition of netvmg 
the acquisition was recorded using the purchase method of accounting under statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 business combinations sfas 
the aggregate purchase price of the acquired company  plus related charges  was approximately million and was comprised of  shares of our series a preferred stock  acquisition costs and warrants to purchase million shares of our common stock 
the warrants are exercisable only in the event the former netvmg shareholders invest an amount no less than million in any future private placement of our equity securities 
results of operations of netvmg have been included in our financial results since the closing date of the transaction 
on october   we completed our acquisition of sockeye 
the acquisition was recorded using the purchase method of accounting under sfas the aggregate purchase price of the acquired company  plus related charges  was approximately million and was comprised of  shares of our common stock and acquisition costs 
results of operations of sockeye have been included in our financial results since the closing date of the transaction 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  customer credit risk  investments  goodwill and other intangible assets  long lived assets  income taxes  restructuring costs  long term service contracts  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies affect the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
the majority of our revenue is derived from high performance internet connectivity and related colocation services 
our revenues are generated primarily from the sale of internet connectivity services at fixed rates or usage based pricing to our customers that desire a ds or faster connection and other ancillary services  such as colocation  content distribution  server management and installation services  virtual private networking services  managed security services  data backup  remote storage and restoration services  and video conferencing services 
we also offer t and fractional ds connections at fixed rates 
we recognize revenues when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the service has been provided  the fees for the service rendered are fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
contracts and sales or purchase orders are generally used to determine the existence of an arrangement 
we test for availability or use shipping documents when applicable to verify delivery of our product or service 
we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment 
deferred revenues consist of revenues for services to be delivered in the future and consist primarily of advance billings  which are amortized over the respective service period  and billings for initial installation of customer network equipment  which are amortized over the estimated life of the customer relationship 
revenues associated with billings for installation of customer network equipment are deferred and amortized over the estimated life of the customer relationship  as the installation service is integral to our primary service offering and does not have value to a customer on a stand alone basis 
customer credit risk 
we review the creditworthiness of our customers routinely 
if we determine that collection of service revenues is uncertain  we do not recognize revenue until cash has been collected 
additionally  we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments on accounts receivable 
to establish the amount of the allowances against revenue and receivables on the balance sheet  we apply a credit risk rating system that is based on management s best understanding of our customers ability to pay 
our assessment of customers creditworthiness may include consideration of payment history 
the sum of individual customer receivable balances multiplied by the credit rating is the basis for reserves against revenues and receivables 
we also increase our reserve estimates for estimated customer credits 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  or management becomes aware of new information impacting a customer s credit risk  additional allowances may be required 

table of contents investments 
we account for investments without readily determinable fair values at historical cost  as determined by our initial investment 
the recorded value of cost basis investments is periodically reviewed to determine the propriety of the recorded basis 
when a decline in the value that is judged to be other than temporary has occurred  based on available data  the cost basis is reduced and an investment loss is recorded 
we account for investments that provide us with the ability to exercise significant influence  but not control  over an investee using the equity method of accounting 
significant influence  but not control  is generally deemed to exist if we have an ownership interest in the voting stock of the investee of between and  although other factors  such as minority interest protections  are considered in determining whether the equity method of accounting is appropriate 
as of december   we have a single investment that qualifies for equity method accounting  our joint venture with ntt me corporation of japan  known as internap japan 
we record our proportional share of the losses of our investee one month in arrears on the consolidated balance sheets as a component of non current investments and our share of the investee s losses as loss on investment on the consolidated statement of operations 
goodwill 
we may record goodwill as a result of acquisitions 
we recorded goodwill as a result of our acquisitions of co space  inc  vpnx 
com  inc  netvmg  inc  and sockeye networks  inc 
we account for goodwill under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
this statement requires an impairment only approach to accounting for goodwill 
the sfas no 
goodwill impairment model is a two step process 
first  it requires a comparison of the book value of net assets to the fair value of the related operations that have goodwill assigned to them 
if the fair value is determined to be less than book value  a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment 
in this process  a fair value for goodwill is estimated  based in part on the fair value of the operations used in the first step  and is compared to the carrying value for goodwill 
any shortfall of the fair value below carrying value represents the amount of goodwill impairment 
sfas no 
requires goodwill to be tested for impairment annually at the same time every year and when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is reasonably possible that impairment may exist 
we selected august as our annual testing date 
to estimate fair value in the future  for purposes of completing the first step of the sfas no 
analysis  we will use a market based analysis based on the value of our equity and a discounted cash flow analysis 
the forecasts of future cash flows will be based on our best estimate of future revenues  operating costs and general market conditions  and is subject to review and approval by senior management 
both approaches to determining fair value will depend on our stock price since market capitalization will impact the discount rate to be applied as well as a market multiple analyses 
changes in the forecast could cause us to either pass or fail the first step test and could result in the impairment of goodwill 
restructuring liability 
when circumstances warrant  we may elect to exit certain business activities or change the manner in which we conduct ongoing operations 
when such a change is made  management will estimate the costs to exit a business or restructure ongoing operations 
the components of the estimates may include estimates and assumptions regarding the timing and costs of future events and activities that represent management s best expectations based on known facts and circumstances at the time of estimation 
management periodically reviews its restructuring estimates and assumptions relative to new information  if any  of which it becomes aware 
should circumstances warrant  management will adjust its previous estimates to reflect what it then believes to be a more accurate representation of expected future costs 
because management s estimates and assumptions regarding restructuring costs include probabilities of future events  such estimates are inherently vulnerable to changes due to unforeseen circumstances  changes in market conditions  regulatory changes  changes in existing business practices and other circumstances that could materially and adversely affect our results of operations 
a change in our restructuring estimates in a future period  compared to the million restructuring liability at december  would result in a million expense or benefit in the statement of operations during the period in which the change in estimate occurred 
deferred taxes 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
since inception we have recorded a valuation allowance equal to our net deferred tax assets 
although we consider the potential for future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we determine we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
network service commitment liability 
we monitor our network service commitments with our network service providers 
when we determine that a service commitment will not be achieved through the ordinary course of business and the service provider is not expected to provide relief from the commitment  we record an expense to the direct costs of network and a liability for the estimated shortfall 
if we are unable to continue increasing our base of customers or if our customer base decreases  we may experience a deterioration of our operating margins 

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  which clarifies the application of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements  relating to consolidation of certain entities 
first  fin requires identification of our participation in variable interest entities vie  which are defined as entities with a level of invested equity that is not sufficient to fund future activities to permit them to operate on a stand alone basis  or whose equity holders lack certain characteristics of a controlling financial interest 
then  for entities identified as vie  fin sets forth a model to evaluate potential consolidation based on an assessment of which party to the vie  if any  bears a majority of the exposure to its expected losses  or stands to gain from a majority of its expected returns 
fin also sets forth certain disclosures regarding interests in vie that are deemed significant  even if consolidation is not required 
we evaluated our investments and other relationships and concluded that none qualify as a vie as defined in fin on may   the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
this statement establishes standards for classifying and measuring as liabilities certain financial instruments that embody obligations of the issuer and have characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
this statement represents a significant change in practice in the accounting for a number of financial instruments  including mandatorily redeemable equity instruments and certain equity derivatives that are frequently used in connection with share repurchase programs 
this statement is effective for all financial instruments created or modified after may   and to other instruments as of july  we adopted the provisions of this standard during and it had no material impact on our financial position and results from operations 
results of operations our revenues are generated primarily from the sale of internet connectivity services at fixed rates or usage based pricing to our customers that desire a ds or faster connection and other ancillary services  such as colocation  content distribution  server management and installation services  virtual private networking services  managed security services  data backup  remote storage and restoration services and video conferencing services 
we also offer t and fractional ds connections at fixed rates 
we recognize revenues when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the service has been provided  the fees for the service rendered are fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
customers are billed on the first day of each month either on a usage or a flat rate basis 
the usage based billing relates to the month prior to the month in which the billing occurs  whereas certain flat rate billings relate to the month in which the billing occurs 
deferred revenues consist of revenues for services to be delivered in the future and consist primarily of advance billings  which are amortized over the respective service period and billings for initial installation of customer network equipment  which are amortized over the estimated life of the customer relationship 
direct cost of network is comprised primarily of the costs for connecting to and accessing internet network service providers and competitive local exchange providers  costs related to operating and maintaining network access points and data centers and costs incurred for providing additional third party services to our customers 
to the extent a network access point is located a distance from the respective internet network service providers  we may incur additional local loop charges on a recurring basis 
connectivity costs vary depending on customer demands and pricing variables while network access point facility costs are generally fixed in nature 
customer support costs consist primarily of employee compensation costs for employees engaged in connecting customers to our network  installing customer equipment into network access point facilities  and servicing customers through our network operation centers 
in addition  facilities costs associated with the network operations center are included in customer support costs 
product development costs consist principally of compensation and other personnel costs  consultant fees and prototype costs related to the design  development and testing of our proprietary technology  enhancement of our network management software and development of internal systems 
costs associated with internal use software are capitalized when the software enters the application development stage until implementation of the software has been completed 
all other product development costs are expensed as incurred 
sales and marketing costs consist of compensation  commissions and other costs for personnel engaged in marketing  sales and field service support functions  as well as advertising  tradeshows  direct response programs  new service point launch events  management of our web site and other promotional costs 
general and administrative costs consist primarily of compensation and other expenses for executive  finance  human resources and administrative personnel  professional fees and other general corporate costs 
the revenue and income potential of our business and market is unproven  and our limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our prospects 
although we have been in existence since  we have recently substantially completed significant operational restructurings  which have included substantial changes in our senior management team  a reduction in headcount from a high of employees to employees at december   streamlining our cost structure  consolidating network access points  terminating certain nonstrategic real estate leases and license arrangements and moving our headquarters from seattle  washington to atlanta  georgia to further reduce costs 
we have incurred net losses in each quarterly and annual period since we began operations in may as of december   our accumulated deficit was million

revenues for increased million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   an increase of 
revenue for internet protocol connectivity and third party services at our existing network access points increased primarily due to an increase in our customer base from  to  a increase 
pricing pressures due to general market conditions caused a decrease in our revenue per customer 
revenue from complementary managed internet services  such as content distribution  increased excluding the revenues from the acquisition of netvmg 
revenue for reflects the addition of netvmg operations subsequent to its acquisition in the fourth quarter 
we expect the composition of future revenue increases will include an increasing percentage of revenue from complementary managed internet services than in the past 
direct cost of network 
direct cost of network decreased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this decrease of million was primarily due to a reduction in negotiated rates with internet network service and local exchange providers throughout the decrease was partially offset by a increase in content distribution costs  which were in line with the increase in content distribution revenue 
facility costs comprise approximately one third of total direct network costs 
during  we anticipate achieving a reduction in these facilities cost due to the consolidation from to locations late in the resulting lower facilities costs are expected to be stable in future years with incremental increases directly related to expansion into new metropolitan market areas 
the remaining direct network cost is anticipated to maintain a similar relationship with revenue 
customer support 
customer support expenses decreased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this decrease of million was primarily driven by decreases in compensation and related costs representing of the decrease due to a headcount reduction of employees and decreased facilities costs representing of the decrease

table of contents depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization of property and equipment for the year ended december  decreased to million compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease of million was primarily due to assets becoming fully depreciated during  which were not replaced by the same level of purchases of property and equipment as during prior years 
amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets for the year ended december  decreased to million compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease of million was due to intangible assets becoming fully amortized during  which was only partially offset by amortization expense for the additional intangible assets related to the netvmg acquisition during pre acquisition liability adjustment 
as part of our acquisition of co space on june   we recorded a pre acquisition liability of million for network equipment purchased by co space 
during  we reevaluated the likelihood of settling the liability related to this equipment and concluded that a contingent obligation no longer exists 
therefore  the liability was eliminated resulting in a one time reduction in costs and expenses of million 
restructuring cost benefit 
a restructuring charge of million was recorded in for costs associated with the relocation of our corporate headquarters to atlanta  georgia 
this compares with a restructuring benefit of million in reflecting non cash restructuring plan adjustments and write downs net of additional restructuring and impairment charges 
other expense 
other expense consists of interest income  interest and financing expense  investment losses and other non operating expenses 
other expense for the year ended december  increased to million from million for the year ended december  the increase of million is due to a million increase in interest expense  offset by a million reduction in losses from our investment accounted for using the equity method 
deemed dividend related to beneficial conversion feature 
our net loss per share includes the effect of a deemed dividend of million related to certain conversion features of our series a preferred stock in in august  we completed a private placement of our common stock which resulted in a decrease of the conversion price of our series a preferred stock to per share and an increase in the number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of all shares of series a preferred stock by million shares 
we recorded a deemed dividend of million in connection with the conversion price adjustment  which is attributable to the additional incremental number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of our series a preferred stock 
see note to our financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
years ended december  and revenues 
revenues for the year ended december  increased by to million  up from million for the year ended december  the increase during was primarily driven by increased connectivity service revenues  accounting for of the increase  which reflects a full year of operations at the six network access points that were opened during  and an increase in our overall customer base from to  customers across our metropolitan market network access points 
revenues for the year ended december  also increased by million compared to due to a reduction in the term of a customer s service contract 
as a result of this reduction in the contractual service period and other factors  we changed the estimated life of the customer relationship over which we recognize deferred revenues from months to months  with months remaining at december  the current balance of deferred revenue attributable to the customer therefore increased to reflect the amortization of the remaining balance over the remaining customer relationship period 
also included are contract termination revenues of million collected from customers that discontinued service during the year 
of the remaining increase  can be attributed primarily to content delivery network services and the remaining can be attributed to colocation data center services  including facilities charges 
direct cost of network 
direct cost of network for the year ended december  decreased to million from million for the year ended december  the decrease of million in reflects reduced network cost and local access expenses representing of the decrease  resolution of disputes with network vendors representing of the decrease and lower third party colocation and service point facility costs representing an additional of the decrease

depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization of property and equipment for the year ended december  increased to million as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase is attributable to a increase in depreciation and amortization expense relating to network and service point assets  including the deployment of six additional network access points during the increase in depreciation and amortization related to network assets was partially offset by a decrease in depreciation and amortization related to non network assets 
this decrease was primarily due to retirements and write downs of assets during and other expense 
other expense consists of interest income  interest and financing expense  investment losses and other non operating expenses 
other expense for the year ended december  decreased to million from million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to losses incurred during on our investments in networks  inc and aventail corporation of million and million  respectively  and the million provision we recorded on a note receivable

these uses of cash were offset by a million decrease in prepaid and other assets 
the increase in receivables at december  compared to december  was related to the increase in revenue compared to the prior year as day s sales outstanding remained constant at days 
the decrease in payables is primarily related to a lower overall level of operating expenses in compared to net cash used in operating activities was million for the year ended december   and was primarily due to the net loss of million adjusted for non cash items of million  an increase in accounts receivable of million  a decrease in accounts payable of million  a decrease in deferred revenue of million  a decrease in accrued restructuring costs of million and a decrease in accrued liabilities of million

these uses of cash were partially offset by decreases in receivables of million and an increase in accrued restructuring costs of million 
the decreases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities are a result of our efforts to streamline operations during  resulting in lower monthly operating costs in the final quarter of the accounts receivable decrease is largely a result of improved collections during day s sales outstanding were days at december   and reached days during the first half of  ending at days 
the decrease in prepaid expenses is due to our focus on cash flow during and a related reduction in prepayment activities 

table of contents net cash provided by investing activities

we expect the purchase of property and equipment will increase during as we continue to enhance and expand our service offerings 
net cash provided by investing activities was million for the year ended december  and was primarily from proceeds of million received on the redemption or maturity of investments 
cash received was partially offset by million used for purchases of property and equipment and million contributed to our joint venture investment  internap japan 
of the million used for purchases of property and equipment  million related to the purchase of assets from our primary provider of leased networking equipment as part of terms of an amendment to our master lease arrangement with the lessor 
net cash provided by investing activities was million for the year ended december  and was primarily from proceeds of million received on the redemption or maturity of investments and million received from restricted cash related to a real estate settlement of a corporate office facility 
as part of the settlement  the lessor was paid from a restricted cash deposit 
cash provided from investing activities was offset by million used for purchases of property and equipment and million used to purchase investments 
the purchases of property and equipment primarily represent leasehold improvements and infrastructure purchases for our colocation facilities that were not financed through lease facilities 
the majority of the cash paid for purchases of property and equipment occurred during the first two quarters of to complete certain colocation facilities under construction during in connection with the restructuring plan adopted by management during february  capital spending for new colocation facilities was significantly reduced 
net cash provided by used in financing activities 
since our inception  we have financed our operations primarily through the issuance of our equity securities  capital leases and bank loans 
see liquidity below 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was million 
cash provided included net proceeds from issuance of common stock of million and proceeds from exercise of stock options and warrants of million 
net cash provided by financing activities was reduced by principal payments on notes payable of million  payments on capital lease obligations of million and a million reduction in our revolving credit facility 
net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december  was million 
cash used included million related to payments on capital lease obligations and million for payments of notes payable 
these uses were offset by proceeds of million related to exercises of stock options and warrants and million related to the sale of common stock  including stock issued to employees pursuant to the amended and restated employee stock purchase plan 
during we amended the terms of our master lease agreement with our primary supplier of networking equipment 
the amended terms of the master lease included a retroactive effective date to march   and extended the payment terms and provided for a deferral of lease payments of the underlying lease schedules for a period of months in exchange for a buy out payment of million in satisfaction of the outstanding lease obligation on schedules totaling million and for the purchase of the equipment leased under the same schedules totaling million 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was million  primarily related to a million issuance of series a convertible preferred stock  net of issuance costs  and million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock and the exercise of stock options 
net cash provided by financing activities was offset by million in payments on capital leases and million paid on a note payable 
net proceeds from financing activities were primarily used to fund operating losses during and  to a lesser extent  for purchases of property and equipment 
capital equipment leases have been used since inception to finance the majority of our networking equipment located in our network access points other than leasehold improvements related to our colocation facilities 
payments under capital lease agreements totaled million  million and million for the years ended december   and respectively 

table of contents on september   we completed a million private placement of units at a per unit price of per unit and issued an aggregate of  units  with each unit consisting of of a share of series a preferred stock and a warrant to purchase of a share of common stock  resulting in the issuance of  shares of series a preferred stock and  warrants to purchase equivalent shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share  which are exercisable for a period of five years 
in august  we completed the sale  pursuant to a private placement  of  shares of our common stock  par value per share  at a price of per share 
we received million  net of issuance costs 
liquidity we have incurred net losses in each quarterly and annual period since we began operations in may we incurred net losses of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was million 
we expect to incur additional operating losses in the future  and we cannot guarantee that we will become profitable 
even if we achieve profitability  given the competitive and evolving nature of the industry in which we operate  we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis  and our failure to do so would adversely affect our business  including our ability to raise additional funds 
we have experienced negative operating cash flow and have depended upon equity and debt financings  as well as borrowings under our credit facilities  to meet our cash requirements in each quarterly and annual period since we began our operations in may we expect to meet our cash requirements in through a combination of existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  borrowings under our credit facilities and proceeds from our recently completed public offering in march of our capital requirements depend on several factors  including the rate of market acceptance of our services  the ability to expand and retain our customer base  and other factors 
if our cash requirements vary materially from those currently planned  if our cost reduction initiatives have unanticipated adverse effects on our business  or if we fail to generate sufficient cash flow from the sales of our services  we may require additional financing sooner than anticipated 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain additional financing on commercially favorable terms  or at all 
provisions in our existing credit facility and the terms of our series a preferred stock limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness 
our credit facility with silicon valley bank of million expires on october  and we are currently negotiating its renewal 
under our credit facility as of december   we had million and million outstanding under the term loan and revolving credit facility  respectively 
we cannot assure you that this credit facility will be renewed upon expiration on commercially favorable terms 
we believe we have sufficient cash to operate our business plan for the foreseeable future 
public offering 
on march   we sold  shares of our common stock in a public offering at a purchase price of per share which resulted in net proceeds to us of million  after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses 
we intend to use the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes 
general corporate purposes may include capital investments in our network access point infrastructure and systems  repayment of debt and capital lease obligations and potential acquisitions of complementary businesses or technologies 
commitments and other obligations 
we have commitments and other obligations that are contractual in nature and will represent a use of cash in the future unless there are modifications to the terms of those agreements 
network commitments primarily represent purchase commitments made to our largest bandwidth vendors and  to a lesser extent  contractual payments to license colocation space used for resale to customers 
our ability to improve cash used in operations in the future would be negatively impacted if we do not grow our business at a rate that would allow us to offset the service commitments with corresponding revenue growth

credit facility 
we have a loan and security agreement with a million revolving credit facility and a million term loan with silicon valley bank 
availability under the revolving credit facility and term loan is based on of eligible accounts receivable plus of unrestricted cash and investments 
in addition  the loan and security agreement will make available to us an additional million under a term loan if we meet certain debt coverage ratios 
the balance outstanding under the term loan was million at december   while the balance under the revolving credit facility was million 
as of december   we had no further borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility 
as of december   the variable interest rate under the revolving credit facility was and the interest rate under the term loan is fixed at 
this credit facility expires on october  there can be no assurance that the credit facility will be renewed upon expiration or that we will be able to obtain credit facilities on commercially favorable terms 
the credit facility contains certain covenants  including covenants that require us to maintain a minimum tangible net worth and that restrict our ability to incur further indebtedness 
as of december   we were in compliance with the covenants under our credit facility 
common and preferred stock 
on september   we completed a million private placement of series a preferred stock and warrants to purchase shares our common stock 
the terms of the series a preferred stock contain restrictions our ability to incur additional debt without the consent of the holders of the series a preferred stock 
if we required additional debt financing in the future  we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain the consent of the series a preferred stockholders 
on august   we completed a private placement of  shares of our common stock at a price of per share 
we received million  net of issuance costs 
because we issued shares of our common stock in the private placement at a price below the conversion price of the series a preferred stock at that time  the number of shares of common stock into which the outstanding shares of series a preferred stock are convertible increased by million shares 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  we recorded a deemed dividend of million  which is attributable to the additional incremental number of shares the series a preferred stock convertible into common stock 
if we offer our common stock in the future at a price below per share  the conversion price of our series a preferred stock will adjust to that lower price and the number of shares of common stock into which shares of our series a preferred stock are convertible will again increase 
during the year ended december   series a preferred stockholders converted  shares of series a preferred stock into  shares of common stock at a recorded value of million 
as of december   we had  shares of series a preferred stock outstanding with a recorded value of million 
lease facilities 
since our inception  we have financed the purchase of network routing equipment using capital leases with our primary supplier 
our future minimum lease payments on the capital lease obligations totaled million at december  of this total principal amount million is to be paid over the next months 
we have fully utilized available funds under our lease facilities 
in april  we amended the terms of our master lease agreement with our primary supplier 
specifically  the lease amendment provides for adjustments to our required minimum quarterly revenue levels and minimum quarterly earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization levels 
under the lease amendment we paid million on april   which represented an advance payment of our lease payments due in march and april the terms of our master lease agreement  as amended  include financial covenants that require us to maintain minimum liquidity balances  minimum revenue levels  specified levels of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization and other customary covenants 
on september   we entered into an additional agreement to further amend our equipment lease obligations with our primary supplier 
this lease amendment provided for additional adjustments to our required minimum quarterly levels of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization and also provided for the removal of the requirement to maintain compliance with all financial covenants when we resume lease payments 
this lease amendment also required us to issue  shares of common stock to our primary supplier having an aggregate value of  based on the closing price of our common stock on september  the value of the common stock issued was recorded as an additional discount to the initial capital lease obligation and the discount is being amortized over the remaining lease term 
if we are unable to meet the requirements of the revised covenants under the lease or make payments when due  our primary supplier could immediately demand all remaining payments due under the lease agreement 

table of contents restructuring and impairment costs restructuring charge 
during  due to the overcapacity created in the internet connectivity market and internet protocol services market  we announced two separate restructurings of our business 
under the restructuring programs  management decided to exit certain non strategic real estate lease and license arrangements  consolidate and exit redundant network connections and streamline the operating cost structure 
as part of the restructuring activity  employees were involuntarily terminated 
employee separations occurred in all departments 
the majority of the costs related to the termination of employees in were paid during the total charges include restructuring costs of million 
during  we incurred cash restructuring expenditures totaling million  non cash restructuring expenditures of million  and we reduced the original restructuring charge cost estimate by million  primarily as a result of favorable lease obligation settlements  leaving a balance of million as of december  during the first and third quarters of  we further reduced our restructuring charge liability by million and million  respectively 
the first quarter reduction was primarily due to settlements to terminate and restructure certain colocation lease obligations on terms more favorable than our original restructuring estimates 
the third quarter reduction was primarily due to returning the previously restructured atlanta  georgia facility into service as the site of the new corporate headquarters 
pursuant to the original restructuring plans  the atlanta facility was not to be used by us in the future 
however  due to changes in management  corporate direction  and other factors  which could not be foreseen at the time of the original restructuring plans  the atlanta facility was selected as the location for the new corporate headquarters 
restructuring charge 
with the continuing overcapacity created in the internet connectivity market and internet protocol services market  during  we implemented additional restructuring actions to align our business with market opportunities 
as a result  we recorded a business restructuring charge and asset impairments of million in the three months ended september  the charges were primarily comprised of real estate obligations related to a decision to relocate the corporate headquarters from seattle  washington to an existing leased facility in atlanta  georgia  net asset write downs related to the departure from the seattle office and costs associated with further personnel reductions 
the restructuring and asset impairment charge of million during was offset by a million adjustment  described above  resulting from the decision to utilize the atlanta facility as our corporate headquarters 
the previously unused space in the atlanta location had been accrued as part of the restructuring liability established during fiscal year included in the million restructuring charge are million of personnel costs related to a reduction in force of approximately employees 
this represents employee severance payments made during restructuring costs 
for the year ended december   we incurred approximately million in restructuring costs which primarily represented retention bonuses and moving expenses related to the relocation of our corporate headquarters to atlanta  georgia 
we continue to evaluate our restructuring reserve as plans are being executed  which could result in additional charges in future periods 
real estate obligations 
both the and restructuring plans require us to abandon certain leased properties not currently in use or that will not be utilized by us in the future 
also included in real estate obligations is the abandonment of certain colocation license obligations 
accordingly  we recorded real estate related restructuring costs of million  net of non cash plan adjustments  which are estimates of losses in excess of estimated sublease revenues or termination fees to be incurred on these real estate obligations over the remaining lease terms expiring through these costs were determined based upon our estimate of anticipated sublease rates and time to sublease the facilities 
if rental rates decrease in these markets or if it takes longer than expected to sublease these properties  the actual loss could exceed this estimate 

table of contents network infrastructure obligations 
the changes to our network infrastructure require that we decommission certain network ports we do not currently use and will not use in the future pursuant to the restructuring plan 
these costs have been accrued as components of the restructuring charge because they represent amounts to be incurred under contractual obligations in existence at the time the restructuring plan was initiated 
these contractual obligations will continue in the future with no economic benefit  or they contain penalties that will be incurred if the obligations are cancelled 
asset impairments 
on february   management and the board of directors approved a restructuring plan that included ceasing development of the executed but undeveloped leases and the termination of core colocation development personnel 
consequently  financial projections for the business were lowered and  pursuant to the guidance provided by sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  management completed a cash flow analysis of the colocation assets  including the assets acquired from co space  inc the cash flow analysis showed that the estimated cash flows were less than the carrying value of the colocation assets 
accordingly  pursuant to sfas no 
 management estimated the fair value of the colocation assets to be million based upon a discounted future cash flow analysis 
as estimated fair value of the colocation assets was less than their recorded amounts  we recorded an impairment charge of approximately million

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not have any arrangements that would qualify as an off balance sheet arrangement 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk cash and cash equivalents 
we maintain cash and short term deposits at our financial institutions 
due to the short term nature of our deposits  they are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value 
as of december   all of our cash equivalents mature within three months and our short term investments generally mature in less than one year 
investments 
we have a million equity investment in aventail  an early stage  privately held company  after having reduced the balance for an impairment loss of million in this strategic investment is inherently risky  in part because the market for the products or services being offered or developed by aventail has not been proven 
because of risk associated with this investment  we could lose our entire initial investment in aventail 
furthermore we have invested million in internap japan  our joint venture with ntt me corporation 
this investment is accounted for using the equity method and to date we have recognized million in equity method losses  representing our proportionate share of the aggregate joint venture losses 
furthermore  the joint venture investment is subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk 
in addition  the market for services being offered by internap japan has not been proven and may never materialize 
notes payable 
as of december  we had notes payable recorded at their present value of million bearing a rate of interest which we believe is commensurate with their associated market risk 
capital leases 
as of december  we had capital leases recorded at million reflecting the present value of future lease payments 
we believe the interest rates used in calculating the present values of these lease payments are a reasonable approximation of fair value and their associated market risk is minimal 
credit facility 
as of december  we had million outstanding under our revolving credit facility with silicon valley bank and million outstanding under the term loan portion of that same facility included in notes payable above 
the interest rate under the revolving credit facility is variable and was at december  interest under the term loan portion is fixed at 
we believe these interest rates are reasonable approximations of fair value and the market risk in minimal 
interest rate risk 
our objective in managing interest rate risk is to maintain a balance of fixed and variable rate debt that will lower our overall borrowing costs within reasonable risk parameters 
currently  our strategy for managing interest rate risk does not include the use of derivative securities 
foreign currency risk 
substantially all of our revenues are currently in united states dollars and from customers primarily in the united states 
therefore  we do not believe we currently have any significant direct foreign currency exchange rate risk
