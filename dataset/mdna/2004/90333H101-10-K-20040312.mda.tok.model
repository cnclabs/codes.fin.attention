item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in part ii item certain information contained in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
see forward looking statements included in this report 
our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward looking statements because of various factors  including those discussed above and elsewhere herein 
management overview business we are a distributor of insurance and financial products and services to approximately  small and mid sized business clients 
we generate revenues primarily from commissions paid by insurance companies on the placement of property casualty p c and individual and group health  life  and disability insurance  which we refer to as group employee benefits  on behalf of our clients  fees paid directly by clients and other third party remuneration for employee benefit related services which we refer to as health welfare when combined with group employee benefits  and investment income 
commissions on p c  health  group life and group disability insurance  are typically calculated as a percentage  ranging from approximately to  of the annual premium 
these commissions generally recur at the same rate as long as the insurance is in force 
commissions earned from the placement of individual and corporate owned life and individual disability insurance are calculated as a percentage of corresponding premiums over the duration or term of the underlying policies 
traditionally  most of the commission revenue on these life and individual products  as well as on other traditional voluntary benefit products such as critical illness insurance  is recognized in the first year the insurance is placed  with the commissions paid in renewal years being relatively insignificant 
we also receive contingent commissions  which are incremental compensation for achieving specified premium volume and or loss experience goals set by the insurance companies for the business we place with them 
contingent commissions are recorded on the earlier of receipt of cash or when we receive data from the insurance companies that allow us to reasonably determine the amount 
fee based revenues related to employee benefits services are generally billed as services are rendered and may vary with factors such as the client s headcount or assets under management 
we have two operating segments insurance brokerage and specialized benefits services  and a third administrative segment corporate 
for  approximately of our revenues were derived from our insurance brokerage segment 
within this segment  approximately related to p c insurance and to group employee benefits 
approximately of our revenues in were derived from our specialized benefits services segment 
within this segment  approximately related to core benefits retirement and health welfare services  to benefits enrollment and communication and to executive and professional benefits deferred compensation and executive benefit programs 
all of specialized benefits services revenue and our group employee benefits revenue are considered health welfare 
our corporate segment had less than of our revenues in the majority of our operating expenses relate to compensation and employee benefits  which amounted to approximately of consolidated revenues in we refer to the balance of our operating expenses as other operating expenses  which includes selling related expenses  rent  communication expenses and other items 
other operating expenses were approximately of consolidated revenues in for more discussion on our business please refer to item business in this report 

table of contents market property casualty approximately of our consolidated revenues in related to p c business 
premium pricing within the commercial p c insurance industry has historically been cyclical  based on the underwriting capacity of the insurance industry and economic conditions 
from through  the commercial p c insurance industry was in a soft market  which is an insurance market characterized by a period of flat to declining premium rates  which negatively affected commissions earned by insurance brokers 
years of underwriting losses for insurance companies combined with the downward turn in the equity markets and interest rates caused insurers to increase premium rates starting in mid to late  creating what we call a hard market 
a hard market is an insurance market characterized by a period of rising premium rates which  absent other changes  positively affects commissions earned by insurance brokers 
additionally  the insurance industry was affected by the events of september   resulting in the largest insurance loss in america s history  which accelerated increases in premium rates for particular lines of commercial p c insurance 
in response to rising premiums  some of our customers increased their deductibles and or reduced their insurance coverage in order to reduce the impact of the premium increases  which negatively impacted our revenues 
the hard market  for many lines of coverage  began to slow in the second half of and throughout in the second half of  we began seeing premiums in most lines of coverage flatten and for some  even a decrease 
we are not able to predict whether this trend of moderating or declining premiums will continue  however  if it does  our p c brokerage revenues may be negatively impacted 
health welfare approximately of our consolidated revenues in related to health welfare business 
premium rates in the health insurance industry have generally realized a consistent upward trend due to increasing health care delivery costs 
in recent years  however  the upward trend in health care insurance premiums has been somewhat offset by the impact of the economic downturn and its resulting negative impact on employment levels of our customers 
additionally  reduced discretionary spending by our corporate clients has led to benefit cut backs and lower expenditures on consulting and other fee based services 
decreases in balances of assets invested within our clients retirement benefit plans and on new investments into those plans  on which we are paid commissions  has negatively impacted our retirement services business 
our health welfare business is most affected by employment levels and by the strength of the economy 
factors such as a tight labor market increase employers spending on benefits  high employment increases the numbers of lives covered within the benefit plans that we broker  and a strong stock market increases both existing assets under management and new investments 
in and into  we have seen the signs of an improving economy  although we have yet to see the benefits of increasing labor ranks or spending on benefits 
while we can not predict whether the economy will continue to improve or if employment and spending on employee benefits will increase  if they do  then our health welfare revenue may be positively impacted 
primary financial measures the financial measures that we use to evaluate our performance are organic revenue growth  which excludes the first twelve months total revenues generated from acquisitions  ebitda  which is income loss from continuing operations plus interest expense  income tax expense  depreciation and amortization of intangibles  and ebitda margin  which we define as ebitda as a percentage of total revenues 
you should not consider these financial measures as alternatives to other financial measures determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which we refer to as 
table of contents gaap or as alternatives to cash flows from operating activities  investing activities or financing activities or as a measure of liquidity 
in addition  please note that because not all companies calculate these financial measures similarly  the presentation of these measures in this report is not necessarily comparable to those of other companies 
we strongly urge investors or potential investors in our stock to review the calculation of ebitda and ebitda margin and the related reconciliation to net income loss presented in accordance with gaap in results of operations  below 
management s strategic objectives our business strategy focuses on generating organic growth in revenues  creating efficiencies in our operations and making disciplined and accretive acquisitions 
specifically  our stated goals are as follows organic revenue growth of over the long term  ebitda margin improvement to at least on a consolidated basis  and acquire each year  in revenues  at least of our prior year s consolidated total revenues 
organic revenue growth we believe that internally generated growth is more valuable than acquired growth 
our strategy for achieving our long term goal of organic growth includes client stewardship and retention best practices  consistent and aggressive sales management  cross selling across all of our major product categories within our business segments  and maintaining a balanced mix of p c and health welfare revenues as a hedge against market cycles 
we monitor and manage to a number of different operating statistics  including  but not limited to  sales pipeline by producer  cross selling within our largest accounts  client retention rates  and revenue mix by operating company 
all of these metrics are tracked and reported monthly and form the basis of our agenda  among other items  for our monthly operations meetings with each of our business unit executive management teams 
margin improvement our ebitda margins are currently among the lowest of our peers 
we have publicly stated that we believe we can improve our margins by basis points per year up to a consolidated margin  including corporate  of at least 
we currently benchmark all expense categories and work with operating management to develop and implement remediation plans for business units performing below our standards 
we are focused on increasing margins by restructuring the mix of incentive versus guaranteed compensation  consolidation of office space  implementation of best practices in operations and lowering the cost of our information technology by the consolidation of data centers 
additionally  we continue to capitalize on opportunities to leverage our fixed costs across a greater revenue base by acquiring fold in and other accretive businesses within our current geographic footprint 
acquisition strategy each year  our goal is to acquire companies with revenues equal to at least of our prior year s consolidated total revenues 

table of contents in most acquisitions  we issue a combination of cash  seller notes and common stock 
we also frequently structure our acquisition agreements to include contingent purchase price payments contingent upon reaching specified financial targets  commonly referred to as earn outs  which are paid in a combination of cash  seller notes and equity and are treated as adjustments to purchase price when the contingency is resolved 
additionally  many of our acquisitions have provisions for reduced consideration based on the failure to meet certain revenue and ebitda targets 
all acquistions require approval of our board of directors and  if greater than million in aggregate purchase price  also require the approval of our bank lenders 
please read note  acquisitions to our consolidated financial statements for more information on acquisitions 
we centrally manage our acquisition pipeline from the point of initial contact through to integration within our operations 
we only consider deals that are accretive to our earnings per share  and sellers must take a portion of their purchase price in our common stock 
all acquisitions are subject to a rigorous due diligence process  including an introduction to our culture and business strategy and the seller s commitment to both our sales and client service model and to a post acquisition integration plan 
currently  we are looking to expand only within our current geographic footprint of operations to maximize efficiencies and continue to build out the balanced revenue mix of p c and health welfare business 
in  we completed six acquisitions of retail insurance brokers 
in the first year of ownership we expect these acquisitions to add in excess of million in revenues  million in ebitda and million in net income in accordance with gaap 
quarterly fluctuations our quarterly revenues and ebitda may be volatile 
this is attributable to the following a significant percentage of commissions and fees in our specialized benefits services segment is typically earned and recorded in the fourth quarter  the timing of executive benefits and enrollment sales with significant first year commissions  and the impact of variations or timing in recording contingent commissions in our insurance brokerage segment 
quarterly fluctuations in revenues and ebitda make our performance less predictable than our peers who have less seasonal and non recurring revenues  which may negatively impact the value of our stock 
we have implemented various strategies to reduce the impact of seasonal and non recurring revenue  such as negotiating alternative commission schedules with insurance companies on products that have historically paid most commissions in the first policy year and diversification of our business model for enrollment business to drive more revenue in the first three quarters of the year 
we continue to focus on strategies that will provide a more predictable revenue stream  however  we cannot predict if we will be successful in these efforts or if market or other changes will result in a similar or greater level of unpredictability 
all revenues are recorded in accordance with gaap 
critical accounting estimates and policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap  which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
some of our accounting policies require management s judgment to estimate values of assets  liabilities  revenues or expenses 
in addition  it may require significant judgment to apply complex principles of accounting to certain transactions  such as acquisitions  to determine the most appropriate accounting treatment 
we believe the following significant accounting estimates and policies are material to our financial condition or results of operations and are subject to a higher degree of subjectivity and or complexity 
we continually evaluate our estimates  which are based on historical experience and on various other 
table of contents assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
if actual performance should differ from historical experience or if our assumptions were to change  it may materially impact our financial condition and results of operations 
please read note  nature of operations and summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements for a description of other significant accounting policies 
revenue recognition we record premiums and commissions receivable from clients  premiums payable to insurance companies and the related commissions income  on the later of the effective date of the policy or the billing date 
we record installment premiums and related commissions periodically as billed 
commissions earned from the placement of individual and corporate owned life and individual disability insurance are calculated as a percentage of corresponding premiums over the duration or term of the underlying policies 
traditionally  most of the commission revenue on these life and individual products  as well as on other traditional voluntary benefit products  such as critical illness insurance  is recorded in the first year the insurance is placed  with the commissions recorded in renewal years being relatively insignificant 
we record commissions on premiums billed and collected directly by insurance companies and contingent commissions when we receive data from the insurance companies that allows us to reasonably determine these amounts 
we are able to reasonably determine these amounts when we receive the cash  the notification of the amount due or the insurance policy detail from the insurance companies 
we receive contingent commissions from insurance companies based on premium volume goals and or the loss experience of the insurance placed with the insurance company 
we record fees for consulting and administrative services over the period in which services are rendered 
we record fees and or commissions related to benefit enrollment services when earned 
we consider the earnings cycle complete when we have substantially completed our obligations under the service contract  we can reasonably estimate the revenue earned and when there is no significant collection risk 
at the completion of an enrollment we record an estimate of first year fee and or commission income less an estimate of policy cancellations 
we maintain an allowance for bad debts and estimated policy cancellations based on our premiums and commissions receivable 
the policy cancellations component represents a reserve for future reversals of commission revenue on insurance policies in force at year end and is established through a charge to revenues  while the bad debt component is established through a charge to other operating expenses 
the allowance is determined based on estimates and assumptions using historical data to project future experience  and  in the case of bad debts  a specific identification of questionable items 
we periodically review the adequacy of the allowance and make adjustments as necessary 
future additions to the allowance may be necessary based on changes in the trend of write offs or cancellations which could increase due to changes in economic conditions and or our clients financial condition and which may have a negative impact on our financial position or results of operations 
goodwill and other intangible assets impairment we assess the recoverability of our goodwill and other intangible assets at least once a year or as required based on triggering events 
a triggering event is a change in business circumstances that indicates that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
examples of a triggering event include poor financial results or projections  deterioration of client base  loss of key employees or changes in the marketplace 
reviews for triggering events are performed at the operating company level  one level below our segments  and require the use of management s judgment 
upon identification of a triggering event we perform an analysis to determine the fair value of the operating unit using either market valuation data  such as recent transaction multiples of revenue or ebitda  or present value techniques 
both methods require substantial judgment 
if  as a result of an 
table of contents impairment review  we find that the carrying value of an asset is in excess of the fair value  we would be required to take a charge against current earnings 
the results of our reviews disclosed no such asset impairments in and future events could cause us to conclude that impairment of our goodwill or other intangible assets exists  which may have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 
business acquisitions and purchase price allocations all of our acquisitions have been accounted for using the purchase method  and the net assets and results of operations of the acquired companies were included in our financial statements on their respective acquisition dates 
frequently  our acquisitions have provisions for a reduction in consideration if the acquired company does not meet targeted financial results 
additionally  the acquisitions frequently have provisions for contingent additional consideration if the acquired company achieves financial targets 
additional or reduced consideration related to acquisition contingency provisions is reflected as an adjustment to goodwill when the contingency is resolved 
for significant acquisitions  we obtain an independent appraisal of the fair value of intangible assets acquired 
for others  we use a methodology based on an estimate of discounted future cash flows derived from acquired client lists and attrition rates to estimate the fair value of the expiration rights and other intangible assets at the date of the acquisition 
the methodology is derived from independent appraisals obtained in connection with our earlier acquisitions 
expiration rights are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated lives of five to ten years with ten years used in most cases  based on historical attrition that has generally been consistent year over year 
non compete agreements are typically valued at their stated contractual amount and are amortized on a straight line basis over the terms of the agreements  which range from four to seven years 
goodwill is not subject to amortization 
both the allocation of purchase price and estimation of useful lives require management s judgment 
if historical fact patterns were to change  such as the rate of attrition of acquired client accounts  we may be required to allocate more purchase price to goodwill or accelerate the amortization of expiration rights  which may have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
income taxes determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any related valuation allowance involves judgment 
gaap requires deferred tax assets and liabilities dtas and dtls  respectively to be recognized for the estimated future tax effects attributed to temporary differences and carry forwards based on provisions of the enacted tax law 
the effects of future changes in tax laws or rates are not anticipated 
temporary differences are differences between the tax basis of an asset or liability and its reported amount in the financial statements 
for example  we have a dta because the tax bases of our accrued liabilities are smaller than their book bases 
similarly  we have a dtl because the book basis of our goodwill exceeds its tax basis 
carry forwards primarily include items such as net operating losses nols  which can be carried forward subject to certain limitations 
a summary of the significant dtas and dtls relating to our temporary differences and carry forwards is included in note  income taxes to our consolidated financial statements 
at december   our dtas total million  and our dtls total million 
we are required to reduce dtas but not dtls by a valuation allowance to the extent that  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not ie  a likelihood of more than that any dtas will not be realized 
recognition of a valuation allowance would decrease reported earnings on a dollar for dollar basis in the year in which any such recognition was to occur 
the determination of whether a valuation allowance is appropriate requires the exercise of management s judgment 
in making this judgment  management is required to weigh the positive and negative evidence as to the likelihood that the dtas will be realized 
prior to the fourth quarter of  we carried a valuation allowance for our net dta based on our history of net losses and the resulting uncertainty as to whether we would generate enough taxable income in the future to 
table of contents utilize our dta 
in the fourth quarter of  based on five consecutive quarters of profitability  our improved financial condition following our initial public offering  restructuring our credit facility and on forecasted future results  management determined that it is more likely than not that our dta will be realized in future periods so we reversed the valuation allowance resulting in a deferred income tax benefit of million in in the event of adverse developments in our projections of taxable income or if our estimates and assumptions were to change  management might be required to reach a different conclusion about the realization of our dta and re establish a valuation allowance through a charge to earnings 
litigation matters we are subject to various claims  lawsuits and proceedings that arise in the normal course of business 
we do not believe we are a party to any claims  lawsuits or legal proceedings that will have a material adverse effect on our reported financial position and results of operations 
as further discussed in note  contingencies to our annual financial statements  we have accrued a liability for our best estimate of the probable cost of the resolution of these claims 
this estimate has been developed in consultation with internal and external counsel that is handling our defense in these matters and is based upon a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
it requires management s judgment to establish reserves for claims and litigation 
to the extent additional information arises or our strategies change  it is possible that our estimate of our accrued liability in these matters may change  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period 
debt covenants our existing credit facility requires us to maintain financial covenants  which we set  with our lenders  based on our estimates of future operating results at that time 
future operating results and continued compliance with our debt covenants cannot be assured and our lenders actions are not controllable by us 
currently  based on our projections of future operating results  we do not expect to violate any such covenants 
if our projections of future operating results are not achieved  resulting in a violation of our financial covenants for which our lenders do not provide a waiver or amendment  we could experience a material adverse effect on our reported financial position and results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period

we present ebitda because we believe that it is a relevant and useful indicator of our operating profitability 
we believe ebitda is relevant due to our leveraged capital structure and resulting significant amount of interest expense and due to our acquisition strategy and resulting significant amount of amortization of intangible assets 
we present ebitda margin because we believe it is a relevant and useful indicator in understanding how we view our operating efficiency 
we present organic revenue growth and feel it is relevant because it allows us to discern year over year growth in revenues related to the success or failure of our ability to execute on our sales and client retention strategies 
we understand that analysts and investors regularly rely on non gaap financial measures  such as ebitda and ebitda margin to provide a financial measure by which to compare a company s assessment of its operating profitability against that of its peers 
additionally  investors use organic revenue growth to provide a financial measure by which to compare a company s internally generated as opposed to acquired revenue growth to that of its peers 
ebitda and ebitda margin may be helpful in more clearly reflecting our operating performance that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on gaap financial measures  because ebitda and ebitda margin eliminate from earnings financial items that have less bearing on our operating performance 
organic revenue growth may be helpful by eliminating the impact of acquired revenue from revenue growth

in the fourth quarter of  we reorganized an administrative affinity group marketing operation  included as part of the insurance brokerage segment  after it lost its principal revenue source  commissions and fees generated from the sale of retiree military supplemental medical insurance 
this source of revenue was negatively impacted by federal legislation that changed the retiree military medical insurance program 
this operation was reorganized into three distinct units 
two of the three units were transferred to then existing operations 
operations at the third unit were terminated 
this decision resulted in a write off of receivables of million and a write off of other assets of million for a total charge of million in the fourth quarter of in  we sold a brokerage operation that generated revenues from commissions and fees on the sale of life insurance products primarily through third party agents  which we call wholesale distribution 
the wholesale distribution strategy of this operation did not fit with our focus on retail distribution  as a result  we sold the operation to the former owners of that operation and recorded a loss of million on the sale of the business 
included in the consideration received for the operation was a note receivable based on a future revenue sharing arrangement 
upon review of the current and future revenue streams generated and to be generated from the sold brokerage operation  we determined that the note was impaired by million 
the note receivable  originally issued for million  was written down by million in the second quarter of  written down by million in the fourth quarter of and written down by million in the first quarter of 
table of contents other charges in january  bernard h 
mizel retired as our chairman and chief executive officer and we recorded a charge of million related to the retirement 
in  in an effort to provide a simplified and common medical and dental insurance program to our employees  we decided to consolidate our insurance program into one self insured medical and dental plan 
prior to this plan  many of our acquired businesses had purchased their medical insurance on an individual basis 
these medical contracts were placed with a number of different regional and or national insurance companies principally on a fully insured basis 
these insurance brokerage businesses had an employment size that placed them into the insurance carriers community rated programs 
community rated programs are for businesses that do not have a sufficient employee size  generally less than employees  for the insurance carriers to evaluate their claim history and  therefore  the insurance carriers rate history on an individual basis 
in accordance with gaap  we were required to establish a liability for incurred but not yet reported claims 
since the prior insurance carriers categorized these acquired businesses as community rated  they could not provide us with historical claims information 
therefore  we could not reasonably estimate this liability at the end of our historical experience indicated that our average monthly claims were approximately million and the lag in reporting claims was approximately three and one half months 
in the first quarter of  we recorded a million charge to establish this self insurance plan liability 
we have purchased a specific and aggregate insurance policy to minimize our future exposure 
in the fourth quarter of  we changed from the self insured plan to a fully insured medical and dental plan 
the impact of this change did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in  several insurance carriers notified us that differences existed between insurance coverages placed and the corresponding premiums remitted 
after a comprehensive review  we determined that in prior periods coverage had been placed with the carriers without the establishment of the corresponding receivable from the client and payable to the carriers on the general ledger 
thus  after obtaining the necessary information from the carriers in  we were able to reasonably estimate and record the corresponding payables and receivables  net of commission revenues 
as the receivables related to the years through and collection would entail pursuing numerous former clients  we determined in the fourth quarter of that the collection of these receivables was remote 
in accordance with gaap  since the collection of the receivables was highly uncertain and the amount of the loss was known  we wrote off the million receivables in the fourth quarter of we have since strengthened our internal controls and systems to minimize the risk of similar discrepancies occurring in subsequent periods 
in december  we entered into a services agreement with ceridian corporation 
the agreement stipulated that ceridian corporation will provide administrative services to our customers and us 
we estimated that the conversion cost associated with this service agreement would be million and we accrued this amount in the fourth quarter of in march  the original service agreement was amended due to our announcement to sell usia 
please read discontinued operations below 
the amendment eliminated usia as a party to the service agreement  which resulted in the accrual of an additional million in the first quarter of in  we entered into a strategic marketing agreement with a technology company 
the agreement was terminated by mutual consent in the fourth quarter of  resulting in an accrual of million 
stock appreciation rights in  we adopted a long term incentive plan to provide a means to attract  retain and motivate employees 
as part of the long term incentive plan we issued stock appreciation rights  which we refer to as sars 
sars generally vest over a five year period  although accelerated vesting is possible under specified circumstances 
upon exercise of a sar  the holder generally is entitled to receive  in cash  the excess of the fair market value per share of our common stock on the date of exercise over the grant price of the sar 
the 
table of contents valuation of sars is based on the estimated fair value of a share of our common stock 
in accordance with gaap  compensation expense  or a reduction of compensation expense  for sars is recorded over the vesting period based on the change in fair value from grant date to each balance sheet date 
please read note  employee benefit plans to our annual financial statements 
we recorded a net reduction in sar related compensation expense of million in  resulting from a reduction in the fair market value of our common stock 
we recorded sar related compensation expense of million in upon the consummation of our initial public offering in october  the long term incentive plan was terminated and replaced with the equity incentive plan 
after the consummation of our initial public offering  we exchanged all our outstanding sars for stock options or stock under our equity incentive plan 
on november   all sar holders agreed to exchange their sars for stock options and the number of options that each individual employee was entitled to receive and the option exercise price  was known 
the historical accounting treatment of sars was finalized and all sars tendered in the exchange were cancelled 
in accordance with gaap  the sar program existing prior to our initial public offering was accounted for as a fixed plan  and compensation expense was measured by the difference between the quoted market price and the price  if any  to be paid by the employee 
the corresponding accrual for sar related compensation expense was reversed and offset compensation expense that was recognized upon the conversion to a stock option 
our stock price did not increase significantly prior to the consummation of the exchange of sars for options  therefore the financial statement impact of the transaction in which the sars were ultimately exchanged for stock options was a million expense which was recorded in the fourth quarter of upon the consummation of the exchange of all sars for options or stock  no further expense was recognized under our equity incentive plan in connection with the exchange 
equity incentive plan our company s board of directors adopted and a requisite majority of our stockholders approved a new equity incentive plan that became effective and replaced the long term incentive plan  upon the consummation of our initial public offering 
the equity incentive plan reserves up to million shares of our common stock for issuance to directors  executive officers  employees and non employee contributors 
awards may consist of options  sars  restricted shares  dividend equivalents or other share based awards and are granted to eligible participants under the plan 
upon the consummation of our initial public offering  approximately million shares of restricted stock  which were fully vested  were granted to nine executive officers 
a million expense was recorded for the value of the grant of restricted stock during the fourth quarter of redeemable common stock warrants in march  we issued warrants to purchase million shares of common stock issued at an exercise price of per share 
holders of the redeemable common stock warrants  issued in conjunction with a senior subordinated debt offering that was repaid in  agreed to terminate the put rights associated with the redeemable common stock warrants concurrent with the consummation of our initial public offering 
the aggregate value of the warrants was million and was reported as redeemable common stock warrants on our balance sheet prior to the consummation of our initial public offering 
the change in value of the warrants  which was recorded as change in value of redeemable common stock warrants in our statements of operations  was million and million for and  respectively 
early retirement of debt in august  we completed a million senior secured credit facility  further described below under long term debt 
the proceeds from borrowings under the credit facility were drawn  in part  to repay all 
table of contents amounts under our previously existing credit facility 
as a result of repaying the previously existing credit facility  we recorded an expense of million as early retirement of debt to reflect the prepayment penalty and the write off of remaining deferred financing costs in the third quarter of on october   we completed our initial public offering of million shares at a price of per share 
the cash proceeds of the offering after the underwriting discount were million 
after deducting offering expenses of million  million was used to pay down our indebtedness under the credit facility 
in connection with the debt repayment  we wrote off million in deferred financing costs in the fourth quarter of in april  we completed the sale of usia for million 
we received cash proceeds of million with the remaining consideration of million in the form of an account receivable 
of the million in cash proceeds  million was used to reduce our term loan and million was used to pay selling costs 
in connection with the debt repayment  we wrote off million in deferred financing costs in the second quarter of liquidity and capital resources liquidity describes the ability of a company to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the cash requirements of its business operations  including working capital needs  capital expenditures  debt service  acquisitions and other commitments and contractual obligations 
prior to our initial public offering  we relied on our ability to generate cash flows from our financing activities  such as the issuance of debt and equity  to supplement our cash flows from operations which were insufficient to fund our business operations 
following our initial public offering  we substantially reduced our long term debt  but still lacked sufficient cash flows from operations to fund our foreseeable debt payments 
so  in  we entered into a new credit facility  as further described below  and now consider our liquidity in terms of cash flows from operations and their sufficiency to fund our operating and investing activities 
when considering our liquidity  it is important to note that we hold cash in a fiduciary capacity as a result of premiums received from clients that have not yet been paid to insurance carriers 
the fiduciary cash is recorded as an asset on our balance sheet with a corresponding liability  net of commissions  to insurance carriers 
we earn interest on these funds during the time between receipt of the cash and payment to insurance carriers 
in some states  fiduciary cash must be kept in separate bank accounts subject to specific guidelines  which generally emphasize capital preservation and liquidity  and is not generally available to service debt or for other corporate purposes 
insurance brokerage transactions typically generate large cash flows  and the timing of such cash flows can significantly affect the net cash balances held at month end 
additionally  the seasonality of some of our businesses  particularly in the specialized benefits segment  can create period to period fluctuations in our cash flows 
we believe that cash and cash equivalents on hand of million and our availability under our revolving credit facility of million as of december   together with cash flows generated from operations  should be sufficient to fund our estimated million in debt principal repayments  working capital needs  acquisitions and budgeted million in capital expenditures through december  our liquidity thereafter will depend on our financial results and results of operations and future available sources of additional equity or debt financing 
our revolving credit facility provides us with availability of up to million  all of which is available for general corporate purposes  including acquisitions 
as of december  availability under the revolving credit facility was reduced by million for outstanding letters of credit 
our future operating performance and ability to service our debt will be subject to economic conditions and to financial  business and other factors  many of which are beyond our control please review our risks related to our business in item of this report

net cash provided by operating activities 
table of contents totaled million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  and is principally dependent upon our results of operations and the timing of collection of premiums receivable and payments of premiums payable 
cash provided by operating activities was negatively impacted in by the pay down of approximately million in liabilities existing at december  in our corporate segment related to pre initial public offering obligations 
these obligations did not exist at december   so we do not expect to see a similar drain on cash flows from operations in net cash used in provided by continuing investing activities totaled million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  which principally reflects acquisition activities and capital expenditures
