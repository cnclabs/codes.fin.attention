overview company acuity brands  inc acuity brands or the company is a holding company that owns and manages two businesses that are segmented based on the distinctive markets served lighting equipment and specialty products 
the lighting equipment segment of the company acuity brands lighting or abl designs  produces  and distributes a broad array of indoor and outdoor lighting fixtures for commercial and institutional  industrial  infrastructure  and residential applications for various markets throughout north america and select international markets 
the specialty products segment of acuity brands acuity specialty products or asp formulates  produces  and distributes specialty chemical products including cleaners  deodorizers  sanitizers  and pesticides for industrial and institutional  commercial  and residential applications primarily for various markets throughout north america and europe 
acuity brands  with its principal office in atlanta  georgia  has approximately  employees worldwide 
abl produces a broad array of indoor and outdoor lighting fixtures for commercial and institutional  industrial  infrastructure  and residential applications for various markets throughout north america and select international markets 
abl is one of the world s leading producers and distributors of lighting fixtures  with a broad  highly configurable product offering  consisting of roughly  active products as part of over  product groups that are sold to approximately  customers 
abl operates factories and distribution facilities to serve its extensive customer base 
asp is a leading producer of specialty chemical products including cleaners  deodorizers  sanitizers  and pesticides for industrial and institutional  commercial  and residential applications primarily for various markets throughout north america and europe 
asp sells over  different products through its salaried and commissioned direct sales force  operates six plants  and serves over  customers through a network of distribution centers and warehouses 
while acuity brands has been publicly held as a stand alone company less than three years  the two segments that make up the company are comprised of organizations with long histories and well known brands 
the spin off of acuity brands from national service industries  inc nsi was effected on november  through a tax free distribution to nsi stockholders of of the outstanding shares of common stock of acuity brands  inc  at that time a wholly owned subsidiary of nsi owning and operating the lighting equipment and specialty products businesses 
therefore  the results of operations prior to november  are based on certain assumptions more fully described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company operates on a fiscal year end of august strategy a long term objective of acuity brands is to be a broader  more diversified industrial manufacturing organization capable of delivering consistent growth in earnings and cash flow 
a broader and more diversified organization has less dependency on a single customer or market and generally experiences reduced volatility in 
table of contents earnings and cash flow caused by the cyclicality of a dominant industry 
acuity brands continued to focus on key initiatives during fiscal that were directed at creating a foundation for the achievement of the company s long term financial goals  which are as follows generating consolidated operating margins in excess of growing earnings per share in excess of per annum providing a return on stockholders equity of or better reducing the company s debt to total capitalization ratio to below in  the company demonstrated meaningful improvement in financial performance while experiencing no tangible improvement in one of its key markets  non residential construction 
the improvement in performance resulted from the benefits of numerous initiatives to introduce new products  expand margins  improve operating efficiencies  and lower costs 
the company delivered improved results while incurring costs and inefficiencies to redeploy resources within the supply chain at abl  which the company anticipates will strengthen future performance  and while confronting rising costs for certain purchased components and raw materials 
economic conditions were less robust than many economists predicted at the start of fiscal while gross domestic product gdp in the united states  the company s primary area of operation  is expected to increase approximately for calendar year  the company continued to experience weakness in certain key markets  including non residential construction  electrical utilities  and industrial manufacturing  many of which have reported declines from the previous year 
non residential construction is estimated to decline in calendar year by approximately or for acuity brands fiscal  the fifth consecutive year of decline 
for acuity brands  these conditions created a challenging business environment in characterized by weak demand in key markets and increasing costs for certain components and raw materials including steel and petroleum based products 
however  in spite of these issues  acuity brands grew net sales by approximately due primarily to initiatives that introduced new products  improved pricing and margins  and diversified the company s customer base and channels of distribution  largely through continued expansion into the home improvement channel at abl 
further  the company made investments to enhance and expand its global supply chain  to develop and introduce new products  to accelerate sales and marketing initiatives  and to implement new organizational development programs 
the cost of many of these initiatives and the negative influences impacting the company s key markets was more than offset by profit improvement programs implemented to enhance margins  improve operating efficiencies  and lower costs 
additionally  the company reduced debt by million as of august  while accelerating investment in key areas of the business during the year and continuing to pay million in annual dividends 
during fiscal  management intends to build on the success and momentum of initiatives implemented in prior years as well as engage in new programs to enhance customer service  product development  productivity  and profitability 
management also expects to continue investing in information technology capabilities at abl and to begin the implementation of an enterprise resource planning system at asp 
in  the company will focus on programs to enhance customer service and delivery improve product quality increase pricing and selling effectiveness accelerate productivity and operational effectiveness generate free cash flow the company wide focus of these programs will be to strengthen relationships with customers  reduce non value added costs  and drive excellence in every aspect of the company through a culture of continuous 
table of contents improvement 
the expected outcome of these activities will be to better position the company to deliver on its full potential  to provide a platform for future growth opportunities  and to allow the company to achieve its long term financial goals

liquidity and capital resources principal sources of liquidity for the company are operating cash flows generated primarily from its business segments and various sources of borrowings  primarily from banks 
the ability of the company to generate sufficient cash flow from operations and to be able to access certain capital markets  including banks  is necessary for the company to meet its obligations as they become due and to maintain compliance with covenants contained in its financing agreements 
the company s ongoing liquidity will depend on a number of factors  including available cash resources  cash flow from operations  and the company s ability to comply with covenants contained in certain of its financing agreements 
based on current earnings projections and prevailing market conditions  both for customer demand and various capital markets  the company believes that over the next twelve months it will have sufficient liquidity and availability under its financing arrangements to fund its operations as currently planned and its anticipated capital investment plan and profit improvement initiatives  to repay borrowings as currently scheduled  to pay the same quarterly stockholder dividends in as were paid in  and to make required contributions into the company s defined benefit plans

the company used its cash flow in primarily to reduce debt  to fund capital expenditures  and to fund quarterly dividend payments 
management believes that investing in assets and programs that will over time increase the overall return on its invested capital is a key factor in driving stockholder value 
the company spent million and million in and  respectively  for new tooling  machinery  and equipment 
the significant increase in spending in was due primarily to the consolidation of certain manufacturing facilities and enhancements to information technology capabilities within abl and investments to improve manufacturing and waste management capabilities at asp 
over the last three years  the company invested a total of million for new plant  equipment  and tooling  primarily to improve productivity and product quality  to create new products  to increase manufacturing efficiencies  and to enhance its customer service capabilities in each segment

for the year ended august   the company reported net income of million compared to million earned in diluted earnings per share were in compared to reported in net sales increased approximately and at abl and asp  respectively  in spite of weak economic conditions in key markets 
the growth in net sales was due primarily to greater shipments to the home improvement channel at abl  better pricing and product mix  and increased shipments to the industrial and institutional channel at asp 
this was partially offset by a decline in demand in the non residential construction market and the absence of sales from a small product line divested during the first quarter of fiscal consolidated operating profit was million of net sales in compared to million of net sales reported in  an increase of 
the increase was due primarily to the contribution margin from higher net sales  benefits from continuous improvement programs including sourcing initiatives to lower product costs  efficiencies resulting from the manufacturing network transformation mnt initiative at abl  and certain pre tax charges of million that were not repeated in fiscal and are more fully described below 
these improvements were partially offset by higher costs for certain purchased components and raw materials particularly steel which increased approximately million in  higher costs associated with programs to streamline the supply chain at abl  and costs associated with a product recall

corporate corporate expenses increased to million in from million reported in the increase in corporate expense in was primarily due to increased expenses associated with certain stock based benefit programs  liability insurance  and expanded audit services 
outlook management expects that fiscal will be a challenging year 
this caution is due to the potential for continued weakness in a key market  non residential construction  the significant impact of rising costs  particularly for certain components and raw materials  and the impact of growing government regulations 
in 
table of contents light of tepid demand for non residential lighting fixtures and the anticipated timing of raw material cost increases  operating results for the first half of fiscal are expected to be relatively consistent with those of the first half of fiscal for the full year  the company hopes to again make meaningful progress in towards the long term goals of growing earnings per share in excess of per annum  providing a return on stockholders equity of or better  and reducing the company s debt to total capitalization ratio to below 
management expects to realize benefits from continuous improvement initiatives and annual product and price review programs to help offset rising costs and expects to improve consolidated operating profit margins by at least basis points in in  the company expects to achieve its debt targets while investing approximately to million in capital expenditures and paying annual dividends of approximately million 
in  the focus of the organization will remain on improving the products and services it provides to customers  becoming more productive and efficient  and enhancing profitability while continuing to diversify and expand the many end markets and customers served 
as part of that effort  the company commenced the mnt initiative and other initiatives in to improve the capabilities and cost structure of the supply chain at abl 
mnt should be completed in fiscal and will continue to result in the consolidation of certain facilities into abl s most productive and efficient plants  as well as expand the worldwide sourcing capabilities of abl 
while a significant portion of the capital investment for mnt occurred in  management expects some carryover spending into fiscal expenses associated with mnt for severance and relocation have been  and are expected to continue to be  largely offset by cost savings and asset sales from the program 
the timing of future expense recognition will depend on the actual dates of certain events and may impact the company s quarterly results differently than management currently anticipates 
while the company incurred approximately million of unanticipated costs in related to programs to streamline the supply chain  including mnt  the overall net impact on financial results in was minimal due to the reduction or elimination of certain fixed and variable costs as a result of these business process changes 
management expects that the program to improve the supply chain at abl will have a positive impact on earnings in accounting standards adopted in fiscal in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
fin no 
requires the consolidation of entities in which an enterprise absorbs a majority of the entity s expected losses  receives a majority of the entity s expected residual returns  or both  as a result of ownership  contractual interests  or other financial interests in the entity 
fin no 
is effective for all new variable interest entities created or acquired after january  for variable interest entities created or acquired prior to february   the provisions of fin no 
must be applied during the first interim or annual period beginning after december  acuity brands adopted fin no 
in fiscal adoption of this interpretation did not have a significant effect on the company s consolidated results of operations or financial position 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  employers disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits an amendment of fasb statements no 
  and this statement requires disclosures in addition to those required by the original sfas no 
related to the assets  obligations  cash flows  and net periodic benefit cost of defined benefit pension plans and other defined benefit postretirement plans 
the company adopted this revised pronouncement in its fiscal quarter ended may  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for more information 
accounting standards yet to be adopted on march   the fasb issued an exposure document related to share based payments that would amend sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
the fasb has tentatively concluded that companies could adopt the new standard in one of two ways the modified prospective transition method and the 
table of contents modified retrospective transition method 
using the modified prospective transition method  a company would recognize share based employee compensation cost from the beginning of the fiscal period in which the recognition provisions are first applied as if the fair value based accounting method had been used to account for all employee awards granted  modified  or settled after the effective date and to any awards that were not fully vested as of the effective date 
using the modified retrospective method  a company would recognize employee compensation cost for periods presented prior to the adoption of the proposed standard in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no 
 that is  an entity would recognize employee compensation cost in the amounts reported in the pro forma disclosures provided in accordance with sfas no 
a company would not be permitted to make any changes to those amounts upon adoption of the proposed statement unless those changes represent a correction of an error and are disclosed accordingly 
for periods after the date of adoption of proposed standard  the modified prospective transition method described above would be applied 
the fasb expects to issue the final standard by december  the company expects to adopt the revised sfas no 
on september  and continues to evaluate the impact the adoption of the final standard will have on the company s results of operations 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 
critical accounting estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations addresses the financial condition and results of operations as reflected in the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
as discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to inventory valuation  depreciation  amortization and the recoverability of long lived assets  including intangible assets  medical  product warranty  and other reserves  litigation  and environmental matters 
management bases its estimates and judgments on its substantial historical experience and other relevant factors  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
management discusses the development of accounting estimates with the company s audit committee 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a summary of the accounting policies of acuity brands 
the management of acuity brands believes the following represent the company s critical accounting estimates inventories acuity brands records inventory at the lower of cost on a first in  first out or average cost basis or market 
management reviews inventory quantities on hand and records a provision for excess or obsolete inventory primarily based on estimated future demand and current market conditions 
a significant change in customer demand or market conditions could render certain inventory obsolete and thus could have a material adverse impact on the company s operating results in the period the change occurs 
long lived and intangible assets and goodwill acuity brands reviews goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives for impairment on an annual basis or on an interim basis if an event occurs that might reduce the fair value of the long lived asset below its carrying value 
all other long lived and intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss would be recognized based on the difference between the carrying value of the asset and its estimated fair value  which would be determined based on either discounted future cash flows or other appropriate fair value methods 

table of contents in july  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
acuity brands adopted sfas no 
as of september  sfas no 
requires companies to cease amortizing goodwill that existed at june  and establishes a new method for testing goodwill for impairment 
sfas no 
also requires that an identifiable intangible asset that is determined to have an indefinite useful economic life not be amortized  but be separately tested for impairment using a fair value based approach 
the evaluation of goodwill and intangibles with indefinite useful lives for impairment requires management to use significant judgments and estimates including  but not limited to  projected future net sales  operating results  and cash flow of each of the company s businesses 
although management currently believes that the estimates used in the evaluation of goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives are reasonable  differences between actual and expected net sales  operating results  and cash flow could cause these assets to be deemed impaired 
if this were to occur  the company would be required to charge to earnings the write down in value of such assets  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial position 
specifically  acuity brands has two unamortized trade names with an aggregate carrying value of million 
management estimates the fair value of these unamortized trade names using a fair value model based on discounted future cash flows 
future cash flows associated with each of the company s unamortized trade names are calculated by applying a theoretical royalty rate a willing third party would pay for use of the particular trade name to estimated future net sales 
the present value of the resulting after tax cash flow is management s current estimate of the fair value of the trade names 
this fair value model requires management to make several significant assumptions  including estimated future net sales  the royalty rate  and the discount rate 
differences between expected and actual results can result in significantly different valuations 
if future operating results are unfavorable compared to forecasted amounts  the company may be required to reduce the theoretical royalty rate used in the fair value model 
a reduction in the theoretical royalty rate would result in lower expected  future after tax cash flow in the valuation model 
accordingly  an impairment charge would be recorded at that time 
to illustrate the potential impact of unfavorable changes in the assumptions underlying the fair value model  a one hundred basis point reduction in the theoretical royalty rate related to the valuation of the holophane trade name acquired in would result in a pre tax impairment charge of approximately  or million  of the carrying value of the trade name 
self insurance it is the policy of the company to self insure for certain insurable property and casualty risks consisting primarily of physical loss to property  business interruptions resulting from property losses  workers compensation  comprehensive general liability  and auto liability 
insurance coverage is obtained for catastrophic property and casualty exposures as well as those risks required to be insured by law or contract 
based on an independent actuary s estimate of the aggregate liability for claims incurred  a provision for claims under the self insured program is recorded and revised annually 
the actuarial estimates are subject to uncertainty from various sources  including  among others  changes in claim reporting patterns  claim settlement patterns  judicial decisions  legislation  and economic conditions 
although acuity brands believes that the actuarial estimates are reasonable  significant differences related to the items noted above could materially affect the company s self insurance obligations and future expense 
the company is also self insured for the majority of its medical benefit plans 
the company estimates its aggregate liability for claims incurred by applying a lag factor to the company s historical claims and administrative cost experience 
the appropriateness of the company s lag factor is evaluated and revised  if necessary  annually 
although management believes that the current estimates are reasonable  significant differences related to claim reporting patterns  legislation  and general economic conditions could materially affect the company s medical benefit plan liabilities and future expense 

table of contents product warranty acuity brands records an allowance for the estimated amount of future warranty costs when the related revenue is recognized  primarily based on historical experience 
excluding costs related to recalls due to faulty components provided by third parties  historical warranty costs have been within expectations
