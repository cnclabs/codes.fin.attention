item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the service areas along the i corridor have similar economic characteristics of population growth and business diversity among service  retail and manufacturing 
among the three service areas along the i corridor  the rockford service area has the highest concentration of manufacturing activities 
the community banking service areas  on the other hand  have less growth potential and have a greater concentration of smaller sized business and agricultural concentrations 
at the end of  economic conditions in the madison service area were characterized as strong with low unemployment 
in the chicagoland service area  economic conditions were stable with strong development activity and loan growth 
in the rockford service area  economic conditions were characterized as declining with high unemployment  primarily due to tightening of employment opportunities in the manufacturing sector with cutbacks and layoffs 
economic conditions in community banking service areas were relatively stable with the exception of the agricultural sector which was experiencing some weakness 
the bank has locations throughout northern illinois  excluding the far northwestern counties  including the illinois cities of rockford  algonquin  elgin  carpentersville  crystal lake  des plaines  lincolnshire  mchenry  schaumburg  oak brook  aurora  st

table of contents and the surrounding communities 
the bank conducts business at locations throughout south central wisconsin  including the wisconsin cities of madison  monroe  baraboo  portage  mt 
horeb  waukesha and the surrounding communities 
through its banking locations  amcore provides various personal banking  commercial banking and related financial services 
amcore also conducts banking business through six supermarket branches  which gives the customer convenient access to bank services seven days a week 
investment portfolio and policies as a complement to its commercial and retail banking segments  the bank also carries a securities investment portfolio 
the level of assets that the company holds in securities is dependent upon a variety of factors 
chief among these factors is the optimal utilization of the company s capital 
after consideration of loan demand  excess capital is available to allocate to high quality investment activities that can generate additional income for the company  while still maintaining strong capital ratios 
in addition to producing additional interest spreads for the bank  the investment portfolio is used as a source of liquidity  to manage interest rate risk and to meet pledging requirements of the bank 
the investment portfolio is governed by an investment policy designed to provide maximum flexibility in terms of liquidity and to contain risk from changes in interest rates 
individual holdings are diversified  maximum terms and durations are limited and minimum credit ratings are enforced and monitored 
the bank does not engage in trading activities 
the amount of securities that the company is permitted to invest in that have a higher degree of risk of loss are defined and limited by company policy 
the investment portfolio is managed on a day to day basis by a professional investment manager from amcore s trust and asset management segment 
portfolio performance and changing risk profiles are regularly monitored by the investment committee of amcore s board of directors 
sources of fundings liquidity management is the process by which the company  through its asset and liability committee alco and treasury function  ensures that adequate liquid funds are available to meet its financial commitments on a timely basis  at a reasonable cost and within acceptable risk tolerances 
these commitments include funding credit obligations to borrowers  funding of mortgage originations pending delivery to the secondary market  withdrawals by depositors  repayment of debt when due or called  maintaining adequate collateral for secured deposits and borrowings  paying dividends to its parent company  payment of operating expenses  funding capital expenditures and maintaining deposit reserve requirements 
liquidity is derived primarily from core deposit growth and retention  principal and interest payments on loans  principal and interest payments  sale  maturity and prepayment of investment securities  net cash provided by operations  and access to other funding sources 
other funding sources include brokered certificates of deposit cd s  federal funds purchased lines fed funds  federal home loan bank fhlb advances  repurchase agreements  commercial paper and back up lines of credit via the bank s parent company  the sale or securitization of loans  and access to other capital markets 
core deposits from the bank s retail and commercial customers are considered by management to be the primary  most stable and most cost effective source of funding and liquidity for the bank 
retail banking segment retail banking services to individuals include deposit demand  savings and time deposit accounts and lending activities 
principal lending types include installment loans primarily direct and indirect automobile lending  mortgage and home equity loans  overdraft protection  personal credit lines and bank card programs 
mortgage and home equity lending have the lowest risk profile due to the nature of the collateral 
installment loans have an intermediate risk due to the lower principal amounts and the depreciating nature of the collateral 
personal lines and overdraft have the highest degree of risk since the loans are unsecured 
the bank card programs are a fee service for originating the relationship and no credit risk is retained by the bank 
the bank manages its retail lending risk via a centralized credit administration process  risk scoring  loan to value and other underwriting standards and knowledge of its customers and their credit history 
as a general rule  the bank does not actively engage in retail lending activities outside its geographic market areas

the bank has a limited portfolio of equipment leases and does not actively promote this type of financing with its commercial customers 
the commercial banking segment lending products are tailored to the specific customer needs facilities acquisition and expansion  equipment purchases and working capital needs 
commercial lending has a higher risk profile than does retail lending due to the larger dollar amounts involved  the nature of the collateral and a greater variety of economic risks that could potentially affect the loan customer 
the bank manages its commercial lending risks through a centralized underwriting process  serial sign off requirements as dollar amounts increase  lending limits  monitoring concentrations  regular loan review and grading of credits and an active work out management process for troubled credits

since  when illinois multi bank holding company legislation became effective  there have been many bank mergers and acquisitions in illinois 
these combinations have had the effect of increasing the assets and deposits of bank holding companies involved in such activities 
illinois legislation  effective december   permitted bank acquisitions in illinois by institutions headquartered in any other state which has reciprocal legislation  further increasing competition 
see supervision and regulation below in this item on september   congress passed laws allowing interstate banking and interstate branching 
a year later  nationwide interstate banking became effective allowing institutions to make acquisitions in any state 
beginning july   interstate branching became effective  and banks can merge with affiliate banks or establish de novo branches in any state 
individual states  however  have the right to opt out of interstate branching 
illinois and wisconsin have not opted out  however iowa has retained the de novo rules for branching 
employment amcore had  full time equivalent employees as of february  amcore provides a variety of benefit plans to its employees including health  dental  group term life and disability insurance  childcare reimbursement  flexible spending accounts  retirement  profit sharing  k  stock option  stock purchase and dividend reinvestment plans 
supervision and regulation amcore is subject to regulations under the bank holding company act of  as amended the act  and is registered with the federal reserve board frb under the act 
amcore is required by the act to file quarterly and annual reports of its operations and such additional information as the frb may require and is subject  along with its subsidiaries  to examination by the frb 
the acquisition of five percent or more of the voting shares or all or substantially all of the assets of any bank by a bank holding company requires the prior approval of the frb and is subject to certain other federal and state law limitations 
the act also prohibits  with certain exceptions  a bank holding company from acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than five percent of the voting shares of any company which is not a bank 
table of contents and from engaging in any business other than banking  managing and controlling banks or furnishing services to banks and their subsidiaries  except that holding companies may engage in  and may own shares of companies engaged in  certain businesses found by the frb to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto 
on august   the frb approved an amendment to add certain activities and to reduce the burden on bank holding companies that desire to conduct these activities by simplifying the regulatory review process 
under current regulations of the frb  a bank holding company and its non bank subsidiaries are permitted  among other activities  to engage in such banking related businesses as sales and consumer finance  equipment leasing  computer service bureau and software operations  mortgage banking  brokerage and financial advisory services 
the act does not place territorial restrictions on the activities of non bank subsidiaries of bank holding companies 
in addition  federal legislation prohibits acquisition of control of a bank or bank holding company without prior notice to certain federal bank regulators 
control is defined in certain cases as acquisition of ten percent or more of the outstanding shares of a bank or bank holding company 
there are a number of obligations and restrictions imposed on bank holding companies and their depository institution subsidiaries by federal law and regulatory policy that are designed to reduce potential loss exposure to the depositors of such depository institutions and to the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic insurance fund in the event the depository institution becomes in danger of default or is in default 
for example  under a policy of the federal reserve with respect to bank holding company operations  a bank holding company is required to serve as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary depository institutions and commit resources to support such institutions in circumstances where it might not do so absent such policy 
in addition  the cross guarantee provisions of federal law require insured depository institutions under common control to reimburse the fdic for any loss suffered or reasonably anticipated as a result of the default of a commonly controlled insured depository institution or for any assistance provided by the fdic to a commonly controlled insured depository institution in danger of default 
the federal banking agencies have broad powers under current federal law to take prompt corrective action to resolve problems of insured depository institutions 
the extent of these powers depends upon whether the institutions in question are well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized  or critically undercapitalized  as such terms are defined under regulations issued by each of the federal banking agencies 
in late  congress passed the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of that included many provisions that have had significant effects on the cost structure and operational and managerial standards of commercial banks 
in addition to provisions for recapitalization of the bank insurance fund  this act contains provisions that revise bank supervision and regulation  including  among many other things  the monitoring of capital levels  outline additional management reporting and external audit requirements  and add consumer provisions that include truth in savings disclosures 
the gramm leach bliley act glb act was enacted november  and  among other things  established a comprehensive framework to permit affiliations among commercial banks  insurance companies and securities firms 
to date  the glb act has not materially affected the company s operations 
however  to the extent the glb act permits banks  securities firms and insurance companies to affiliate  the financial services industry may experience further consolidation 
this could result in a growing number of larger financial institutions that offer a wider variety of financial services than the company currently offers and that can aggressively compete in the markets the company currently serves

amcore is supervised and examined by the frb 
the bank and aig are supervised and regularly examined by the office of the comptroller of the currency occ and are subject to examination by the frb

subsidiary dividends and capital legal limitations exist as to the extent to which the bank can lend or pay dividends to amcore and or its affiliates 
the payment of dividends by a national bank without prior regulatory approval is limited to the current year s net income plus the adjusted retained net income for the two preceding years 
the payment of dividends by any bank or bank holding company is affected by the requirement to maintain adequate capital pursuant to the capital adequacy guidelines issued by the frb and regulations issued by the fdic and the occ collectively agencies 
as of december   approximately million was available for payment to amcore in the form of dividends without prior regulatory approval 
the bank is also limited as to the amount it may lend to amcore and its affiliates 
at december   the maximum amount available to amcore and its affiliates in the form of loans approximated million 
there were no loans outstanding from the bank to affiliates at december  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the frb issues risk based capital guidelines for bank holding companies 
these capital rules require minimum capital levels as a percent of risk weighted assets 
in order to be adequately capitalized under these guidelines  banking organizations must have minimum capital ratios of and for tier capital and total capital  respectively 
the frb also established leverage capital requirements intended primarily to establish minimum capital requirements for those banking organizations that have historically invested a significant portion of their funds in low risk assets 
federally supervised banks are required to maintain a minimum leverage ratio of not less than 
refer to the capital management section of item for a summary of amcore s capital ratios as of december  and see also note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
governmental monetary policies and economic conditions the earnings of all subsidiaries are affected not only by general economic conditions  but also by the policies of various regulatory authorities 
in particular  the frb influences general economic conditions and interest rates through various monetary policies and tools 
it does so primarily through open market operations in us government securities  varying the discount rate on member and non member bank borrowings  and setting reserve requirements against bank deposits 
frb monetary policies have had a significant effect on the operating results of banks in the past and are expected to do so in the future 
the general effect of such policies upon the future business and earnings of each of the subsidiary companies cannot accurately be predicted 
interest rate sensitivity has a major impact on the earnings of banks 
as market rates change  yields earned on assets may not necessarily move to the same degree as rates paid on liabilities 
for this reason  amcore attempts to minimize earnings volatility related to fluctuations in interest rates through the use of a formal asset liability management program and certain derivative activities 
see item a and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item for additional discussion of interest rate sensitivity and related derivative activities

item properties on december   amcore had locations  of which were owned and were leased 
the commercial  retail and mortgage banking segments had locations  of which were owned and were leased

see item and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item of this document for further information on properties 
in addition  amcore had atm machine locations that were available without fee to amcore customers 
item legal proceedings management believes that no litigation is threatened or pending in which the company faces potential loss or exposure which will materially affect the company s consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations 
since the company s subsidiaries act as depositories of funds  trustee and escrow agents  they occasionally are named as defendants in lawsuits involving claims to the ownership of funds in particular accounts 
this and other litigation is incidental to the company s business

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion highlights the significant factors affecting amcore financial  inc and subsidiaries amcore or the company consolidated financial condition as of december  compared to december  and the consolidated results of operations for the three years ended december  the discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements  accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements  and selected financial data appearing elsewhere within this report 
factors influencing forward looking statements this report on form k contains  and our periodic filings with the securities and exchange commission and written or oral statements made by the company s officers and directors to the press  potential investors  securities analysts and others will contain  forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities act of  and the company intends that such forward looking statements be subject to the safe harbors created thereby with respect to  among other things  the financial condition  results of operations  plans  objectives  future performance and business of amcore 
statements that are not historical facts  including statements about beliefs and expectations  are forward looking statements 
these statements are based upon beliefs and assumptions of amcore s management and on information currently available to such management 
the use of the words believe  expect  anticipate  plan  estimate  should  may  will or similar expressions are forward looking statements 
forward looking statements speak only as of the date they are made  and amcore undertakes no obligation to update publicly any of them in light of new information or future events 
contemplated  projected  forecasted or estimated results in such forward looking statements involve certain inherent risks and uncertainties 
a number of factors many of which are beyond the ability of the company to control or predict could cause actual results to differ materially from those in its forward looking statements 
these factors include  among others  the following possibilities i heightened competition  including specifically the intensification of price competition  the entry of new competitors and the formation of new products by new or existing competitors  ii adverse state  local and federal legislation and regulation  iii failure to obtain new customers and retain existing customers  iv inability to carry out marketing and or expansion plans  v ability to attract and retain key executives or personnel  vi changes in interest rates including the effect of prepayment  vii general economic and business conditions which are less favorable than expected  viii equity and fixed income market fluctuations  ix unanticipated changes in industry trends  x unanticipated changes in credit quality and risk factors  xi success in gaining regulatory approvals when required  xii changes in federal reserve board monetary policies  xiii unexpected outcomes on existing or new litigation in which amcore  its subsidiaries  officers  directors or employees are named defendants  xiv technological changes  xv changes in accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  xvi changes in assumptions or conditions affecting the application of critical accounting estimates  and xvii inability of third party vendors to perform critical services to the company or its customers  and xviii disruption of operations caused by the conversion of data processing systems 
critical accounting estimates the financial condition and results of operations for amcore presented in the consolidated financial statements  accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements  selected financial data appearing elsewhere within this report  and management s discussion and analysis are  to a large degree  dependent upon the company s accounting policies 
the selection and application of these accounting policies involve judgments  estimates and uncertainties that are susceptible to change 

table of contents presented below are discussions of those accounting policies that management believes requires its most difficult  subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain critical accounting estimates and are most important to the portrayal and understanding of the company s financial condition and results of operation 
in the event that different assumptions or conditions were to prevail  and depending upon the severity of such changes  the possibility of materially different financial condition or results of operations is a reasonable likelihood

loans and allowance for estimated losses loans are the company s largest income earning asset category 
loans are recorded at the amount advanced to the borrower plus certain costs incurred by amcore to originate the loan  less certain origination fees that are collected from the borrower 
the carrying amount of loans is reduced as principal payments are made 
payments made by the borrower are allocated between interest income and principal payment based upon the outstanding principal amount  the contractual rate of interest and other contractual terms 
the carrying amount is further adjusted to reflect amortization of the origination costs net of origination fees 
these items are amortized over the expected life of the loan 
the accrual of interest income is generally discontinued non accrual status when management believes that collection of principal and or interest is doubtful or when payment becomes to days past due  except for loans that are well secured and are in a short term  well defined process of collection 
payments received from the borrower after a loan is placed on non accrual status are applied to reduce the principal balance of the loan until such time that collectibility of remaining principal and interest is no longer doubtful 
management periodically evaluates the loan portfolio in order to establish an estimated allowance for loan losses allowance that are probable as of the respective reporting date and considered adequate to absorb probable losses 
this evaluation includes specific loss estimates on certain individually reviewed loans  statistical loss estimates for loan groups or pools that are based on historical loss experience and other loss estimates that are based upon the size  quality  and concentration characteristics of the various loan portfolios  adverse situations that may affect a borrower s ability to repay  and current economic and industry conditions  among other things 
if the allowance is not adequate  additions to the allowance are charged against earnings for the period as a provision for loan losses provision 
conversely  this evaluation could result in a decrease in the allowance and provision 
actual loan losses are charged against reduce the allowance when management believes that the collection of principal will not occur 
unpaid interest attributable to prior years for loans that are placed on non accrual status is also charged against the allowance 
unpaid interest for the current year for loans that are placed on non accrual status is reversed against the interest income previously recognized 
subsequent recoveries of amounts previously charged to the allowance  if any  are credited to increase the allowance 
the allowance is also subject to periodic examination by regulators whose review includes a determination as to its adequacy to absorb probable losses 
those judgments and assumptions that are most critical to the application of this accounting policy are the initial and on going credit worthiness of the borrower  the amount and timing of future cash flows of the borrower that are available for repayment of the loan  the sufficiency of underlying collateral  the enforceability of third party guarantees  the frequency and subjectivity of loan reviews and risk gradings  emerging or changing trends that might not be fully captured in the historical loss experience  and charges against the allowance for actual losses that are greater or less than previously estimated 
these judgments and assumptions are dependent upon or can be influenced by a variety of factors including the breadth and depth of experience of lending officers  credit administration and the corporate loan review staff that periodically review the status of the loan  changing economic and industry conditions  changes in the financial condition of the borrower and changes in the value and availability of the underlying collateral and guarantees 

table of contents while the company strives to reflect all known risk factors in its evaluations  judgment errors may occur 
if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail  the amount and timing of interest income and loan losses could be materially different 
these factors are most pronounced during economic downturns and may continue into an economic recovery  as specific credit performance may not be immediately affected by the stress of the downturn 
since  as described above  so many factors can affect the amount and timing of losses on loans it is difficult to predict  with any degree of certainty  the affect on income if different conditions or assumptions were to prevail 
nonetheless  if any combination of the above judgments or assumptions were to adversely affect the adequacy of the allowance by ten percent  an additional provision of approximately million would be necessary

mortgage servicing rights the company recognizes as separate assets the rights to service mortgage loans for others 
mortgage servicing rights that are retained when mortgage loans are sold are recorded by allocating the previous carrying amount of the sold loan between the servicing rights retained and the loans that are sold 
this allocation is based upon the relative fair values of the mortgage servicing rights and the loans sold 
because it is retained as an asset  the amount allocated to mortgage servicing rights will have a favorable impact on the amount of gain or loss that is recognized on the sale of the loans 
the mortgage servicing rights asset is amortized over the projected period of and in proportion to the estimated amount of net servicing income 
amortization of the servicing rights asset will reduce the amount of income that is recorded in the respective period from the servicing of the mortgage loans 
each reporting period  the company re evaluates the fair value of its remaining mortgage servicing rights assets 
the amount by which the unamortized carrying amount of mortgage servicing rights exceeds the new estimate of fair value is charged against earnings for the period 
rather than directly reducing the unamortized carrying amount of the servicing rights asset  a valuation allowance is established for the same amount as the charge against earnings 
in subsequent reporting periods  depending upon current estimates of fair value  the valuation allowance may be reversed 
the reversal is limited to the remaining amount of the valuation allowance and will result in an increase in recorded earnings 
the periodic re evaluation of fair value is based upon current estimates of the present value of remaining net servicing cash flows that incorporate numerous assumptions including the cost of servicing the loans  discount rates  prepayment rates and default rates 
this re evaluation is done by stratifying mortgage servicing rights assets into pools based upon one or more predominant risk characteristics of the underlying loans that are being serviced 
risk characteristics include loan type and interest rate 
valuation allowances required for one pool cannot be offset by the amount that the fair value of another pool exceeds its unamortized carrying amount 
judgments and assumptions that are most critical to the application of this accounting policy are the appropriate risk weighted discount rates used to determine the present value of estimated net future cash flows  prepayment speeds that will determine the amount and period of servicing revenue that is expected to be earned  estimated costs to service the loans and estimated interest earned on amounts collected for real estate tax and property insurance premiums that are held in escrow until payment is due 
these assumptions are based upon actual performance of the underlying loans and the general market consensus regarding changes in mortgage and other interest rates 
for example  declining mortgage interest rates typically result in accelerated mortgage prepayments  which tend to shorten the life and reduce the value of the servicing rights asset 
in addition to the judgments and assumptions affecting the application of this accounting policy  the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by sfas no 
 permitted mortgage servicers to restratify their mortgage servicing rights pools 
upon consideration  the company determined that its existing stratification was preferable 
table of contents to other alternatives and chose not to restratify its pools 
this represented the selection of an accounting policy that could have produced different results for and later years had the company chose to restratify its pools 
in general  the greater the number of pools  the greater the likelihood of earnings volatility associated with valuation allowances 
conversely  the fewer the number of pools the less likely there will be earnings volatility 
if different assumptions and conditions were to prevail  materially different amortization and valuation allowances than those that were recorded may be required 
since  as described above  so many factors can affect the value of mortgage servicing rights it is difficult to predict  with any degree of certainty  the affect on income if different conditions or assumptions were to prevail 
nonetheless  if any combination of the above judgments or assumptions were to adversely affect their value by an additional ten percent  an additional impairment charge of approximately million would be necessary

loan securitizations and sale of receivables during and  the company sold certain indirect automobile loans in securitization transactions 
upon the sale  the net carrying amount of the loans were removed from the consolidated balance sheet in exchange for cash  and certain retained residual interests 
the retained interests included rights to service the loans that were sold the servicing rights and an interest in residual cash flows the interest only strip 
the interest only strip includes the excess of interest collected on the loans over the amount required to be paid to the investors and the securitization agent the excess spread plus an interest in sales proceeds that were not remitted by the securitization trust at the time of the initial sale of the loans to the extent it exceeds projected credit losses the credit enhancement or overcollateralization 
the carrying value of the loans removed from the balance sheet included the unpaid principal balance of the loans  net of an allocable portion of the allowance for loan and lease losses  minus the portion of the carrying value of the loans that were allocated to the retained residual interests 
these allocations were based upon the relative fair values of the retained residual interests and the loans sold 
because they are retained assets  the amount allocated and recorded for the residual interests had a favorable impact on the amount of gain or loss that was recognized on the sale of the loans 
since the projected income from the servicing rights approximates what is considered adequate compensation for servicing the loans  no asset or liability was recorded for servicing rights 
income from servicing is recognized as earned pursuant to the terms of the servicing agreement and to the extent cash collections from the borrowers exceed payments to the investors and agent 
cash collections in excess of the servicing rights income that is earned is next applied to the interest only strip 
the value allocated to the interest only strip is reduced and interest income is recorded assuming a constant yield based upon the discount rate used to estimate its fair value 
at the end of the estimated life of the securitization  the carrying value of the interest only strip that is attributable to the excess spread will be fully amortized 
at that time the carrying value of the interest only strip that is attributable to the overcollateralization will have accreted to the amount of the sales proceeds that were not remitted by the securitization trust at the time of the initial sale of the loans less credit losses and excess overcollateralization previously refunded by the securitization trust because it exceeds contractual requirements 
at that time cash is expected to be released by the securitization trust in an amount that equals the accreted value of the overcollateralization 
because the company s retained residual interests are subordinated to the interests of securitization investors and the trust agent  there is risk that the carrying value of the interest only strip will not be fully recovered  resulting in a loss charged to earnings 
these include the risk the asset will have a shorter life than originally estimated prepayment risk  that actual credit losses may exceed expected credit losses credit risk and that interest paid to the securitization trust and investors will be greater than projected interest rate risk 
the company s risk of loss is limited to its interest in the interest only strip 
neither the investors nor the securitization trust have any other recourse to the company s other assets  thus a loss in excess of the carrying value of the interest only strip is not possible 
each reporting period  the fair values of the interest only strips are re evaluated based upon current estimates and assumptions of the net present value of residual future cash flows net of remaining expected credit 
table of contents losses and anticipated refunds of overcollaterization 
changes in fair value are generally recorded net of tax as a component of oci 
if this re evaluation results in fair values that are less than the amortized carrying value of the interest only strip  and if the decline is considered other than temporary  in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
recognition of interest income and impairment on purchased and retained interests in securitized financial assets  the decline is charged against earnings for the current period 
finally  each reporting period  new interest only strip amortization schedules are developed based upon current estimates  assumptions  adjusted carrying values and revised constant yields 
judgments and assumptions that are most critical to the application of this accounting policy are estimated defaults  delinquencies and credit losses  projected prepayment speeds  projected interest rates  and discount rates 
these assumptions are based upon demonstrated credit performance  the prepayment history of the underlying loans and market consensus on future interest rates 
these are  in turn  most highly influenced by general economic conditions  with the greatest adverse affect during economic downturns and periods of rapidly falling interest rates 
if different assumptions and conditions were to prevail  noticeably different results could occur because the recorded value of the interest only strips may need to be written off or written down faster than planned and cash flows from the retained residual interests may be less than expected 
since  as described above  so many factors can affect the value of the interest only strips it is difficult to predict  with any degree of certainty  the affect on income if different conditions or assumptions were to prevail 
nonetheless  if any combination of the above judgments or assumptions were to adversely affect their value by an additional ten percent and the decline was determined to be other than temporary  an impairment charge of approximately million would be necessary

table of contents earnings review of consolidated income statement the following highlights a comparative discussion of the major components of net income and their impact for the last three years 
net interest income net interest income is the difference between income earned on interest earning assets and the interest expense incurred on interest bearing liabilities 
the interest income on certain loans and investment securities is not subject to federal income tax 
for analytical purposes  the interest income and rates on these types of assets are adjusted to a fully taxable equivalent or fte basis 
the fte adjustment was calculated using amcore s statutory federal income tax rate of 
adjusted interest income is as follows in thousands years ended december  interest income book basis fte adjustment interest income fte basis interest expense net interest income fte basis net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis increased million or in and increased million or in the increase in net interest income in was primarily attributable to higher average earning assets 
the increase in net interest income in was primarily the result of decreased funding costs and an increase in average earning assets 
the net interest spread is the difference between the average rates on interest earning assets and the average rates on interest bearing liabilities 
the interest rate margin represents net interest income divided by average earning assets 
these ratios can also be used to analyze net interest income 
since a significant portion of the company s funding is derived from interest free sources  primarily demand deposits  other liabilities and stockholders equity  the effective rate paid for all funding sources is lower than the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities alone 
as table indicates  the interest rate spread improved eight basis points to in from in  which was an improvement of basis points from the level of 
the interest rate margin was in  an increase of one basis point from in the level was an increase of basis points from in the level of net interest income is the result of the relationship between the total volume and mix of interest earning assets and the rates earned and the total volume and mix of interest bearing liabilities and the rates paid 
the rate and volume components associated with interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities can be segregated to analyze the year to year changes in net interest income 
changes due to rate volume variances have been allocated between changes due to average volume and changes due to average rate based on the absolute value of each to the total change of both categories 
because of changes in the mix of the components of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  the computations for each of the components do not equal the calculation for interest earning assets as a total and interest bearing liabilities as a total 
table analyzes the changes attributable to the volume and rate components of net interest income 
changes due to volume in  net interest income on an fte basis increased due to average volume by million 
this was comprised of an million increase in interest income that was partially offset by a million increase in 
table of contents interest expense 
in  net interest income on an fte basis increased due to average volume by million 
this was comprised of an million increase in interest income that was partially offset by a million increase in interest expense 
the increase in interest income of million was driven by a million or increase in average loans offset by a decline of million or in average investment securities 
the growth in average loans came from an increase of million in commercial real estate lending driven mostly by the branch expansion while average consumer and average commercial loans increased million and million  respectively 
partially offsetting these increases was an million average decline in residential real estate loans  due to the impact of refinancings  as fixed mortgage interest rates reached year lows 
strong loan growth  particularly in new markets  has allowed the company to reshape its balance sheet to an improved mix of earning assets  contributing to the decline in average investment securities 
the increase in average loans  offset by the decline in investment securities  was funded by a million or increase in average bank issued deposits and by a million or increase in average brokered certificate of deposits cd s 
the increase in average bank issued deposits which includes a million increase in non interest bearing deposits was attributable to a company wide initiative to attract deposits  especially transaction deposits  and the branch expansion 
this growth occurred despite the transfer of million of deposits in connection with the wisconsin branch sales 
amcore recognizes the importance of continued bank issued deposit growth  not only as a means of funding the branch expansion loan growth  but also to continue the strategy of reducing wholesale funding balances 
the transition to full service branches in new growth markets as the branch expansion develops  continued emphasis on attracting and retaining primary transaction accounts  and auto loan sales are all means by which the company has and expects to implement these strategies 
to this end  the company was able to decrease average borrowings by million or compared to the increase in interest income of million was largely the result of a million or increase in average loans 
average installment and consumer loans  primarily indirect automobile lending  increased million  while average commercial real estate and average commercial  financial and agricultural loans increased million and million  respectively 
the combined increase in commercial lending was primarily driven by amcore s branch expansion in the chicago suburban and madison area markets 
these increases were partially offset by a decline in average residential real estate loans of million due to the impact of refinancings  as mortgage interest rates hit year lows 
the increase in average earning assets was funded by a million increase in average deposits 
the increase was comprised of a million increase in average brokered deposits and a million or increase in average bank issued deposits 
the growth in bank issued deposits reflects company wide initiatives to attract additional bank issued deposits as well as deposit growth attributable to the branch expansion 
over of the bank issued deposit growth was attributable to primary transaction account business  which is one of the company s lowest cost funding sources 
changes due to rate during  net interest income on an fte basis declined due to average rates by million when compared with this was comprised of a million decrease in interest income that was partly offset by a million decline in interest expense 
during  net interest income on an fte basis increased due to average rates by million  when compared with this was comprised of a million decline in interest income that was more than offset by a million decrease in interest expense 
the yield on earning assets declined basis points in  compared to the yield on average securities fell by basis points  while the yield on average loans fell by basis points 
the decline in security yields was affected by the prepayment of higher yielding mortgage related securities  including accelerated premium 
table of contents amortization  that occurred as mortgage interest rates fell 
these securities were replaced with lower yielding securities due to the current low interest rate environment 
while nearly all loan categories were affected  the largest dollar decline was attributable to commercial real estate loans 
loans that refinanced during the year  variable priced loans and new loan production were all adversely impacted by the reductions in interest rates that have been in decline since january of the rate on interest bearing liabilities declined basis points during compared to  due to lower bank issued deposit  wholesale deposit  short term and long term borrowing rates 
while rates fell on all deposit products  the decrease was most pronounced on cd s 
average rates on cd s have declined as older cd s bearing higher rates have matured and re priced since the decline in interest rates that have occurred over the past three years 
the company also benefited from an expired interest rate swap that had increased funding costs in  as well as new swaps entered into during that lowered the cost of wholesale deposits during the decrease in borrowing rates was largely the result of lower rates paid on reverse repurchase agreements that renewed at lower rates as short term interest rates have declined 
the yield on earning assets declined basis points in  compared to the yield on average loans fell by basis points and was primarily attributable to commercial real estate and commercial loans 
falling interest rates during the year impacted pricing on new loan volume  variable priced loans and loans that refinanced during the year 
the yield on average securities decreased by basis points  also the result of declining interest rates 
yields on securities were also affected by the sale of higher risk securities in the security portfolio restructuring well as the pre payment of higher yielding mortgage related securities that occurred as mortgage interest rates fell 
the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities declined basis points in  compared to this was primarily due to decreased rates paid on deposits and short term borrowings 
the decrease in deposit costs was largely driven by cd s and the company s indexed money market deposit accounts amdex that benefited from the decline in short term interest rates 
the decrease in short term borrowing costs was mainly due to reverse repurchase agreements that renewed at lower rates  also due to the decline in short term interest rates 
the current interest rate environment is expected to result in improved interest rate spreads and margins in  compared to specifically  the company expects continuing benefits from deposit re pricing during the coming year 
among those factors that could cause margins and spreads not to improve as anticipated by the company in include  unexpected changes in interest rates  changes in the shape of the yield curve  the effect of prepayments or renegotiated rates  changes in the mix of earning assets and the mix of liabilities  including greater than anticipated use of expensive wholesale sources to fund the branch expansion and greater than expected loan delinquencies resulting in non accrual status 
provision for loan losses the provision see critical accounting estimates discussion was million for  and increased by million or compared to increases in net charge offs  higher specific loss estimates on individually reviewed loans  increased concentrations  increasing loan balances in emerging markets  higher levels of delinquencies and continued economic weakness were all among the factors leading to the increased provision 
comparable additions to the allowance in were not necessary 
the provision decreased million or in from the million in while non accrual loans and net charge offs were up year over year in  the total of non accrual loans  loans past due days or more and restructured loans were down compared to as a result  although non accrual loans and net charge offs were up  there was a decrease in the provision year over year 
amcore recorded net charge offs of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
net charge offs represented basis points of average loans in versus basis points in and basis points in commercial net charge offs increased million in compared to 
table of contents installment and consumer net charge offs increased million in compared to  reflecting continuing increases in losses on repossessed vehicles 
residential real estate net charge offs increased  while commercial real estate net charge offs declined  in compared to commercial net charge offs declined million in  compared to  reflecting settlement activity that occurred in installment and consumer loan net charge offs increased million over the same period  the result of the continued sluggish economy and increasing loss levels on repossessed vehicles 
real estate loan net charge offs were up  year to year 
non interest income total non interest income is comprised primarily of fee based revenues from trust and asset management activities  bank related service charges on deposits and mortgage revenues 
net security gains or losses and increases in cash surrender value csv of bank and company owned life insurance coli are also included in this category 
for and  this category also included branch gains and auto loan sales gains

non interest income totaled million in  a decline of million or from the million in increases of million attributable to services charges on deposits and million of security gains were offset by the branch gains of million included in non interest income in trust and asset management income  the company s largest source of fee based revenues  totaled million in  a decrease of million or from million in this follows a decrease in of million or from million in declining equity markets over the past three years have challenged the investment industry with the s p losing of its value from to these declines have negatively impacted the value of amcore administered assets  upon which fees are partially based  leading to the decrease in fee revenue 
also contributing to the decline was the loss of a major public fund customer effective october  and specific investment performance on related vintage mutual funds 
unless replaced with new business  the loss of the public fund customer could adversely affect trust and asset management income in revenues from this customer were  in  million in and  in a shift by clients to a higher mix of fixed income and money market assets also affected prior year results

assets under administration at december  and were billion and billion  respectively 
assets in the vintage mutual funds totaled million  million and billion at december   and  respectively 
in addition to overall market performance  trust and asset management revenues are dependent upon the company s ability to attract and retain accounts  specific investment performance and other economic factors 
fees from money market funds can also be negatively affected as the federal funds purchased fed funds rate approaches  a level generally viewed as a minimum acceptable return by investors 
thus  waivers of fees on money market funds have been and may continue to be required to provide competitive returns for investors 
service charges on deposits totaled million in  an increase of  or from the million in during  service charges on deposits increased million or from million in deposit growth initiatives  which primarily affected retail accounts  contributed to the increases in both and additionally  in  increased commercial account maintenance fees contributed to the increase

earnings review by business segment amcore s internal reporting and planning process focuses on four primary lines of business segment s commercial banking  retail banking  trust and asset management  and mortgage banking 
note of the notes to consolidated financial statements presents a condensed income statement and total assets for each segment 
the financial information presented was derived from the company s internal profitability reporting system that is used by management to monitor and manage the financial performance of the company 
this information is based on internal management accounting policies which have been developed to reflect the underlying economics of the segments and  to the extent practicable  to portray each segment as if it operated on a stand alone basis 
thus  each segment  in addition to its direct revenues  expenses  assets and liabilities  includes an 
table of contents appropriate allocation of shared support function expenses 
the commercial  retail and mortgage banking segments also include funds transfer adjustments to appropriately reflect the cost of funds on loans made and funding credits on deposits generated 
apart from these adjustments  the accounting policies used are similar to those described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
since there are no comprehensive authorities for management accounting equivalent to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  the information presented is not necessarily comparable with similar information from other financial institutions 
in addition  methodologies used to measure  assign and allocate certain items may change from time to time to reflect  among other things  accounting estimate refinements  changes in risk profiles  changes in customers or product lines  and changes in management structure 
during the first quarter of  the company also changed the classification of mortgage loans not sold into the secondary market that are retained by the bank 
all revenues from these loans  along with related provisions and expenses  are now reported as part of the mortgage banking segment instead of the retail banking segment 
prior period segment results have been restated to reflect this change 
total segment results differ from consolidated results primarily due to intersegment eliminations  certain corporate administration costs  items not otherwise allocated in the management accounting process and treasury and investment activities 
the impact of these items is aggregated to reconcile the amounts presented for the segments to the consolidated results and is included in the other column of note of the notes to consolidated financial statements

net interest income increased million in the increase was due to higher average loan volumes  particularly commercial real estate loans  lower priced deposits and decreased cost of funds allocations  which more than compensated for lower yields on loans 
the lower yields on loans  reduced rates on deposits and decreased cost of funds allocations were all attributable to declining short term interest rates over the past three years  which have impacted new product loans and deposits pricing as well as the re pricing of variable priced products and fixed price product renewals 
strong loan demand  aided by the branch expansion  was more than sufficient to replace average loan balances transferred in the branch sales  leading to the increased volumes 
non interest income increased million and was attributable to commercial s allocable portion of the branch gain of million 
the provision increased million and was attributable to a million increase in net charge offs  a million increase in both specific loss estimates and other loss estimates 
these estimates are based upon increased concentrations  including commercial real estate  deteriorating loan quality and collateral values  including loans that are secured by receivables  inventory and specialized equipment  growth in new markets  increased delinquencies  continued weakness in the overall economy  particularly the manufacturing segment  and other factors

these factors offset lower yields on loans and reduced funds credit allocations 
the lower yields on loans  reduced rates on deposits and decreased funds credit allocations were all attributable to declining rates over the past three years  which have impacted new product loans and deposits pricing as well as the re pricing of variable priced products and fixed price product renewals

the decrease in was primarily due to declines in non interest income net of lower operating expenses and income taxes 

table of contents tam non interest income declined million in declines in fee based revenue were partially offset by increased brokerage commission income 
lower amcore managed asset values and specific investment performance on selected vintage mutual funds contributed to the decrease in trust and asset management revenues 
declining equity markets over the past three years have challenged the investment industry with the s p losing of its value from to these declines have negatively impacted the value of amcore administered assets  upon which fees are partially based  leading to the decrease in fee revenue 
also contributing to the decline was the loss of a major public fund customer effective october  unless replaced with new business the loss of the public fund client could continue to adversely affect tam revenues 
revenues from this customer were  in and million in a shift to a higher mix of fixed income and money market assets also affected prior year results 
net brokerage commissions on the other hand have been particularly strong and are primarily the result of increased fixed annuity sales

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as part of its normal operations  amcore is subject to interest rate risk on the interest earning assets it invests in primarily loans and securities and the interest bearing liabilities it funds with primarily customer deposits  brokered deposits and borrowed funds  as well as its ability to manage such risk 
fluctuations in interest rates may result in changes in the fair market values of amcore s financial instruments  cash flows and net interest income 
like most financial institutions  amcore has an exposure to changes in both short term and long term interest rates 
in the near term  amcore expects that its interest rate risk will be greater should interest rates decline 
while amcore manages other risks in its normal course of operations  such as credit and liquidity risk  it considers interest rate risk to be its most significant market risk 
other types of market risk  such as foreign currency exchange risk and commodity price risk  do not arise in the normal course of amcore s business activities and operations 
in addition  since amcore does not hold a trading portfolio  it is not exposed to significant market risk from trading activities 
during  there were no material changes in amcore s primary market risk exposures 
based upon current expectations  no material changes are anticipated in the future in the types of market risks facing amcore 
table and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements summarize amcore s market risk and interest sensitivity position as of december  the amounts and assumptions should not be relied upon as indicative of expected actual results since  like most financial institutions  amcore s net interest income can be significantly impacted by external factors 
these factors include  but are not limited to overall economic conditions  policies and actions of regulatory authorities  the amounts of and rates at which assets and liabilities re price  variances in prepayment of loans and securities other than those that are assumed  early withdrawal of deposits  exercise of call options on borrowings or securities  competition  a general rise or decline in interest rates  changes in the slope of the yield curve  changes in historical relationships between indices and balance sheet growth 
amcore s asset and liability management process is utilized to manage market and interest rate risk through structuring the balance sheet and off balance sheet positions to maximize net interest income while maintaining acceptable levels of risk to changes in market interest rates 
while achievement of this goal requires a balance between earnings  liquidity and interest rate risk  there are opportunities to enhance revenues through managed risk 
interest rate sensitivity analysis is performed monthly using various simulations with an asset liability modeling system 
these analyses are reviewed by the asset and liability committee alco  whose actions attempt to minimize any sudden or sustained negative impact that interest rate movements may have on net interest income 
alco reviews the impact of liquidity  capital adequacy and rate sensitivity  among other things  and determines appropriate policy direction to maintain or meet established alco guidelines 
the company may  from time to time  use derivative contracts to help manage its exposure to changes in interest rates and in conjunction with its mortgage banking operations 
the derivatives used most often are interest rate swaps  caps  collars and floors collectively interest rate derivatives  mortgage loan commitments and forward contracts and are more fully described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
interest rate derivatives are contracts with a third party the counter party to exchange interest payment streams based upon an assumed principal amount the notional principal amount 
the notional principal amount is not advanced from the counter party 
it is used only as a reference point to calculate the exchange of interest payment streams 
amcore does not have any derivatives that are held or issued for trading purposes 
the only credit risk exposure amcore has is in relation to the counter parties  which all have investment grade credit ratings 
all counter parties are expected to meet any outstanding interest payment obligations 
the total notional amount of swap contracts outstanding was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
as of december   swap contracts had an aggregate positive 
table of contents carrying and fair value of million 
there were no collars outstanding at december  or the total notional amount of caps outstanding was million at december   with million of outstanding caps as of the end of as of the end of  the caps had an aggregate carrying and fair value of see table for further discussion of derivative contracts  see notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
based upon an immediate increase in interest rates of basis points and no change in the slope of the yield curve  the potential decrease in net interest income for would be approximately  or of base forecasted net interest income 
this analysis assumes no growth in assets or liabilities and replacement of maturing instruments with like kind instruments 
at the end of  comparable assumptions would have resulted in a potential increase in net income of million or 
thus  amcore s earnings at risk for rising rates has increased since the end of  as the company moved from an asset sensitive position to a slightly liability sensitive position 
conversely  an immediate decrease in interest rates of basis points and no change in the slope of the yield curve would result in a potential decrease in net interest income for of million or of base forecasted net interest income 
at the end of  a similar decrease in rates would have resulted in a potential decrease in net interest income of million or 
amcore s sensitivity to declining interest rates has remained relatively stable since the end of amcore continues to be sensitive to compression as rates on most earning assets would be adversely affected by the full basis point decline whereas many interest paying liabilities may already be paying less than one percent and thus cannot decline the full basis points 
other factors include the negative convexity of the mortgage backed products and the large volume of floating rate commercial loans 
the amounts and assumptions used in the rising and falling rate scenarios should not be viewed as indicative of expected actual results 
in addition to rising or falling interest rates  amcore s net interest income can be significantly impacted by a variety of external factors  such as those previously noted 
in addition  as interest rates move  the alco is likely to adjust interest rate risk management strategies to limit  to the extent possible  the adverse impact that such changes in interest rates might otherwise have on amcore s net interest income  as well as maximize potential positive impacts such movements might have
