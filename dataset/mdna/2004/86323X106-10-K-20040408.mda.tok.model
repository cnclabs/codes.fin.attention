part i item business general lanvision systems  inc lanvision or the company is a healthcare information technology company focused on solutions that improve document centric information flows and complement and enhance existing transaction centric healthcare information systems 
the company s workflow and document management solutions bridge the gap between current  predominantly paper based processes and transaction based healthcare information systems by electronically capturing document centric information from disparate sources  electronically directing that information through vital business processes  and providing access to the information to authenticated users such as physicians  nurses  administrative and financial personnel and payers across the continuum of care 
the company s workflow based products and services offer solutions to specific healthcare business processes within the revenue cycle  such as remote coding  abstracting and chart completion  remote physician order processing  pre admission registration scanning  insurance verification  denial management  secondary billing services  explanation of benefits processing and release of information processing 
lanvision s products and services also create an integrated document centric repository of historical health information that is complementary and can be seamlessly bolted on to existing transaction centric clinical  financial and management information systems  allowing healthcare providers to aggressively move toward fully electronic medical record emr processes while improving service levels and convenience for all stakeholders 
these integrated systems allow providers and administrators to dramatically improve the availability of patient information while decreasing direct costs associated with document retrieval  work in process  chart completion  document retention and archiving 
lanvision s systems can be provided on a subscription basis via remote application hosting services or installed locally 
lanvision provides its aspen sm  application service provider based remote hosting services to the university hospital  a member of the health alliance of greater cincinnati  md anderson cancer center and children s medical center of columbus  oh among others 
in addition  lanvision has installed its workflow and document management solutions at leading healthcare providers including stanford hospital and clinics  the albert einstein healthcare network  beth israel medical centers  the university of pittsburgh medical center  medical university hospital authority of south carolina  and memorial sloan kettering cancer center 
lanvision s applications allow authenticated users  such as physicians  nurses  administrative and financial personnel  and payers with access to patient healthcare information that exists in disparate systems across the continuum of care and improve operational efficiencies through business process re engineering and automating labor intensive and demanding paper environments 
lanvision s applications and services are complementary to existing clinical and financial systems  and use document imaging and advanced workflow tools to ensure users can electronically access both structured and unstructured patient data and all the various forms of clinical and financial healthcare information from a single permanent and secure repository  including clinician s handwritten notes  laboratory reports  photographs  insurance cards  etc 
lanvision s workflow solutions offer value to all of the constituents in the healthcare delivery process by enabling them to simultaneously access and utilize lanvision s advanced technological workflow applications to process the document centric information  on a real time basis from virtually any location  including the physician s desktop  using web based technology 
lanvision s solutions integrate its own proprietary imaging platform  application workflow modules and image and web enabling tools that allow for the seamless merger of back office functionality with existing clinical and financial information systems at the desktop 
lanvision offers its own document imaging management infrastructure foundation suite that is built for high volume transaction processing and is specifically designed for the healthcare industry 
in addition to providing access to information not previously available at the desktop  lanvision s applications fulfill the administrative and legal needs of the medical records and patient financial services departments 
furthermore  these systems have been specifically designed to integrate with any clinical information system 
for example  lanvision has integrated its products with selected systems from siemens medical solutions health services corporation siemens  and cerner corporation and idx information systems corporation idx applications 
by offering electronic access to all the patient information components of the medical record  this integration completes one of the most difficult tasks necessary to provide a true electronic medical record 
lanvision s systems deliver on line enterprisewide access to fully updated patient information  which historically was maintained on a variety of media  including paper  magnetic disk  optical disk  and microfilm 
lanvision operates in one segment as a provider of health information technology solutions that streamline document centric information flows 
the financial information required by items b of regulation s k is incorporated herein by reference from item selected financial information of this form k 
historically  lanvision has derived most of its revenues from systems sales  recurring application hosting subscriptions services  recurring maintenance fees and professional services involving the licensing  either directly or through remarketing partners  of its medical record workflow and revenue cycle management solutions to integrated healthcare delivery networks idn 
in a typical transaction  lanvision  or its remarketing partners  enter into a perpetual license or fee for service subscription agreement for lanvision s software application suite and may license or sell other third party software and hardware components to the idn 
additionally  lanvision  or its remarketing partners provide professional services  including implementation  training  and product support 
with respect to systems sales  lanvision earns its highest margins on proprietary lanvision software or application hosting services and the lowest margins on third party hardware 
systems sales to customers may include different configurations of lanvision software  hardware and professional services  resulting in varying margins among contracts 
the margins on professional services revenues fluctuate based upon the negotiated terms of the agreement with each customer and lanvision s ability to fully utilize its professional services  maintenance  and support services staff 
beginning in  lanvision began offering customers the ability to obtain its workflow solutions on an application hosting basis as an application service provider asp 
lanvision established a hosting data center and installed lanvision s suite of workflow products  called aspen application service provider ehealth network within the hosting data center 
under this arrangement  customers electronically capture information and securely transmit the data to the hosting data center 
the aspen services store and manage the data using lanvision s suite of applications  and customers can view  print  fax  and process the information from anywhere using the lanvision web based applications 
lanvision charges and recognizes revenue for these aspenservices on a per transaction or subscription basis as information is captured  stored  retrieved and processed 
the decision by a healthcare provider to replace  substantially modify  or upgrade its information systems is a strategic decision and often involve a large capital commitment requiring an extended approval process 
since inception  lanvision has experienced extended sales cycles  which has adversely affected revenues 
it is not uncommon for sales cycles to take six to eighteen months from initial contact to the execution of an agreement 
as a result  the sales cycles can cause significant variations in quarter to quarter operating results 
these agreements cover the entire implementation and maintenance of the system and specify the installation schedule  which typically takes place in one or more phases 
the licensing agreements generally provide for the licensing of lanvision s proprietary software and third party software with a perpetual or term license fee that is adjusted depending on the number of concurrent users or workstations using the software 
third party hardware is sold outright  with a one time fee charged for installation and training 
site specific customization  interfaces with existing customer systems and other consulting services are sold on a fixed fee or a time and materials basis 
alternatively  with lanvision s aspen services solution  the application hosting services agreements generally provide for utilizing lanvision s software and third party software on a fee per transaction or recurring subscription basis 
aspen services was designed to overcome obstacles in the buying decision such as large capital commitment  length of implementation  and the scarcity of time for healthcare information systems personnel to implement new systems 
lanvision believes that idn s and smaller healthcare providers are looking for this type of asp application because of the ease of implementation and lower entry level costs 
lanvision believes its business model is especially well suited for the medium to small acute care facility marketplace as well as the ambulatory marketplace and is actively pursuing remarketing agreements  in addition to those discussed below  with other healthcare information systems his and staff outsourcing providers to distribute lanvision s workflow solutions 
generally  revenues from systems sales are recognized when an agreement is signed and products are made available to end users 
revenue recognition related to routine installation  integration and project management are deferred until the work is performed 
if an agreement requires lanvision to perform services and modifications that are deemed significant to system acceptance  revenues are recorded either on the percentage of completion method or revenue related to the delivered hardware and software components is deferred until such obligations are deemed insignificant  depending on the contractual terms 
revenues from consulting  training  and application hosting services are recognized as the services are performed 
revenues from short term support and maintenance agreements are recognized ratably over the term of the agreements 
billings to customers recorded prior to the recognition of the revenue are classified as deferred revenues 
revenues recognized prior to progress billings to customers are recorded as contract receivables 
in  lanvision entered into a five year remarketing agreement with idx information systems corporation 
under the terms of the agreement  idx was granted a non exclusive worldwide license to distribute all lanvision workflow software including accessanyware tm  codinganyware tm  and aspen application hosting services to idx customers and prospective customers  as defined in the remarketing agreement 
under the terms of this remarketing agreement  idx remits royalties to lanvision based upon idx sublicensing lanvision s software to idx s customers 
thirty percent of the royalty is due days following the end of the month in which idx executes an end user license agreement with its customer 
lanvision recognizes this revenue upon receipt of the royalty report 
the remaining seventy percent of the royalty is due from idx  in varying amounts based on implementation milestones  days following the end of the month in which a milestone occurs 
lanvision records this revenue when the seventy percent payment due from idx is fixed and determinable  which is generally when the products are made available to end users 
in  lanvision entered into a marketing and referral agreement with the m health information systems  a division of minnesota mining manufacturing co  whereby m health information systems and lanvision entered into a referral marketing agreement for its new product codinganyware 
lanvision s quarterly operating results have varied in the past and may continue to do so in the future because of various reasons including demand for lanvision s products and services  long sales cycles  and extended installation and implementation cycles based on customer s schedules 
sales are often delayed because of customers budgets and competing capital expenditure needs as well as personnel resource constraints within an integrated delivery network 
delays in anticipated sales or installations may have a significant impact on lanvision s quarterly revenues and operating results  because substantial portions of the operating expenses are relatively fixed 
the us department of health and human services  in its national health expenditure projections released in january  believe that the health spending expenditures will reach trillion in  growing at an average annual rate of during the forecasted period as a share of the gross domestic product  health spending is projected to reach by up from its level of 
in response to this growth  the healthcare industry is undergoing significant change as competition and cost containment measures imposed by governmental and private payers have created significant pressures on healthcare providers to control healthcare costs while providing quality patient care 
at the same time  the healthcare delivery system is experiencing a shift from a highly fragmented group of non allied healthcare providers to integrated healthcare networks  which combine all of the services  products and equipment necessary to address the needs of healthcare customers 
as a result  healthcare providers are seeking to cut costs  increase productivity and enhance the quality of patient care through improved access to information throughout the entire hospital or integrated healthcare network 
today  the majority of the patient records are paper based 
the inefficiencies of paper based records increase the cost of patient care 
physicians often cannot gain access to medical records at the time of patient visits  and multiple users cannot simultaneously access the record when only a single copy of the paper based patient record is available 
based upon lanvision s experience in installing its systems  a typical bed hospital can produce  to  pages of new patient information each day even with computerized admission  billing  laboratory and radiology systems  and individual physician document retrieval requests can be as high as documents per physician per day 
the volume of medical images in the patient record is expanding as well 
in addition to images such as x rays and cat scans  mri s  new image forms such as digitized slides  videos and photographs proliferate 
thus  the ability to store and retrieve images of voluminous paper records and medical images on a timely basis is a critical feature of a complete computerized patient record 
in order to simultaneously reduce costs and enhance the level of patient care  hospitals and other healthcare providers are requiring comprehensive  cost effective information systems that deliver rapid access to fully updated and complete patient information 
traditional healthcare information systems are inadequate because i they do not capture large amounts of the patient records which are paper based and stored in various sites throughout the enterprise  ii computerized patient data is generated using a variety of disparate systems which cannot share information  and iii multimedia medical information such as x rays  cat scans  mri s  video and audio information are frequently inaccessible at the point of patient care 
accordingly  hospitals and other healthcare providers have begun to increase their information systems expenditures 
in the eleventh annual healthcare information and management systems society himss leadership survey  healthcare business issues were driving information technology priorities with over half of the respondents indicating that cost pressures would continue to be a driving force in improving operational efficiencies 
included in the top ten information technology priorities was the implementation of computerized patient records 
respondents believe that implementing ehealth and hipaa health insurance portability and accountability act of strategies see regulations relating to confidentiality below will consume most of the information technology budget  because use of interactive ehealth solutions has become a competitive advantage 
providers  payers and suppliers know that the consequences of ignoring an ehealth strategy will result in the loss of market share 
lanvision believes that the hipaa regulations will be an additional impetus for idn s to embrace lanvision products and services as a means of ensuring compliance with federal regulations 
a medical records institute survey of electronic health records trends and usage reported that one of the more interesting findings indicated that of the respondents acknowledge that electronic medical record systems can help improve workflow  said that such systems can help improve clinical documentation  and said emrs will help improve patient safety 
document imaging and workflow technologies are essential elements of a complete emr because they allow for the storage of unstructured data ie  patient record elements other than data or text  such as hand written physician or nursing notes and physician orders  photographs  images of a document and they enable digitized x rays  cat scans  mri s  video and audio information to be accessed and delivered to the caregiver at the point of patient care 
lanvision believes the demand for its medical record workflow solutions  which can supply document imaging capabilities to the emr  will increase in future years 
also  the himss leadership survey indicated that of the survey respondents were interested in outsourcing information technology functions in asp services 
additionally  the information technology individuals responding to the himss leadership survey indicated that security related to patient records to meet hipaa regulations was the second most important information technology priority within their institutions 
the number one priority was to deploy internet technology to support ehealth by moving healthcare information to the web 
in addition to mandated hipaa regulations  the healthcare industry is being strongly encouraged by many professional medical organizations to make greater use of information technology 
a report by the institute of medicine iom of the national academies  entitled to err is human building a better health system  envisioned a revamped system that  among other things  makes greater use of information technology to enable providers and institutions to move away from paper based medical record systems to take advantage of new information technology 
the american medical association  american academy of family physicians  american college of physicians  american society of internal medicine  and the american college of surgeons  issued a joint statement supporting the iom recommendations 
current regulatory matters the u 
s 
department of health and human services hss has asked the institute of medicine to design a standardized model of an electronic health record  in a move that may help spur nationwide acceptance of electronic medical records 
the tentative date for the completed design is the impact of such change  if implemented by hss  on current lanvision products and services is unknown at this time 
however  lanvision believes that its software and systems are sufficiently flexible to accommodate changing regulatory requirements 
regulations relating to confidentiality federal and state laws regulate the confidentiality of patient records and the circumstances under which such records may be released 
these regulations govern both the disclosure and use of confidential patient health information 
regulations governing electronic health data privacy are evolving as the final federal regulations are published 
the health insurance portability and accountability act of  enacted august   is designed to improve the efficiency of healthcare by standardizing the interchange of specified electronic data  and to protect the security and confidentiality of protected health information phi 
the legislation requires that covered entities comply with national standards for certain types of electronic health information transactions and the data elements used in such transactions  and adopt policies and practices to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of phi 
regulations adopted pursuant to hipaa include rules addressing several areas 
compliance with the new privacy rule was required by most covered entities other than small health plans by april the final privacy rule also extended the scope of enforcement to phi residing on non electronic media  such as paper  as well as to email  oral and written communications 
the regulations under the security rule were effective in april  with a compliance date of april small health plans have until april to comply with the security rule 
lanvision believes that the regulations issued to date would not have a material adverse affect on its business 
lanvision cannot predict the potential impact of the regulations that have not yet been released or made final  or any other regulations that might be adopted 
congress may adopt legislation that may change  override  conflict with  or preempt the currently issued regulations 
additionally  legislation governing the dissemination of patient health information is also from time to time proposed and debated at the state level 
these laws or regulations  when adopted  could restrict the ability of customers to obtain  use  or disseminate patient health information 
lanvision believes that the features and architecture of lanvision s products are such that it currently supports or should be able to make the necessary modifications to its products  if required  to ensure support of the hipaa regulations  and other legislation or regulations 
however  if the regulations are unduly restrictive  this could cause delays in the delivery of new versions of products and adversely effect the licensing of lanvision s products 
overall  lanvision believes the hipaa regulations will stimulate healthcare organizations to purchase computer based electronic medical record systems that automate the collection  use  and disclosure of patient health information  while maintaining appropriate security and audit controls over the information 
however  there can be no assurance that an increase in the purchase of new systems or additional use of lanvision application hosting services will occur 
rapid technological change and evolving market the market for lanvision s products and services is characterized by rapidly changing technologies  regulatory requirements  evolving industry standards and new product introductions and enhancements that may render existing products obsolete or less competitive 
as a result  lanvision s position in the healthcare information technology market could change rapidly due to unforeseen changes in the features and functions of competing products  as well as the pricing models for such products 
lanvision s future success will depend  in part  upon lanvision s ability to enhance its existing products and services and to develop and introduce new products and services to meet changing requirements 
changes and consolidation in the healthcare industry lanvision derives substantially all of its revenues from the licensing of software  providing professional services and maintenance services and providing application hosting services within the healthcare industry 
accordingly  the success of lanvision is dependent upon the regulatory and economic conditions in the healthcare industry 
many healthcare providers are consolidating to establish integrated delivery networks to take advantage of economies of scale  greater marketing power and greater leverage in negotiating with venders who supply the industry with the goods and services they require 
the impact of such consolidations  lanvision believes  will benefit lanvision as more healthcare organizations investigate methods to streamline operations  including outsourcing non core services to reduce costs and improve the quality of patient care through the use of information technology  especially in the paper intensive area of patient medical records and patient financial services 
key personnel lanvision s success depends  to a significant degree  on its management and technical personnel 
lanvision must recruit  motivate and retain highly skilled managers  consulting and technical personnel  including application programmers  database specialists  consultants and system architects skilled in the technical environments in which lanvision s products operate 
competition for such technical expertise is intense 
limited protection of proprietary technology the success of lanvision depends on the protection of its intellectual property rights relating to its proprietary technology 
lanvision relies on a combination of confidentiality  nondisclosure  license  and employment agreements  trade secret laws  copyrights  and restrictions on the disclosure of its intellectual property 
notwithstanding these precautions  others may copy  reverse engineer or design independently  technology similar to lanvision s products 
it may be necessary to litigate to enforce or defend lanvision s proprietary technology or to determine the validity of the intellectual property rights of others 
lanvision could also be required to defend itself against claims made by third parties for intellectual property right infringement 
any litigation  could be successful or unsuccessful  may result in substantial cost and require significant attention by management and technical personnel 
warranties and indemnities lanvision s products are very complex and may not be error free  especially when first released 
failure of any lanvision product to operate in accordance with its specifications and documentation could constitute a breach of the license agreement and require lanvision to correct the deficiency 
if such deficiency is not within the agreed upon contractual limitations on liability and cannot be corrected in a timely manner  it could constitute a material breach of a contract allowing the termination thereof and possible subjecting lanvision to liability 
also  lanvision indemnifies its customers against third party infringement claims 
if such claims are made  even if they are without merit  they could be expensive to defend 
if lanvision becomes liable to a third party for infringement of their intellectual property  lanvision could be required to pay substantial amounts as damages  obtain a license to use the infringing technologies  develop its own noninfringing technologies  or cease using the infringing intellectual property 
competition several companies historically have dominated the healthcare clinical information system software market and several of these companies have either acquired  developed or are developing their own document imaging and workflow technologies 
the industry is currently undergoing consolidation and realignment as companies position themselves to compete more effectively 
strategic alliances between vendors offering medical record workflow and document imaging technologies and vendors of other healthcare systems are increasing 
barriers to entry to this market include technological and application sophistication  the ability to offer a proven product  a well established customer base and distribution channels  brand recognition  the ability to operate on a variety of operating systems and hardware platforms  the ability to integrate with pre existing systems and capital for sustained development and marketing activities 
lanvision believes that these barriers taken together represent a moderate to high level barrier to entry 
foreign competition has not been a significant factor in the market  to date 
lanvision s competitors include clinical information system vendors that are larger and more established and have substantially more resources than lanvision 
in addition  information and document management companies serving other industries may enter the market 
suppliers and companies with whom lanvision may establish strategic alliances may also compete with lanvision 
such companies and vendors may either individually  or by forming alliances excluding lanvision  place bids for large agreements in competition with lanvision 
a decision on the part of any of these competitors to focus additional resources in the image enabling  workflow  and other markets addressed by lanvision could have a material adverse effect on lanvision 
lanvision believes that the principal competitive factors in its market are customer recommendations and references  company reputation  system reliability  system features and functionality including ease of use  technological advancements  customer service and support  breadth and quality of the systems  the potential for enhancements and future compatible products  the effectiveness of marketing and sales efforts  price and the size and perceived financial stability of the vendor 
in addition  lanvision believes that the speed with which companies in its market can anticipate the evolving healthcare industry structure and identify unmet needs are important competitive factors 
there can be no assurance that lanvision will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or potential competitors 
lanvision believes that its principal competitors are american management systems  incorporated  cerner corporation  eclipsys corporation  hyland software  inc  mckesson hboc  inc  medplus  inc 
a subsidiary of quest diagnostics incorporated  perceptive vision  inc  siemens medical solutions health services corporation  and softmed systems  inc cerner corporation and siemens medical solutions health services corporation are both developing competitive products and applications 
the lanvision solution lanvision s products and services streamline document centric information flows and provide medical record workflow and patient financial services workflow solutions for the patient information access needs of hospitals and integrated healthcare delivery networks 
lanvision s systems enable medical and administrative personnel to rapidly and efficiently capture  store  manage  route  retrieve and process vast amounts of clinical and financial patient information 
lanvision s systems i capture and store electronic data from disparate hospital information systems through real time  computerized interfaces  ii provide applications for efficiently scanning and automatically indexing paper based records  iii allow storage of a patient s lifetime medical record on secure media which also provides rapid access to high volumes of data enterprisewide  iv provide technologically advanced workflow automation software to facilitate the re engineering of business processes  and v incorporate physician oriented interfaces that allow the user to easily locate and retrieve patient information in the hospital or clinical setting  including the point of patient care 
lanvision s medical record workflow and patient financial services workflow solutions provide financial  administrative  and clinical benefits to the healthcare provider and facilitate more effective patient care 
these benefits include improved access to patient information to assist in making informed clinical and financial decisions  reduced costs for administrative personnel due to increased workflow efficiency  as data can be routed within an organization to all users who need to process that information simultaneously or in sequence as required  increased productivity through the elimination of file contention by providing multiple users simultaneous access to patient medical records  reduced costs and improved care through the reduction of unnecessary testing and admissions  improved cash flow through accelerated account receivable collections and reductions in technical denials which occur when a third party payer refuses payment because of the provider s inability to substantiate billing claims due to loss of portions or all of the patient record  expedited treatment decisions  and fewer redundant tests as a result of timely access to complete information  fewer medical record errors by minimizing misfiled  lost and improperly completed records  and increased security of patient information through improved controls on access to confidential data and the creation of audit trails that identify the persons who accessed or even tried to access such information 
the lanvision strategy lanvision s objective is to continue to be a leading provider of medical record and patient financial services workflow solutions to the healthcare industry 
important elements of lanvision s business strategy include expand distribution channels lanvision estimates the market for lanvision s products and services could be in excess of billion  and the market is less than penetrated 
a recent healthcare industry report stated that in order to comply with the hipaa healthcare information electronic transmission regulations  healthcare systems will need to adjust existing systems or purchase new information technology systems  hire and retrain staff  and make significant changes to the current processes associated with maintaining patient privacy  the cost of which is estimated to be somewhere between three to four times the amount of expenditures required for year remediation  or an amount in excess of billion 
lanvision strongly believes its highly evolved  secure and technologically advanced web browser based asp solutions will position lanvision to take advantage of  what it continues to believe will be  significantly increasing market opportunities for lanvision and its distribution partners in the future 
in  lanvision entered into a five year remarketing agreement with idx information systems corporation  which offers a wide variety of patient care products to integrated delivery networks  group practices  academic medical centers  radiological centers  and hospitals nationwide 
idx has installed its products at more than  customer sites with systems deployed to serve over  physicians 
under the terms of the agreement  idx was granted a non exclusive worldwide license to distribute all lanvision applications  and aspen services to idx customers and prospective customers  as defined in the agreement 
idx s will sell lanvision s electronic medical record workflow and document imaging products as an integrated component of the idx clinical information systems  which idx can remarket as an integrated solution with either idx product carecast or lastword 
in  lanvision entered into a new two year marketing and referral agreement with the m health information systems  a division of the minnesota mining and manufacturing company  whereby m and lanvision will refer prospective customers for the other s products and services 
m will refer potential customers to use the lanvision codinganyware software and lanvision will refer potential customers to use the m healthcare products  including their coding and reimbursement software  which is complementary to the lanvision codinganyware software 
it is lanvision s intention to develop additional remarketing alliances with other healthcare information systems  medical records management  and medical records outsourcing vendors and to explore other means of expanding lanvision s distribution channels 
application service provider application hosting services beginning in  lanvision began offering customers the ability to obtain its workflow solutions on an application hosting basis as an application service provider 
lanvision established a hosting data center and installed lanvision s suite of workflow products  called aspen within the hosting data center  which utilizes lanvision s web browser based applications across an internet intranet  to deliver high quality  transaction based services to healthcare providers from a centrally located data center 
aspen enables its healthcare customers to achieve enhanced patient care  improved security  and accessibility to patient records at significant cost savings with minimal up front capital investment  maintenance  and support costs 
customers realize benefits more quickly  with less economic risk 
customers are charged on a per transaction or subscription basis  which is an attractive alternative to purchasing an in house system 
this service is made possible through the advancement of web browser based technology  state of the art communication technology and advanced software design 
maintain technological leadership through the development of new software applications and increased functionality of existing applications lanvision intends to continue its product development efforts and increase the functionality of existing applications along with the development of new applications using document imaging and workflow technologies 
in particular  lanvision intends to increase the functionality of its web based applications 
lanvision has continued to add new features and functionality to its suite of products  including revenue cycle management solutions such as remote coding  remote physician order processing  pre admission registration scanning  insurance verification  denial management  secondary billing services  explanation of benefits processing  etc 
lanvision has released its latest generation product  accessanyware  a web based application with a user interface that includes the best features of lanvision s entire product portfolio 
the accessanyware application utilizes a common database for medical records and patient financial services  thereby improving system administration and eliminating redundant data entry 
lanvision has implemented its first revenue cycle products  codinganyware  an application that provides workflow automation of the coding and abstracting process by allowing hospital personnel to electronically access documents to be coded and abstracted from remote locations  including the employee s home 
the codinganyware product can also be integrated with third party encoding or abstracting software  such as m  thus avoiding redundant data entry 
lanvision believes only the most robust  flexible  dependable products will survive in the healthcare market  and lanvision has attempted to establish itself as the leader in document imaging management and workflow applications through strong product development 
image enable clinical data repositories and other applications software today  healthcare information is often stored on numerous dissimilar host based and departmental systems that are spread throughout an enterprise and are not integrated 
additionally  these current systems do not address the data stored on paper or the increasing volume of medical images such as cat scans  mri s  digitized slides  exploratory scopes  photographs  audio  etc 
lanvision believes the efficiencies and productivity of hospitals and integrated healthcare delivery networks can be greatly enhanced by seamlessly integrating their historical information systems with document imaging and workflow applications 
physicians  clinicians  and other healthcare users then have access to the complete patient medical record  including the structured data  such as a laboratory results  and the related unstructured data  or a doctor s hand written notes 
lanvision has image enabled many popular clinical data repositories  such as those offered by oacis healthcare holdings corp  idx information systems corporation  and cerner corporation 
lanvision is marketing image enabling technology through its accessanyware  and lanvision application bridge products 
lanvision intends to continue to aggressively market its unique image enabling solutions to end users and other third party software application providers 
lanvision has several large scale  enterprisewide image enabled sites  including memorial sloan kettering cancer center which utilizes lanvision s solution on over  workstations and over  simultaneous users at any point in time

lanvision s systems can be configured with various hardware platforms  including intel compatible personal computers 
lanvision s systems include a user interface designed specifically by lanvision for physicians and other medical and administrative personnel in hospitals and integrated healthcare networks 
lanvision s systems operate on multiple imaging platforms  including siemens and filenet in addition to its own proprietary document imaging platform 
lanvision s medical record workflow solutions incorporate advanced features  including workflow and security features that allow customers to restrict direct access to confidential patient information  secure patient data from unauthorized indirect access and have audit trail features 
a brief description of lanvision s products follows lanvision products and services are built using advanced document imaging management and workflow automation technology to create robust medical records and revenue cycle workflow solutions 
document imaging technology makes paper based information  as well as medical images  sound and video information as readily available and easy to process as traditional electronic data 
workflow automation offers intelligent electronic routing of documents and sophisticated management tools and reporting to increase efficiency and to support business process re engineering efforts 
lanvision s products and services were designed to be complementary with existing third party his and asp based services  providing value added functionality to these third party applications  including the following the ability to gain seamless electronic access to medical records  business office documents and medical images unstructured data  workflow based automated chart deficiency analysis and completion  workflow based automated release of information and billing  workflow based remote coding and seamless integration to third party encoder and abstracter software  workflow based physician order routing for scheduling  workflow based financial screening and routing of patient financial ability to pay information  computer aided data extraction solutions using ocr technology to scan  extract  verify and input into existing information systems data  eob processing for electronic filing of explanation of benefits documents  and archival support for a legal historical repository of patient information 
lanvision has developed innovative application tool sets to image and web enable existing his clinical and patient financial services applications  thus allowing clients to have a common graphical user interface on a universal workstation 
lanvision has also developed its own proprietary document imaging middleware foundation suite to efficiently provide the object oriented business processes common to all of its applications  such as scanning indexing  faxing printing  data archiving migration  security and auditing 
through its application software  document imaging middleware  and its workflow  image and web enabling tools  lanvision allows the seamless merging of its medical record and patient financial services department back office functionality with existing clinical information systems at the desktop 
for maximum flexibility  the most current lanvision family of products and services accessanyware is packaged into four distinct offerings the health information management him suite  the patient financial services pfs suite  the enterprise suite  and a set of productivity tools 
the accessanyware family of products is lanvision s fifth generation document centric repository of historical health information that is complimentary and can be seamlessly bolted on to existing transaction centric clinical  financial and management information systems  allowing healthcare providers to aggressively move toward fully electronic medical records 
it allows authorized users to perform document searching  retrieval  viewing  processing  printing and faxing  as well as report generation all from a single login 
him suite the him suite includes accessanyware patient folders  completion workflow  releaseanyware tm  codinganyware  the lanvision application bridge and the lanvision productivity tools 
accessanyware patient folders accessanyware patient folders is a web based application that provides hospital organizations the ability to electronically store  search and retrieve medical records from any location within the facility  physician offices  off site clinics and even from home 
in addition  accessanyware patient folders provides a complete web based chart deficiency management system that includes analysis  electronic signature and management reports all from a single login 
accessanyware patient folders allows the user to securely view the entire medical record from a visit view or a category based longitudinal view of historical patient information 
completion workflow the completion workflow application is an integrated module of accessanyware that provides analysts and clinicians the ability to remotely analyze  electronically sign and complete deficient records 
in addition to a single login  accessanyware delivers a single user interface and integrated database 
therefore  from a single login to the system  users with appropriate security have the ability to search and retrieve information regarding patients and cases for chart analysis  view  print and fax patient documents  as well as analyze or complete deficient documents  via the completion workflow module 
the functions presented to the user vary with the user s security 
for example  if the user is a clinician  he she is presented with an inbox function that displays a list of incomplete charts awaiting completion and a list of linked patients assigned to them

the small number of customers  the dependence on remarketing partner idx  and extended sales cycles has contributed to variability in quarterly and annual operating results 
lanvision expects that as its customer base continues to increase  and sales through its remarketing agreements increase and the actions of any one customer will have less of an effect on its quarterly and annual operating results 
the loss of a major customer or the remarketing partner idx could have a material adverse effect on lanvision 
signed agreements backlog see also item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations backlog  for an explanation of the current year backlog compared with the prior year backlog 
lanvision enters into master agreements with its customers to specify the scope of the system to be installed and or services to be provided by lanvision  the agreed upon aggregate price and the timetable for implementation 
the master agreement typically provides that lanvision will deliver the system in phases pursuant to the customer s purchase orders  thereby allowing the customer flexibility in the timing of its receipt of systems and to make adjustments that may arise based upon changes in technology or changes in customer needs 
the master agreement also allows the customer to request additional components as the installation progresses  which additions are then separately negotiated as to price and terms 
historically  customers have ultimately purchased systems and services in addition to those originally contemplated by the master agreement  although there can be no assurance that this trend will continue in the future 
at january   lanvision has agreements  purchase orders or royalty reports from remarketing partners for systems and related services excluding support and maintenance  and transaction based revenues for the application hosting services which have not been delivered  installed and accepted which  if fully performed  will generate future revenues of approximately  the related products and services are expected to be delivered over the next two to three years 
furthermore  lanvision has entered into application hosting agreements  which are expected to generate revenues in excess of  through their respective renewal dates in fiscal years and lanvision s master agreements also generally provide for an initial maintenance period and give the customer the right to subscribe for maintenance and support services on a monthly  quarterly  or annual basis 
maintenance and support revenues for fiscal years  and were approximately   and  respectively 
maintenance and support revenues are expected to increase in at january   lanvision had maintenance agreements  purchase orders or royalty reports from remarketing partners for maintenance  which if fully performed  will generate future revenues of approximately  through their respective renewal dates in fiscal years and the commencement of revenue recognition varies depending on the size and complexity of the system  the implementation schedule requested by the customer and usage by customers of the application hosting services 
therefore  lanvision is unable to accurately predict the revenue it expects to achieve in any particular period 
lanvision s master agreements generally provide that the customer may terminate its agreement upon a material breach by lanvision  or may delay certain aspects of the installation 
there can be no assurance that a customer will not cancel all or any portion of master agreement or delay installations 
a termination or installation delay of one or more phases of an agreement  or the failure of lanvision to procure additional agreements  could have a material adverse effect on lanvision s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
royalties lanvision incorporates software licensed from various vendors into its proprietary software 
in addition  third party  stand alone software is required to operate lanvision s proprietary software 
lanvision licenses these software products  and pays the required royalties and or license fees when such software is delivered to lanvision s customers 
employees as of january  lanvision had full time employees 
in addition  lanvision utilizes independent contractors to supplement its staff  as needed 
none of lanvision s employees are represented by a labor union or subject to a collective bargaining agreement 
lanvision has never experienced a work stoppage and believes that its employee relations are good

in addition  the stock market  in general  has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations which have particularly affected the market price of many high technology companies and which have been often unrelated to the operating performance of a specific company 
many technology companies  including lanvision  experience significant fluctuations in the market price of their equity securities 
there can be no assurance that the market price of the common stock will not decline  or otherwise continue to experience significant fluctuations in the future 
b according to the transfer agent records  lanvision had stockholders of record as of april  because brokers and other institutions on behalf of stockholders hold many of such shares  lanvision is unable to determine with complete accuracy the current total number of stockholders represented by these record holders

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations see also part  item  business for general and specific descriptions of lanvision s business 
application of critical accounting policies see also notes to consolidated financial statements lanvision s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires lanvision to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
on an on going basis  lanvision evaluates its estimates  including those related to product revenues  bad debts  capitalized software development costs  income taxes  warranty obligations  support contracts  contingencies and litigation 
lanvision bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that lanvision believes are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and revenue recognition 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
lanvision believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition lanvision records revenues for customer contracts  including special payment agreements and royalties from third party resellers in accordance with statement of position  software revenue recognition 
revenue is derived from the licensing and sale of systems  either directly to end users or through third party resellers  comprising internally developed software  third party software and hardware components  product support  maintenance and professional services  and  application hosting services that provide high quality  transaction or subscriptions based document imaging management services from a central data center 
generally  revenues from software license fees and hardware sales to end users are recognized when a master agreement is signed and products are made available to end users 
revenues from agreements that contain multiple element arrangements are allocated to the various elements based on the fair value of the elements 
revenues related to routine installation and integration and project management are deferred until the work is performed 
if a contract requires lanvision to perform services and modifications that are deemed significant to system acceptance  revenues are recorded either on the percentage of completion method or revenue related to the delivered hardware and software components are deferred until such obligations are deemed insignificant  depending on the contractual terms 
lanvision follows this method since reasonably dependable estimates of the revenues and costs applicable to various stages of a contract can be made 
recognized revenues and profit are subject to revisions as the contract progresses to completion 
revisions in profit estimates are charged or credited to income in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
revenues from consulting  education  and application hosting services are recognized as the services are performed 
revenues from short term support and maintenance agreements are recognized ratably over the term of the agreements 
billings to customers recorded prior to the recognition of revenue are classified as deferred revenues 
revenues recognized prior to progress billings to customers are recorded as contract receivables 
under the terms of a remarketing agreement with idx information systems corporation  royalties are remitted by idx to lanvision based upon idx sublicensing lanvision s software to idx s customers 
thirty percent of the royalty is due days following the end of the month in which idx executes an end user license agreement with its customer 
lanvision recognizes this revenue upon receipt of the royalty report 
the remaining seventy percent of the royalty is due from idx  in varying amounts based on implementation milestones  days following the end of the month in which a milestone occurs 
lanvision records this revenue when the seventy percent payment due from idx is fixed and determinable  which is generally when the products are made available to end users 
each contract is reviewed quarterly with the appropriate lanvision client manager to determine the appropriateness of the revenue recognition criteria applied to the individual contracts based upon the most currently available information as to the status of the contract  the customer comments  if any  and the status of any open or unresolved issues with the customer 
bad debts accounts and contract receivables are comprised of amounts owed lanvision for licensed software  professional services  including maintenance services and application hosting activities 
contracts with individual customers and resellers determine when receivables are due 
in determining the allowance for doubtful accounts  each unpaid receivable is reviewed quarterly with the appropriate lanvision client manager to determine the payment status based upon the most currently available information as to the status of the receivables  the customer comments  if any  and the status of any open or unresolved issues with the customer preventing the payment thereof 
corrective action  if necessary  is taken by lanvision to resolve open issues related to unpaid receivables 
during these quarterly reviews  lanvision determines the required allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the unwillingness or inability of its customers or resellers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of lanvision s customers or resellers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
lanvision s customers typically have been well established hospitals  medical facilities  or major healthcare information systems companies that resell lanvision s products  which have good credit histories  and payments have been received within normal time frames for the industry 
however  some healthcare facilities have experienced significant operating losses and limited cash resources as a result of limits on third party reimbursements from insurance companies and governmental entities 
extended payment of lanvision receivables is not uncommon 
capitalized software development costs software development costs are accounted for in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the costs of software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed 
costs associated with the planning and designing phase of software development  including coding and testing activities necessary to establish technological feasibility are classified as product research and development and are expensed as incurred 
once technological feasibility has been determined  a portion of the costs incurred in development  including coding  testing  and product quality assurance  are capitalized and subsequently reported at the lower of unamortized cost or net realizable value 
lanvision capitalized   and  in  and  respectively 
research and development expense  net of capitalized software development expenditures  was   and  in  and  respectively 
amortization is provided on a product by product basis over the estimated economic life of the software  not to exceed three years  using the straight line method 
amortization commences when a product is available for general release to customers 
unamortized capitalized costs determined to be in excess of the net realizable value of a product are expensed at the date of such determination 
amortization expense was   and  in  and  respectively 
lanvision reviews  on an on going basis  the carrying value of its capitalized software development expenditures  net of accumulated amortization 
lanvision believes that to replicate the existing software would cost significantly more than the stated net value of  at january  over the last three years  lanvision has spent  in research and development  of which  or  has been capitalized 
amortization of capitalized software expenditures during the last three years has amounted to  or a net increase in capitalized software of only  during the last three years 
many of the programs related to capitalized software development continue to have great value to lanvision s current products and those under development as the concepts  ideas and software code are readily transferable and are incorporated into new products 
contractual obligations payments by fiscal year total long term debt capitalized leases operating leases accrued interest  assuming no warrant value see below total capitalized leases during fiscal year lanvision acquired computer equipment and related software for a new application hosting services data center  which are accounted for as capitalized leases 
the amounts of the leased assets by category are computer equipment  computer software  and prepaid maintenance and expenses  for a total of  in new assets 
the leases are payable monthly in installments of  through august and an additional amount of  through december the present value of the future lease payments upon lease inception was  using the interest rates implicit in the lease agreements at the inception of the leases 
long term debt the long term debt of  is secured by all of the assets of lanvision and the loan agreement  as amended  restricts lanvision from incurring additional indebtedness for borrowed money  including capitalized leases  limits certain investments  restricts substantial asset sales  capital expenditures  cash dividends  stock repurchases  and mergers and consolidations with unaffiliated entities without lender consent 
in addition  lanvision is required to meet certain financial covenants  including minimum levels of revenues  earnings  and net worth 
also  the loan agreement required lanvision to maintain a minimum cash balance of  through the maturity of the loan on july  lanvision was in compliance with all of the covenants during fiscal year  except for the minimum earnings before interest and taxes requirement at the end of the first quarter  which covenant was waived by the lender 
lanvision believes that it will be able to comply with all of its covenants in fiscal year  and the likelihood of defaulting on the debt covenants is not likely absent any material adverse events that may affect the healthcare industry or our market 
in the past  lanvision has requested  and the lender has granted  waivers of certain debt covenants 
however  our expectations of future operating results and continued compliance with the debt covenants cannot be assured and the lenders actions are not controllable by us 
if our projections of future operating results are not achieved and the debt is placed in default  lanvision would experience a material adverse impact on the reported financial position and results of operations 
in connection with the issuance of the long term debt  lanvision issued warrants to purchase  shares of common stock of lanvision at per share at any time through july  the warrants are subject to customary antidilution and registration rights provisions 
under the terms of the long term debt agreement  lanvision has guaranteed the lender that the increase in the market value of the stock underlying the warrants  at the time of loan maturity  over the exercise price plus the interest paid on the loan will yield the lender a compound annual return 
if the yield from the warrants plus interest paid does not provide the lender with the guaranteed compound annual return  lanvision is required to pay the additional amount in cash at the time of maturity 
accordingly  lanvision is accruing interest on the loan at a compound interest rate  regardless of the market value of the stock and the inherent value of the warrants 
assuming that the warrants have no value  the maximum amount of the accrued and unpaid interest at maturity on july  will be  less any prepayments made as discussed below 
subsequent to january   lanvision collected in excess of  of the  in contract receivables at january   and on march   made a prepayment of  on the accrued and unpaid interest on the long term debt due on july   and the lender agreed to reduce the minimum cash balance requirement to  through the maturity of the loan on july  see also liquidity and capital resources for additional discussion on refinancing a portion of the accrued and unpaid interest at maturity on july  operating leases lanvision rents office and data center space and equipment under noncancelable operating leases that expire  at various times  during the next three fiscal years 
the minimum payments  by year  are detailed in the contractual obligations table above 
warranties and indemnities lanvision provides for the estimated cost of the product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
should products fail to meet certain performance standards for an initial warranty period  lanvision s estimated warranty liability might need to be increased 
lanvision bases its warranty estimates on the nature of any performance complaint  the effort necessary to resolve the issue  customer requirements and any potential concessions which may be required to be granted to a customer which result from performance issues 
lanvision s aspen application hosting services guarantees specific up time and response time performance standards  which  if not met may result in reduced revenues  as a penalty  for the month in which the standards are not met 
lanvision s standard agreements with its customers also usually include intellectual property infringement indemnifications provisions to indemnify them from and against third party claims  and for liabilities  damages  and expenses arising out of lanvision s operation of its business or any negligent act or omission of lanvision 
to date lanvision has always maintained the aspen performance standards and has not been required to make any material penalty payments to customers or indemnify any customers for any material third party claims 
at january  and lanvision has a warranty reserve in the amount of  each contract is reviewed quarterly with the appropriate lanvision client manager to determine the need for a warranty reserve based upon the most currently available information as to the status of the contract  the customer comments  if any  and the status of any open or unresolved issues with the customer 
income taxes the benefit provision for income taxes was   and  in  and  respectively  and the net non current deferred tax asset was  and at january  and  respectively 
a key assumption in the determination of the book tax benefit provision is the amount of the valuation allowance required to reduce the related deferred tax assets 
a valuation allowance reduces the deferred tax assets to a level which will  more likely than not  be realized 
whether the deferred tax assets will be realized depends on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the deferred tax asset become deductible 
the net deferred tax assets reflect management s estimate of the amount which will  more likely than not  reduce future taxable income 
as of january   lanvision believes that a valuation allowance is required to reduce a portion of the deferred tax assets  primarily relating to certain net operating loss carry forwards  for the following reasons although lanvision generated  of earnings before income taxes during the three year period ended january   there can be no assurance that lanvision will be able to neither achieve consistent profitability on a quarterly or annual basis nor be able to sustain or increase its revenue growth in future periods and believes historical operating results may not be indicative of the future performance of lanvision in the near or long term 
prior to  lanvision incurred net losses as indicated by the carry forwards of approximately  based on the expenses associated with current and planned staffing levels  continued profitability and utilization of carry forwards to be evaluated as more likely than not is dependent upon increasing revenues 
lanvision s backlog has been trending up over the past three years 
as of january   lanvision estimates that a valuation allowance of approximately  was required to reduce the deferred tax assets  primarily relating to loss carry forwards  to a level lanvision currently believes will be utilized to offset future earnings before income taxes based on the current backlog and forecasts over the next two years 
the valuation allowance is required due to the inability to predict on a longer term basis that lanvision will more likely than not attain levels of profitability required to utilize additional carry forwards 
off balance sheet arrangements lanvision does not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for each fiscal year indicated  certain operating data as percentages consolidated statements of income fiscal year systems sales services  maintenance and support application hosting services total revenues cost of sales selling  general and administrative product research and development total operating expenses operating profit other income expense  net income benefit taxes net earnings cost of systems sales cost of services  maintenance and support cost of application hosting services because a significant percentage of the operating costs are expensed as incurred  a variation in the timing of systems sales and installations and the resulting revenue recognition can cause significant variations in operating results 
as a result  period to period comparisons may not be meaningful with respect to the past operations nor are they necessarily indicative of the future operations of lanvision in the near or long term 
the data in the table is presented solely for the purpose of reflecting the relationship of various operating elements to revenues for the periods indicated 
all references to a fiscal year refer to the fiscal year commencing on february of that calendar year and ending on january of the following year

total revenues for fiscal year were  compared with revenues of  in fiscal year  a decrease of  or 
the decrease was primarily the result of decreased systems sales  primarily software  and professional services revenues 
revenues from systems sales in fiscal year were  a decrease of  or  compared with fiscal year the decrease resulted primarily from lower software revenues from siemens in and from existing customers in that made significant one time upgrades to their systems in the decrease in software revenues was offset  to some extent  by increased revenues from idx and by increases in maintenance and application hosting revenues 
revenues from services  maintenance  and support in fiscal year were  a decrease of  or  compared with fiscal year professional services revenues in fiscal year were  a decrease of  or  compared with fiscal year the decrease was caused by lower utilization of existing staff in and fewer consulting engagements in compared with maintenance and support revenues in fiscal year were  an increase of  or  in fiscal year the increase in maintenance and support revenues in fiscal year is primarily the result of new installations by our remarketing partner idx  and expansion  of existing lanvision client systems 
revenues from application hosting services increased  or to  when compared with  in the increase was primarily the result of a full year of revenue relating to the addition of two new application hosting services clients in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year application hosting services revenues are primarily subscription based 
in fiscal year  three customers accounted for of the total revenues compared with in fiscal year  exclusive of our remarketing partners 
total revenues from siemens were  in fiscal year compared with  in fiscal year which decline was offset by increased revenues from idx that were  or of total revenues  in fiscal year compared with  or of total revenues in fiscal year approximately of fiscal year revenues came from fulfillment of backlog and add on business  primarily expansion and upgrades of systems for lanvision s existing and new clients  and came from resellers  compared with and  respectively in fiscal year revenues for fiscal year and were less than lanvision s plan for each year 
the shortfalls in anticipated revenues occurred for various reasons  including significantly lower spending on information technology by healthcare institutions as many institutions delayed implementation for new electronic medical record systems until final federal health privacy regulations to comply with hipaa were issued and lower sales by our remarketing partner siemens who is building a competitive product 
buying decisions at certain hospitals and integrated healthcare delivery networks are influenced by recommendations of the largest healthcare information systems vendors  including siemens medical solutions health services corporation  mckesson hboc  inc  cerner corporation  idx information systems corporation and eclipsys corporation 
it continues to be difficult for companies with relatively small sales forces to influence the buying decisions as effectively as the major his vendors which is why lanvision transitioned its distribution model from a direct selling organization to primarily an indirect distribution  primarily through remarketers and the asp application hosting services based delivery model 
the original remarketing agreement with siemens was signed in  and throughout fiscal years  and  lanvision and siemens integrated the lanvision product line with the siemens novius product 
the final integration and testing of the products was completed in late during  and most of  siemens remarketed lanvision s products on a limited basis through their specialized document imaging sales force 
in  siemens advised lanvision that they had undertaken the development of their own medical records document imaging application that will replace lanvision s application 
accordingly  future software revenues from siemens are not expected to be significant  if any 
approximately    and  of siemens software royalties were recognized by lanvision in   and  respectively 
the idx remarketing agreement  which was signed in january  resulted in two signed agreements in fiscal year  and four signed agreements in total idx revenues for the two years amounted to approximately  or of the total revenues for the last two fiscal years 
lanvision relies on idx for a significant amount of its revenues  the loss of which would have a material adverse affect on future results of operations 
lanvision believes a greater percentage of its future revenues will come from remarketing agreements with  idx  m and other his related vendors 
lanvision continues to actively pursue remarketing agreements with other companies 
lanvision believes the large his vendors  hospitals and integrated healthcare delivery networks now have a better understanding of the valuable role the emr plays in providing a truly computerized patient record 
as more healthcare providers become aware of and better understand the significant economic and operating benefits of the emr and other imaging management and workflow applications  lanvision believes the future demand for its products and services will increase 
many companies have emerged to provide healthcare applications through private intranets or secure applications on the internet 
additionally  the traditional his companies have developed clinical information systems for the internet 
lanvision s applications are well suited for integration with such clinical systems and are optimized for use on the internet and private intranets 
through lanvision s aspen services  application hosting customers can rapidly deploy and access healthcare information using web browser based technology from a central data center on a per transaction or subscription basis thereby minimizing up front capital expenditures 
lanvision believes healthcare organizations will continue to increase their use of healthcare applications through the internet  and lanvision s products are an integral part of providing a complete emr across the internet 
lanvision continues to actively pursue strategic relationships with other healthcare application service providers 
management believes that revenue growth in will be fueled by an increase in incremental revenue from existing and new strategic distribution partners  an increase in interest by healthcare organizations in lanvision products and services to assist in compliance with the federal hipaa standards as they relate to the confidentiality and security of medical records  and incremental new revenues derived from a new line of business for lanvision in the remote coding and revenue cycle workflows for the hospital marketplace 
the revenue cycle workflows are a logical extension of the product line because of the ability of the financial services departments of hospitals to access and process patient information from the emr 
due to an acute shortage of available coding personnel  there currently exists a great demand for solutions to attract and retain qualified coders and to make the coding process more efficient 
cost of sales 
cost of sales consists of cost of systems sales  cost of services  maintenance and support and cost of application hosting services 
cost of systems sales includes amortization of capitalized software expenditures  royalties  and the cost of third party hardware and software 
cost of systems sales  as a percentage of systems sales  varies from period to period depending on hardware and software configurations of the systems sold 
the cost of systems sales as a percentage of revenues in fiscal year and were and  respectively 
the higher relative costs in reflect a significantly lower volume of lanvision software revenues 
cost of services  maintenance  and support includes salaries and benefits for support and professional services personnel and the cost of third party maintenance contracts 
the cost of services  maintenance and support as a percentage of services  maintenance and support revenues in and were and  respectively 
the cost of application hosting services represents primarily the cost associated with operating  the data center 
the cost of application hosting as a percentage of application hosting revenues in and were and  respectively 
the decrease in the relative cost of proving application hosting services is the result of a increase in application hosting revenues with only a increase in the cost to provide the services 
the cost comparison  between and  of providing the application hosting services are not comparable  as the cost of application hosting services in represented primarily processing fees paid to a third party data center provider for most of the year plus the cost associated with establishing and operating a new lanvision data center  for part of the year  while the associated cost in  relate exclusively to the operation of the new lanvision data center 
lanvision believes that it can add additional application hosting customers with a minimal increase in cost  as the basic infrastructure and operating costs are relatively fixed at this time 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel and related costs  travel and living expenses  trade shows  etc 
for selling and marketing activities and general corporate and administrative activities 
in fiscal year  selling  general  and administrative expenses were  compared with  in fiscal year the  decrease in fiscal year is primarily attributable to approximately  in decreased professional fees including legal costs in of asserting lanvision s intellectual property rights in two cases  initiated in prior years  to protect lanvision s proprietary technology that it believed was being used by others without lanvision s permission  reimbursement in of approximately  of prior year s legal expenses upon settlement of the lanvision proprietary technology claims  a  favorable change in the estimate for certain franchise tax liabilities as a result of the tax authority audit of certain prior year s tax returns  offset by approximately  in additional expenses primarily increased selling expenses as the direct sales department was expanded and increased travel costs incurred 
product research and development 
product research and development expenses in fiscal year were  compared with  in fiscal year the decrease reflects primarily the increased capitalized software development expenditures 
during  lanvision concentrated its development efforts primarily on new revenue cycle products 
lanvision capitalized  in product research and development expenditures in fiscal year  compared with  in operating profit 
operating profit in fiscal year was  compared with  in fiscal year the  decrease  results primarily from decreased systems sales  most notable software revenues  and an overall increase in cost of sales as discussed above  offset to some extent by a the increased application hosting services revenues b reduced selling  general  and administrative expenses and c lower research and development expenses as discussed above 
other income expense 
interest income consists primarily of interest on cash and cash equivalents 
the decrease results from lower average cash balances in fiscal year compared with fiscal year and significantly lower interest rates 
interest expense in and is related primarily to the long term debt and  additional interest on the unpaid accrued interest payable to the lender and capitalized leases 
provision for income taxes 
lanvision is in a tax loss carry forward position 
the tax loss carry forward approximates  which begins to expire in lanvision also has an alternative minimum tax credit carry forward of approximately  which has an unlimited carry forward period 
the income tax provision in fiscal year  and  related to the alternative minimum tax provision  as all income could not be offset against the tax loss carry forward 
in fiscal year  lanvision recorded a tax benefit in the amount of  as a result of a reduction in the valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets relating primarily to the tax loss carry forward based on future earnings before income tax projections 
net earnings 
net earnings in fiscal year were  compared with net earnings of  in fiscal year the  increase results primarily from the reduction in interest expense  net and the  tax benefit  which are discussed above which offset the  reduction in operating profit  resulting primarily from a  reduction in revenues primarily in software revenues as discussed above 
backlog 
at january   lanvision has master agreements  purchase orders or royalty reports from remarketing partners for systems and related services excluding support and maintenance  and transaction based application hosting revenues  which have not been delivered  installed and accepted which  if fully performed  would generate future revenues of approximately  compared with  at january  the related products and services are expected to be delivered over the next two to three years 
the reduction in master agreement backlog results from the installation of a major idx account in the amount of approximately  in fiscal year that was signed in fiscal year  and the cancellation in of siemens orders  in the amount of approximately  as a result of changes in the business environment  whereby siemens and lanvision mutually agreed to re align their contractual arrangement as a result of siemens decision to build a competitive product 
in addition  customers contract for maintenance and support services on a monthly  quarterly  or annual basis 
at january  lanvision had maintenance agreements  purchase orders or royalty reports from remarketing partners for maintenance  which if fully performed  will generate future revenues of approximately  compared with  at january   through their respective renewal dates in fiscal year and in  maintenance and support revenues approximated  compared with  in and are expected to increase in fiscal year furthermore  lanvision has entered into application hosting agreements  which are expected to generate revenues in excess of  through their respective renewal dates in fiscal years and comparison of fiscal year with revenues 
total revenues for fiscal year were  compared with revenues of  in fiscal year  an increase of  or 
the increase was primarily the result of increased systems sales and increased professional services revenues 
revenues from systems sales in fiscal year were  an increase of  or of systems sales in fiscal year resulting primarily from upgrading and expansion of systems with existing clients 
revenues from services  maintenance  and support in fiscal year were  an increase of  or over fiscal year professional services revenues in fiscal year were  an increase of  or of the professional services revenues in fiscal year the increase was caused by higher utilization of existing staff in and significant new installations in compared with maintenance and support revenues in fiscal year were  an increase of  or over maintenance and support revenues in fiscal year the increase in maintenance and support revenues in fiscal year is primarily due to new installations by our remarketing partners  and expansion of existing lanvision client systems  offset by some reductions in maintenance as some customers transitioned to non lanvision systems 
revenues from application hosting services increased  or 
the increase was due to the addition of two new application hosting services clients in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year application hosting services revenues at some locations were usage based and fluctuations in admissions  length of stay  return patient visits  etc 
affect the system usage and the corresponding application hosting services revenues 
in fiscal year  three customers accounted for of the total revenues compared with in fiscal year  exclusive of our remarketing partners 
total revenues from siemens were  in fiscal year compared with  in fiscal year and through idx   in fiscal year  the first year of the agreement 
approximately of fiscal year revenues came from fulfillment of backlog and add on business  primarily expansion and upgrades of systems for lanvision s existing and new clients  and came from resellers  compared with and  respectively in fiscal year cost of sales 
cost of sales consists of cost of systems sales  cost of services  maintenance and support and cost of application hosting services 
cost of systems sales includes amortization of capitalized software expenditures  royalties  and the cost of third party hardware and software 
cost of systems sales  as a percentage of systems sales  varies from period to period depending on hardware and software configurations of the systems sold 
the cost of systems sales as a percentage of revenues in fiscal year and were and  respectively 
the higher costs in reflect a significantly higher volume of hardware and third party components  with lower margins 
cost of services  maintenance  and support includes salaries and benefits for support and professional services personnel and the cost of third party maintenance contracts 
cost of services  maintenance and support as a percentage of services  maintenance and support revenues in and were and  respectively 
the lower relative cost reflects greater efficiencies in providing the service 
the cost of application hosting services represents primarily processing fees paid to a third party data center provider for most of the year plus the cost associated with establishing and operating  for part of the year  a new lanvision data center as discussed above which increased expenses relative to revenues 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel and related costs  travel and living expenses  trade shows  etc 
for selling and marketing activities and general corporate and administrative activities 
in fiscal year  selling  general  and administrative expenses were  compared with  in fiscal year the  increase in fiscal year is primarily attributable to increased legal costs of asserting lanvision s intellectual property rights in two cases to protect lanvision s proprietary technology that it believed was being used by others without lanvision s permission 
also  lanvision s sales costs increased as lanvision expanded its direct sales organization to handle the increased inquiries into lanvision s products and services 
this expansion of the direct sales organization resulted in two new direct clients for the aspen application hosting services 
product research and development 
product research and development expenses in fiscal year were  compared with  in fiscal year the increase reflects primarily the increased software development costs for new products 
during  lanvision concentrated its development efforts primarily on its new products accessanyware and codinganyware 
lanvision capitalized  in software development expenditures in fiscal year  compared with  in operating profit 
operating profit in fiscal year was  compared with  in fiscal year the  increase  results primarily from the  increased revenues in all categories  primarily from systems sales from upgrading and expansion of systems with existing clients  and services  maintenance and support revenues  offset to some extent by an overall  increase in cost of sales which reflects a significantly higher volume of hardware and third party components  with lower margins and increased application hosting operating costs for the new data center and  increased selling  general  and administrative expenses and research and development expenses all as discussed above 
other income expense 
interest income consists primarily of interest on cash and cash equivalents 
the decrease results from lower average cash balances in fiscal year compared with fiscal year and significantly lower interest rates 
interest expense in and is related primarily to the long term debt and  additional interest on the unpaid long term accrued interest payable to the lender and capitalized leases 
provision for income taxes 
the income tax provision in fiscal year and  relates to the alternative minimum tax provision  as all income cannot be offset against the tax loss carry forwards 
net earnings 
net earnings in fiscal year were  compared with net earnings of  in fiscal year the  improvement  results primarily from increased revenues in all categories offset to some extent by higher cost of sales  and higher selling  general  and administrative and research and development expenses and higher net interest in fiscal year since commencing operations in  lanvision has incurred substantial operating losses 
although lanvision achieved profitability during the last four years  lanvision incurred net losses in most fiscal years prior thereto 
based upon the expenses associated with current and planned staffing levels  continued profitability is dependent upon increasing revenues 
there can be no assurance that lanvision will be able to neither achieve consistent profitability on a quarterly or annual basis nor be able to sustain or increase its revenue growth in future periods and believes historical operating results may not be indicative of the future performance of lanvision in the near or long term 
liquidity and capital resources during the last six fiscal years  lanvision has funded its operations  working capital needs  and capital expenditures primarily from a combination of cash generated by operations  and a  loan 
lanvision s liquidity is dependent upon numerous factors to include the timing and amount of revenues and collection of contractual amounts from customers  amounts invested in research and development  capital expenditures  and the level of operating expenses  all of which can vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
lanvision s customers typically have been well established hospitals or medical facilities or major his companies that resell lanvision products which have good credit histories and payments have been received within normal time frames for the industry 
however  some healthcare organizations have experienced significant operating losses as a result of limits on third party reimbursements from insurance companies and governmental entities 
agreements with customers often involve significant amounts and contract terms typically require customers to make progress payments 
lanvision has no significant obligations for capital resources  other than its long term debt and accrued interest described below  the noncancelable operating leases of approximately  payable over the next three years and capitalized leases of approximately  payable over the next two years 
capital expenditures for property and equipment in are not expected to exceed  of which  would be for the expansion of the data center  on an as needed basis  as new application hosting customers are added 
on july   upon maturity of the long term debt  lanvision may  under the terms of the long term debt agreement  be required to pay to the lender an amount necessary so that the market value of the stock underlying the warrants issued to the lender in connection with the long term debt  plus the interest paid on the loan will yield the lender a compound annual return 
if the yield from the warrants plus interest paid does not provide the lender with the guaranteed compound annual return  lanvision is required to pay the additional amount in cash at the time of maturity 
accordingly  lanvision is accruing interest on the loan at a compound interest rate  regardless of the market value of the stock and the inherent value of the warrants 
at january   the estimate of the maximum amount at maturity  which would be required to be paid to the lender assuming the warrants have no value  is approximately  less the prepayment made on march  of  on the accrued and unpaid interest on the long term debt 
if the market price of lanvision s common stock exceeds per share the purchase price of the warrant then the value of the warrant would reduce the amount of the accrued and unpaid interest required to be paid at maturity by such value 
depending on the amount of cash lanvision has at that time  and the value of the warrants  if any  it may be necessary for lanvision to borrow funds or obtain additional equity in order to fund the deferred interest payable to the lender at that time 
lanvision believes that continued operating performance improvements should enable it to fund a portion of any obligation and borrow the additional funds necessary to retire the obligation at maturity 
lanvision has received nonbinding proposals with favorable terms to refinance the deferred interest on its existing debt 
however  there can be no assurance lanvision will be able to do so 
over the last several years  lanvision s revenues were less than its internal plans 
however  during the same period  lanvision has expended significant amounts for capital expenditures  product research and development  sales  support and consulting expenses 
this resulted in significant net cash outlays over the last five years 
although lanvision reduced staffing levels and related expenses in prior years  increased revenues and improved operating performance over the last three year period when compared to the prior three year period  lanvision s expenses will continue to increase 
accordingly  to continue to achieve increasing profitability  and positive cash flow  it is necessary for lanvision to increase revenues or continue to reduce expenses 
lanvision believes that the requirement for healthcare organizations to become hipaa compliant  and the signing of the idx information systems corporation remarketing agreement and the m marketing and referral agreement should offer opportunities to increase revenues 
lanvision believes also that market opportunities are such that lanvision should be able to increase its revenues 
however  there can be no assurance lanvision will be able to do so 
at january  lanvision had cash and cash equivalents of  cash equivalents consist primarily of overnight bank investments and short term commercial paper 
under the terms of its loan agreement  as amended  lanvision has agreed to maintain a minimum cash and cash equivalent balance of  through the maturity of the loan on july  during the first six months of fiscal year   of long term debt and approximately  of deferred interest is required to be repaid to the lender 
subsequent to january   lanvision collected in excess of  of the  in contract receivables at january   and on march   made a prepayment of  on the accrued and unpaid interest on the long term debt due on july   and the lender agreed to reduce the current cash balance requirement to  through the maturity of the loan on july  based on current cash and operating projections  it is anticipated that lanvision will have to borrow a maximum of  at a significantly lower interest rate than the current debt  to finance the final payment of the accrued and unpaid interest due on july  accordingly  the interest expense in the second half of fiscal year should be significantly less than the first half 
lanvision has carefully monitored operating expenses during the last four fiscal years  and believes it will improve operating results in fiscal year notwithstanding the current levels of revenues and operating profit  for the foreseeable future  lanvision will need to continually assess its revenue prospects compared to its then current expenditure levels 
if it does not appear likely that revenues will increase  it may be necessary to reduce operating expenses or raise cash through additional borrowings  the sale of assets  or other equity financing 
certain of these actions will require current lender approval 
however  there can be no assurance lanvision will be successful in any of these efforts 
if it is necessary to significantly reduce operating expenses  this could have an adverse effect on future operating performance 
lanvision believes that its present cash position  combined with cash generation anticipated from operations  which for the last two years has exceeded  each year  and the assumed ability to refinance a portion of the deferred interest payment on july  will be sufficient to meet anticipated cash requirements during fiscal year lanvision has received nonbinding proposals with favorable terms to refinance the deferred interest on its existing debt 
to date  inflation has not had a material impact on lanvision s revenues or expenses 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk lanvision currently invests its cash balances  in excess of its current needs  in approximately day commercial paper 
lanvision does not invest for the purposes of trading in securities  however  the portfolio is managed and invested for maximum return on the investments 
additionally  lanvision does not have any significant market risk exposure at january
