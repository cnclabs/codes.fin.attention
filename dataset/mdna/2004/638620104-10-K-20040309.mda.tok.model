item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview to facilitate your review and understanding of this section of our report and the financial statements that follow  we are providing this overview of what management believes are the most important considerations for understanding our company and its business the key factors that drive our business and the principal associated risks 
the company we are a public equity reit that invests in senior housing and long term care properties 
passive investments our investments are passive ie  we do not operate the properties  investor flexibility liquidity investors desiring to invest in this real estate sector can do so with an investment flexibility and liquidity that is not available in most direct investments  and no double taxation our income is not taxed at the corporate level as long as we continue to distribute to our stockholders at least of our taxable income and meet other reit tax requirements 
business purpose our long term corporate goal is clearly defined to provide stockholders with an attractive total return based on a secure dividend 
our business model for achieving this goal is equally straightforward 
we invest passively in geographically diversified senior housing and long term care properties primarily assisted and independent living facilities and skilled nursing facilities 
in making these investments  we generally give equal weight to facility attributes and operator quality  drawing on our extensive management expertise and experience in this real estate sector 
we continue to focus on this sector because we continue to believe in its growth potential  as evidenced by the favorable demographics of a rapidly growing elderly population and the corresponding recognized need for additional and improved senior housing and long term care alternatives 
operations we primarily make our investments by acquiring an ownership interest in facilities and leasing them to unaffiliated operators under triple net leases that pass all facility operating costs insurance  property taxes  utilities  maintenance  capital improvements  etc 
through to the tenant operator 
in addition  but intentionally to a much lesser extent because we view the risks of this activity to be greater  from time to time we extend mortgage loans to operators 
currently  about of our revenues are derived from our leases  with the remaining from our mortgage loans 
last three years in early  we evaluated a number of alternatives including a medium term notes exchange  high yield debt  additional mortgage financing  convertible debentures  convertible preferred and a rights offering to recapitalize our company to better position us for future growth 
ultimately  we decided the best course of action was to de leverage by issuing equity specifically common stock that  coupled with a dividend reduction of about to obtain a more conservative dividend payout in line with our historical experience  allowed us to extinguish the near term maturities of our long term debt and  although still dilutive  we believe enhanced our credit statistics and balance sheet and served to help preserve our investment grade credit ratings 
after decreasing from to by almost primarily due to the developments outlined below  our funds from operations ffo  which is defined and described in more detail below and  like most reits  is the key measurement tool that management looks to in running our business increased in over by over 
most of the reduction occurred in when the full impact of the developments described below was realized  while the increase primarily relates to internal growth and additional income from new investments made in and reduced interest expense as a result of the common stock offering 
we define funds from operations as income before extraordinary items adjusted for certain non cash items  primarily real estate depreciation and impairment of assets less gains losses on sales of facilities 
our measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other reits 
consequently  our funds from operations may not provide a meaningful measure of our performance as compared to that of other reits or as defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts 
the securities and exchange commission may not allow reits to add back impairment of assets charges in the calculation of funds from operations in the future 
funds from operations does not represent cash generated from operating activities as defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states funds from operations does not include changes in operating assets and liabilities and  therefore  should not be considered as an alternative to net income as the primary indicator of operating performance or to cash flow as a measure of liquidity 
operator financial problems 
we believe that largely marked the end of what had been a very challenging period for many of our operators as they worked through  with varying degrees of success  financial problems largely caused by skilled nursing facility and assisted and independent living facility capital market excesses in the late s and government reimbursement issues 
overly enamored with the sector s long term favorable demographics  a wide range of debt and equity investors flooded this market with large sums of readily available capital that led to excessive levels of operator debt and overbuilding in the late s 
skilled nursing facilities 
we saw unprecedented debt financed merger and acquisition activity with the large  publicly traded skilled nursing facility operators at a time when the federal government was changing the structure and amount of its reimbursement program in a way that did not support the debt incurred 
this led to a number of bankruptcies of these operators including five of the seven largest publicly traded skilled nursing facility operators that depressed this market 
this  in turn  adversely affected us by reducing our net income and ffo as a result of lost revenues from i negotiated rent reductions  ii lower rentals on re leased facilities acquired through lease terminations in and out of bankruptcy and iii facility closures in a few circumstances  coupled with related bankruptcy and other costs  including substantially increased general and administrative primarily legal expenses 
assisted and independent living facilities 
in our view  investors became irrationally exuberant with the assisted and independent living facility senior housing alternative  especially because unlike skilled nursing facilities  there generally were no requirements to obtain a certificate of need con or other significant governmental barriers for the construction of new facilities 
consequently  the enormous growth in supply rapidly exceeded market demand 
this resulted in newly constructed facilities incurring substantial losses and being unable to pay their rents as they experienced prolonged low occupancy rates 
we were forced either to restructure our leases of these facilities or find new operators  in many cases with rent deferrals or reductions to reflect depressed occupancy levels and market conditions 
our net income and ffo in turn were adversely affected because there were less rental revenues to offset the additional interest expense incurred to finance construction and increased restructuring expenses 
beverly enterprises portfolio restructuring 
in connection with the expiration of the initial term of many of our leases with beverly enterprises  inc beverly  effective january   we restructured our entire leased portfolio of skilled nursing facilities operated by them which accounted for about of our revenues for 
these leases were entered into with beverly in through after we were formed to invest primarily in beverly s facilities 
the leases contained some provisions not found in our leases today  including the ability of beverly to selectively renew the leases by cherry picking the portfolio 
in other words  beverly was able to enter into new leases with us covering the best performing properties and terminate the leases for about under performing properties 
given the generally poorer quality of these properties  we in turn were forced to close some of them and re lease the others for less rent  in several cases to unproven or lower quality operators 
many of these arrangements failed  resulting in further closures and restructurings  and some continue to have problems that may lead to further restructurings although to a much lesser extent 
our net income and ffo over the past three years have been adversely impacted by the cumulative effect of this beverly restructuring 
capital redeployment from mortgage loan prepayments and purchase option exercises 
we experienced a substantial increase in mortgage loan prepayments and purchase option exercises  especially in the mortgage prepayments largely resulted from a program we initiated to make our asset base more safe and secure by increasing the relative mix of leased versus mortgaged properties 
unlike leases  in bankruptcy a debtor does not need to determine timely whether to assign  affirm or reject the mortgage in its entirety or to make mortgage payments timely until it makes that determination  but rather can ignore its obligations  challenge the economics of the mortgage and cram down terms including principal amount  interest rate and payment terms to those reflecting typically distressed market levels 
to lower our overall exposure to this scenario  we encouraged prepayments by waiving any prepayment fees 
while our goal of improving our risk profile was met  our net income and ffo were adversely affected by the mortgage loan prepayments and purchase option exercises because we were unable to replace the significant lost revenues from the higher yielding leases and loans 
rather  because there were not any desirable new investments available to us at that time in fact  desirable new investments were only available in  we instead were forced to re deploy the capital to fulfill existing construction commitments for new assisted and independent living facilities that were not yet yielding revenue and otherwise pay down our lower cost debt 
restricted growth 
because of the factors noted above  we had no net internal growth in revenues from our existing portfolio and saw our net income and ffo decrease until similarly  we had only modest external growth in revenues from acquisitions over the past three years  with most of that coming in in  a number of attractive investment opportunities became available largely as a result of industry wide restructurings 
to supplement our capital sources and take advantage of these opportunities  we formed a joint venture with an institutional investor 
by the end of  we had made a total of about million in new investments  million for our own account and million by our joint venture  which contributed to our net income and ffo growth 
in  a combination of capital constraints and the absence of good investment opportunities contributed to minimal external growth 
focus and outlook for our focus for is to increase our net income and ffo 
in that regard  we are cautiously optimistic about both our internal and external growth prospects for we believe that the worst of the restructurings is behind us and  accordingly  that the annual rent increases built into our leases should overcome any reasonably foreseeable further restructurings 
we expect this modest internal growth to be bolstered by rents received from restructured leases and loans that produced modest or no revenue for all or most of many of these involve the newly constructed assisted and independent living facilities referred to above that are beginning to see increased occupancies now that further development has substantially moderated 
we are also seeing a number of attractive investment opportunities that we will be pursuing 
in management s view  there are two principal near term risks we face in maintaining and then growing our dividend 
the first is that more serious operator financial problems may lead to more extensive restructurings or tenant disruptions than we currently expect 
this could be unique to a particular operator or it could be more industry wide  such as further federal or state governmental reimbursement reductions in the case of our skilled nursing facilities as governments work through their budget deficits  continuing reduced occupancies or slow lease ups for our assisted and independent living facilities due to general economic and other factors  continuing increases in liability  insurance premiums and other expenses 
the second principal near term risk is the continued availability of reasonably priced capital that we need to take advantage of the number of attractive investments we are seeing and expect to continue to see at least in the near term 
critical accounting policies our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions  including those that impact our most critical accounting policies 
we base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following are our most critical accounting policies 
revenue recognition our rental revenue is accounted for in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for leases sfas no 
and sec staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition in financial statements sab no 
among other authoritative pronouncements 
these pronouncements require us to account for the rental income on a straight line basis unless a more appropriate method exists 
we believe that the method most reflective of the use of a healthcare facility is the straight line method 
straight line accounting requires us to calculate the total fixed rent to be paid over the life of the lease and recognize that revenue evenly over that life 
in a situation where a lease calls for fixed rental increases during the life of a lease or there is a period of free rent at the beginning of a lease  rental income recorded in the early years of a lease is higher than the actual cash rent received which creates an asset on the balance sheet called deferred rent receivable 
at some point during the lease  depending on the rent levels and terms  this reverses and the cash rent payments received during the later years of the lease are higher than the rental income recognized  which reduces the deferred rent receivable balance to zero by the end of the lease 
the majority of our leases do not contain fixed increases or provide for free or reduced rent at the beginning of the lease term 
however  certain leases for facilities we have constructed have free rent for the first three to six months and certain leases we have entered into  primarily with regard to facilities returned to us by operators in bankruptcy have reduced or free rent in the early months of the lease or fixed increases in future years 
we record the rent for these facilities on a straight line basis in accordance with sfas no 
however  we also assess the collectibility of the deferred portion of the rent that is to be collected in a future period in accordance with sab no 
this assessment is based on several factors  including the financial strength of the lessee and any guarantors  the historical operations and operating trends of the facility  the historical payment pattern of the facility and whether we intend to continue to lease the facility to the current operator  among others 
if our evaluation of these factors indicates we may not receive the rent payments due in the future  we provide a reserve against the current rental income as an offset to revenue  and depending on the circumstances  we may provide a reserve against the existing deferred rent balance for the portion  up to its full value  that we estimate will not be recovered 
this assessment requires us to determine whether there are factors indicating the future rent payments may not be fully collectible and to estimate the amount of the rent that will not be collected 
if our assumptions or estimates regarding a lease change in the future  we may have to record a reserve to reduce or further reduce the rental revenue recognized and or deferred rent receivable balance 
we recognized  of revenues in excess of cash received during   of revenues in excess of cash received during and  of revenues in excess of cash received during there is  at december   and  at december   of deferred rent receivables  net of reserves  recorded under the caption other assets on the balance sheets 
additional rents are generally computed as a percentage of facility revenues in excess of base amounts or as a percentage of the increase in the consumer price index 
additional rents are generally calculated and payable monthly or quarterly  and most of our leases contain provisions such that total rent cannot decrease from one year to the next 
while the calculations and payments of additional rents contingent upon revenue are generally made on a quarterly basis  sab no 
does not allow for the recognition of this revenue until all possible contingencies have been eliminated 
most of our leases with additional rents contingent upon revenue are structured as quarterly calculations so that all contingencies for revenue recognition have been eliminated at each of our quarterly reporting dates 
depreciation and useful lives of assets we calculate depreciation on our buildings and improvements using the straight line method based on estimated useful lives ranging up to years  generally from to years 
a significant portion of the cost of each property is allocated to building generally approximately 
the allocation of the cost between land and building  and the determination of the useful life of a property  are based on management s estimates 
we calculate depreciation and amortization on equipment and lease costs using the straight line method based on estimated useful lives of up to five years or the lease term  whichever is appropriate 
we review and adjust useful lives periodically 
if we do not allocate appropriately between land and building or we incorrectly estimate the useful lives of our assets  our computation of depreciation and amortization will not appropriately reflect the usage of the assets over future periods 
if we overestimate the useful life of an asset  the depreciation expense related to the asset will be understated  which could result in a loss if the asset is sold in the future 
asset impairment we review our long lived assets individually on a quarterly basis to determine if there are indicators of impairment in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 

indicators may include  among others  the tenant s inability to make rent payments  operating losses or negative operating trends at the facility level  notification by the tenant that it will not renew its lease  a decision to dispose of an asset or changes in the market value of the property 
for operating assets  if indicators of impairment exist  we compare the undiscounted cash flows from the expected use of the property to its net book value to determine if impairment exists 
if the sum of the future estimated undiscounted cash flows is higher than the current net book value  in accordance with sfas no 
 we conclude no impairment exists 
if the sum of the future estimated undiscounted cash flows is lower than the current net book value  we recognize an impairment loss for the difference between the net book value of the asset and its estimated fair market value 
to the extent we decide to sell an asset  we recognize an impairment loss if the current net book value of the asset exceeds its fair value less costs to sell 
the above analyses require us to determine whether there are indicators of impairment for individual assets  to estimate the most likely stream of cash flows from operating assets and to determine the fair value of assets that are impaired or held for sale 
if our assumptions  projections or estimates regarding an asset change in the future  we may have to record an impairment charge to reduce or further reduce the net book value of such asset 
during the year ended december   we recorded an impairment of assets charge of  in discontinued operations related to three of our assets held for sale 
during  we entered into agreements to sell two assets for less than net book value and became aware of facts and circumstances indicating one other asset had become impaired 
collectibility of receivables we evaluate the collectibility of our mortgage loans and other receivables on a regular basis 
we evaluate the collectibility of receivables based on factors including  among others  payment history  the financial strength of the borrower and any guarantors  the value of the underlying collateral  the operations and operating trends of the underlying collateral  if any  and current economic conditions 
if our evaluation of these factors indicates we may not recover the full value of the receivable  we provide a reserve against the portion of the receivable that we estimate will not be recovered 
this analysis requires us to determine whether there are factors indicating a receivable may not be fully collectible and to estimate the amount of the receivable that will not be collected 
if our assumptions or estimates regarding the collectibility of a receivable change in the future  we may have to record a reserve to reduce or further reduce the carrying value of the receivable 
impact of new accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb released interpretation no 
consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
in april  the fasb released sfas no 
amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities 
in may  the fasb released sfas no 
accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
the effect of these pronouncements on our financial statements is not expected to be material 
operating results year ended december  compared to year ended december  rental income increased  or  in as compared to the increase was primarily due to rental income from three facilities acquired during and facilities acquired during  rental income from five facilities we acquired during that previously had an aggregate mortgage loans receivable balance of  and rent increases at existing facilities 
the increase was partially offset by rent reductions on certain facilities that were returned to us and leased to other operators in and we believe that the worst of the restructurings resulting in rent reductions are now behind us 
interest and other income decreased by  or  in as compared to the decrease was primarily due to the payoff at par of mortgage loans receivable totaling  securing six facilities  acquiring title to five facilities previously having an aggregate mortgage loans receivable balance of  during and regular principal repayments of notes receivable during and the decrease was partially offset by interest earned on a new mortgage loan with a balance of  in and a new mortgage loan with a balance of  in interest and amortization of deferred financing costs increased  or  in as compared to the increase was primarily due to the issuance of  of fixed rate medium term notes in third quarter  the assumption of a  mortgage note on one facility acquired during second quarter and obtaining a  mortgage secured by one existing facility in third quarter the increase was partially offset by the payoff of  of fixed rate medium term notes during  the payoff of  of fixed rate medium term notes during  a reduction in the average balance on our  unsecured revolving credit facility during and a reduction in the average interest rates on our unsecured revolving credit facility 
depreciation and amortization increased  or  in as compared to the increase was due primarily to depreciation on the facilities acquired during  the acquisition of three facilities during and acquiring title to five facilities previously having an aggregate mortgage loans receivable balance of  during general and administrative expenses increased  or  in as compared to primarily due to expenses related to facilities returned to us and leased to other operators in  increases in legal fees related to operators in bankruptcy  the addition of a chief operating officer position and increase in other general corporate expenses 
we expect general and administrative expenses to increase by approximately in due to the addition of a chief operating officer and increases in other general corporate expenses 
the expected increase excludes any potential retirement compensation related to our chief executive officer 
income from unconsolidated joint venture represents our share of the income generated by the joint venture and our management fee of of the revenues of the unconsolidated joint venture 
the increase of  or  in as compared to is due to the joint venture owned facilities generating revenue for all of  versus facilities producing revenue from april to september and facilities producing revenue from october to december please see the caption 
investment in unconsolidated joint venture below for more information regarding the unconsolidated joint venture 
discontinued operations reflects a loss of  in versus a loss of  in discontinued operations consists of gain loss on sale of facilities and income loss from discontinued operations 
the loss on sale of facilities of  in is due to the sale of ten facilities  four buildings held for sale and four land parcels held for sale 
the gain on sale of facilities of  in is due to the sale of six facilities  five buildings held for sale and one land parcel held for sale 
the income from discontinued operations in reflects the revenues less the depreciation and amortization and other expenses related to the facilities sold and those classified as held for sale during offset by an impairment of assets charge of  related to one building and two land parcels held for sale  of which the building and one land parcel were disposed during the loss from discontinued operations in reflects the revenues less the depreciation and amortization and other expenses related to the facilities sold and those classified as held for sale during and offset by an impairment of assets charge of  related to assets held for sale 
the income from discontinued operations in of  excluding the impairment of assets charge  is significantly less than the income from discontinued operations in of  excluding the impairment of assets charge  primarily due to the facilities disposed of in being included in income from discontinued operations for only the portion of prior to their sale while they were included for all of and the facilities disposed of in were also included in income from discontinued operations for the portion of prior to their sale 
any future income loss in discontinued operations would result from future sales of facilities or reclassifications of facilities to assets held for sale 
we are currently aware of one facility that we anticipate will be sold in may as a result of the exercise of the purchase option by the tenant 
this sale is expected to result in a gain of approximately million 
we expect to receive increased rent and interest at individual facilities because our leases and mortgages generally contain provisions under which rents or interest income increase with increases in facility revenues and or increases in the consumer price index 
if revenues at our facilities and or the consumer price index do not increase  our revenues may not continue to increase 
sales of facilities or repayments of mortgage loans receivable would serve to offset revenue increases  and if sales and repayments exceed additional investments this could actually reduce revenues 
our leases could renew below or above the aggregate existing rent level  so the impact of lease renewals may cause a decrease or an increase in the total rent we receive 
we currently have only two leases expiring in  one of which we anticipate will be sold pursuant to the exercise of the purchase option by the tenant as discussed above 
the exercise of purchase options by tenants would also cause a decrease in the total rent we receive 
additional investments in healthcare facilities would increase rental and or interest income and at this time we expect to increase acquisitions during as additional investments in facilities are made  depreciation and or interest expense will also increase 
we expect any such increases to be at least partially offset by rent or interest income associated with the investments 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  rental income decreased  or  in as compared to the decrease was primarily due to reserving straight lined rent on certain facilities and rent reductions on certain facilities that were returned to us and leased to other operators in and the decrease was partially offset by rental income from the acquisition of facilities during  rental income from five facilities we acquired during that previously had an aggregate mortgage loans receivable balance of  and rent increases at existing facilities 
interest and other income decreased  or  in as compared to the decrease was primarily due to the payoff at par of mortgage loans receivable totaling approximately  securing ten facilities  the conversion of eight facilities totaling  from mortgage loans receivable to owned real estate properties mentioned above and principal repayment of notes receivable  all since january  interest and amortization of deferred financing costs increased  or less than  in as compared to the increase was primarily due to the issuance of  of fixed rate medium term notes since january   increases in the balance on our bank line of credit  mortgages totaling  secured by existing buildings since december and the assumption of a  mortgage note on one facility acquired during the second quarter of the increase was partially offset by the payoff of  of fixed rate medium term notes since january and a reduction in the average interest rates on our bank line of credit 
depreciation and amortization increased  or  in as compared to the increase was attributable to increased depreciation on the acquisition of facilities during and acquiring title to eight facilities previously having an aggregate mortgage loans receivable balance of  since january  general and administrative expenses increased  or  in as compared to primarily due to  of expense related to the severance of an executive officer partially offset by a reduction in legal expenses related to certain operators previously in bankruptcy 
income from unconsolidated joint venture of  during represents our share of the income generated by the joint venture and our management fee of of the revenues of the unconsolidated joint venture 
the joint venture made its first investment in april  hence there was no income from joint venture in please see the caption 
investment in unconsolidated joint venture below for more information regarding the unconsolidated joint venture 
during  we became aware of facts and circumstances indicating that certain assets may have become impaired 
after analyzing the assets and the facts  we recorded an impairment of assets charge in continuing operations totaling  as a result of lower than expected operating results for the first quarter at the former balanced care corporation facilities and six facilities operated by another operator  we changed our estimate of the recoverability of the deferred rent related to these facilities during we determined that the most appropriate method of recognizing revenues for these facilities  given the recent operating results  was to record revenues only to the extent cash is actually received 
accordingly  we fully reserved the deferred rent balance outstanding and all related notes receivable outstanding  totaling  as part of the impairment of assets charge in continuing operations 
in addition  the impairment of assets charge reported in continuing operations also included a reserve of  against a loan previously made to the operator of a large continuing care retirement community in florida 
the collectibility of that loan became uncertain due to developments at the facility during that we believed might necessitate a change in operators 
a new operator took over the facility in september during  we classified ten unoccupied buildings and eight land parcels as assets held for sale 
as required by sfas no 
 the net book values of those assets were transferred to assets held for sale and the operations of those assets were included in discontinued operations for the years ended december  and the impairment of assets charge in discontinued operations totaled  and represented the write down of of those assets to their individual estimated fair values less costs to sell 
discontinued operations reflects a loss of  in versus income of  in discontinued operations consists of gain loss on sale of facilities and income loss from discontinued operations 
the gain on sale of facilities of  in is due to the sale of six facilities  five buildings held for sale and one land parcel held for sale 
the gain on sale of facilities of  in is due to the sale of facilities 
the income from discontinued operations in reflects the revenues less the depreciation and amortization and other expenses related to the facilities sold and those classified as held for sale during offset by an impairment of assets charge of  related to assets held for sale 
the loss from discontinued operations in reflects the revenues less the depreciation and amortization and other expenses related to the facilities sold and those classified as held for sale during offset by an impairment of assets charge of  related to three skilled nursing facilities 
the income from discontinued operations in of  excluding the impairment of assets charge  is higher than the income from discontinued operations in of  excluding the impairment of assets charge  primarily due to the revenues from six facilities acquired in and disposed of in that are included in discontinued operations for most of  but are not included in discontinued operations for the increase is partially offset by the facilities disposed of in being included in income from discontinued operations for only the portion of prior to their sale while they were included for all of information regarding certain operators as of december   two of our tenant operators remain involved in chapter reorganization bankruptcy proceedings  as described below 
generally speaking  a tenant in bankruptcy can assign  affirm or reject a lease 
until a lease is rejected  the tenant is obligated to comply with the terms of the lease following the bankruptcy filing  including the timely payment of rent 
moreover  if the lease ultimately is assigned or affirmed  the tenant or its assignee is obligated to accept the lease without modification and to cure all pre filing breaches 
in our experience  whether or not the leased property is providing positive cash flow is usually a key factor in the tenant s decision to assign  affirm or reject a lease 
we believe that if the leases ultimately are rejected  we should be able to re lease or operate the facilities upon terms that would not have a long term material adverse effect on our company 
alpha filed october 
alpha leased five facilities that were formerly operated by beverly enterprises  inc two of these leases were rejected 
one was leased to a new operator resulting in an annual rent reduction of approximately  the other rejected facility was closed in january this facility was classified as held for sale and written down to its fair value less costs to sell in and was sold for approximately that value in june alpha had originally advised us that it intended to affirm the leases for the three remaining facilities  but has now indicated it plans to reject them 
we have signed leases with two new operators for all three facilities at rates consistent with those previously paid by alpha 
the new leases will become effective in second quarter infinia filed december 
infinia and its related entities operate three of our facilities 
certain related entities of infinia have filed for bankruptcy protection  one of which leases one of these facilities 
the bankrupt entity has filed a motion with the court to affirm our lease as is 
we expect the bankruptcy court to approve this motion 
if it does not  we believe we will be able to lease the facility to another operator on terms substantially consistent with the current lease 
lexington healthcare  inc filed for protection under the united states bankruptcy laws in april at the time  it operated two of our facilities under a master lease 
the lease was rejected during fourth quarter we have leased the buildings to a new operator under a master lease with an annual rent reduction of approximately  from the prior lease  however we may not receive any rent during the first three quarters of unless occupancy levels exceed a specified target 
as we have recognized revenue on a cash basis for these facilities subsequent to the date of the bankruptcy filing  we did not recognize any revenue from september to december in january  alterra  our largest operator  filed for protection under the united states bankruptcy laws 
alterra operates of our facilities and its subsidiaries  which did not file for bankruptcy protection  operate all of the facilities owned by our joint venture 
in december  alterra emerged from bankruptcy and completed its restructuring activities 
none of our leases or the leases of our joint venture was rejected in the bankruptcy proceeding and all of those leases are continuing without any rental reductions or other material lease concessions 
investment in unconsolidated joint venture during  we entered into a joint venture with jer senior housing  llc  a wholly owned subsidiary of jer partners  an institutional investor 
the joint venture may invest up to  of which over  has already been invested  in healthcare facilities similar to those already owned by us 
we are a equity partner in the venture 
the financial statements of the joint venture are not consolidated with our financial statements and our investment is accounted for using the equity method 
no investments were made by or into this joint venture prior to the joint venture owns assisted living facilities in states that are leased to alterra 
the joint venture was financed with secured non recourse debt of approximately  capital contributions from our joint venture partner of approximately  and capital contributions from us of approximately  we do not expect to make any additional contributions to the joint venture related to the facilities it acquired during the joint venture may sell three or four facilities during  however we do not believe the impact of the sale would be material to us 
the agreement contains reciprocal buy sell provisions that allow either of us at any time to offer to buy out the other s interest in the venture 
if such an offer is made  the recipient then has the choice to either accept the offer and sell its interest on those terms or reject the offer and buy the interest of the partner making the offer on the same economic terms 
liquidity and capital resources operating activities cash provided by operating activities for increased  over this was primarily due to increased revenues of  discussed above  partially offset by increases in interest expense and general and administrative expenses 
there have been no significant changes in the underlying sources and uses of cash provided by operating activities 
investing activities during  we acquired two skilled nursing facilities and one assisted and independent living facility in two separate transactions for an aggregate investment of  we also funded  in expansions  construction and capital improvements at certain facilities in accordance with existing lease provisions 
such expansions  construction and capital improvements generally result in an increase in the minimum rents earned by us on these facilities either at the time of funding or upon completion of the project 
the acquisitions  expansions  construction and capital improvements were funded by borrowings on our unsecured revolving credit facility and by cash on hand 
at december   we had committed to fund additional expansions  construction and capital improvements of approximately  during  we sold five assisted living facilities and five skilled nursing facilities in four transactions for cash proceeds of  the sale of these facilities resulted in an aggregate loss of  that is included in the loss on sale of facilities in discontinued operations 
the proceeds from the sales were used to repay borrowings on our unsecured revolving credit facility 
during  we sold four buildings and four land parcels classified as assets held for sale in eight separate transactions for net proceeds of  resulting in an aggregate loss of  these assets had previously been written down to their individual estimated fair values less costs to sell during and the proceeds from the sales were used to repay borrowings on our unsecured revolving credit facility 
financing activities during  we repaid  of fixed rate medium term notes that bore interest at a weighted average rate of 
the repayments were funded by borrowings on our unsecured revolving credit facility and by cash on hand 
we have  of medium term notes maturing in january and we have  of medium term notes maturing in third quarter in addition   of medium term notes with a rate of due in may be put back to us at their face amounts at the option of the holders on october  while we do not expect these notes will be put back to us  the holders may elect to do so 
we anticipate repaying the maturing medium term notes and any that are put back to us with a combination of proceeds from the issuance of additional medium term notes or equity securities under the shelf registration statements discussed below  borrowings on our unsecured revolving credit facility  cash on hand  new mortgage financing on certain facilities  potential asset sales and mortgage loans receivable payoffs or cash from operations 
our medium term notes have been investment grade rated since our current ratings are baa from moody s  bbb from standard poor s and bbb from fitch 
during  we entered into a new mortgage in the amount of  at 
the net proceeds were used to repay borrowings on our unsecured revolving credit facility 
during  we repaid industrial revenue bonds in the amount of  with a blended interest rate of secured by one facility 
the repayment was funded by borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility and by cash on hand 
in order to enhance our capital base and improve our liquidity  we sold  shares of common stock in may  at a negotiated price of per share to a select group of institutional investors  all but one of which were existing stockholders 
this private placement resulted in net proceeds to us of approximately  after placement agent  legal and other fees of approximately  the net proceeds were used to repay borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility 
in connection with this offering  we reduced our quarterly dividend payable to per share  representing a reduction of per share  or approximately from the rate we had previously paid dividends 
during  we adopted a dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan 
this plan enables existing stockholders to purchase additional shares of common stock by automatically reinvesting all or part of the cash dividends paid on their shares of common stock 
the plan also allows investors to acquire shares of our common stock  subject to certain limitations  including a maximum monthly investment of  at a discount ranging from to  determined by us from time to time in accordance with the plan 
the discount at december  is 
during the year ended december   we issued approximately  shares of common stock resulting in net proceeds of  that were used to repay borrowings on our unsecured revolving credit facility 
at december   we had  available under our  unsecured revolving credit facility that expires on november  at our option  borrowings under the bank line of credit bear interest at prime or at libor plus 
we pay a facility fee of per annum on the total commitment under the facility 
under covenants contained in the credit agreement  we are required to maintain  among other things i a minimum net asset value of  ii a ratio of total indebtedness to capitalization value of not more than  iii an interest coverage ratio of at least to  iv a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least to  v a secured indebtedness ratio of not more than  vi an unsecured interest coverage ratio of at least to  vii floating rate debt of no more than of total debt  viii an unencumbered asset value ratio of no more than  and ix a minimum rent mortgage interest coverage ratio of at least to as of december   we were in compliance with all of the above covenants 
we believe we have sufficient margin in the various debt covenants that we expect to remain in compliance throughout in january  we issued  shares of common stock in an underwritten public offering at a price of per share 
this issuance resulted in net proceeds of approximately  after underwriting discounts and legal and other fees of approximately  the net proceeds were used to repay all of the outstanding borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility of  and the remaining proceeds of approximately  are held in cash for general corporate purposes  including future acquisitions 
at december   we had shelf registration statements on file with the sec under which we may issue a up to  in aggregate principal amount of medium term notes and b up to  of securities including debt  convertible debt  common and preferred stock 
subsequent to the stock issuance discussed above  there is approximately  remaining for issuance on the  shelf registration statement 
in addition  during  we adopted a dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan  as discussed above  and authorized up to  shares to be issued under the plan 
at december   approximately  shares remain available for issuance 
we did not utilize any off balance sheet financing arrangements or have any unconsolidated subsidiaries prior to the second quarter of the only off balance sheet financing arrangement that we currently utilize is the unconsolidated joint venture discussed above under the caption investment in unconsolidated joint venture 
contractual obligations and cash requirements as of december   our contractual obligations are as follows thereafter total in thousands contractual obligations long term debt operating leases commitments capital expenditures the level of our new investments has been depressed during the prior four years  although we did make significant acquisitions during at this time we expect to increase investments during financing for future investments and for the repayment of the obligations and commitments noted above may be provided by borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility discussed above  private placements or public offerings of debt or equity either under the shelf registration statements discussed above or under new registration statements  the assumption of secured indebtedness  obtaining mortgage financing on a portion of our owned portfolio or through joint ventures 
we believe the combination of the available balance on the unsecured revolving credit facility and the availability under the shelf registration statements is sufficient to meet our expected cash requirements for we anticipate the potential repayment of certain mortgage loans receivable and the possible sale of certain facilities during in the event that there are mortgage loan receivable repayments or facility sales in excess of new investments  revenues may decrease 
we anticipate using the proceeds from any mortgage loans receivable repayments or facility sales to provide capital for future investments  to reduce the outstanding balance on our bank line of credit or to repay other borrowings as they mature 
any such reduction in debt levels would result in reduced interest expense that we believe would partially offset any decrease in revenues 
we believe we have sufficient liquidity and financing capability to finance anticipated future investments  maintain our current dividend level and repay borrowings at or prior to their maturity  for at least the next months

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates on our mortgage loans receivable and debt 
we do not utilize interest rate swaps  forward or option contracts on foreign currencies or commodities  or other types of derivative financial instruments 
the purpose of the following analyses is to provide a framework to understand our sensitivity to hypothetical changes in interest rates as of december  readers are cautioned that many of the statements contained in these paragraphs are forward looking and should be read in conjunction with our disclosures under the heading 
statement regarding forward looking disclosure set forth above 
we provide mortgage loans to operators of healthcare facilities as part of our normal operations 
the majority of the loans have fixed rates 
three of our mortgage loans have adjustable rates  however  the rates adjust only once or twice over the term of the loans and the minimum adjusted rates are equal to the then current rates 
therefore  all mortgage loans receivable are treated as fixed rate notes in the table and analysis below 
we utilize debt financing primarily for the purpose of making additional investments in healthcare facilities 
historically  we have made short term borrowings on our variable rate unsecured revolving credit facility to fund our acquisitions until market conditions were appropriate  based on management s judgment  to issue stock or fixed rate debt to provide long term financing 
a portion of our secured debt is variable rate debt in the form of housing revenue bonds that were assumed in connection with the acquisition of certain healthcare facilities 
pursuant to the associated lease arrangements  increases or decreases in the interest rates on the housing revenue bonds would be substantially offset by increases or decreases in the rent received by us on the properties securing this debt 
therefore  there is substantially no market risk associated with this variable rate secured debt 
for fixed rate debt  changes in interest rates generally affect the fair market value  but do not impact earnings or cash flows 
conversely  for variable rate debt  changes in interest rates generally do not impact fair market value  but do affect the future earnings and cash flows 
we generally cannot prepay fixed rate debt prior to maturity 
therefore  interest rate risk and changes in fair market value should not have a significant impact on the fixed rate debt until we would be required to refinance such debt 
holding the variable rate debt balance constant  and including the bank borrowings as variable rate debt due to its nature  each one percentage point increase in interest rates would result in an increase in interest expense for the coming year of approximately  the table below details the principal amounts and the average interest rates for the mortgage loans receivable and debt for each category based on the final maturity dates 
certain of the mortgage loans receivable and certain items in the various categories of debt require periodic principal payments prior to the final maturity date 
the fair value estimates for the mortgage loans receivable are based on the estimates of management and on rates currently prevailing for comparable loans 
the fair market value estimates for debt securities are based on discounting future cash flows utilizing current rates offered to us for debt of a similar type and remaining maturity 
maturity date thereafter total fair value dollars in thousands assets mortgage loans receivable  net average interest rate liabilities debt fixed rate average interest rate variable rate average interest rate unsecured revolving credit facility average interest rate the book value and fair value at december  of each category presented above was book value fair value dollars in thousands assets mortgage loans receivable  net average interest rate liabilities debt fixed rate average interest rate variable rate average interest rate unsecured revolving credit facility average interest rate decreases in interest rates during resulted in a decrease in interest expense related to our bank line of credit 
these interest rate decreases have made it less expensive for us to borrow on our bank line of credit 
any future interest rate increases will increase the cost of borrowings on our bank line of credit and any borrowings to refinance long term debt as it matures or to finance future acquisitions
