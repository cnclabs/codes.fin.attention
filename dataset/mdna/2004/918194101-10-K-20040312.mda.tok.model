more information about potential factors that could affect our business and financial results is included in the section entitled risk factors 
overview we are a leading animal health care services company and operate the largest networks of veterinary diagnostic laboratories and freestanding  full service animal hospitals in the united states 
our network of veterinary diagnostic laboratories provides sophisticated testing and consulting services used by veterinarians in the detection  diagnosis  evaluation  monitoring  treatment and prevention of diseases and other conditions affecting animals 
our animal hospitals offer a full range of general medical and surgical services for companion animals 
we treat diseases and injuries  offer pharmaceutical products and perform a variety of pet wellness programs  including health examinations  diagnostic testing  routine vaccinations  spaying  neutering and dental care 
at december   our laboratory network consisted of laboratories serving all states and our animal hospital network consisted of animal hospitals in states 
we primarily focus on generating internal growth to increase revenue and profitability 
in order to augment internal growth  we may selectively acquire laboratories and intend to acquire approximately to animal hospitals per year with aggregate annual revenues of approximately million  depending upon the attractiveness of candidates and the strategic fit with our existing operations 
in addition  if presented with a favorable opportunity  we may pursue acquisitions of additional animal hospitals or laboratories  including additional chains 
the following table summarizes our growth in facilities for the years ended december   and laboratories beginning of period acquisitions and new facilities relocated into other labs operated by us end of period animal hospitals beginning of period acquisitions relocated into hospitals operated by us sold or closed end of period we adopted fin no 
r in the fourth quarter of and accordingly  restated all prior periods to conform to the current year presentation 
under fin no 
r we consolidate the operating results of the veterinary medical groups for which we provide management services 
the result of the consolidation is an increase in both revenue and direct costs by an equal amount  thus there is no impact on operating income  net income  earnings per share or cash flows 
however  hospital and consolidated operating 
table of contents margins are lower than our historical reported margins because of the increase in revenue without a corresponding increase in operating income 
our common stock was publicly traded from until september  when we completed a recapitalization with certain investors affiliated with leonard green and partners 
the recapitalization was completed in a financial market which we believed did not adequately value companies of our size and type because the market s focus and attention was largely on technology and internet based companies 
our subsequent performance and the changing market dynamics supported the determination by our board of directors to re enter the public sector 
on november   we consummated our initial public offering 
as a result of this offering we issued  shares of common stock and received net proceeds of million 
concurrent with the consummation of the initial public offering  our wholly owned subsidiary issued million in principal amount of senior subordinated notes 
we applied the net proceeds from the offering and the sale of the senior subordinated notes  plus cash on hand  to redeem our outstanding series a and series b redeemable preferred stock and repay certain debt balances 
in february  we consummated an additional common stock public offering 
as a result of this offering we issued  shares of common stock and received net proceeds of million 
we applied the net proceeds from the secondary offering to primarily repay the entire remaining principal amount of our senior notes 
basis of reporting general our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america  or gaap 
we report our operations in three segments laboratory  animal hospital and corporate 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expense  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate our estimates on an on going basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates due to changes in future conditions 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue only after the following criteria are met there exists adequate evidence of the transaction  delivery of goods has occurred or services have been rendered  and the price is not contingent on future activity and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we report our revenue net of sales discounts 
laboratory revenue laboratory internal revenue growth was calculated using laboratory revenue as reported  adjusted to exclude revenue for the newly acquired laboratories that we did not own for the entire period presented and adjusted for the impact resulting from any differences in the number of billing days in comparable periods 
approximately of laboratory revenue is intercompany revenue that was generated by providing laboratory services to our animal hospitals 
for purposes of reviewing the operating performance of the business segments  all 
table of contents intercompany revenue is accounted for as if the transaction was with an independent third party at current market prices 
for financial reporting purposes  intercompany revenue is eliminated as part of our consolidation 
discounts  such as those given to clients for prompt payment  are given to clients in periods subsequent to the period the revenue was recognized 
these discounts are estimated and deducted from revenue in the period the related revenue was recognized 
these estimates are based upon historical experience 
errors in these estimates would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
animal hospital revenue certain states prohibit business corporations from providing  or holding themselves out as providers of  veterinary medical care 
in these states  we provide administrative and support services to veterinary medical groups pursuant to management agreements 
the veterinary medical groups are each solely responsible for all aspects of the practice of veterinary medicine 
in return for our services  the veterinary medical groups pay us management fees 
we consolidate the financial results of these veterinary medical groups 
same facility revenue growth includes revenue generated by customers referred from our relocated or combined animal hospitals  including those combined upon acquisition 
other revenue in and  we earned consulting fees under an agreement with heinz pet products related to the marketing of its proprietary pet food 
this agreement expired in september direct costs laboratory direct costs are comprised of all costs of laboratory services  including salaries of veterinarians  specialists  technicians and other non administrative  laboratory based personnel  facilities rent  occupancy costs and supply costs 
animal hospital direct costs are comprised of all costs of services and products at the animal hospitals  including salaries of veterinarians  technicians and all other animal hospital based personnel  facilities rent  occupancy costs  supply costs  certain marketing and promotional expense and costs of goods sold associated with the retail sales of pet food and pet supplies 
selling  general and administrative expense our selling  general and administrative expense is divided between our laboratory  animal hospital and corporate segments 
laboratory selling  general and administrative expense consists primarily of salary related sales  administrative  accounting personnel  selling  marketing and promotional expense 
animal hospital selling  general and administrative expense consists primarily of field management  recruiting  certain administrative and accounting personnel  recruiting and certain marketing expense 
corporate selling  general and administrative expense consists of administrative expense at our headquarters  including the salaries of corporate officers  rent  accounting  finance  legal and other professional expense and occupancy costs 
non cash compensation during the year ended december   certain stock options granted in were accounted for as variable stock options that required us to recognize non cash compensation of million as a component of laboratory direct costs and million as a component of selling  general and administrative expense 
in august  all of these options were exercised 
software development costs we frequently develop and implement new software to be used internally  or enhance our existing internal software 
we develop the software using our own employees and or outside consultants 
costs associated with the 
table of contents development of new software are expensed as incurred 
costs related directly to the software design  coding  testing and installation are capitalized and amortized over the expected life of the software  generally three years 
costs related to upgrades or enhancements of existing systems are capitalized if the modifications result in additional functionality 
software development costs capitalized during the years ended december   and amounted to   and million  respectively 
critical accounting policies and significant estimates we are required to make significant accounting estimates that directly impact our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures 
significant estimates are estimates that meet two criteria the estimates require that we make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimates are made  and there exist different estimates that could reasonably be used in the current period  or changes in the estimates used are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  both of which would have a material impact on the presentation of the financial condition or our results of our operations 
we base our assumptions and estimates on historical experience and on various other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
we have discussed with our audit committee the critical accounting policies for our company  the basis for their underlying assumptions and estimates and the nature of our related disclosures herein 
we believe the critical accounting policies for our company that are most affected by significant estimates and judgments are as follows workers compensation expense workers compensation expense is the cost to insure our company against losses related to injuries incurred by our employees in the normal course of their duties 
in  we restructured our workers compensation insurance policies to a self insurance retention program 
the effect of this restructuring was a shift of the significant portion of the financial risk associated with claims losses from the insurance company to our company  while the insurance company bears only the financial risk of large individual losses and large aggregate losses 
we estimate the amount that we will ultimately pay for losses associated with workers compensation claims  or claims losses for the policy period 
these estimated claims losses are recorded as expense during the policy period 
claims losses can vary substantially and  because they can take years to develop fully  can be difficult to estimate 
these estimates are based on complex judgments regarding the probable number of claims that will be filed and the nature of those claims 
both of those variables are highly uncertain and combine to form a factor referred to as the loss pick 
the loss pick factor is multiplied by our payroll cost to determine what the projected costs for claims and our related expense will be 
we estimate the loss pick by reviewing a minimum of five years of our historical claims loss data and analyzing the trend of the development of claims over time 
we also review and adjust the loss pick for other major factors such as the risk control environment and claims handling 
we review our loss pick on a quarterly basis considering the current loss trend and any changes in the environment as indicated above 
the loss pick is then applied to our actual payroll costs to estimate the claims loss portion of our workers compensation expense for the given period 
our insurance carrier requires us to pre fund claims losses at a loss pick of for the policy year ending september   and gave us a maximum loss pick of  above which the carrier is responsible for paying all claims 
for the policy year ended september   we were required to pre fund claims losses at a loss pick of and have a maximum loss pick of 
for the policy year ended september   we were required to pre fund claims losses at a loss pick of and have a maximum loss pick of 
the ranges set forth by the insurance carrier reflect the most probable potentials for our workers compensation claims losses 
the increase in the insurance carriers range reflects the trend over the last several years toward increasing workers compensation costs 
based on these ranges  and the factors described above  we estimated our losses using a loss pick of for the policy year ended september  and for the policy years ending september  and the increase in our loss pick reflects an increase in our claims loss trend during the previous years 

table of contents the following table reflects the ranges for the loss picks and the loss picks used by us in the estimate of our workers compensation costs in thousands estimated expense probable expense range payroll recorded low end high end policy year ending september  months of a month policy loss pick percentage calculated loss pick in dollars premiums and other fees total workers compensation expense policy year ended september  loss pick percentage calculated loss pick in dollars premiums and other fees total workers compensation expense policy year ended september  loss pick percentage calculated loss pick in dollars premiums and other fees total workers compensation expense we recognize workers compensation expense in direct costs and selling  general and administrative expense of our segments  based on their respective payroll cost and the loss pick percentage discussed and shown above  to calculate the claims loss portion of the expense 
the difference between the minimum amount of claims losses pre funded to the insurance carrier and the amount expensed is accrued and included in other liabilities 
if our estimates prove to be incorrect as the losses develop over several years  we will either have to pay additional claims losses or will receive a refund from our insurance carrier 
this could result in a need for us to recognize additional expense or have expense reduced in future periods within the range shown above 
the insurance policies in place prior to september  did not have large deductibles  and we have accrued for the maximum possible expense under these policies 
impairment of goodwill our goodwill represents the purchase price paid and liabilities assumed for animal hospital and laboratory acquisitions in excess of the fair market value of the net assets acquired 
the total amount of our net goodwill at december  was million  consisting of million for our laboratory segment and million for our animal hospital segment 
annually  and upon material changes in our operating environment  we test our goodwill for impairment by comparing the fair market value of our reporting units  which equate to our laboratory and animal hospital operating segments  to their respective net book value 
at december   the net book value of our laboratory segment was million and the net book value of our animal hospital segment was million 
an independent valuation expert estimated the fair market value based on standard valuation techniques discussed below 
as of december  the estimated fair market value of our operating segments exceeded their net book values resulting in our conclusions that our goodwill was not impaired 
the independent valuation expert used three techniques to estimate the fair market value of our operating segments at december  a market based valuation  a discounted cash flow valuation and a transaction 
table of contents valuation 
the results of these techniques and comparison to last valuations performed is as follows dollars in millions market based approach ebitda control valuation estimated multiple ebit multiple premium date value range range range used laboratory january  x x x x december    x x x x animal hospital december  x x x x december  x x x x discounted cash flow approach valuation estimated growth rate discount rate date value range range range laboratory january  december   animal hospital december  december  transaction approach ebitda valuation estimated multiple ebit multiple date value range range range laboratory december    x x x x animal hospital december  x x x x we did not perform a valuation of our laboratory segment as of december  based on our assessment that the fair market value of the operating segment exceeded the value of its net book assets 
this assessment was based on the large margin between the laboratory s estimated fair market value at january  and the net book value of its assets at that time and the fact that there were no significant subsequent changes in the laboratory s operations or operating environment 
market based approach 
the market based approach uses the enterprise value of selected publicly traded companies that are similar to each operating segment to estimate the operating segment s fair market value 
the similarities include but are not limited to business structure and nature of service provided 
the enterprise value of comparable companies equals the sum of their stock price times the total number of diluted shares and the fair market value of their outstanding debt 
the enterprise value is then used to create specific valuation multiples of ebitda that can be applied to each operating segment 
in our valuation process  five to ten comparable companies were used to create ranges for specific valuation multiples that were then used to estimate the enterprise value of each operating segment 
different companies could have been reasonably selected  however  we do not feel that a different selection would have a material impact on the results of the test 
in the future  the enterprise value of the companies selected may change dramatically based on changes in their stock price or the fair market value of their debt  both of which have historically shown significant and unexpected volatility 

table of contents the control premium represents the additional value that would have to be paid to take control of a business in the open market under the assumption that stock prices would increase due to an attempt to purchase all of the publicly traded common stock of a company 
in the fair market valuations  a control premium is applied to the enterprise value to arrive at the estimated fair market value 
the control premium is estimated based on actual control premiums used for comparable companies that are involved with or have recently completed an acquisition process 
while the control premium is based on actual control premiums paid in recent acquisitions of comparable companies  a different control premium could have been reasonably selected in our valuation process 
based on the comparable companies  the range of reasonable premiums was  from which was used in our valuation process 
we do not feel that different premiums would have had a material impact on our valuation process 
in the future  the control premium may decrease based on market conditions  and any decrease could have a material impact on the results of our valuation process 
the increase in the segments estimated value range from the prior valuation date is caused by the increase in the stock price of comparable companies  as well as the growth and improved performance of our operating segments 
discounted cash flow approach 
the discounted cash flow approach estimates the projected aggregate of future net cash flows generated by each operating segment 
the aggregate net cash flows are discounted for the time value of money and risk 
the time value of money reflects the fact that a dollar today is worth more than a dollar in the future 
the risk factor reflects the risk that our operating segments may not generate the future net cash flows that we are projecting for a variety of reasons as discussed in the risk factors section included herein 
the time value of money and the risk factor combine to form a discount rate that is used for discounting the future projected net cash flow of each operating segment 
both the projected net cash flows of our operating segments and the discount rate used involve the use of estimates and assumptions 
while different estimates and assumptions could have been reasonably made in the valuation process  we do not believe that they would have had a material impact on the results of the process 
in the future  these factors may change based on changes in our operating performance and or operating environment 
the increase in the segments estimated value range from the prior valuation date reflects the increase in cash flow of the segments during the period 
the increase in the laboratory segment estimated value range from the prior valuation date also reflects an increase in the growth rate range 
transaction approach 
the transaction approach uses completed or announced controlling interest acquisitions of companies that are similar to each operating segment to estimate the operating segment s fair market value 
the similarities include but are not limited to business structure and nature of service provided 
the purchase price of the comparable companies is used to create specific valuation multiples of ebitda that can be applied to each segment 
legal settlements we are a party to various legal proceedings 
although we cannot determine the ultimate disposition of these proceedings  we can use judgment to reasonably estimate our liability for legal settlement costs that may arise as a result of these proceedings 
based on our prior experience  the nature of the current proceedings and our insurance policy coverage for such matters we have accrued million as of december  for legal settlements as part of other accrued liabilities 
significant changes in the proceedings of current claims or the occurrence of new claims could result in the need for additional accruals 
allowance for uncollectible accounts the allowance for uncollectible accounts is estimated based primarily upon age of accounts receivable and loss history 
accounts receivable balances are routinely reviewed in conjunction with collection efforts  historical collection rates and other economic conditions which might ultimately affect the collectibility of accounts when considering the adequacy of the amounts recorded as allowance for uncollectible accounts 
significant changes in client mix or economic conditions could affect our collection of accounts receivable  cash flows and results of operations

table of contents revenue the following table summarizes our revenue for the years ended december   and in thousands change laboratory animal hospital other intercompany total revenue laboratory revenue laboratory revenue increased million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   which increased million compared to the year ended december  the components of the increase in laboratory revenue are detailed below in thousands  except average price per requisition comparative analysis comparative analysis change change laboratory revenue internal growth number of requisitions average revenue per requisition total internal revenue billing day adjustment acquired revenue total computed by dividing total internal revenue by the number of requisitions 
numbers may not calculate exactly due to rounding 
laboratory revenue and requisitions generated from internal growth  as set forth in the above table  have been adjusted to exclude revenue and requisitions for newly acquired laboratories those laboratories that we did not own for the entire periods presented and have been adjusted for any differences in the number of billing days in comparable periods 
the increases in requisitions from internal growth in and are the result of a continued trend in veterinary medicine to focus on the importance of laboratory diagnostic testing in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases due to the increasing awareness and availability of diagnostic testing 
in addition  our marketing programs include comprehensive education material that has contributed to the growth in our revenue in both volume and breadth of tests performed 
the increases in the average revenue per requisition in and are attributable to our sales and marketing efforts of our pet health and wellness programs  which have contributed to an increase in the number of tests performed per requisition  as well as a change in the mix of tests to include more comprehensive and expensive tests 
also contributing to our increase in average revenue per requisition are price increases 
the prices of most tests were increased to in february and to in february 
table of contents as the result of our laboratory acquisitions between november  and december   we generated an additional million of revenue referred to in the above table as acquired revenue during the year ended december  in comparison to the prior year 
in november we acquired a laboratory  which added  of acquired revenue during the year ended december  as compared to the prior year 
the billing adjustment reflects the impact of one additional billing day for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year 
animal hospital revenue animal hospital revenue increased million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   which increased million compared to the year ended december  the components of the increases are summarized in the following table in thousands  except average price per order comparative analysis comparative analysis change change animal hospital revenue same facility orders average revenue per order same facility revenue net acquired revenue total computed by dividing same facility revenue by same facility orders 
numbers may not calculate exactly due to rounding 
in and we experienced an increase in the average revenue per order with a decrease in total orders for an overall increase in same facility revenue 
the increase in average revenue per order is partially the result of a business strategy to place greater emphasis on high quality veterinary care and wellness programs 
in addition  prices were increased to on services at most hospitals in february of both years 
prices are reviewed on an annual basis for each hospital and adjustments are made based on market considerations  demographics and our costs 
the decrease in the number of orders is primarily the result of two factors a market shift in the point of sale of certain pet related retail products and a decrease in the frequency of vaccinations 
over the last few years  certain pet related products traditionally sold at animal hospitals have become more widely available in retail stores and other distribution channels  and  as a result  we have fewer customers coming to the animal hospitals solely to purchase such items 
the decline in the number of vaccinations has occurred as some recent professional literature and research has suggested that vaccinations can be given to pets less frequently 
net acquired revenue represents the revenue from those hospitals acquired  sold or closed after the beginning of the comparative period  which was january  for the comparative analysis and january  for the comparative analysis 
fluctuations in net acquired revenue occur due to the volume  size  and timing of acquisitions and disposals during the periods compared 
other revenue other revenue consists of fees earned from a marketing consulting agreement with heinz pet products  which paid a monthly fee of  commencing october  through september  we recognized revenue of million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively

our operating leverage comes from the incremental margins we realize on additional tests ordered by the same client  as well as when more comprehensive tests are ordered 
we are able to benefit from these incremental margins due to the relative fixed cost nature of our laboratory business 
animal hospital direct costs the decreases in animal hospital direct costs as a percentage of applicable revenue was attributable to the increase in animal hospital revenue together with the operating leverage associated with the animal hospital business  as many of the costs associated with this business do not increase proportionately with increases in the volume of services rendered

depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization for the year ended december  includes the amortization of goodwill and executive non competition agreements 
commencing january   we no longer amortize goodwill as a result of adopting sfas no 
following our initial public offering in november  we terminated the executive non competition agreements 
we have excluded these charges when analyzing depreciation and amortization  as they were not incurred in all periods presented 
the following table reconciles our depreciation and amortization as reported to depreciation and amortization adjusted to exclude the amortization of goodwill and executive non competition agreements for the years ended december   and in thousands change depreciation and amortization as reported less amortization of goodwill amortization of executive non competition agreements as adjusted the increases in adjusted depreciation and amortization were primarily due to the purchase of property and equipment and the addition of non competition agreements executed in connection with the acquisition of animal hospitals and laboratories

debt retirement costs on august   we refinanced our senior credit facility retiring million principal balance outstanding under our senior term c notes with million of cash on hand and million received from the issuance of new senior term d notes  with an interest rate margin of compared to for the senior term c notes 
in conjunction with that transaction  we recorded debt retirement costs of million 
on february   we voluntarily retired the entire principal amount of our senior notes with net proceeds from the sale of our common stock during an additional common stock offering 
in conjunction with that transaction  we recorded debt retirement costs of million

we cannot assure that our operations will not be affected by inflation in the future 
related party transactions transactions with zoasis corporation we incurred marketing expense for vaccine reminder and other direct mail services provided by zoasis  an internet start up business that is majority owned by robert antin  the company s chief executive officer and chairman 
the expense incurred was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the pricing of these services is comparable to prices paid by us to independent third parties 
in  we purchased  shares of the series a preferred stock of zoasis for million and entered into an agreement pursuant to which zoasis developed and licensed to us software that our laboratory operations use to deliver laboratory results to clients over the internet and our animal hospitals use to communicate with vendors in the procurement of operating supplies over the internet 
in december  we entered into an agreement with zoasis pursuant to which we acquired all of zoasis right  title and interest in and to this software in exchange for the  shares of series a preferred stock of zoasis then held by us 
the value of such stock was written off in and  consequently  had no value on our books at the time of the transfer 
concurrently with the purchase of the software  we granted to zoasis a limited  royalty free  non exclusive license to the software for internal use by zoasis 
we agreed not to grant any other licenses in the software for a period of five years except that we may grant licenses to our affiliates and subsidiaries 
both we and zoasis have a right to make modifications to the software  but all modifications and derivative works are owned by us 
the software will be hosted at a third party hosting facility for the benefit of both parties through july  and for up to two successive additional one year periods at the option of either party 
zoasis is obligated to fund up to  in hosting fees each month through july  and  per month thereafter 
as the owner of the software  we are responsible for the remainder of any such fees 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents at december  totaled million up from million at december  the increase is a result of net cash provided by operations exceeding net cash used in investing and financing activities 
cash flows from operating activities net cash provided by operating activities increased million and million for the years ended december  and driving the increase in both years was a an increase in operating income resulting from an increase in revenue from internal growth in laboratory revenue and growth in same facility animal hospital revenue together with an increase in operating margins resulting from leverage on internally generated revenue growth  and b an increase in revenue resulting from acquisitions 
in addition  part of the increase in was a 
table of contents million decrease in interest paid in  a result of decreasing interest rates combined with the reductions in debt balances 
part of the increase in was also attributable to the fact we did not make payments to leonard green partners  lp  which amounted to million in for management services received and the termination of the management services agreement 
the increases in were partially offset by a a million increase in cash paid for taxes  a result of the increase in income before taxes and net operating loss carryforwards utilized during the year ended december  and b a cash use of million from normal changes in working capital 
the increases in were partially offset by a a million increase in interest paid resulting from changes in interest rates during the period and b a million increase in taxes paid  a result of the increase in income before taxes and refunds received during the year ended december  however  taxes paid during the year ended december  were reduced as a result of utilizing net operating loss carryforwards 
in and  our cash position benefited from net operating loss carryforwards and refunds 
we do not anticipate any significant benefits in our cash position from net operating loss utilization in future years 
on a prospective basis  in we anticipate cash flow from operating activities to continue growing in line with increases in operating income resulting from increases in internal revenue together with related increases in operating margins and growth from acquisitions 
however  we also anticipate that operating cash flow may be negatively impacted by in an increase in cash paid for interest  a result of increasing interest rates 
interest rates are at historical lows and are projected to increase over the next few years 
any increases in interest rates can materially impact our operating cash flows because of the variable rate nature of our senior debt 
cash flows used in investing activities in each of the three years ended december   net cash used in investing activities was primarily comprised of cash used for the acquisition of animal hospitals and laboratories and expenditures for property  plant and equipment 
for the current year  we anticipate spending approximately to million for acquisitions and million for property  plant and equipment 
however  we may purchase either a fewer or greater number of animal hospital facilities  including additional chains  than we are planning depending upon opportunities that present themselves and our cash requirements may change accordingly 
in addition  there may be acquisition opportunities in the laboratory field that may impose additional cash requirements 
we intend to primarily use cash in our acquisitions but  depending upon the timing and amount of our acquisitions  we may use stock or debt to the extent we deem it appropriate 
our covenants under our senior credit facility allow us to spend million per year on acquisitions  and we would require a waiver or amendment to the covenant to exceed this amount 
cash flows used in financing activities in each of the three years ended december   we had financing transactions  as discussed below 
the purpose of the transactions was to take advantage of favorable market conditions to secure less expensive sources of financing and to improve our capital structure the activity in each of the three years ending december  is as follows february  we completed an offering of common stock at an issue price of per share  in which we sold million shares of our common stock in exchange for net proceeds of million 
approximately million of the net proceeds received were used to redeem the entire principal amount of our senior notes due at a redemption price of of the principal amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest 

table of contents august  we refinanced our senior credit facility retiring million principal balance outstanding under the senior term c notes with million of cash on hand and million received from the issuance of new senior term d notes 
the interest rate on the senior term d notes is basis points lower than the interest rate on the senior term c notes 
october  we redeemed million  the entire principal balance  of our senior subordinated notes due at a redemption price of and million in principal amount of our senior notes due at a redemption price of by issuing million in principal amount of additional senior term c notes and using cash on hand 
august  we refinanced our senior credit facility retiring million  the entire principal balance  on our senior term a and senior term b notes by issuing new senior term c notes 
the interest rate on the senior term c notes was basis points lower than the weighted average interest rate for the senior term a and senior term b notes 
november  we completed an initial public offering at an issue price of per share receiving net proceeds of approximately million 
concurrent with the initial public offering  we issued million of senior subordinated notes due for net proceeds of million 
the proceeds from these offerings were used to redeem all of the outstanding series a and b redeemable preferred stock for million  redeem million in principal amount of our senior term a and b notes under our senior credit facility  redeem million in principal amount of our senior notes at a redemption price of  plus accrued and unpaid interest  and redeem million in principal amount of our senior notes at a redemption price of  plus accrued and unpaid interest 
currently  we have no plans to execute additional financing transactions in the near future  however  future changes in interest rates or the value of our common stock could create an opportunity to create increased shareholder value through additional financing activity 
before december   we can redeem up to million of principal on our senior subordinated notes at of face with proceeds from an equity offering 
the remaining portion may be paid off at our discretion beginning december  at of face 
borrowings and repayments under our revolving credit facility are the result of normal working capital shifts created by the seasonality of our business and the timing of acquisition activity 
at the end of we borrowed million  and in early we repaid the full amount 
at december   we had no borrowings under our revolving credit facility 

table of contents future contractual cash requirements the following table sets forth the scheduled principal  interest and other contractual cash obligations due by us for each of the years indicated in thousands total thereafter long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases fixed cash interest expense variable cash interest expense deferred income tax liabilities mandatorily redeemable partnership interests swap agreements we have both fixed rate and variable rate debt 
the interest payments on our variable rate debt are based on a variable rate component plus a fixed 
including the fixed  we estimate that the interest rate on our variable rate debt will be     and for years through  respectively 
these estimates are based on interest rate projections used to price our interest rate swap agreements 
see footnote  long term obligations  in our consolidated financial statements provided under part ii  item of this annual report on form k for a more detailed discussion of these variable rate notes 
our net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was million 
we do not anticipate any significant declines in future net cash provided by operating activities 
if our operating cash flow remains constant with  for the years  and we will have adequate cash flow each year to satisfy our contractual cash requirements and fund our planned annual expenditures of to million for acquisitions and million for property  plant and equipment 
in the event we have a shortfall in operating cash flow  we can cover contractual cash obligations by limiting our expenditures for acquisitions and drawing on our million revolving credit facility  which expires in september to the extent that our cash on hand is insufficient to meet the increased principal payments beginning in  we plan to enter into additional financing activities to satisfy our debt obligations 
debt related covenants the senior credit facility contains certain financial covenants pertaining to interest coverage  fixed charge coverage and leverage ratios 
in addition  the senior credit facility has restrictions pertaining to capital expenditures  acquisitions and the payment of dividends 
we currently believe the most restrictive covenant is the fixed charge coverage ratio 
the senior credit facility defines the fixed charge coverage ratio as that ratio which is calculated on a last twelve month basis by dividing pro forma earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  as defined by the agreement  by fixed charges 
fixed charges are defined as cash interest expense  scheduled principal payments on debt obligations  capital expenditures  and provision for income taxes 
at december   we had a fixed charge coverage ratio of to  which was in compliance with the required ratio of no less than to 

table of contents interest rate hedging agreements we entered into certain no fee swap agreements whereby we pay to the counter party amounts based on fixed interest rates and set notional principal amounts in exchange for the receipt of payments from the counter party based on london interbank offer rates  libor  and the same set notional principal amounts 
a summary of these agreements is as follows swap swap swap fixed interest rate notional amount million million million effective date expiration date counter party wells fargo bank wells fargo bank goldman sachs we entered into the swap agreements to hedge against the risk of increasing interest rates 
the contracts effectively convert a certain amount of our variable rate debt under our senior credit facility to fixed rate debt for purposes of controlling cash paid for interest 
that amount is equal to the notional amount of the swap agreements and the fixed rate conversion period is equal to the terms of the contract 
the impact of the swap agreements has been factored into our future contractual cash requirements table above 
in the future  we may enter into additional interest rate strategies to take advantage of favorable current rate environments 
we have not yet determined what those strategies will be or their possible impact 
description of indebtedness senior credit facility at december   we had million principal amount outstanding under our senior term d notes and no borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility 
borrowings under the senior credit facility bear interest  at our option  on either the base rate  which is the higher of the administrative agent s prime rate or the federal funds rate plus plus a base rate margin  or the adjusted eurodollar rate  which is the rate per annum obtained by dividing the rate of interest offered to the administrative agent on the london interbank market by a percentage equal to minus the stated maximum rate of all reserve requirements applicable to any member bank of the federal reserve system in respect of eurocurrency liabilities plus a eurodollar rate margin 
the base rate margins for the revolving credit facility range from to per annum and the margin for the senior term d notes is per annum 
the eurodollar rate margins for the revolving credit facility range from to per annum and the margin for the senior term d notes is per annum 
the senior term d notes mature in september and the revolving credit facility matures in september senior subordinated notes on november   vicar operating  inc  our wholly owned subsidiary  issued million in principal amount of senior subordinated notes due december   which were exchanged on june  for substantially similar securities that are registered under the securities act 
interest on these senior subordinated notes is per annum  payable semi annually in arrears in cash 
at december   the outstanding principal balance of these senior subordinated notes was million 
we and each existing and future domestic wholly owned subsidiary of vicar have jointly and severally  fully and unconditionally guaranteed these notes 
these guarantees are unsecured and subordinated in right of payment to all existing and future indebtedness outstanding under the credit and guaranty agreement and any other indebtedness permitted to be incurred by vicar under the terms of the indenture agreement governing these notes 

table of contents other debt at december   we had seller notes secured by assets of animal hospitals  unsecured debt and capital leases that totaled million 
new accounting pronouncements consolidations of variable interest entities in december  the fasb issued fin no 
r  consolidation of variable interest entities  requiring that companies consolidate variable interest entities if they are the primary beneficiaries of the activities of those entities 
companies are generally required to apply fin no 
r immediately for all variable interest entities created after january  and by the end of the first quarter for all other entities for which it is the primary beneficiary 
we provide management services to certain veterinary medical groups in states with laws that prohibit business corporations from providing  or holding themselves out as providers of  veterinary medical care 
as of december   we operated in of these states providing management services to veterinary medical groups pursuant to long term management agreements ranging from to years with renewal options  where allowable 
pursuant to the management agreements  the veterinary medical groups are each solely responsible for all aspects of the practice of veterinary medicine  as defined by their respective state 
we provide administrative and other support services 
in the fourth quarter of  we determined that the veterinary medical groups are variable interest entities as defined by fin no 
r  and that we have a variable interest in those entities through our management agreements 
we also determined that our variable interests  in aggregation with the variable interests held by our related parties  absorbed the majority of the expected losses and residual returns of the veterinary medical groups 
based on these determinations  we consolidated the veterinary medical groups in our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended december  and have restated our prior periods presented to conform to the current year presentation 
the result of the consolidation is an increase in both revenue and direct costs by an equal amount  thus there is no impact on operating income  net income  earnings per share or cash flows 
however  hospital and consolidated operating margins are lower than our historical reported margins because of the increase in revenue without a corresponding increase in operating income 
a comparative analysis of the our financial results before and after consolidation of the veterinary medical groups for the year ended december  is as follows in thousands before consolidation as reported difference revenue direct costs excluding operating depreciation operating income accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity in may  the fasb issued sfas no

historically  we recognized these liabilities as a component of minority interest  however  in the fourth quarter of 
table of contents  we determined that sfas no 
required us to present these liabilities apart from minority interest 
we calculated the value of these obligations to be million  which we have reported as mandatorily redeemable partnership interests on our consolidated balance sheet 
gains and losses from extinguishment of debt and capital leases in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections  to be applied in fiscal years beginning after may  under sfas no 
 gains and losses from extinguishment of debt should be classified as extraordinary items only if they meet the criteria of accounting principles board opinion  or apb  no 
under apb no 
 events are considered extraordinary only if they possess a high degree of abnormality and are not likely to recur in the foreseeable future 
we have concluded that the debt retirement costs we have incurred do not qualify for extraordinary treatment under apb no 
because we have historically changed our capital structure to take advantage of favorable market conditions  and it is probable that we will continue to do so in the future 
as a result  these costs for all periods presented have been included as a component of income from recurring operations in the consolidated statements of operations 
consideration received from a vendor in november  fasb s emerging issues task force  or eitf  reached a consensus regarding two issues raised by eitf issue no 
 accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor 
the eitf concluded that cash received from a vendor is presumed to be a reduction of the cost of the vendor s products or services  however that presumption is overcome when the consideration is either a a payment for assets or services  or b a reimbursement of specific and identifiable costs incurred on behalf of the vendor in selling the vendor s products or services  in which case the consideration is a reduction of that cost  and rebates offered to a customer or reseller should be recognized as a reduction of the cost of sales based on a systematic and rational allocation provided that the amounts recognized are probable and reasonably estimable

although not readily detectable because of the impact of acquisitions  our operations are subject to seasonal fluctuation 
in particular  our revenue historically has been greater in the second and third quarters than in the first and fourth quarters 
the demand for our veterinary services is significantly higher during warmer months because pets spend a greater amount of time outdoors  where they are more likely to be injured and are more susceptible to disease and parasites 
in addition  use of veterinary services may be affected by levels of infestation of fleas  heartworms and 
table of contents ticks and the number of daylight hours 
a substantial portion of our costs are fixed and do not vary with the level of demand 
consequently  our operating income and operating margins  generally have been higher for the second and third quarters than that experienced in the first and fourth quarters 
risk factors this annual report on form k  including risk factors set forth below  contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties  as well as assumptions that  if they materialize or prove incorrect  could cause our results and the results of our consolidated subsidiaries to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward looking statements 
all statements other than statements of historical fact are statements that could be deemed forward looking statements  including any projections of earnings  revenue or other financial items  any statements of the plans  strategies and objectives of management for future operations  any statement concerning proposed new services or developments  any statements regarding the future economic conditions or performance  any statements of belief  and any statements of assumptions underlying any of the foregoing 
the risks  uncertainties and assumptions referred to above include difficulty of managing our growth and integrating our new acquisitions and other risks that are described from time to time in our sec reports  including but not limited to the items discussed below 
if we are unable to effectively execute our growth strategy  we may not achieve our desired economics of scale and our margins and profitability may decline 
our success depends in part on our ability to build on our position as a leading animal health care services company through a balanced program of internal growth initiatives and selective acquisitions of established animal hospitals and laboratories 
if we cannot implement or effectively execute these initiatives and acquisitions  our results of operations will be adversely affected 
even if we effectively implement our growth strategy  we may not achieve the economies of scale that we have experienced in the past or that we anticipate having in the future 
our internal growth rate may decline and could become negative 
our laboratory internal revenue growth has fluctuated between and for each fiscal year from through similarly  our animal hospital adjusted same facility revenue growth rate has fluctuated between and over the same fiscal years 
our internal growth may continue to fluctuate and may be below our historical rates 
any reductions in the rate of our internal growth may cause our revenues and margins to decrease 
our historical growth rates and margins are not necessarily indicative of future results 
demand for certain products could decline as their product life cycle matures and the products become available in other channels of distribution such as retail oriented locations and through internet service providers 
this cycle could affect the frequency of veterinary visits and may result in a reduction in revenue 
demand for vaccinations may also be impacted in the future as protocols for vaccinations change 
vaccinations have been recommended by some in the profession to be given less frequently 
this may result in fewer visits and potentially less revenue 
vaccine protocols for our company are currently established by our veterinarians 
some of our veterinarians have changed their protocols and others may change their protocol in light of recent literature 
due to the fixed cost nature of our business  fluctuations in our revenue could adversely affect our operating income 
approximately of our expense for the year ended december   particularly rent and personnel costs  are fixed costs and are based in part on expectations of revenue 
we may be unable to reduce spending in a timely manner to compensate for any significant fluctuations in our revenue 
accordingly  shortfalls in revenue may adversely affect our operating income 
difficulties integrating new acquisitions may impose substantial costs and cause other problems for us 
our success depends on our ability to timely and cost effectively acquire  and integrate into our business  additional animal hospitals and laboratories 
any difficulties in the integration process may result in increased expense  loss of customers and a decline in profitability 
we expect to acquire to animal hospitals per year with aggregate annual revenues of approximately million  however  based on the opportunity  the number could be higher 
historically we have experienced delays and increased costs in integrating some hospitals 
table of contents primarily where we acquire a large number of hospitals in a single region at or about the same time 
in these cases  our field management may spend a predominant amount of time integrating these new hospitals and less time managing our existing hospitals in those regions 
during these periods  there may be less attention directed to marketing efforts or staffing issues 
in these circumstances  we also have experienced delays in converting the systems of acquired hospitals into our systems  which results in increased payroll expense to collect our results and delays in reporting our results  both for a particular region and on a consolidated basis 
these factors have resulted in decreased revenue  increased costs and lower margins 
we continue to face risks in connection with our acquisitions including negative effects on our operating results  impairments of goodwill and other intangible assets  dependence on retention  hiring and training of key personnel  including specialists  and contingent and latent risks associated with the past operations of  and other unanticipated problems arising in  an acquired business 
the process of integration may require a disproportionate amount of the time and attention of our management  which may distract management s attention from its day to day responsibilities 
in addition  any interruption or deterioration in service resulting from an acquisition may result in a customer s decision to stop using us 
for these reasons  we may not realize the anticipated benefits of an acquisition  either at all or in a timely manner 
if that happens and we incur significant costs  it could have a material adverse impact on our business 
the carrying value of our goodwill could be subject to impairment write down 
at december   our balance sheet reflected million of goodwill  which is a substantial portion of our total assets of million at that date 
we expect that the aggregate amount of goodwill on our balance sheet will increase as a result of future acquisitions 
we continually evaluate whether events or circumstances have occurred that suggest that the fair market value of each of our reporting units is below their carrying values 
if we determine that the fair market value of one of our reporting units is less than its carrying value  this may result in an impairment write down of the goodwill for that reporting unit 
the impairment write down would be reflected as expense and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations during the period in which we recognize the expense 
at december   we concluded that the fair value of our reporting units exceeded their carrying value and accordingly  as of that date  our net goodwill was not impaired in our consolidated financial statements 
however  in the future we may incur impairment charges related to the goodwill already recorded or arising out of future acquisitions 
we have recorded the write down of goodwill as the result of several events occurring during the three years ended december  these events are described below sold an animal hospital during each of the years ended december  and  which resulted in the write down of goodwill in the amount of  and  respectively  and relocated certain animal hospitals operated by us and determined that the value of the goodwill for one of our animal hospitals was impaired during the year ended december   which resulted in the write down of goodwill in the amount of million 
we require a significant amount of cash to service our debt and expand our business as planned 
we have  and will continue to have  a substantial amount of debt 
our substantial amount of debt requires us to dedicate a significant portion of our cash flow from operations to pay down our indebtedness and related interest  thereby reducing the funds available to use for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and general corporate purposes 

table of contents at december   our debt  excluding unamortized discounts  consisted of million in principal amount outstanding under our senior credit facility  million in principal amount outstanding under our senior subordinated notes  and million in principal amount outstanding under our other debt 
the following table sets forth the scheduled principal and interest payments that are due on our debt for each of the periods indicated in thousands total thereafter long term debt fixed cash interest expense variable cash interest expense capital lease obligations swap agreements we have both fixed rate and variable rate debt 
the interest payments on our variable rate debt are based on a variable rate component plus a fixed 
including the fixed  we estimate that the total interest rate on our variable rate debt will be     and for years through  respectively 
these estimates are based on interest rate projections used to price our interest rate swap agreements 
see footnote  long term obligations  of our consolidated financial statements provided under part ii  item of this annual report on form k for a more detailed discussion of these variable rate notes 
our ability to make payments on our debt  and to fund acquisitions  will depend upon our ability to generate cash in the future 
insufficient cash flow could place us at risk of default under our debt agreements or could prevent us from expanding our business as planned 
our ability to generate cash is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 
our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations  our strategy to increase operating efficiencies may not be realized and future borrowings may not be available to us under our senior credit facility in an amount sufficient to enable us to service our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs 
in order to meet our debt obligations  we may need to refinance all or a portion of our debt 
we may not be able to refinance any of our debt on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
our debt instruments may adversely affect our ability to run our business 
our substantial amount of debt  as well as the guarantees of our subsidiaries and the security interests in our assets and those of our subsidiaries  could impair our ability to operate our business effectively and may limit our ability to take advantage of business opportunities 
for example  our indenture and senior credit facility limit our funds available to repay the senior subordinated notes  limit our ability to borrow additional funds or to obtain other financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  investments and general corporate purposes  limit our ability to dispose of our assets  create liens on our assets or to extend credit  make us more vulnerable to economic downturns and reduce our flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business or industry  
table of contents place us at a competitive disadvantage to our competitors with less debt  and restrict our ability to pay dividends  repurchase or redeem our capital stock or debt  or merge or consolidate with another entity 
the terms of our indenture and senior credit facility allow us  under specified conditions  to incur further indebtedness  which would heighten the foregoing risks 
if compliance with our debt obligations materially hinders our ability to operate our business and adapt to changing industry conditions  we may lose market share  our revenue may decline and our operating results may suffer 
our failure to satisfy covenants in our debt instruments will cause a default under those instruments 
in addition to imposing restrictions on our business and operations  our debt instruments include a number of covenants relating to financial ratios and tests 
our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control  including prevailing economic  financial and industry conditions 
the breach of any of these covenants would result in a default under these instruments 
an event of default would permit our lenders and other debtholders to declare all amounts borrowed from them to be due and payable  together with accrued and unpaid interest 
moreover  these lenders and other debtholders would have the option to terminate any obligation to make further extensions of credit under these instruments 
if we are unable to repay debt to our senior lenders  these lenders and other debtholders could proceed against our assets 
the significant competition in the companion animal health care services industry could cause us to reduce prices or lose market share 
the companion animal health care services industry is highly competitive with few barriers to entry 
to compete successfully  we may be required to reduce prices  increase our operating costs or take other measures that could have an adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations  margins and cash flow 
if we are unable to compete successfully  we may lose market share 
there are many clinical laboratory companies that provide a broad range of laboratory testing services in the same markets we service 
our largest competitor for outsourced laboratory testing services is idexx laboratories  inc  which currently competes or intends to compete in most of the same markets in which we operate 
also  idexx and several other national companies provide on site diagnostic equipment that allows veterinarians to perform their own laboratory tests 
our primary competitors for our animal hospitals in most markets are individual practitioners or small  regional  multi clinic practices 
also  regional pet care companies and some national companies  including operators of super stores  are developing multi regional networks of animal hospitals in markets in which we operate 
historically  when a competing animal hospital opens in close proximity to one of our hospitals  we have reduced prices  expanded our facility  retained additional qualified personnel  increased our marketing efforts or taken other actions designed to retain and expand our client base 
as a result  our revenue may decline and our costs increase 
we may experience difficulties hiring skilled veterinarians due to shortages that could disrupt our business 
as the pet population continues to grow  the need for skilled veterinarians continues to increase 
if we are unable to retain an adequate number of skilled veterinarians  we may lose customers  our revenue may decline and we may need to sell or close animal hospitals 
as of december   there were veterinary schools in the country accredited by the american veterinary medical association 
these schools graduate approximately  veterinarians per year 
there is a shortage of skilled veterinarians in some regional markets in which we operate animal hospitals 
during shortages in these regions  we may be unable to hire enough qualified veterinarians to adequately staff our animal hospitals  in which event we may lose market share and our revenues and profitability may decline 

table of contents if we fail to comply with governmental regulations applicable to our business  various governmental agencies may impose fines  institute litigation or preclude us from operating in certain states 
the laws of many states prohibit business corporations from providing  or holding themselves out as providers of  veterinary medical care 
these laws vary from state to state and are enforced by the courts and by regulatory authorities with broad discretion 
as of december  we operated animal hospitals in states with these laws  including in new york 
we may experience difficulty in expanding our operations into other states with similar laws 
given varying and uncertain interpretations of the veterinary laws of each state  we may not be in compliance with restrictions on the corporate practice of veterinary medicine in all states 
a determination that we are in violation of applicable restrictions on the practice of veterinary medicine in any state in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on us  particularly if we were unable to restructure our operations to comply with the requirements of that state 
all of the states in which we operate impose various registration requirements 
to fulfill these requirements  we have registered each of our facilities with appropriate governmental agencies and  where required  have appointed a licensed veterinarian to act on behalf of each facility 
all veterinarians practicing in our clinics are required to maintain valid state licenses to practice 
any failure in our information technology systems or disruption in our transportation network including disruption resulting from terrorist activities could significantly increase testing turn around time  reduce our production capacity and otherwise disrupt our operations 
our laboratory operations depend  in part  on the continued and uninterrupted performance of our information technology systems and transportation network 
our growth has necessitated continued expansion and upgrade of our information technology systems and transportation network 
sustained system failures or interruption in our transportation network or in one or more of our laboratory operations could disrupt our ability to process laboratory requisitions  perform testing  provide test results in a timely manner and or bill the appropriate party 
we could lose customers and revenue as a result of a system or transportation network failure 
our computer systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from a variety of sources  including telecommunications failures  electricity brownouts or blackouts  malicious human acts and natural disasters 
moreover  despite network security measures  some of our servers are potentially vulnerable to physical or electrical break ins  computer viruses and similar disruptive problems 
despite the precautions we have taken  unanticipated problems affecting our systems could cause interruptions in our information technology systems 
our insurance policies may not adequately compensate us for any losses that may occur due to any failures in our systems 
in addition  over time we have significantly customized the computer systems in our laboratory business 
we rely on a limited number of employees to upgrade and maintain these systems 
if we were to lose the services of some or all of these employees  it may be time consuming for new employees to become familiar with our systems  and we may experience disruptions in service during these periods 
any substantial reduction in the number of available flights or delays in the departure of flights  whether as a result of severe weather conditions  as we recently experienced in the eastern united states  a terrorist attack or any other type of disruption  will disrupt our transportation network and our ability to provide test results in a timely manner 
any change in government regulation related to transporting samples or specimens could also have an impact on our business 
in addition  our test express service  which services customers outside of major metropolitan areas  is dependent on flight services in and out of memphis and the transportation network of federal express 
any sustained interruption in either flight services in memphis or the transportation network of federal express would result in increased turn around time for the reporting of test results to customers serviced by our test express service 
the loss of mr 
robert antin  our chairman  president and chief executive officer  could materially and adversely affect our business 
we are dependent upon the management and leadership of our chairman  president and chief executive officer  robert antin 
we have an employment contract with mr 
antin which may be terminated at the option of

we do not maintain any key man life insurance coverage for mr 
antin 
the loss of mr 
antin could materially adversely affect our business 
concentration of ownership among our existing executive officers  directors and principal stockholders may prevent new investors from influencing significant corporate decisions 
our executive officers  directors and principal stockholders beneficially own  in the aggregate  of our outstanding common stock 
as a result  these stockholders are able to significantly affect our management  our policies and all matters requiring stockholder approval 
our largest stockholder is leonard green partners  lp  which owns of our common stock 
three of the partners of leonard green partners  lp sit on our seven member board of directors 
these directors  along with the two management directors  will be able to significantly affect decisions relating to our capital structure  including decisions to issue additional capital stock  implement stock repurchase programs and incur indebtedness

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of december   we had borrowings of million under our senior credit facility with fluctuating interest rates based on market benchmarks such as libor 
to reduce the risk of increasing interest rates  we have entered into three separate no fee interest rate swap agreements 
the first agreement is for million and commenced on november  and expires november  the second agreement is for million and commenced on may  and expires may  the third agreement is for million and commenced on may  and expires may  these swap agreements have the effect of reducing the amount of our debt exposed to variable interest rates from million to million 
accordingly  based on the balances at december   for every increase in libor we will pay an additional  in interest expense per year and for every decrease in libor we will save  in interest expense per year 
we are considering entering into additional interest rate strategies to take advantage of the current rate environment 
we have not yet determined what those strategies may be or their possible impact
