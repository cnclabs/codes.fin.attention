item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we derive revenues from memberships to our research product offerings and from our advisory services and events available through what we refer to as research  data  consulting  and community offerings 
contracts for our research products are available through our research  data  or community offerings and are typically renewable annually and payable in advance 
research revenues are recognized as revenue ratably over the term of the contract 
accordingly  a substantial portion of our billings are initially recorded as deferred revenue 
advisory services are available through our data  consulting  and community offerings to supplement and complement memberships to our research 
billings attributable to advisory services are initially recorded as deferred revenue and are recognized as revenue when performed 
event billings are also initially recorded as deferred revenue and are recognized as revenue upon completion of each event 
consequently  changes in the number and value of client contracts  both net decreases as well as net increases  impact our revenues and other results over a period of several months 
our primary operating expenses consist of cost of services and fulfillment  selling and marketing expenses  general and administrative expenses  and depreciation and amortization 
cost of services and fulfillment represents the costs associated with the production and delivery of our products and services  and it includes the costs of salaries  bonuses  and related benefits for research personnel and all associated editorial  travel  and support services 
selling and marketing expenses include salaries  employee benefits  travel expenses  promotional costs  sales commissions  and other costs incurred in marketing and selling our products and services 
general and administrative expenses include the costs of the technology  operations  finance  and strategy groups and our other administrative functions 
overhead costs are allocated over these categories according to the number of employees in each group 
in february  we acquired giga information group  inc giga  a global technology advisory firm  pursuant to a cash tender offer and second step merger 
the results of giga s operations have been included in our consolidated financial statements since february  we believe that the agreement value of contracts to purchase research and advisory services provides a significant measure of our business volume 
we calculate agreement value as the total revenues recognizable from all research and advisory service contracts in force at a given time  without regard to how much revenue has already been recognized 
principally due to the acquisition of giga  agreement value increased to million at december  from million at december  agreement value decreased to million at december  from million at december  due to a more difficult economic environment 
no single client accounted for more than of agreement value at december  our historical experience is that a majority of client companies renew expiring contracts each year 
approximately   and of our client companies with memberships expiring during the years ended december    and  respectively  renewed one or more memberships for our products and services 
these renewal rates are not necessarily indicative of the rate of future retention of our revenue base 
the increase in renewal rates reflects the acquisition of giga during and an improving economic environment 
reorganizations since july  we have reorganized our workforce and consolidated our facilities several times in response to market conditions  and in august  in connection with the integration of giga 
a summary of the key items related to the reorganizations is as follows july  january  july  august  in thousands workforce reduction    facility consolidation and other related costs   depreciable assets  total reorganization charge     accrued severance and facility consolidation costs as of december   critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our policies and estimates  including but not limited to  those related to our revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  non marketable investments  goodwill  and other intangible assets and income taxes 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we consider the following accounting policies to be those that require the most subjective judgment or those most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations 
if actual results differ significantly from management s estimates and projections  there could be a material effect on our financial statements 
this is not a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
for a discussion of our other accounting policies  see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k  beginning on page f revenue recognition 
we generate revenues from licensing research  performing advisory services  and hosting events 
we execute contracts that govern the terms and conditions of each arrangement 
revenues from contracts that contain multiple deliverables are allocated among the separate units based on their relative fair values 
research services are recognized as revenue ratably over the term of the agreement 
advisory services are recognized during the period in which the services are performed 
revenue from events is recognized upon completion of the events 
reimbursed out of pocket expenses are recorded as advisory revenue 
furthermore  our revenue recognition determines the timing of commission expenses that are deferred and expensed to operations as the related revenue is recognized 
we evaluate the recoverability of deferred commissions at each balance sheet date 
as of december   deferred revenues and deferred commissions totaled million and million  respectively 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make contractually obligated payments that totaled approximately million as of december  management specifically analyzes accounts receivable and historical bad debts  customer concentrations  current economic trends  and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required  and if the financial condition of our customers were to improve  the allowances may be reduced accordingly 
non marketable investments 
we hold minority interests in companies and equity investment funds that totaled approximately million as of december  our investments are in companies and funds that are not publicly traded  and  therefore  no established market for these securities exists 
we have a policy in place to review the fair value of our investments on a regular basis to evaluate the carrying value of the investments in these companies 
we record impairment charges when we believe that an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
we recorded net impairment charges that totaled approximately and during the years ended december  and  respectively 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
goodwill and intangible assets 
at december   we had goodwill and identified intangible assets with finite lives related to our acquisitions that totaled approximately million and million  respectively 
sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives no longer be amortized but instead be measured for impairment at least annually or whenever events indicate that there may be an impairment 
in order to determine if a goodwill impairment exists  we obtain an independent appraisal which determines if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value 
the estimates of the reporting unit s fair value are based on market conditions and operational performance 
absent an event that indicates a specific impairment may exist  we have selected november th as the date of performing the annual goodwill impairment test 
as of december   we believe that the carrying value of our goodwill is not impaired 
future events such as a decline in our customer renewal rate or a loss of acquired customers could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill associated with our acquired businesses is impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
intangible assets with finite lives are valued according to the future cash flows they are estimated to produce 
these assigned values are amortized on an accelerated basis which matches the periods those cash flows are estimated to be produced 
we continually evaluate whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate that the estimated remaining useful life of our intangible assets may warrant revision or that the carrying value of these assets may be impaired 
to compute whether assets have been impaired  the estimated undiscounted future cash flows for the estimated remaining useful life of the assets are compared to the carrying value 
to the extent that the future cash flows are less than the carrying value  the assets are written down to the estimated fair value of the asset 
income taxes 
we have deferred tax assets related to temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities as well as operating loss carryforwards primarily from stock option exercises and the acquisition of giga that totaled approximately million as of december  in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible and the carryforwards expire 
although realization is not assured  based upon the level of our historical taxable income and projections for our future taxable income over the periods during which the deferred tax assets are deductible and the carryforwards expire  management believes it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefits of these deductible differences 
the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable  however  could be reduced if estimates of future taxable income during the carry forward periods are reduced 
results of operations the following table sets forth selected financial data as a percentage of total revenues for the periods indicated year ended december  research services advisory services and other total revenues cost of services and fulfillment selling and marketing general and administrative depreciation and amortization amortization of intangible assets integration costs reorganization costs income loss from operations other income  net impairments of non marketable investments  net gain on sale of internet adwatch income before income tax provision benefit provision benefit for income taxes net income years ended december  and december  revenues 
total revenues increased to million in from million in the acquisition of giga closed on february   and as such  giga s operations have been included in the consolidated financial statements since february  revenues from research services increased to million in from million in increases in total revenues and revenues from research services were primarily attributable to increases in agreement value and client companies as a result of the giga acquisition 
no single client company accounted for more than of revenues during or advisory services and other revenues increased to million in from million in during  we held forrester events and four legacy giga events as compared to forrester events held during the increase in advisory services and other revenues is primarily attributable to increases in the number of clients to  at december  from  at december   and in the number of research employees delivering advisory services to employees at december  from employees at december   which more than offset the decrease in event revenue attributable to our holding fewer events during than during the increase in clients and headcount in our research organization is primarily attributable to the acquisition of giga 
revenues attributable to customers outside the united states increased to million in from million in revenues attributable to customers outside the united states remained constant as a percentage of total revenues at during and the increase in international revenues in dollars is primarily attributable to the acquisition of giga 
we invoice our united kingdom customers in pound sterling  the functional currency of our london subsidiary  our continental european customers in euros  the functional currency of our amsterdam subsidiary  and all other international customers in us dollars 
the effect of changes in currency exchange rates have historically not had a significant impact on our results of operations 
assuming the acquisition of giga occurred on january   whereby pre acquisition revenues of giga would be added to forrester s revenues  total revenues would have been million in compared to million in the decrease of million is primarily attributable to a more difficult economic environment in  resulting in lower revenues in because of the annual nature of our research contracts and the related revenue recognition policies 
cost of services and fulfillment 
cost of services and fulfillment increased as a percentage of total revenues to in from in these expenses increased to million in from million in the increase in expenses and in expenses as a percentage of revenues was primarily attributable to greater compensation costs  as headcount in our research organization increased to employees at december  from employees at december  the increased headcount in our research organization is primarily attributable to the acquisition of giga  which provided for an additional research personnel at the time of acquisition 
selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses increased as a percentage of total revenues to in from in these expenses increased to million in from million in the increase in expenses and in expenses as a percentage of total revenues was primarily attributable to greater compensation costs  as headcount in our sales organization increased to employees at december  from employees at december  the increased headcount in our sales organization is primarily attributable to the acquisition of giga  which provided for an additional sales personnel at the time of acquisition 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of total revenues to in from in these expenses increased to million in from million in the increase in expenses was primarily due to greater compensation costs and professional fees as a result of the giga acquisition 
the decrease in expenses as a percentage of revenues is primarily attributable to an increased revenue base as a result of the acquisition of giga 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation expense decreased to million in from million in the decrease in these expenses was principally due to the write off of certain depreciable assets in connection with the workforce reorganizations in january and july as well as property and equipment becoming fully depreciated in which is partially offset by additional depreciation expense from fixed assets acquired as part of the acquisition of giga and other capital expenditures during amortization of intangible assets 
amortization of intangible assets increased to million in from  in this increase in amortization expense is a result of the amortization of intangible assets acquired in connection with the acquisition of giga 
integration costs 
we incurred integration costs of during these integration costs are related to our acquisition of giga  and are primarily related to orientation events for forrester and giga employees and data migration 
reorganization costs 
reorganization costs decreased to million in from million in during  these costs related to severance and related benefits costs in connection with the elimination of approximately positions  as well as revisions to the lease loss estimates related to prior reorganizations 
during  these costs related to facility consolidation costs  severance and related benefits costs in connection with the elimination of approximately positions  and losses incurred in the disposal of certain depreciable assets 
other income  net 
other income  consisting primarily of interest income  decreased to million during from million during the decrease is primarily due to declines in interest income resulting from lower cash and investment balances available for investment as a result of the cash paid for the acquisition of giga  coupled with lower returns on invested capital 
other income during includes realized gains on the sales of marketable securities of  compared to minimal losses on the sales of marketable securities during impairments of non marketable investments  net 
net impairments of non marketable investments resulted in net charges of million during compared to million during provision for income taxes 
during  we recorded an income tax provision of million reflecting an effective tax rate of 
during  we recorded a tax benefit of  reflecting an effective tax rate of 
in  after subtracting our tax exempt investment income  we had a loss before our income tax provision 
the increase in our effective tax rate for fiscal year resulted primarily from our tax exempt investment income comprising a smaller percentage of our total pre tax income in as compared to years ended december  and december  revenues 
total revenues decreased to million in  from million in revenues from core research decreased to million in  from million in decreases in total revenues and revenues from core research were primarily attributable to decreases in client companies to  at december  from  at december   as well as lower average contract values due to a more difficult economic environment 
these same factors also resulted in a decrease in revenues from core research as a percentage of total revenues 
no single client company accounted for more than of revenues in advisory services and other revenues decreased to million in  from million in this decrease was primarily attributable to the smaller number of events we held in  which was events  compared to events held during the year ended december  the more difficult economic environment also resulted in a decrease in sales of advisory services 
in addition  the reduction of our research organization responsible for performing advisory services to at december  from at december  contributed to the decrease in advisory services performed 
revenues attributable to customers outside the united states decreased to million in  from million in but remained constant as a percentage of total revenues in compared with at 
the decrease in international revenues in dollars is primarily attributable to a decline in revenue from core research related to decreases in the number of client companies and lower average contract values 
cost of services and fulfillment 
cost of services and fulfillment increased as a percentage of total revenues to in  from in these expenses decreased to million in  from million in the increase in expense as a percentage of revenues was primarily attributable to cost of services and fulfillment expenses  particularly compensation related costs  rent and survey costs associated with our product offerings  decreasing at a slower rate than revenues 
the decreases in these expenses in absolute dollars is primarily due to compensation related costs and travel and entertainment expense savings associated with the reduction in staffing in our research organization to at december  from at december  the decrease in expenses is also due to a reduction in events expense as we hosted fewer events and had a higher mix of lower costing events in compared to selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses decreased as a percentage of total revenues to in from in these expenses decreased to million in  from million in the decrease in expenses in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues was principally due to lower compensation related costs and travel and entertainment expense savings as a result of the reduction in the number of direct sales personnel to at december  from at december  general and administrative

results of quarterly operations the following tables set forth a summary of our unaudited quarterly operating results for each of our eight most recently ended fiscal quarters 
we have derived this information from our unaudited interim consolidated financial statements  which  in the opinion of our management  have been prepared on a basis consistent with our financial statements contained elsewhere in this annual report and include all adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments  necessary for a fair presentation in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states when read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
certain reclassifications have been made to the quarterly presentation to conform with our year end presentation 
historically  our total revenues  operating profit  and net income in the fourth quarter have reflected the significant positive contribution of revenues attributable to advisory services performed and forum events held in the fourth quarter 
as a result  we have historically experienced a decline in total revenues  operating profit  and net income from the quarter ended december to the quarter ended march our quarterly operating results are not necessarily indicative of future results of operations

we regularly invest excess funds in short and intermediate term interest bearing obligations of investment grade 
in the first quarter of  we acquired giga pursuant to a cash tender offer and second step merger 
the acquisition increased agreement value and the number of client companies and will reduce the operating expenses of the combined entity through economies of scale 
the aggregate purchase price was  in cash which consisted of  for the acquisition of all outstanding shares of giga common stock of which  was paid as of december    of direct acquisition costs of which  was paid as of december   and  for severance and related benefits costs in connection with the termination of giga employees as a result of the acquisition of which  was paid as of december  the remaining payments are expected to be completed by march  as part of the acquisition of giga  we acquired an equity investment in gigagroup sa gigagroup 
gigagroup was created in through the spin off of giga s french subsidiary  and held an exclusive agreement to distribute all giga research and certain services in france  belgium  netherlands  luxemburg  switzerland  italy  spain  and portugal 
during  we recognized revenues of approximately  related to this distribution agreement prior to the acquisition of gigagroup in november in november  we acquired the assets of gigagroup for a total purchase price of million  consisting of million in cash   of direct acquisition costs   of outstanding accounts receivable due to us  and the contribution of the equity investment in gigagroup valued at  in june  we committed to invest million in two private equity investment funds over a period of up to five years 
as of december   we had contributed approximately million to the funds 
the timing and amount of future contributions are entirely within the discretion of the investment funds 
we have adopted a cash bonus plan to pay bonuses  after the return of invested capital  measured by the proceeds of a portion of the share of net profits from these investments  if any  to certain key employees  subject to the terms and conditions of the plan

during the three months ended december   we entered into a structured stock repurchase agreement giving us the right to acquire shares of our common stock in exchange for an up front net payment of million 
this agreement expired in february and we received approximately  shares of our common stock 
the million up front net payment is recorded in stockholder s equity as a reduction of additional paid in capital in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of december  during each of the three month periods ended march   june  and september   we entered into similar agreements in exchange for up front net payments of million 
upon expiration of each agreement  we received approximately million of cash

we do not have a line of credit and do not anticipate the need for one in the foreseeable future 
we plan to continue to introduce new products and services and expect to make the requisite investments in our infrastructure during the next months 
we believe that our current cash balance  marketable securities  and cash flows from operations will satisfy working capital  financing activities  and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next two years

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we do not use derivative financial instruments 
interest rate sensitivity 
we maintain an investment portfolio consisting mainly of federal and state government obligations and corporate obligations  with a weighted average maturity of approximately months 
these available for sale securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
we have the ability to hold our fixed income investments until maturity except for any future acquisitions or mergers 
therefore  we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by a sudden change in market interest rates on our securities portfolio 
the following table provides information about our investment portfolio 
for investment securities  the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
principal amounts by expected maturity in us dollars dollars in thousands fair value at year ending year ending year ending year ending december  december  december  december  december  cash equivalents   weighted average interest rate investments      weighted average interest rate total portfolio      weighted average interest rate foreign currency exchange 
on a global level  we face exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
this exposure may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 
historically  our primary exposure had been related to non us dollar denominated operating expenses in canada and asia where we sell primarily in us dollars 
the introduction of the euro as a common currency for members of the european monetary union took place in our fiscal year to date  neither the introduction of the euro nor the effect of changes in currency exchange rates has had a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations 
accordingly  we have not entered into any hedging agreements 
however  we are prepared to hedge against fluctuations that the euro  or other foreign currencies  will have on foreign exchange exposure if this exposure becomes material 
as of december   the total assets related to non us dollar denominated currencies were approximately million
