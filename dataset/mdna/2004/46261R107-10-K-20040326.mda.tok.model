this marks our second consecutive year of solid comparable store sales growth 
our sales results were highlighted by an outstanding halloween season  which led the way to an increase in comparable stores sales of for the month of october and for our fourth quarter

our inventory and accounts receivable secure our line of credit 
we believe that all of these accomplishments have positioned us for continued success

special charge as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  we recorded a special charge in in the amount of  due to the overissuance of  common shares upon conversion of certain shares of our convertible preferred stock and the subsequent sale of such common shares into the public market 
this overissuance resulted from a previously incorrect application of the anti dilution provisions applicable to our series b  c and d convertible preferred stock 
this special charge includes  for professional fees incurred through december  and a non cash charge of  stock option compensation expense our stock option compensation expense consists of the amortization of stock options granted in   and for consulting services rendered to us by certain of our directors as well as the amortization of stock options granted in to our chief executive officer at an exercise price of  which was below the then current market price of

net loss available to common stockholders our net loss available to common stockholders was  in due to the inclusion of a beneficial conversion dividend in the amount of  which reflects the impact of correcting the conversion ratios of the remaining preferred stockholders to rectify the error discussed in the special charge above 
critical accounting policies our financial statements are based on the application of significant accounting policies  many of which require management to make significant estimates and assumptions see note to the consolidated financial statements 
we believe the following accounting policies to be those most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and those that require the most subjective judgment 
if actual results differ significantly from management s estimates and projections  there could be a material effect on our financial statements 
inventory and related allowance for obsolete and excess inventory our inventory consists of party supplies and is valued at the lower of moving weighted average cost or market 
we record vendor rebates  discounts and certain other adjustments to inventory  including freight costs  and we recognize these amounts in the income statement as the related goods are sold 
in january  the emerging issues task force eitf issued eitf no 
 accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor  which states that cash consideration received from a vendor is presumed to be a reduction of the prices of the vendor s products or services and should  therefore  be characterized as a reduction of cost of sales when recognized in the statement of operations 
that presumption is overcome when the consideration is either a reimbursement of specific  incremental  identifiable costs incurred to sell the vendor s products  or a payment for assets or services delivered to the vendor 
since we treated all rebates as a reduction of the price of the vendor s products  adoption of eitf issue no 
in did not have a material impact on our results of operations 
during each interim reporting period we estimate the impact on cost of products sold associated with inventory shortage 
the actual inventory shortage is determined upon reconciliation of the annual physical inventory  which occurs shortly after our year ends  and an adjustment to cost of products sold is recorded at the end of the fourth quarter to recognize the difference between the estimated and actual inventory shortage for the full year 
the adjustment in the fourth quarter of included a reduction of  to the cost of products sold during the previous three quarters 
we also make adjustments to reduce the value of our inventory for an allowance for obsolete and excess inventory  which is based on our review of inventories on hand compared to estimated future sales 
we conduct reviews periodically throughout the year on each stock keeping unit sku 
as we identify obsolete and excess inventory  we take immediate measures to reduce our inventory risk on these items and we adjust our allowance accordingly 
thus  actual results could differ from our estimates 
in  we refined our methodology for accounting for vendor rebates  discounts and freight 
we also continued to refine our methodology for estimating an appropriate allowance for obsolete and excess inventory 
the net impact of these adjustments increased pre tax income by  net income by  and had no impact on basic and diluted earnings per share 
revenue recognition revenues include the selling price of party goods sold  net of returns and discounts  and are recognized at the point of sale 
we estimate returns based upon historical return rates and such amounts have not been significant 
impairment of long lived assets we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets in  which requires that long lived assets be measured at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations in we review each store for impairment indicators annually  considering operating results and cash flows 
we are not aware of any impairment indicators for any of our stores at december  income taxes historically  we have not recognized an income tax benefit for our losses 
accordingly we record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets because of the uncertainty of future taxable income and the realizability of the deferred tax assets 
should we determine that we will be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to our deferred tax assets would increase income in the period we made such a determination 
previous restatement of financial information and balance sheet presentation of series a f convertible preferred stock the holders of our series a f convertible preferred stock have the right to a liquidation preference  which previously could have been exercised under certain events not within our control 
in accordance with eitf topic d  we have included the respective equity securities outside of permanent stockholders deficit in our accompanying restated balance sheet as of december  at their respective carrying values 
during the fourth quarter of  the composition of our board of directors changed such that holders of our convertible preferred stock or the designates of our preferred stockholders no longer constitute a majority of our board members 
this change in the composition of our board of directors has permitted us to present our convertible preferred stock in equity in the accompanying balance sheet as of december   at its respective carrying values as the redemption is solely within our control 
we will continue to review and consider the criteria in eitf topic d at the reporting of each balance sheet 
stock option compensation expense we account for our stock option compensation agreements with employees under the provisions of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
we have adopted the disclosure only provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  an amendment of financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
our actual results could differ from our estimates 
new accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin arb no 
fin 
fin requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
fin is effective for all new variable interest entities created or acquired after january  for variable interest entities created or acquired prior to february   the provisions of fin must be applied for the first interim or annual period beginning after june  however  in october  the fasb deferred the effective date of fin to the end of the first interim or annual period ending after december  for those arrangements involving special purpose entities entered into prior to february  all other arrangements within the scope of fin are subject to its provisions beginning in we adopted fin  as required  with no material impact to our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
we do not believe that the adoption of the remaining provisions of fin in will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
liquidity and capital resources our operating activities provided  in net cash in compared to  in  an increase of  which was largely due to our growth in net income  which was  in  compared to a net loss of  in our increase in net income was partially offset by an increase in net cash used in inventory  which was  in compared to cash provided by inventory of  in the increase in net cash used in inventory was primarily for the three new stores we opened in we invested cash in property and equipment  including new store capital expenditures  totaling  in and  in the increase in capital expenditures was largely due to the addition of three new stores in compared to two new stores in we used  in net cash in financing activities in compared to providing  in net cash in financing activities in we increased our borrowings under our line of credit by  in compared to an increase of  in  largely to finance capital expenditures for new stores 
at december  we had a line of credit the line with wells fargo retail finance ii  llc 
the line had a maturity date of july  and a minimum interest rate of 
the line allowed for borrowings equal to the lesser of  or the borrowing base  as defined 
our inventory and other assets secured our line 
we were required to maintain a minimum availability under the line in the amount of  at december  we were in compliance with this financial covenant 
the line of credit generally prohibits the payment of any dividends or other distributions to any of our classes of capital stock 
the amount outstanding under our line was  as of december  and  on december  the outstanding balances under the line are classified as current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets since we are required to apply daily lock box receipts to reduce the amount outstanding 
at december   we had approximately  of excess availability under the line of credit 
subsequent to the end of fiscal  we amended the line on january  the amendment extended the maturity date of our line to january   eliminated the minimum interest rate of  established a new interest rate at the bank s base rate plus basis points and added the option to increase the line in increments of  beyond the previous limit of  to a limit of  upon days written notice  as long as we are in compliance of debt covenants and the provisions of the loan agreement 
our inventory and accounts receivable secure our line of credit 
the amended agreement includes a financial covenant requiring us to maintain a minimum availability under the line in the amount of of the credit limit  which at the current limit of  is  if we adjust the credit limit in the future  the minimum availability would be of the adjusted credit limit 
the amended agreement also has a covenant that requires us to limit our capital expenditures to within of those amounts included in our business plan  which may be updated from time to time 
our prospective cash flows are subject to certain trends  events and uncertainties  including demands for capital to support growth  economic conditions  and contractual matters 
we expect our capital expenditures for to be primarily related to new stores  a new retail stores point of sale computer system  store improvements and other technology advancements in support of growth and operational enhancement 
contractual obligations at december  were as follows payments due by period within year within years within years after years total line of credit capital lease obligations operating leases including retail space leases earn out agreement included in accrued expenses total contractual obligations in addition  at december   we had outstanding purchase orders totaling  for the acquisition of inventory that was scheduled for delivery after december  we believe  based on our current operating plan  that anticipated revenues from operations and borrowings available under the existing line of credit will be sufficient to fund our operations and working capital requirements for the next months 
our current operating plan includes the opening of four to seven additional new stores and the replacement of our current point of sale system during in the event that our operating plan changes or proves inaccurate due to decreased revenues  unanticipated expenses  increased competition  unfavorable economic conditions  or other unforeseen circumstances  our liquidity may be negatively impacted 
accordingly  we would be required to adjust our expenditures to conserve working capital or raise additional capital to fund operations 
there can be no assurance  however  that  should we require additional financing  such financing will be available on terms and conditions acceptable to us 
acquisitions we operate in an un branded business arena that has many small players 
as a result  we may consider growing our business through acquisitions of other entities 
any determination to make an acquisition will be based upon a variety of factors  including  without limitation  the purchase price and other financial terms of the transaction  the business prospects  geographical location and the extent to which any acquisition would enhance our prospects 
we presently have no plans  agreement  understanding  or arrangement with respect to any acquisition 
stockholder rights plan on november   we announced that our board of directors adopted a stockholder rights plan the plan 
under the plan each share of our capital stock outstanding at the close of business on november  and each share of our capital stock issued subsequent to that date has a right associated with it  such that each share of our common stock is entitled to one right and each share of our preferred stock is entitled to such number of rights equal to the number of common shares into which it is convertible 
the rights will become exercisable only in the event that  with certain exceptions  an acquiring party accumulates percent or more of our voting stock or if a party announces an offer to acquire percent or more of our voting stock 
the rights expire on november  when exercisable  each right entitles the holder to purchase from us one one hundredth of a share of a new series of series g junior preferred stock at an initial purchase price of 
in addition  upon the occurrence of certain events  holders of the rights will be entitled to purchase either iparty corp 
stock or shares in an acquiring entity at half of market value 
we generally will be entitled to redeem the rights at per right at any time until the date on which a percent position in our voting stock is acquired by any person or group 
until a right is exercised  the holder of a right will have no rights as a stockholder of iparty solely by virtue of being a rights holder  including  without limitation  the right to vote or receive dividends 
effects of inflation we do not view the effects of inflation to have a material effect upon our business 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not believe that we have any material market risk exposure owing to foreign currency risk  exchange rate risk  commodity price risk and other relevant market rate or price risks that require the quantitative and qualitative disclosures set forth in item of regulation s k 
we have interest rate risk on our line of credit debt obligation to the extent that if interest rates were to rise our rate of interest under our line of credit would also increase 
we do not believe that this interest rate risk is material and we have not entered into any hedging or similar contractual arrangements with respect to such risk 
we do not enter into contracts for trading purposes
