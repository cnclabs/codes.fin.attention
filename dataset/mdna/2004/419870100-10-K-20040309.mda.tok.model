heco management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with hawaiian electric company  inc s heco s consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
overview and strategy heco and its electric public utility subsidiaries collectively  the company are vertically integrated and regulated by the hawaii public utilities commission puc 
hawaii has not experienced any of the disaggregation or deregulation that has occurred in the industry on the u 
s 
mainland over the past several years 
keys to achieving reasonable returns are containing costs  retaining customers by providing reliable service and maintaining close customer relationships  and receiving rate increases when needed 
the success of the company s strategy will be heavily influenced by hawaii s general economic conditions and tourism 
real gross state product grew by in and the state of hawaii department of business  economic development and tourism dbedt has projected that gross state product will grow by in however  if a strike in the concrete business on oahu that began in early february continues  it may become increasingly difficult for the state economy to achieve such growth in reliability projects remain a priority for heco and its subsidiaries and significant progress was made in enhancing reliability in after years of delays  the keahole power plant expansion on the island of hawaii resumed construction in november and the units are now expected to go online in the second quarter of and be fully operational by december   providing needed generation to the fast growing communities in west hawaii 
a request to approve a new plan for the east oahu transmission project  an important reliability project for the major transmission grid on the island of oahu  was filed with the puc in december also on oahu  a new fuel oil pipeline has been approved by the puc and is under construction 
major infrastructure projects can have a pronounced impact on the communities in which they are located 
the company has expanded its community outreach and consultation process so they can better understand and evaluate community concerns early in the process 
with large power users in its service territories  such as the us military  hotels and state and local government  management believes that retaining customers by maintaining customer satisfaction is a critical component in achieving kwh sales and revenue growth in hawaii over time 
the company has established programs that offer these customers specialized services and energy efficiency audits to help them save on energy costs 
heco plans to file an application for a rate case in the second half of  based on a test year 
the final decision for the last rate case on oahu was issued in heco and its subsidiaries forecast that cash flows from operations over the next five years will cover their capital expenditures and dividend requirements  except for slight increases in long term debt from the drawdown of outstanding revenue bond proceeds and in short term borrowings  which will fluctuate during this period 
besides installing new generating units  the company s long term plan to meet hawaii s future energy needs includes their support of energy conservation and efficiency through demand side management programs and initiatives to pursue a range of energy choices  including renewable energy and new power supply technologies such as distributed generation 
in late  heco formed a new subsidiary  renewable hawaii  inc rhi  which will invest up to million in renewable energy projects to advance the long term development of renewable energy in hawaii 
requests for proposals have been issued for projects and rhi is presently evaluating the viability of several projects 
net income was million in compared to million in a swing of million in retirement benefits expense  from a credit of million in to an expense of million in  was a primary cause of the decline 
pension expense in is expected to be million lower than in kwh sales growth was up for the year 
table of contents and growth was particularly strong at for the island of hawaii 
assuming a near term resolution of the current strike and continuing strength in the us and hawaii economies  management expects higher kwh sales again in from time to time  the company considers various strategies designed to enhance their competitive positions and to maximize shareholder value 
these strategies may include the formation of new subsidiaries or the acquisition or disposition of businesses 
the company may from time to time be engaged in preliminary discussions  either internally or with third parties  regarding potential transactions 
management cannot predict whether any of these strategies or transactions will be carried out or  if so  whether they will be successfully implemented 
economic conditions because it provides local electric utility services  the company s operating results are significantly influenced by the strength of hawaii s economy  which has been growing modestly 
growth in real gross state product was and in and  respectively 
tourism is widely acknowledged as the largest component of the hawaii economy 
direct and indirect tourism dollars accounted for approximately of gross state product  of civilian jobs and of state and local taxes based on a study conducted by dbedt 
in  visitor arrivals reached a high of million 
in  arrivals were pacing levels when the terrorist acts of september th negatively impacted tourism  especially japanese arrivals 
in  the war in iraq and the outbreak of sars in asia provided additional reasons for japanese tourists not to travel 
while tourism has since rebounded  visitor arrivals have lagged the record arrival levels 
total visitor arrivals in were million  down from  due to a combination of a weak international visitor market down and a strong domestic market up 
positives in tourism were visitors stayed longer  evidenced by a increase in total visitor days  hotel occupancy levels reached through november  higher than occupancy rates for the same period of  and visitor expenditures are expected to be billion for  which would represent a increase over visitor expenditures 
also in  visitor days  which reflect both visitor arrivals and length of stay  were million  also a record high for hawaii tourism 
key non tourism sectors in hawaii  particularly the military and residential real estate  are fueling economic growth 
after remaining relatively stable over the last five years  the military is showing a growing presence with several key military construction projects slated to begin in  including billion of housing renewal projects  billion in construction for an army stryker brigade and over million to prepare for the arrival of eight c cargo planes at hickam air force base 
in general  the construction industry in hawaii has been doing well 
private building permits were up overall for the year through november compared with the same period in  and were also up in all categories residential up  commercial and industrial up and additions and alterations up 
local economists anticipate year end data to reflect growth in construction in and have forecast a increase for however  in early february  employees of the principal manufacturers of concrete on oahu went on strike  causing a slowdown in construction in hawaii halting many construction projects and leading to hundreds of layoffs in the construction industry 
the slowdown in construction activity will temporarily delay electricity demand from new customers 
a prolonged strike could significantly adversely affect hawaii s construction industry and the hawaii economy in general 
hawaii s improving economy in is also reflected in other general economic statistics 
total salary and wage jobs increased by in versus hawaii s unemployment rate of was well below the national average of at the end of dbedt also estimates real personal income growth of in compared to given these positive trends in key non tourism sectors and overall economic indicators  dbedt expects hawaii s economy to grow moderately by in  excluding inflation  but achievement of such growth is subject to numerous variables and unknowns 
future growth in hawaii s economy is expected to be tied primarily to the rate of expansion in the mainland us and japan economies and increased military spending  and remains vulnerable to uncertainties in the world s geopolitical environment

pension and other postretirement benefits for  the retirement benefit plan assets generated a total return of nearly for realized and unrealized net gains of million 
in contrast  for  and  the realized and unrealized net losses on retirement benefit plan assets were million  million and million  respectively 
contributions to the retirement benefit plans totaled million in  compared to contributions of million and million during and  respectively 
contributions are expected to total million in as of december  and  the market value of such assets was million and million  respectively

the estimated retirement benefits expenses  net of income taxes  are forward looking statements subject to risks and uncertainties  including the impact of plan changes during the year  if any  and the impact of actual information when received eg  actual participant demographics as of january  
in  revenues increased by  or million  from primarily due to higher energy prices million  a increase in kwh sales of electricity million and higher demand side management 
table of contents dsm lost margins and shareholder incentives million  partly offset by lower dsm program and integrated resource plan irp costs to be recovered million 
the increase in kwh sales from was primarily due to increases in the number of residential customers and residential and commercial usage resulting in part from an improving hawaii economy higher visitor days and strong real estate market and warmer weather more air conditioning usage 
the growth in sales was achieved despite the impact on tourism of concerns over the japanese economy  the war in iraq  terrorism and sars 
cooling degree days were higher in compared to operating income was million lower than mainly due to higher other expenses  primarily higher retirement benefit expenses 
fuel oil expense and purchased power expense in increased by and  respectively  due primarily to higher fuel prices  which are generally passed on to customers  and more kwhs generated and purchased 
other expenses were up in due to an or million increase in other operation expense  a or million increase in depreciation expense due to additions to plant in service in  including heco s kewalo kamoku kilovolt kv line  a or million increase in taxes  other than income taxes  primarily due to the increase in revenues  partly offset by a or million decrease in maintenance expense due in part to less underground distribution line corrective maintenance 
as the companies focused on capital expenditures to ensure reliability  ducted cables were installed to replace  rather than repair  direct buried cables when cable problems occurred 
other operation expense increased primarily due to higher retirement benefits expense and environmental expenses including higher emission fees 
pension and other postretirement benefit costs  net of amounts capitalized  swung million over million expense in versus a million credit in  partly due to revised assumptions decreasing the discount rate basis points to and the long term rate of return on assets basis points to as of december  compared to december  
as of december   the discount rate was further reduced to  but retirement benefits expense in is expected to be million lower than due to the improved performance of plan assets and contributions made in other operation expense for also included million of charges related to a settlement reached in december involving the expansion of the existing plant at keahole on the island of hawaii see note in heco s notes to consolidated financial statements  offset by lower dsm and irp costs 
in january  the department of health of the state of hawaii doh announced that it intended to waive emissions fees  thus  emissions fees of million  which were accrued in  were reversed in the first quarter of in  revenues decreased by  or million  from primarily due to lower energy prices million  partly offset by a increase in kwh sales of electricity million 
the increase in kwh sales from was primarily due to increases in residential usage and the number of residential customers and a recovery in the local economy following the events of the september  terrorist attacks  in spite of cooler temperatures which typically result in lower residential and commercial air conditioning usage 
operating income for was slightly lower than fuel oil expense decreased due primarily to lower fuel oil prices  partly offset by more kwhs generated 
purchased power expense decreased due primarily to lower fuel prices and lower purchased capacity payments to an ipp who was able to produce only an average of about megawatt mw of firm capacity since april compared to the mw the ipp contracted to provide to helco 
other expenses were up due to a increase in other operation expense including million lower retirement benefits income  net of amounts capitalized  primarily due to a basis points lower discount rate and the market performance of plan assets ie  million retirement benefits income in compared to million in  an increase in maintenance expense partly due to the timing and larger scope of generating unit overhauls  a increase in depreciation expense due to additions to plant in service in  partly offset by a decrease in taxes  other than income taxes 
allowance for funds used during construction afudc for was lower than due to the lower base on which afudc was calculated 
interest expense decreased from due to lower short term borrowings and interest rates 

table of contents recent rate requests heco  helco and meco initiate puc proceedings from time to time to request electric rate increases to cover rising operating costs eg  higher purchased power capacity charges and the cost of plant and equipment  including the cost of new capital projects to maintain and improve service reliability 
as of february   the return on average common equity roace found by the puc to be reasonable in the most recent final rate decision for each utility was for heco decision and order d o issued on december   based on a test year  for hawaii electric light company  inc helco d o issued on february   based on a test year and for maui electric company  limited meco amended d o issued on april   based on a test year 
for  the actual simple average roaces calculated under the rate making method and reported to the puc for heco  helco and meco were  and  respectively 
helco s actual roace for of  compared to its allowed roace of  reflects in part helco s decision to discontinue accruing afudc  effective december   on its ct and ct generating units that are being installed at the keahole power plant 
the non accrual of afudc currently estimated at approximately million after tax per month is expected to continue to have a negative impact on helco s roace for as of february   the return on average rate base ror found by the puc to be reasonable in the most recent final rate decision for each utility was for heco  for helco and for meco d os noted above 
for  the actual rors calculated under the rate making method for heco  helco and meco were  and  respectively 
hawaiian electric company  inc heco has not initiated a rate case in about ten years  but in it committed to initiate a rate case within three years  using a or test year 
the puc later approved heco s request that the time for initiating the rate case be extended by months  with the result that the rate case is to be initiated in the second half of  using a test year 
see other regulatory matters  demand side management programs agreements with the consumer advocate 
in october  heco filed an application with the puc for approval to change its depreciation rates and to change to vintage amortization accounting for selected plant accounts  which changes would have amounted to an estimated million  or  increase in heco s annual depreciation expense based on a study of depreciation expense for in its application  heco requested that the effective date of the proposed changes coincide with the effective date of the rates established in heco s next rate case proceeding so that heco s financial results would not be negatively impacted by the depreciation rates and method ultimately approved by the puc 
in july  the consumer advocate submitted its direct testimony and recommended depreciation expense approximately million  or  less than heco s requested million in annual depreciation expense 
in march  heco and the consumer advocate reached an agreement  subject to puc approval 
under the agreement  heco would change its depreciation rates and change to vintage amortization accounting for selected plant accounts  effective with the puc s final decision and order in this application 
if approved by the puc  the settlement agreement would result in an estimated million in annual depreciation expense for hawaii electric light company  inc in early  helco received a final d o from the puc authorizing an million  or increase in annual revenues  effective february  and based on an roace 
the d o included in rate base million for pre air permit facilities needed for the delayed keahole power plant expansion project that the puc had also found to be used or useful to support the existing generating units at keahole 
the timing of a future helco rate increase request to recover costs relating to the delayed keahole power plant expansion project  ie  adding two combustion turbines ct and ct at keahole  including the remaining cost of pre air permit facilities  will depend on future circumstances 
see helco power situation in note in heco s notes to consolidated financial statements 
on june   the puc issued an order approving a new standby service rate schedule rider for helco 
the standby service rider issue had been bifurcated from the rate case decided by the puc in february the rider provides the rates  terms and conditions for obtaining backup and supplemental electric power from the utility when a customer obtains all or part of its electric power from sources other than helco 

table of contents other regulatory matters demand side management programs lost margins and shareholder incentives 
heco  helco and meco s energy efficiency dsm programs  currently approved by the puc  provide for the recovery of lost margins and the earning of shareholder incentives 
lost margins are accrued and collected prospectively based on the programs forecast levels of participation  and are subject to two adjustments based on the actual level of participation and the results of impact evaluation reports 
the difference between the adjusted lost margins and the previously collected lost margins are subject to refund or recovery  with any over or under collection accruing interest at heco  helco  or meco s authorized rate of return on rate base 
heco  helco and meco plan to file the impact evaluation report for the period with the puc in the fourth quarter of and adjust the lost margin recovery as required 
past adjustments required for lost margins have not had a material effect on heco  helco or meco s financial statements 
shareholder incentives are accrued currently and collected retrospectively based on the programs actual levels of participation for the prior year 
beginning in  shareholder incentives collected are subject to retroactive adjustment based on the results of impact evaluation reports  similar to the adjustment process for lost margins 
demand side management programs agreements with the consumer advocate 
in october  heco and the consumer advocate finalized agreements  subject to puc approval  for the continuation of heco s three commercial and industrial dsm programs and two residential dsm programs until heco s next rate case  which heco committed to file using a or test year 
these agreements were in lieu of heco continuing to seek approval of new year dsm programs 
any dsm programs to be in place after heco s next rate case will be determined as part of the case 
under the agreements  heco will cap the recovery of lost margins and shareholder incentives if such recovery would cause heco to exceed its current authorized return on rate base ie the rate of return on rate base found by the puc to be reasonable in the most recent rate case for heco 
heco also agreed it will not pursue the continuation of lost margins recovery and shareholder incentives through a surcharge mechanism in future rate cases 
in october  helco and meco reached similar agreements with the consumer advocate and filed requests to continue their four existing dsm programs 
in november  the puc issued orders one of which was later amended that  subject to certain reporting requirements and other conditions  approved the agreements regarding the temporary continuation of heco s five existing dsm programs until heco s next rate case and the agreements regarding the temporary continuation of helco s and meco s dsm programs until one year after the puc makes a revenue requirements determination in heco s next rate case 
under the orders  however  helco and meco are allowed to recover only lost margins and shareholder incentives accrued through the date that interim rates are established in heco s next rate case  but may request to extend the time of such accrual and recovery for up to one additional year 
in  meco s revenues from shareholder incentives were million lower than the amount that would have been recorded if meco had not agreed to cap such incentives when its authorized ror was exceeded 
also in  helco slightly exceeded its authorized ror resulting in a reduction of revenues from shareholders incentives for by  recorded in january 
in  heco did not exceed its authorized ror 
in  none of the electric utilities exceeded their respective authorized rors 
as part of heco s agreement with the consumer advocate regarding heco s commercial  industrial and residential dsm programs  the parties agreed in august  and the puc approved  that heco could delay the filing of its next rate case by approximately months  with the result that the rate case will be filed in the second half of using a test year 
the other components of the existing agreements  as approved by the puc  would be continued under the new agreements 
collective bargaining agreements heco  helco and meco reached a new collective bargaining agreement in with the union which represents approximately of its employees 
see collective bargaining agreements in note in heco s notes to consolidated financial statements 

table of contents legislation congress and the hawaii legislature periodically consider legislation that could have positive or negative effects on the utilities and their customers 
for example  although it is currently stalled in a house senate conference committee  comprehensive energy legislation is still before congress that could increase the domestic supply of oil as well as increase support for energy conservation programs and mandate the use of renewables by utilities 
the hawaii legislature considered measures that would undertake a comprehensive audit of hawaii s electric utility regulatory policies  energy policies and support for reducing hawaii s use of imported petroleum for electrical generation  and a measure to remove the cap on the amount of net energy metering the utilities would be required to make available to eligible customers 
these measures were not enacted into law 
the legislature did  however  pass a more restricted bill calling for a management audit of the puc and consumer advocate 
also  on june   the governor signed into law the hawaii state tax credit for renewable energy  which extends the existing tax credit of of the cost of residential solar water heating up to  until at least in its session  the hawaii legislature passed a law establishing renewable portfolio standard goals for electric utilities of by december   by december  and by december  heco  helco and meco are permitted to aggregate their renewable portfolios in order to achieve these goals 
any electric utility whose percentage of sales of electricity represented by renewable energy does not meet these goals will have to report to the puc and provide an explanation for not meeting the renewables portfolio standard 
the puc could then grant a waiver from the standard or an extension for meeting the standard 
the puc may also provide incentives to encourage electric utilities to exceed the standards or meet the standards earlier  or both  but as yet no such incentives have been proposed 
the law also requires that electric utilities offer net energy metering to solar  wind turbine  biomass or hydroelectric generating systems or hybrid systems with a capacity up to kilowatts ie  a customer generator may be a net user or supplier of energy and will make payments to or receive credits from the electric utility accordingly 
the company currently supports renewable sources in various ways  including their solar water heating and heat pump programs and their purchased power contracts with nonutility generators using renewable sources eg  refuse fired  geothermal  hydroelectric and wind turbine generating systems 
on december   helco signed an approximately mw as available wind power contract with hawi renewable development 
the electric utilities continue to initiate and support many renewable energy research and development projects to help develop these technologies eg  photovoltaic projects 
they are also conducting integrated resource planning to evaluate the use of more renewables and  in december  heco formed a nonregulated subsidiary  renewable hawaii  inc rhi  to invest in renewable energy projects 
in and  rhi solicited competitive proposals for investment opportunities in projects mw or larger to supply renewable energy on the islands of oahu  maui  molokai  lanai and hawaii 
rhi is currently reviewing proposals received 
rhi is seeking to take a passive  minority interest in such projects to help stimulate the addition of cost effective  commercially viable renewable energy generation in the state of hawaii 
over of consolidated electricity sales for were from renewable resources as defined under the renewable portfolio standard law 
while the company thus met the target for provided for in the hawaii legislation  it believes it may be difficult to meet the renewable portfolio standard goals in future years  particularly if sales of electricity increase as projected 
thus  at this time  management cannot predict the impact of this law or of other proposed congressional and hawaii legislation on the company or its customers 
effects of inflation us inflation  as measured by the us consumer price index  averaged in  in and in hawaii inflation  as measured by the honolulu consumer price index  averaged in  in and in although the rate of inflation over the past several years has been low  inflation continues to have an impact on the company s operations 
inflation increases operating costs and the replacement cost of assets 
with significant physical assets  heco and its subsidiaries replace assets at much higher costs and must request and obtain rate increases to maintain adequate earnings 
in the past  the puc has generally approved rate increases to cover the effects of inflation 
the puc granted rate increases in and for helco  and in for meco  in part to cover increases in construction costs and operating expenses due to inflation 

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements see recent accounting pronouncements and interpretations in note in heco s notes to consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources the company believes that its ability to generate cash  both internally from operations and externally from issuances of equity and debt securities  commercial paper and bank borrowings  is adequate to maintain sufficient liquidity to fund its capital expenditures and investments and to cover debt  retirement benefits and other cash requirements in the foreseeable future 
the company s total assets were billion at december  and billion at december  heco s consolidated capital structure was as follows december in millions short term borrowings long term debt  net heco obligated preferred securities of trust subsidiaries preferred stock common stock equity as of february   the standard poor s s p and moody s investors service s moody s ratings of heco securities were as follows s p moody s commercial paper a p revenue bonds senior unsecured  insured aaa aaa heco obligated preferred securities of trust subsidiaries bbb baa cumulative preferred stock selected series nr baa nr not rated 
the above ratings are not recommendations to buy  sell or hold any securities  such ratings may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating agencies  and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 
in may  s p revised its credit outlook on heco securities to stable from negative  citing recovery in hawaii s economy  moderate construction spending  aggressive cost containment  limited competitive pressures  steady banking operations  and expectations for continued financial improvement 
the rating agencies use a combination of qualitative measures ie  assessment of business risk that incorporates an analysis of the qualitative factors such as management  competitive positioning  operations  markets and regulation as well as quantitative measures eg  cash flow  debt  interest coverage and liquidity ratios in determining the ratings of heco securities 
from time to time  heco utilizes short term debt  principally commercial paper  to support normal operations and for other temporary requirements 
from time to time  heco also borrows short term from hei for itself and on behalf of helco and meco  and heco may borrow from or loan to helco and meco short term 
at december   heco had million and million of short term borrowings from hei and meco  respectively  and helco had million of short term borrowings from heco 
heco had an average outstanding balance of commercial paper for of million and had no commercial paper outstanding at december  management believes that if heco s commercial paper ratings were to be downgraded  they might not be able to sell commercial paper under current market conditions 
at december   heco maintained bank lines of credit totaling million all maturing in 
these lines of credit are principally maintained by heco to support the issuance of commercial paper  but also may be drawn for general corporate purposes 
accordingly  the lines of credit are available for short term liquidity in the event a rating agency downgrade were to reduce or eliminate access to the commercial paper markets 
there are 
table of contents in  the company s investing activities used million in cash  primarily for capital expenditures 
capital expenditures requiring the use of cash totaled approximately million in  of which million was attributable to heco  million to helco and million to meco 
approximately of the total capital expenditures was for transmission and distribution projects and approximately was for generation and general plant projects 
cash contributions in aid of construction received in totaled million 
financing activities used net cash of million  including million for the payment of common and preferred stock dividends and preferred securities distributions and million for the net repayment of long term debt 
operating activities provided cash of million 
in september  the department of budget and finance of the state of hawaii issued  at a small discount  series a special purpose revenue bonds sprb in the principal amount of million with a maturity of years and a fixed coupon interest rate of yield of  and loaned the proceeds from the sale to heco

as of december   million of proceeds from the series a sale by the department of budget and finance of the state of hawaii of special purpose revenue bonds issued for the benefit of heco remain undrawn 
on may   the department of budget and finance of the state of hawaii issued  at a small discount  refunding series a sprb in the aggregate principal amount of million with a maturity of approximately years and a fixed coupon interest rate of yield of  and loaned the proceeds from the sale to helco 
also on may   the department of budget and finance of the state of hawaii issued  at par  refunding series b sprb in the aggregate principal amount of million with a maturity of approximately years and a fixed coupon interest rate of and loaned the proceeds from the sale to heco and helco

payments on the revenue bonds issued in may are insured by a financial guaranty insurance policy issued by xl capital assurance inc as further explained in note in heco s notes to consolidated financial statements  the company maintains pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
funding for the pension plans is based upon actuarially determined contributions that take into account the amount deductible for income tax purposes and the minimum contribution required under the employee retirement income security act of  as amended erisa 
the company was not required to make any contributions to the pension plans to meet minimum funding requirements pursuant to erisa for  but the company s pension investment committee chose to make tax deductible contributions in contributions to the pension and postretirement benefit plans totaled million in contributions are expected to total million in the company s policy is to comply with directives from the puc to fund the costs of the postretirement benefit plan 
these costs are ultimately collected in rates billed to customers 
the company reserves the right to change  modify or terminate the plans 
from time to time in the past  benefits have changed 
depending on the performance of the assets held in the plans trusts and numerous other factors  additional contributions may be required in the future to meet the minimum funding requirements of erisa or to pay benefits to plan participants 
the company believes it will have adequate access to capital resources to support any necessary funding requirements 
net capital expenditures for through are estimated to total billion 
consolidated cash flows from operating activities net income  adjusted for noncash income and expense items such as depreciation  amortization and deferred taxes  after the payment of common stock and preferred stock dividends  are expected to provide cash to cover the forecast consolidated net capital expenditures  except for a slight increase in short term 
table of contents borrowings and in long term debt from the drawdown of outstanding revenue bond proceeds 
short term borrowings are expected to fluctuate during this forecast period 
additional debt and or equity financing may be required for various reasons  including increases in the costs of or an acceleration of the construction of capital projects  unbudgeted acquisitions or investments in new businesses  significant increases in retirement benefit funding requirements that may be required if the market value of pension plan assets does not increase or there are changes in actuarial assumptions and other unanticipated expenditures not included in the through forecast 
capital expenditures include the costs of projects that are required to meet expected load growth  to improve reliability and to replace and upgrade existing equipment 
net capital expenditures for the five year period through are currently estimated to total billion

for  net capital expenditures are estimated to be million 
gross capital expenditures are estimated to be million  including approximately million for transmission and distribution projects  approximately million for generation projects and approximately million for general plant and other projects 
investment in renewable projects through rhi in is estimated to be an additional million 
drawdowns of million of proceeds from the series a sale of tax exempt special purpose revenue bonds  cash flows from operating activities and short term borrowings are expected to provide the cash needed for the net capital expenditures in management periodically reviews capital expenditure estimates and the timing of construction projects 
these estimates may change significantly as a result of many considerations  including changes in economic conditions  changes in forecasts of kwh sales and peak load  the availability of purchased power and changes in expectations concerning the construction and ownership of future generating units  the availability of generating sites and transmission and distribution corridors  the ability to obtain adequate and timely rate increases  escalation in construction costs  the impacts of dsm programs and combined heat and power chp installations  the effects of opposition to proposed construction projects and requirements of environmental and other regulatory and permitting authorities 
existing debt or trust preferred securities may be refinanced potentially at more favorable rates with additional debt or equity financing or both 
the puc must approve issuances  if any  of equity and long term debt securities by heco  heco and meco 
in february  the puc approved the issuance of trust preferred securities by heco capital trust iii to refinance the trust preferred securities issued by heco capital trust i in and or the trust preferred securities issued by heco capital trust ii in depending on interest rates and other conditions in the capital markets  the company s current plans are to redeem the trust preferred securities of heco capital trust i with the proceeds of the sale of the trust preferred securities of heco capital trust iii and to utilize short term borrowings from hei and internal funds to effect the redemption of the trust preferred securities issued by heco capital trust ii 
it is anticipated that heco will pay down these short term borrowings over time with lower dividends to hei 
if these refinancings proceed  management expects to complete these redemptions in the second quarter of see note in heco s notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of fuel and power purchase commitments 

table of contents selected contractual obligations the following table presents aggregated information about total principal  lease and fuel oil payments and minimum fixed capacity purchase power charges due during the indicated periods under the specified contractual obligations december  payment due by period in millions less than year years years after years total contractual obligations long term debt  net heco obligated preferred securities of trust subsidiaries operating leases fuel oil purchase obligations estimate based on january  fuel oil prices purchase power obligations minimum fixed capacity charges the table above does not include other categories of obligations and commitments  such as interest payable  trade payables  obligations under purchase orders and amounts that may become payable in future periods under collective bargaining and other employment agreements and employee benefit plans 
as of december   the fair value of the assets held in trusts to satisfy the obligations of the pension and other postretirement benefit plans exceeded the pension plans accumulated benefit obligation and the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for retirees 
thus  no minimum funding requirements for retirement benefit plans have been included in the tables above 
certain factors that may affect future results and financial condition the company s results of operations and financial condition can be affected by numerous factors  many of which are beyond its control and could cause future results of operations to differ materially from historical results 
the following is a discussion of certain of these factors 
economic conditions 
because its core business is providing local electric utility services  the company s operating results are significantly influenced by the strength of hawaii s economy  which in turn is influenced by economic conditions in the mainland us particularly california and asia particularly japan as a result of the impact of those conditions on tourism 
see results of operations economic conditions 
competition 
the electric utility industry is competitive and the company s success in meeting competition will continue to have a direct impact on the company s financial performance 
the generation sector of the electric utility industry has become increasingly competitive in hawaii 
although competition in the generation sector in hawaii has been moderated by the scarcity of generation sites  various permitting processes and lack of interconnections to other electric utilities  several independent power producers ipps have established power purchase agreements with the company  and customer self generation  with or without cogeneration  is a continuing competitive factor 
recent developments involving distributed generation 
historically  heco  helco and meco have been able to compete by offering customers economic alternatives that  among other things  employ energy efficient electrotechnologies such as the heat pump water heater 
however  the number of customer self generation projects that are being proposed or installed in hawaii  particularly those involving chp systems  is growing 
chp systems are a form of distributed generation dg  and produce electricity and thermal energy from gas  propane or diesel fired engines 
in hawaii  the thermal energy generally is used to heat water and  through an absorption chiller  drive an air conditioning system 
the electric energy generated by these systems is usually lower in output than the customer s 
table of contents load  which results in continued connection to the utility grid to make up the difference in electricity demand and to provide back up electricity 
the company has initiated several demonstration projects and other activities  including a small chp demonstration project on maui  to provide on going evaluation of dg 
the company also has made a limited number of proposals to customers  subject to puc review and approval  to install and operate utility owned chp systems at the customers sites 
incremental generation from such customer sited chp systems  and other dg  is expected to complement traditional central station power  as part of the company s plans to serve their forecast load growth 
to facilitate the offering of chp systems  the company signed a teaming agreement  in early  with a manufacturer of packaged chp systems  but the teaming agreement does not commit the company to make any chp system purchases 
in july  three vendors of dg chp equipment and services proposed  in an informal complaint to the puc  that the puc open a proceeding to investigate the company s provision of chp services and the teaming agreement with another vendor  and to issue rules or orders to govern the terms and conditions under which the company will be permitted to engage in utility owned dg at individual customers sites 
in august  the company responded to the informal complaint  and to information requests from the puc on the chp demonstration project and teaming agreement 
in october  the puc opened an investigative docket to determine the potential benefits and impact of dg on hawaii s electric distribution systems and markets and to develop policies and a framework for dg projects deployed in hawaii 
the puc also plans to address issues raised in the informal complaint filed by the three vendors of dg chp equipment 
in march  the puc issued an order which granted motions by several parties to intervene or participate without intervention in the dg docket 
in its order  the puc also ordered the parties and participants to meet to formulate for puc approval by april   the issues  procedures  schedule and the degree of participation by the participants 
in october  the company filed an application for approval of a chp tariff  under which it would provide chp services to eligible commercial customers 
under the tariff  the company would own  operate and maintain customer sited  packaged chp systems and certain ancillary equipment pursuant to a standard form of contract with the customer 
in march  the puc issued an order  in which it suspended the chp tariff application until  at a minimum  the matters in the investigative docket on dg have been addressed 
pending completion of the dg docket and approval of a tariff in the chp application  the company plans to request approval for individual chp projects 
competition docket and related proceedings 
in  the puc instituted a proceeding to identify and examine the issues surrounding electric competition and to determine the impact of competition on the electric utility infrastructure in hawaii 
several of the parties submitted final statements of position to the puc in heco s position in the proceeding was that retail competition is not feasible in hawaii  but that some of the benefits of competition could be achieved through competitive bidding for new generation  performance based rate making pbr and innovative pricing provisions 
the other parties to the proceeding advanced numerous other proposals 
in may  the puc approved heco s standard form contract for customer retention that allows heco to provide a rate option for customers who would otherwise reduce their energy use from heco s system by using energy from a nonutility generator 
based on heco s current rates  the standard form contract provides a and an discount on base energy rates for qualifying large power and general service demand customers  respectively 
in march  the puc approved a similar standard form contract for helco which  based on helco s current rates  provides a discount on base energy rates for qualifying large power and general service demand customers 
in december  heco  helco and meco filed an application with the puc seeking permission to implement pbr in future rate cases 
in early  the puc dismissed the pbr proposal without prejudice  indicating it declined at that time to change its current cost of service rate of return methodology for determining electric utility rates 
in january  the puc submitted to the legislature a status report on its investigation of competition 
the report stated that competitive bidding for new power supplies ie  wholesale generation competition is a logical first step to encourage competition in hawaii s electric industry and that the puc plans to proceed with an examination of the feasibility of competitive bidding and to review specific policies to encourage renewable energy resources in the power generation mix 
the report stated that further steps by the puc will involve the development of specific 
table of contents policies to encourage wholesale competition and the continuing examination of other areas suitable for the development of competition 
in october  the puc closed the competition proceeding instituted in the puc found that developments in other states indicate that  at best  implementation of retail access would be premature  and determined that no action will be taken to implement retail electric competition in hawaii at this time 
the puc concluded that projections of any potential benefits of restructuring hawaii s electric industry are too speculative and that it has not been sufficiently demonstrated that all consumers in hawaii would continue to receive adequate  safe  reliable  and efficient energy services at fair and reasonable prices under a restructured market at this time 
the puc indicated it will take a cautious approach to restructuring and will continue to monitor restructuring experiences in other states and at the federal level before proceeding with any major restructuring in hawaii 
the puc determined that it was in the public interest to work within the current regulatory system to strive to improve efficiency within the electric industry  and opened investigative dockets on competitive bidding and dg to move toward a more competitive electric industry environment under cost based regulation 
the stated purpose of the competitive bidding investigation is to evaluate competitive bidding as a mechanism for acquiring or building new generating capacity in hawaii 
the puc stated it would consider related filings on a case by case basis pending completion of the docket 
the puc has made the electric utilities in hawaii and the consumer advocate parties to the new proceedings 
motions to intervene or participate were filed by parties in the competitive bidding investigative docket 
management cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these proceedings 
us capital markets and interest rate environment 
changes in the us capital markets can have significant effects on the company 
for example  the company estimates that consolidated retirement benefits expense  net of amounts capitalized and income taxes  will be million in as compared to million in  and that the company s contributions to the retirement benefit plans will be million in as compared to million in  partly as a result of the performance of hei s retirement benefit plans assets 
see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
technological developments 
new technological developments eg  the commercial development of fuel cells or distributed generation may impact the company s future competitive position  results of operations and financial condition 
limited insurance 
in the ordinary course of business  the company purchases insurance coverages eg  property and liability coverages to protect itself against loss of or damage to its properties and against claims made by third parties and employees for property damage or personal injuries 
however  the protection provided by such insurance is limited in significant respects and  in some instances  the company has no coverage 
for example  the company s overhead and underground transmission and distribution systems with the exception of substation buildings and contents have a replacement value roughly estimated at billion and are uninsured because the amount of transmission and distribution system insurance available is limited and the premiums are cost prohibitive 
similarly  the company has no business interruption insurance as the premiums for such insurance would be cost prohibitive  particularly since the utilities are not interconnected to other systems 
if a hurricane or other uninsured catastrophic natural disaster should occur  and the puc does not allow the company to recover from ratepayers restoration costs and revenues lost from business interruption  the company s results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely impacted 
also  certain of the company s insurance has substantial deductibles or has limits on the maximum amounts that may be recovered 
insurers have also introduced new exclusions or limitations of coverage for claims related to certain perils including  but not limited to  mold and terrorism 
if a series of losses occurred  such as from a series of lawsuits in the ordinary course of business each of which were subject to the deductible amount  or if the maximum limit of the available insurance were substantially exceeded  the company could incur losses in amounts that would have a material adverse effect on its results of operations and financial condition 
environmental matters 
heco and its subsidiaries are subject to environmental laws and regulations that regulate the operation of existing facilities  the construction and operation of new facilities and the proper cleanup and disposal of hazardous waste and toxic substances 
these laws and regulations  among other things  require that certain environmental permits be obtained as a condition to constructing or operating certain facilities  and obtaining such permits can entail significant expense and cause substantial construction delays 
also  these laws and regulations 
table of contents may be amended from time to time  including amendments that increase the burden and expense of compliance 
management believes that the recovery through rates of most  if not all  of any costs incurred by heco and its subsidiaries in complying with environmental requirements would be allowed by the puc 
the entire electric utility industry is affected by the amendments to the clean air act  recent changes to the national ambient air quality standard naaqs for ozone  and adoption of a naaqs for fine particulate matter 
possible changes to the federal new source review permitting regulations  as well as new regulatory programs  if enacted  regarding global warming and mandating further reductions of certain air emissions will also pose challenges for the industry 
if the clear skies bill is adopted as currently proposed  heco  and to a lesser extent  its subsidiaries  will likely incur significant capital and operations and maintenance costs beginning one to two years after enactment 
heco  helco and meco  like other utilities  periodically identify leaking petroleum containing equipment such as underground storage tanks  piping and transformers 
the electric utilities report releases from such equipment when and as required by applicable law and address impacts due to the releases in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements 
the honolulu harbor environmental investigation  described in note in heco s notes to consolidated financial statements  is an ongoing environmental investigation 
although this investigation is expected to entail significant expense over the next several years  management does not believe  based on information available to the company at this time  that the costs of this investigation or any other contingent liabilities relating to environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on the company 
however  there can be no assurance that a significant environmental liability will not be incurred by the company  including with respect to the honolulu harbor environmental investigation 
regulation of electric utility rates 
the puc has broad discretion in its regulation of the rates charged by heco  helco and meco and in other matters 
any adverse d o by the puc concerning the level or method of determining electric utility rates  the authorized returns on equity or other matters  or any prolonged delay in rendering a d o in a rate or other proceeding  could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
upon a showing of probable entitlement  the puc is required to issue an interim d o in a rate case within months from the date of filing a completed application if the evidentiary hearing is completed subject to extension for days if the evidentiary hearing is not completed 
there is no time limit for rendering a final d o 
interim rate increases are subject to refund with interest  pending the final outcome of the case 
at december   heco and its subsidiaries had recognized million of revenues with respect to interim orders regarding certain integrated resource planning costs  which revenues are subject to refund  with interest  to the extent they exceed the amounts allowed in final orders 
management cannot predict with certainty when d os in future rate cases will be rendered or the amount of any interim or final rate increase that may be granted 
there are no rate cases pending at this time 
heco  however  has committed to file a rate increase application in the second half of  using a test year 
the rate schedules of heco  helco and meco include energy cost adjustment clauses under which electric rates charged to customers are automatically adjusted for changes in the weighted average price paid for fuel oil and certain components of purchased power  and the relative amounts of company generated power and purchased power 
in puc decisions approving the electric utilities fuel supply contracts  the puc noted that  in light of the length of the fuel supply contracts and the relative stability of fuel prices  the need for continued use of energy cost adjustment clauses would be the subject of investigation in a generic docket or in a future rate case 
the company believes that the energy cost adjustment clauses continue to be necessary 
these clauses were continued in the most recent helco and meco rate cases final d o s issued in february and april  respectively 
consultants periodically conduct depreciation studies for the company to determine whether the existing approved rates and methods used to calculate depreciation accruals are appropriate for the production  transmission  distribution and general plant accounts 
if it is determined that the existing rates and methods are no longer appropriate  changes to those rates are recommended as part of the study 
in october  heco filed an application with the puc for approval to change its depreciation rates and to change to vintage amortization accounting for selected plant accounts  which changes would have amounted to an approximate million  or  increase in depreciation expense based on a study of depreciation expense for in its application  heco requested that the effective date of the proposed changes coincide with the effective date of the rates established in heco s next rate case proceeding so that heco s financial results would not be impacted by the depreciation rates 
table of contents and method ultimately approved by the puc 
in march  heco and the consumer advocate reached a settlement agreement in this application  subject to puc approval 
see previous section called recent rate requests 
fuel oil and purchased power 
heco  helco and meco rely on fuel oil suppliers and independent power producers to deliver fuel oil and power  respectively 
the company estimates that of the net energy generated and purchased in will be generated from the burning of oil 
purchased kwhs provided approximately of the total net energy generated and purchased in compared to in and in failure by the company s oil suppliers to provide fuel pursuant to existing supply contracts  or failure by a major independent power producer to deliver the firm capacity anticipated in its power purchase agreement  could interrupt the ability of the company to deliver electricity  thereby materially adversely affecting the company s results of operations and financial condition 
heco  however  maintains an inventory of fuel oil in excess of one month s supply  and helco and meco maintain approximately a one month s supply of both medium sulfur fuel oil and diesel fuel 
the company s major sources of oil  through their suppliers  are in alaska  indonesia and the far east 
some  but not all  of the company s power purchase agreements require that the independent power producers maintain minimum fuel inventory levels and all of the firm capacity power purchase agreements include provisions imposing substantial penalties for failure to produce the firm capacity anticipated by those agreements 
other regulatory and permitting contingencies 
many public utility projects require puc approval and various permits eg  environmental and land use permits from other agencies 
delays in obtaining puc approval or permits can result in increased costs 
if a project does not proceed or if the puc disallows costs of the project  the project costs may need to be written off in amounts that could have a material adverse effect on the company 
two major capital improvement utility projects  the keahole project and the east oahu transmission project  have encountered opposition and the keahole project has been seriously delayed although this project is now scheduled for completion during 
see note in heco s notes to consolidated financial statements 
material estimates and critical accounting policies in preparing the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period reported 
management reviews these estimates and assumptions periodically and reflects the effect of revisions in the period that they are determined to be necessary 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates 
material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change in the case of the company include the amounts reported for utility plant  pension and other postretirement benefit obligations  contingencies and litigation  income taxes  regulatory assets and liabilities  and revenues 
in accordance with sec release no 
 cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies  management has identified the following accounting policies to be the most critical to the company s financial statements that is  management believes that these policies are both the most important to the portrayal of the company s results of operations and financial condition  and currently require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
management has reviewed the material estimates and critical accounting policies with the heco audit committee 
for additional discussion of the company s accounting policies  see note in heco s notes to consolidated financial statements 
utility plant 
utility plant is reported at cost 
self constructed utility plant includes engineering  supervision  and administrative and general costs  and an allowance for the cost of funds used during the construction period 
these costs are recorded in construction in progress and are transferred to utility plant when construction is completed and the facilities are either placed in service or become useful for public utility purposes 
upon the retirement of utility plant  no gain or loss is recognized 
the cost of the utility plant retired is charged to accumulated depreciation 
amounts collected from customers for cost of removal expected to exceed salvage value in the future are included in regulatory liabilities 
management believes that the puc will allow recovery of utility plant in its electric rates 
if the puc does not allow recovery of any such costs  the company would be required to write off the disallowed costs at that time 
see the 
table of contents discussion in note in heco s notes to consolidated financial statements concerning costs recorded in construction in progress for ct and ct at keahole and the proposed east oahu transmission project 
pension and other postretirement benefits obligations 
pension and other postretirement benefit collectively  retirement benefits costs returns are charged credited primarily to expense and utility plant 
the company s reported costs of providing retirement benefits described in note in heco s notes to consolidated financial statements are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience 
for example  pension and other postretirement benefit costs are impacted by actual employee demographics including age and compensation levels  the level of contributions to the plans and earnings on plan assets 
changes made to the provisions of the plans may also impact current and future costs 
no changes were made to the retirement benefit plans provisions in  and that have had a significant impact on recorded retirement benefit plan amounts 
costs may also be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions  including anticipated rates of return on plan assets and the discount rates used 
as a result of the factors listed above  significant portions of pension and other postretirement benefit costs recorded in any period do not reflect the actual benefits provided to plan participants 
for and  the company recorded other postretirement benefit expense  net of amounts capitalized  of approximately million and million  respectively  in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions 
actual payments of such benefits made to retirees during and were million and million  respectively 
in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  changes in pension obligations associated with the factors noted above may not be immediately recognized as pension costs on the income statement  but generally are recognized in future years over the remaining average service period of plan participants 
for and  the company recorded non cash pension expense income  net of amounts capitalized  of approximately million and million  respectively  and paid pension benefits of million and million  respectively 
the assumptions used by management in making benefit and funding calculations are based on current economic conditions 
changes in economic conditions will impact the underlying assumptions in determining retirement benefit costs on a prospective basis 
in selecting an assumed discount rate  the company benchmarks its discount rate assumption to the moody s year aa corporate bond composite index 
in selecting an assumed rate of return on plan assets  the company considers economic forecasts for the types of investments held by the plan and the past performance of plan assets 
as presented in note in heco s notes to consolidated financial statements  the company has revised its discount rate as of december  compared to december  the change did not have an impact on reported costs in  however  for future years  this change will have a significant impact 
based upon the revised discount rate decreased basis points to and plan assets as of december   the company estimates that retirement benefits expense  net of amounts capitalized and income taxes  will be million in as compared to million in in determining the retirement benefit costs  assumptions can change from period to period  and such changes could result in material changes to these estimated amounts 
the company s plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income investments 
fluctuations in actual equity market returns as well as changes in general interest rates may result in increased or decreased retirement benefit costs and contributions in future periods 
the following tables reflect the sensitivities of the projected benefit obligation pbo and accumulated postretirement benefit obligation apbo as of december   and net income associated with a change in certain actuarial assumptions by the indicated basis points and constitute forward looking statements 
each sensitivity below reflects an evaluation of the change based solely on a change in that assumption as well as a related change in the contributions to the applicable retirement benefits plan

contingencies and litigation 
the company is subject to proceedings  lawsuits and other claims  including proceedings under laws and government regulations related to environmental matters 
management assesses the likelihood of any adverse judgments in or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of reserves required  if any  for these contingencies is based on a careful analysis of each individual issue often with the assistance of outside counsel 
the required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach in dealing with these matters  such as a change in settlement strategy 
in general  environmental contamination treatment costs are charged to expense  unless it is probable that the puc would allow such costs to be recovered in future rates  in which case such costs would be capitalized as regulatory assets 
also  environmental costs are capitalized if the costs extend the life  increase the capacity  or improve the safety or efficiency of property  the costs mitigate or prevent future environmental contamination  or the costs are incurred in preparing the property for sale 
see environmental regulation in note in heco s notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of the honolulu harbor investigation 
income taxes 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are established for the temporary differences between the financial reporting bases and the tax bases of the company s assets and liabilities at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when such deferred tax assets or liabilities are realized or settled 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
management periodically evaluates its potential exposures from tax positions taken that have or could be challenged by taxing authorities 
these potential exposures result because taxing authorities may take positions that differ from those taken by management in the interpretation and application of statutes  regulations and rules 
management considers the possibility of alternative outcomes based upon past experience  previous actions by taxing authorities eg  actions taken in other jurisdictions and advice from tax experts 
management believes that the company s provision for tax contingencies is reasonable 
however  the ultimate resolution of tax treatments disputed by governmental authorities may adversely affect the company s current and deferred income tax amounts 
regulatory assets and liabilities 
heco  helco and meco are regulated by the puc 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation  the company s financial statements reflect assets  liabilities  revenues and costs based on current cost based rate making regulations 
the actions of regulators can affect the timing of recognition of revenues  expenses  assets and liabilities 
regulatory assets represent incurred costs that have been deferred because they are probable of future recovery in customer rates 
regulatory liabilities represent amounts collected from customers for costs that are expected to be 
table of contents incurred in the future 
historically  the company  like most electric utilities  had included net salvage ie  the cost of removal in excess of salvage value in accumulated depreciation 
recently  however  the securities and exchange commission provided guidance indicating that net salvage meets the sfas no 
definition of a regulatory liability 
accordingly  the company reclassified its accumulated net salvage as of december  and all prior periods presented from accumulated depreciation to regulatory liabilities 
as of december   regulatory liabilities  net of regulatory assets  amounted to million 
regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities are itemized in note in heco s notes to consolidated financial statements 
management continually assesses whether the regulatory assets are probable of future recovery by considering factors such as changes in the applicable regulatory environment 
because current rates include the recovery of regulatory assets existing as of the last rate case and rates in effect allow the utilities to earn a reasonable rate of return  management believes the regulatory assets as of december  are probable of recovery 
this determination assumes continuation of the current political and regulatory climate in hawaii  and is subject to change in the future 
management believes its operations currently satisfy the sfas no 
criteria 
if events or circumstances should change so that those criteria are no longer satisfied  the company expects that the regulatory liabilities  net of regulatory assets  would be credited to income 
in the event of unforeseen regulatory actions or other circumstances  however  management believes that a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial position may result if regulatory assets have to be charged to expense without an offsetting credit from regulatory liabilities 
revenues 
revenues are based on rates authorized by the puc and include revenues applicable to energy consumed in the accounting period but not yet billed to the customers 
at december   revenues applicable to energy consumed  but not yet billed to the customers  amounted to million 
revenue amounts recorded pursuant to a puc interim order are subject to refund  with interest  pending a final order 
at december   heco and its subsidiaries had recognized million of revenues with respect to interim orders regarding certain integrated resource planning costs incurred since  which revenues are subject to refund  with interest  to the extent they exceed the amounts allowed in final orders 
if a refund were required  the revenues to be refunded would be immediately reversed on the income statement 
the consumer advocate has objected to the recovery of million before interest of the million of integrated resource planning costs incurred from through  and the puc s decision is pending on this matter 
the rate schedules of heco  helco and meco include energy cost adjustment clauses under which electric rates are adjusted for changes in the weighted average price paid for fuel oil and certain components of purchased power  and the relative amounts of company generated power and purchased power 
if the energy cost adjustment clauses were discontinued  the company s results of operations could fluctuate significantly as a result of increases and decreases in fuel oil and purchased energy prices 
in puc decisions approving the electric utilities fuel supply contracts  the puc noted that  in light of the length of the fuel supply contracts and the relative stability of fuel prices  the need for continued use of energy cost adjustment clauses would be the subject of investigation in a generic docket or in a future rate case 
the company believes that the energy cost adjustment clauses continue to be necessary and these clauses were continued in the and final d os in helco s and meco s most recent rate cases 
consolidation of variable interest entities vies 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued revised fasb interpretation no 
fin no 
r  consolidation of variable interest entities  which addresses how a business enterprise should evaluate whether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity through means other than voting rights and accordingly should consolidate the entity 
the company currently anticipates that application of fin no 
r will result in a deconsolidation of its subsidary trusts 
the company is evaluating the impact of applying fin no 
r in the first quarter of to its relationships with ipps from whom it purchases power and has not yet completed this analysis 
a possible outcome of the analysis  however  is that heco or its subsidiaries  as applicable may be found to meet the definition of a primary beneficiary of the ipps  which finding may result in the consolidation of the ipps in the company s consolidated financial statements 
the consolidation of ipps would have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements  including the recognition of a significant amount of assets and liabilities
