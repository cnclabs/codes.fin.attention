com  which closed on march   august   may  and november   respectively 
the overall revenue increase was partially offset by lower call volumes in certain product lines in the communication services segment 
in addition  pricing pressures and concessions continue in both the communication services and conferencing services segments 
during the year ended december   our largest clients represented of revenues compared to and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this reduced concentration is due to the intercall acquisition

an important utilization measurement used by the communication services segment for agent based revenue is the revenue per workstation benchmark 
for the year ended december   the revenue per workstation was  compared to  in the decline in this measurement reflects the effects of the pricing pressures noted above and reduced capacity utilization 
conferencing services revenue for was million

this is consistent with a recent trend of declining rates offset by increasing minute volumes

cost of services increased million  or  in to million  from million for the comparable period of as a percentage of revenue  cost of services decreased to for  compared to  for the comparable periods in this reduction was primarily due to the acquisition of intercall  which historically has had a lower percentage of direct costs to revenue than our communication services segment 
communication services costs of services decreased million  or  in to million  from million for the comparable period of as a percentage of revenue  communication services cost of services decreased to for  compared to for the comparable periods in the decrease in cost of services as a percentage of revenue can be attributed primarily to continued control of variable labor costs  a greater percentage of call volumes of certain product lines which traditionally have a lower direct cost as a percent of revenue than other communication services operations and the exiting of the services provided by the communication services segment during which had higher direct costs as a percentage of revenue than other communication services product offerings 
in  the communication services segment incurred a million charge related to the sale of one contact center and closing of three other contact centers 
similarly  in  the communication services segment incurred a million charge related to the closing of several contact centers 
currently  the communications services segment does not anticipate the need to close any further significant contact centers in however  if market conditions dictate further reductions in capacity  the communication service s segment would revisit this decision

other income expense 
other income expense includes sub lease rental income  interest income from short term investments and interest expense from short term and long term obligations

the following discussion reflects our prior organization as a single segment 
revenue 
revenues increased million  or  to million in from million in the increase in revenue included million of revenue derived from new clients and million derived from the acquisitions of tel mark sales  dakotah direct and attention 
the overall revenue increase was partially offset by lower call volumes in agent based services  as well as the wind down of services in automated services 
in addition  pricing concessions resulting from various market changes in agent based services contributed to a decline in the rate of revenue growth 
during the year ended december   we provided service to over clients 
eighty percent of our revenue was generated by clients in compared to clients during we had one customer  at t  who accounted for of total revenue for the year ended december  and and of total revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively 
these percentages do not include the former wireless and broadband units of at t  which were divested from at t in cost of services 
cost of services increased million  or  to million in  up from million for the comparable period of during  cost of services as a percentage of revenue decreased to  compared to for the comparable period in the decrease in cost of services as a percentage of revenue can be attributed primarily to continued control of variable labor costs  a greater percentage of automated and in bound call volumes which traditionally have a lower direct cost as a percent of revenue than our other operations and the significant reduction in call volumes which have higher direct costs as a percentage of revenue than our other operations 
lower telecommunication costs due to lower service rates negotiated with our primary telecommunications vendor also contributed to lower cost of services in cost of services includes charge backs relating to service revenue of approximately million in selling  general and administrative expenses 
sg a expenses increased by million  or  to million in from million for the comparable period of the increase in sg a is due primarily to an increase in bad debt expense of million  increased depreciation and amortization of 
table of contents million and sg a expenses associated with our three acquisitions of million 
during the year ended december   we wrote off million in accounts and notes receivable  all of which had been reserved for in the allowance for doubtful accounts 
the increase in depreciation is due to the overall increase in property and equipment primarily due to the purchase of interactive voice response ports during the twelve months ended december  as a percentage of revenue  sg a expenses increased to in compared to for the comparable period of operating income 
operating income decreased by million  or  to million in down from million for the comparable period of as a percentage of revenue  operating income decreased to in compared to for the corresponding period of due to the factors discussed above for revenue  cost of services and sg a expenses 
other income expense 
other income expense includes sub lease rental income  interest income from short term investments  interest income from customer notes receivable and interest expense from short term and long term obligations 
other income expense totaled million in compared to million for the comparable period of the increase is primarily the result of a million write down of an investment in synchrony communications  inc in september net income 
net income decreased million  or  to million in compared to million for the comparable period of diluted earnings per share were compared to for the comparable period in net income includes a provision for income tax expense at an effective rate of approximately for this compares to  for the comparable period in outlook on december   we announced our financial outlook 
in that announcement  we stated that revenue expectations for our communication services segment had been reduced by to million due to the anticipated reduction of services for a significant client 
this reduction in service is expected to begin after the end of the first quarter and transition through the end of the third quarter 
this reduction in service was the result of the client s decision to discontinue outsourcing their crm solutions 
while the magnitude of this client s decision is unusual  it is an example of the potential variability of our revenue and cash flow 
periodically we do lose clients due to a variety of reasons including competition  mergers  bankruptcies  pricing pressures and client s decision to discontinue outsourcing crm solutions 
we continue to experience pricing pressure from clients 
in response to our clients demands  we have expanded our foreign customer contact centers to take advantage of lower labor costs 
while consolidated workstation capacity declined in  three foreign customer contact centers under our management were opened in  increasing foreign capacity over 
we also opened a customer contact center in the philippines in february the market pressure to lower prices and the trend to expand foreign operations is likely to continue for the foreseeable future 
in response to these pricing pressures  we developed a home agent solution  which we began offering in early the home agent solution allows agents to work from their homes 
the home agent solution provides us access to a greater pool of potential agents and the reduced infrastructure required for this solution provides attractive pricing alternatives for our clients 
at december   we had approximately home agents  which is the equivalent of an average sized inbound contact center 
liquidity and capital resources our primary source of liquidity has been cash flow from operations  supplemented by proceeds from notes payable  capital leases and borrowings under our revolving bank line of credit 
two bank credit facilities were established in  which are described below 
the acquisition of intercall closed on may  and was funded with cash and borrowings on the two bank credit facilities 
the first facility is a million four year term loan 
the second facility is a revolving credit facility that initially had aggregate borrowing capacity of up to million 
in january  the revolving credit facility 
table of contents was amended to increase the aggregate borrowing capacity to million 
at december   million was outstanding on the revolving credit facility 
both facilities bear interest at a variable rate over a selected libor based on our leverage  which adjusts quarterly in basis point increments 
the effective annual interest rate  inclusive of debt amortization costs  on the term loan since the debt was acquired through december   was 
the weighted average contractual rate on the term loan at december  was 
the average daily outstanding balance of the revolving credit facility since the debt was acquired through december   was million 
the effective annual interest rate  inclusive of debt amortization costs  on the revolving credit facility since the debt was acquired through december   was 
the commitment fee rate on the unused revolving credit facility at december   was 
the facilities bear interest at a minimum of basis points over the selected libor and a maximum of basis points over the selected libor 
at december   the contractual interest rate was basis points over libor 
the facilities are secured by the capital stock of all our material subsidiaries 
all our obligations under the facilities are unconditionally guaranteed by all our material domestic subsidiaries 
the facilities contain various financial covenants  which include a consolidated leverage ratio of funded debt to adjusted earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda which may not exceed to and a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of adjusted ebitda to the sum of consolidated interest expense  scheduled funded debt payments  scheduled payments on acquisition earn out obligations and income taxes paid  which must exceed to both ratios are measured on a rolling four quarter basis 
we were in compliance with the financial covenants at december  on january   we amended these credit arrangements to increase the aggregate borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility to million 
this increased the unused and available portion of the revolving credit facility from million at december  to million 
net cash flow from operating activities increased million  or  to million for  compared to net cash flow from operating activities of million for the increase was due primarily to an increase in net income  depreciation and amortization and other non cash liabilities and accrued expenses 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in the provision for bad debts and accounts payable 
net cash flow used in investing activities was million for  compared to million for the comparable period of the increase in cash flow used in investing activities of million was primarily due to the acquisitions of intercall and conferencecall 
com  net of cash received of million 
we also invested million in capital expenditures in  and million in a licensing agreement 
this compares to the million we invested during the same period in the capital expenditures were financed by million of capital lease obligations and the remaining million was funded through cash flow from operations 
we did not utilize any new capital lease financing in we project our capital expenditures during to be approximately to million  primarily for new facilities  equipment and technology upgrades at existing facilities 
net cash flow from financing activities was million for  compared to net cash flow used in financing activities of million for the comparable period of during  net cash flow from financing activities consisted primarily of proceeds of million from the term loan and net proceeds of million from the revolving credit facilities noted above 
the cash flow from financing activities was partially offset by payments of debt  and capital lease obligations as well as debt issuance costs for the term loan and revolving credit facilities 
these payments were million during compared to million for the comparable period of proceeds from our stock based employee benefit programs  including related tax benefits  were million during and million during days sales outstanding  a key performance indicator we utilize to monitor the accounts receivable average collection period and assess overall collection risk was days at december   and ranged from to days during the year 
at december   the days sales outstanding was also days and ranged from to days during the year 

table of contents contractual obligations as described in financial statements and supplementary data  we have contractual obligations that may affect our financial condition 
however  based on management s assessment of the underlying provisions and circumstances of our material contractual obligations  there is no known trend  demand  commitment  event or uncertainty that is reasonably likely to occur which would have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december  dollars in thousands contractual less than after obligations total year years years years long term debt revolving credit facility operating leases purchase obligations acquisition earnout commitments total contractual cash obligations represents future obligations for capital and expense projects that are in progress or are committed 
represents the minimum amounts payable 
if all earnout conditions were fully satisfied  an additional million would be payable over the next years 
capital expenditures our operations continue to require significant capital expenditures for technology  capacity expansion and upgrades 
capital expenditures were million for the year ended december   which were entirely funded through operations 
capital expenditures were million for the year ended december   in which  million of these expenditures were funded from operations and the remaining million of expenditures were financed using capital leases 
capital expenditures for the year ended december  consisted primarily of equipment purchases  the cost of a new call center in canada and upgrades at existing facilities 
we also invested million in a licensing agreement in we currently project our capital expenditures for to be approximately to million primarily for capacity expansion and upgrades at existing facilities and the addition of one customer contact center in the first half of we believe that the cash flows from operations  together with existing cash and cash equivalents  financing through capital or operating leases  and available borrowings under our credit facilities will be adequate to meet its capital requirements for at least the next months 
our two credit facilities  discussed above  include covenants which allow us the flexibility to issue additional indebtedness that is pari passu with or subordinated to the existing credit facilities in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed million  allow us to incur capital lease indebtedness in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed million and allow us to incur accounts receivable securitization indebtedness in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed million without requesting a waiver from the lender 
we may pledge additional property or assets or assets any of our subsidiaries  which are not already pledged as collateral securing existing credit facilities or any of our affiliates 
we or any of our affiliates may be required to guarantee any existing or additional credit facilities 
off balance sheet arrangements during the second quarter of  we completed a transaction whereby a development company acquired the debt and equity holdings of the synthetic lease special purpose trust 
the special purpose trust was terminated and the development company became the owner of the two buildings 
we entered into a lease of the buildings from this development company 
the development company is not a variable interest entity as defined by financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of 
table of contents variable interest entities an interpretation of arb no 
fin 
in addition  the development company partially utilized recourse capital to fund the acquisition of the buildings 
the terms of the lease call for an initial lease term of five years with three renewal options of five years each subject to mutual agreement of the parties 
the lease facility bears interest at a variable rate over a selected libor  which resulted in an annual effective interest rate of at december  we may  at any time  elect to exercise a purchase option of approximately million for the san antonio building and approximately million for the omaha building 
if we elect not to purchase either building or renew either lease  the buildings would be returned to the lessee for remarketing 
we have guaranteed a residual value of to the lessor upon the sale of each building 
in december  we established  through attention  a million revolving financing facility with a third party specialty lender and capitalized a consolidated special purpose entity spe for the sole purpose of purchasing defaulted accounts receivable portfolios 
these assets will be purchased by attention  transferred to the spe and sold to a non consolidated special purpose entity qspe 
the qspe will be funded through an interest bearing note issued to the third party specialty lender for of each purchase and a investment from us for each purchase 
the note to the third party lender is collateralized by the assets of the qspe 
in addition  we pledged our interest in the qspe to the third party lender to the extent cash flows generated by the portfolios cannot repay amounts owed for interest and principle due to the third party lender 
attention will perform collection services on the receivable portfolio for a fee  recognized when earned 
the spe and the third party lender will also be entitled to a portion of the profits of the qspe to the extent cash flows from collections are greater than amounts owed by the qspe  after repayment of all servicing fees 
on december   the spe has a note receivable from the qspe for  the note receivable will be evaluated for collectibility on a quarterly basis 
also  on december   million of the million revolving financing facility had been utilized 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation fin no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities revised but as qspe s are excluded from the scope of fin  we do not expect this interpretation to affect the way we account for this arrangement 
we account for this transaction as a sale  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishment of liabilities  and recognize a servicing asset or liability at the time of sale  as necessary  based on the fair value of the servicing fee for each portfolio 
we have no ownership interest in the third party lender 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our results of operations 
however  there can be no assurance that our business will not be affected by inflation in the future 
critical accounting policies the process of preparing financial statements requires the use of estimates on the part of management 
the estimates used by management are based on our historical experiences combined with management s understanding of current facts and circumstances 
certain of our accounting policies are considered critical as they are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require significant or complex judgment on the part of management 
we believe the following represent our critical accounting policies as contemplated by financial reporting release no 
 cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies 
revenue recognition 
the communication services segment recognizes revenue for customer initiated  agent based services  including order processing  customer acquisition  customer retention and customer care in the month that calls are answered by an agent based on the number of calls and or minutes received and processed on behalf of clients 
for agent based services that we initiate including order processing  customer acquisition  customer retention and customer care  revenue is recognized on an hourly basis or on a success rate basis in the month that we place calls to consumers on behalf of clients 
revenue for accounts receivable 
table of contents management services is recognized in the month collection payments are received based upon a percentage of cash collected or other agreed upon contractual parameters 
automated services revenue is recognized in the month that the calls are received or sent by automated voice response units and is billed based on call duration 
the conferencing services segment recognizes revenue when services are provided and generally consists of per minute charges 
revenues are reported net of any volume or special discounts 
allowance for doubtful accounts and notes receivable 
our allowance for doubtful accounts reflects reserves for receivables to reduce receivables to amounts expected to be collected 
management uses significant judgment in estimating uncollectible amounts 
in estimating uncollectible amounts  management considers factors such as overall economic conditions  industry specific economic conditions  historical customer performance and anticipated customer performance 
while management believes the processes effectively address our exposure to doubtful accounts  changes in the economy  industry or specific customer conditions may require adjustment to the allowance for doubtful accounts recorded 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
as a result of five acquisitions made during and  our recorded goodwill as of december  was million and the recorded value of other intangible assets as of december  was million 
two matters arise with respect to these assets that require significant management estimates and judgment the valuation in connection with the initial purchase price allocation and the ongoing evaluation of goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment 
in connection with these acquisitions  a third party valuation was performed to determine the purchase price allocation between goodwill and other intangible assets 
the purchase price allocation process requires estimates and judgments as to certain expectations and business strategies 
if the actual results differ from the assumptions and judgments made  the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements could result in a possible impairment of the intangible assets and goodwill or require acceleration in amortization expense 
in addition  sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  requires that goodwill be tested annually using a two step process 
the first step is to identify a potential impairment 
the second step measures the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
any changes in key assumptions about the businesses and their prospects  or changes in market conditions or other externalities  could result in an impairment charge and such a charge could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
stock options 
our employees are periodically granted stock options by the compensation committee of the board of directors 
as allowed under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america gaap  we do not record any compensation expense on the income statement with respect to options granted to employees 
alternatively  under gaap  we could have recorded a compensation expense based on the fair value of employee stock options 
as described in note in the consolidated financial statements  had we recorded a fair value based compensation expense for stock options  diluted earnings per share would have been to less than what we reported for  and income taxes 
we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities in the multiple taxing jurisdictions which we operate within 
future tax law changes may require adjustment to our existing tax assets and liabilities 
risk factors an investment in our common stock involves risks 
you should carefully consider the following risks before making an investment decision 
if any of these risks occurs  our business  financial condition  liquidity and results of operations could be seriously harmed  in which case the price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or a part of your investment 
we face risks in connection with completed or potential acquisitions 
our growth has been enhanced through acquisitions of other businesses 
we continue to pursue strategic acquisitions 
if we are unable to make appropriate acquisitions on reasonable terms it may be difficult for us to achieve the same level of growth as historically achieved 

table of contents in addition  when considering an acquisition  we determine whether such acquisition will allow us to achieve certain objectives including operational synergies  reduced costs and expenses  increased revenues  additional clients  increased market share  new products and capabilities 
to the extent that we are unable to achieve our planned objectives from an acquisition  this may affect our growth rate 
we are subject to extensive regulation that could limit or restrict our activities and impose financial requirements or limitations on the conduct of our business 
the united states congress  fcc  ftc and various states have promulgated and enacted rules and laws that govern the methods and processes of making and completing telephone solicitations and sales and the collection of consumer debt 
we believe that our operating procedures currently comply in all material respects with presently effective provisions of these rules and laws 
there can be no assurance  however  that we would not be subject to agency or state proceedings alleging violation of such rules and laws 
future rules and laws may require us to modify our operations or service offerings in order to effectively meet our clients service requirements  and there can be no assurance that additional regulations would not limit our activities or significantly increase the cost of regulatory compliance 
for further discussion of regulatory issues  see item business government regulations 
even if we comply with the rules and laws  the restrictions imposed by such regulations may generally adversely impact our business 
our clients may reduce the volume of business they outsource 
regulations regarding the use of technology  such as restrictions on automated dialers or the required transmittal of caller identification information  may further reduce the efficiency or effectiveness of our operations 
however  we cannot predict the impact state and federal regulations may have on our business or whether such impact may adversely affect or limit our operations 
our clients are also subject to varying degrees of government regulation  particularly in the telecommunications  insurance and financial services industries 
we may be subject to a variety of enforcement or private actions for non compliance or our clients non compliance with such regulations 
there is increasing federal and state interest in privacy protection  some aspects of which could impose additional regulatory pressure on the business of our clients and  less directly  on our business 
such pressures could impact our business if it has the effect of reducing the demand for our services or exposes us to potential liability 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to compete successfully in our highly competitive industries 
we face significant competition in our markets and expect this competition will intensify 
the principal competitive factors in our industries are technological expertise  service quality  sales and marketing skills  the ability to develop and implement customized products and services and the cost of services 
in addition  we believe there has been an industry trend to move agent based operations towards offshore sites 
such movement could result in excess capacity in the united states where most of our current capacity exists 
the trend towards international expansion by foreign and domestic competitors and continuous technological changes may bring new and different competitors into our markets and may erode profits because of reduced prices 
our competitors products and services and pricing practices  as well as the timing and circumstances of the entry of additional competitors into our markets may harm our business 
our communication services segment s business and growth depends in large part on the industry trend toward outsourcing crm solutions and services 
there can be no assurance that this trend will continue  as organizations may elect to perform such services themselves 
a significant change in this trend could seriously harm our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
additionally  there can be no assurance that our cross selling efforts will cause clients to purchase additional services from us or adopt a single source outsourcing approach 
our operating results may be harmed if we are unable to maximize our call center capacity utilization 
our profitability is influenced significantly by our call center capacity utilization 
we attempt to maximize utilization 
however  we have significantly higher utilization during peak periods 
from time to time we assess the expected long term capacity utilization of our centers 
accordingly  we may  if deemed 
table of contents necessary  consolidate or close under performing centers in order to maintain or improve utilization and margins 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve or maintain optimal contact center capacity utilization 
if we lose one or more significant clients  or if the volume of calls from any such client or clients decline  or if a significant contract is not implemented in the time frame and budget anticipated  our operating results are likely to be harmed unless and until we are able to reduce expenses proportionally or successfully negotiate contracts with new clients to generate additional revenues at a comparable level 
increases in the cost of telephone and data services or significant interruptions in such services could seriously harm our business 
we depend on telephone and data service provided by various local and long distance telephone companies 
because of this dependence  any change to the telecommunications market that would disrupt these services or limit our ability to obtain services or favorable rates could harm our business 
we have taken steps to mitigate our exposure to the risks associated with rate fluctuations and service disruption by entering into long term contracts 
there is no obligation  however  for these vendors to renew their contracts with us or to offer the same or lower rates in the future  and such contracts are subject to termination or modification for various reasons outside of our control 
a significant increase in the cost of telephone services that is not recoverable through an increase in the price of our services  or any significant interruption in telephone services  could seriously harm our business 
our inability to continue to attract and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees could seriously harm our business 
the crm industry is very labor intensive and experiences high personnel turnover 
many of our employees receive modest hourly wages and  although we employ a significant number of full time employees  many are nevertheless employed on a part time basis 
some of our operations require specially trained employees 
growth in our business will require us to recruit and train qualified personnel at an accelerated rate from time to time 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to hire  train and retain a sufficient labor force of qualified employees 
a significant portion of our costs consists of wages to hourly workers 
an increase in hourly wages  costs of employee benefits or employment taxes could seriously harm our business 
because we have operations in countries outside of the united states  we may be subject to political  economic and other conditions affecting such countries that could result in increased operating expenses and regulation on our business 
we operate or rely upon businesses in numerous countries outside the united states 
we may expand into additional countries and regions 
there are risks inherent in conducting business internationally  including exposure to currency fluctuations  longer payment cycles  greater difficulties in accounts receivable collection  uncertainty regarding intellectual property protection  difficulties in complying with a variety of foreign laws  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  political instability and potentially adverse tax consequences 
there can be no assurance that one or more of such factors will harm our business 
the loss of one or more key clients would result in the loss of net revenues 
in  and  our largest clients represented  and of total revenue 
we had one customer  at t  who accounted for of total revenue in and and of total revenue in and  respectively 
these percentages do not include the former wireless and broadband units of at t  which at t divested in our loss of  or the failure to retain a significant amount of business from at t or any of our other significant clients could seriously harm our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
many of our contracts are cancelable by the client at any time or on short term notice  and clients may unilaterally reduce their use of our services under these contracts without penalty 
thus  our contracts with our clients do not ensure that we will generate a minimum level of revenue 

table of contents we serve clients and industries that have experienced a significant level of consolidation in recent years 
we cannot assure that additional consolidating transactions will not occur in which our clients acquire additional businesses or are acquired 
the loss of any current significant client resulting from consolidation activity could seriously harm our business 
we are exposed to the risks that third parties may violate our proprietary rights and our intellectual property rights may not be well protected in foreign countries 
third parties may infringe or misappropriate our patents  trademarks  trade names  trade secrets or other intellectual property rights  which could seriously harm our business  financial condition  operating results or cash flows 
the actions we take to protect our intellectual property may not be adequate 
litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights  protect our trade secrets or determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to prevent infringement of our intellectual property rights or misappropriation of our proprietary information 
any infringement or misappropriation could harm any competitive advantage we currently derive or may derive from our proprietary rights 
in addition  third parties may assert infringement claims against us 
any claims and any resulting litigation could subject us to significant liability for damages 
an adverse determination in any litigation of this type could require us to design around a third party s patent or to license alternative technology from another party 
in addition  litigation is time consuming and expensive to defend and could result in the diversion of our time and resources 
any claims from third parties may also result in limitations on our ability to use the intellectual property subject to these claims 
our networks are exposed to the risks of software failure 
the software that we have purchased and developed to provide our products and services may contain undetected errors 
although we generally engage in extensive testing of our software prior to introducing the software onto any of our networks and or product equipment  errors may be found in the software after the software goes into use 
any of these errors may result in partial or total failure of our networks  additional and unexpected expenses to fund further product development or to add programming personnel to complete a development project  and loss of revenue because of the inability of clients to use our service or the cancellation of services by significant customers 
our clients may be affected by rapid technological change and systems availability 
we may be unable to introduce solutions on a timely basis 
we have invested in sophisticated and specialized computer and telephone technology 
our business relies on this technology to provide customized solutions to meet our client s needs 
we anticipate that it will be necessary to continue to select  invest in and develop new and enhanced technology on a timely basis in the future in order to maintain competitiveness 
our future success will depend in part on our ability to continue to develop technology solutions which keep pace with evolving industry standards and changing client demands 
our products and services are dependent upon our ability to protect the equipment and data at our facilities against damage that may be caused by fire  power loss  technical failures  unauthorized intrusion  natural disasters  sabotage and other similar events 
despite taking a variety of precautions  we have experienced downtime in our infrastructure from time to time and we may experience downtime in the future
