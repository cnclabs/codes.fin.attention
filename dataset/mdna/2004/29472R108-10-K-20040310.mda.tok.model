critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the related disclosures 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we periodically evaluate our long lived assets  including our investments in real estate  for impairment indicators 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on factors such as operational performance  market conditions and legal factors 
future events could occur which would cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and an impairment loss is warranted 
real estate is recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation 
depreciation is computed on the straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
we use a year estimated life for buildings acquired and structural and land improvements  a ten to fifteen year estimated life for building upgrades and a three to seven year estimated life for furniture  fixtures and equipment 
expenditures for ordinary maintenance and repairs are expensed to operations as incurred and significant renovations and improvements that improve the asset and extend the useful life of the asset are capitalized over their estimated useful life 
however  the useful lives  salvage value  and customary depreciation method used for land improvements and other significant assets may significantly and materially overstate the depreciation of the underlying assets and therefore understate the net income of the company 
in addition  the financial accounting standards board fasb is currently reviewing the methods of depreciation and cost capitalization for all industries and in june issued fasb exposure draft  accounting in interim and annual financial statements for certain costs and activities related to property  plant and equipment  the implementation of which  if issued  could also have a material effect on the company s results of operations 
the valuation of financial instruments under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 disclosures about fair value of financial instruments sfas no 
and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas no 
requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the fair value of the instruments 
where possible  we base the fair values of our financial instruments  including our derivative instruments  on listed market prices and third party quotes 
where these are not available  we base our estimates on other factors relevant to the financial instrument 
certain costs  primarily legal costs  relative to our efforts to effectively change the use and operations of several properties subject to rent control see note are currently classified in other assets 
these costs  to the extent these efforts are successful  are capitalized to the extent of the established value of the revised project and included in the net investment in real estate for the appropriate properties see note 
to the extent these efforts are not successful  these costs will be expensed 
in addition  we capitalize certain costs  primarily legal costs  related to entering into lease agreements which govern the terms under which we may enter into leases with individual tenants and which are expensed over the term of the lease agreement 
in  due to the successful settlement of litigation related to one property  deanza santa cruz  we reclassified approximately million of these costs to land improvements and will depreciate these costs over years in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin 
the objective of fin is to provide guidance on how to identify a variable interest entity vie and determine when the assets  liabilities  non controlling interests  and results of operations of a vie need to be included in the company s consolidated financial statements 
a company that holds variable interests in an entity will need to consolidate such entity if the company absorbs a majority of the vie s expected losses or receive a majority of the entity s expected residual returns if they occur  or both 
the provisions of fin apply to the company upon initial involvement with the respective entity for transactions created after january  the adoption of fin in had no effect on the company in the provisions of fin and related revised interpretations apply no later than the end of the first interim reporting period ending march  march  for entities created before february  the company is currently evaluating and assessing the impact of fin and the related revised interpretations on entities created before february  critical accounting policies and estimates prior to january  we accounted for our stock compensation in accordance with apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  based upon the intrinsic value method 
this method results in no compensation expense for options issued with an exercise price equal to or exceeding the market value of the common shares on the date of grant 
effective january   we elected to account for our stock based compensation in accordance with sfas no 
and its amendment sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  which will result in compensation expense being recorded based on the fair value of the stock options and other equity awards issued 
sfas provides three possible transition methods for changing to the fair value method 
we have elected to use the modified prospective method 
this method requires that we recognize stock based employee compensation cost from the beginning of the fiscal year in which the recognition provisions are first applied as if the fair value method had been used to account for all employee awards granted  or settled  in fiscal years beginning after december  the following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share as if the fair value method was applied to all outstanding and unvested awards in each period presented amounts in thousands  except per share data net income available for common shares as reported    add stock based compensation expense included in net income as reported    deduct stock based compensation expense determined under the fair value based method for all awards

funds from operations funds from operations ffo  a non gaap financial performance measure  was redefined by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit in april  as net income computed in accordance with gaap  before allocation to minority interests  excluding gains or losses from sales of property  plus real estate depreciation and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
the company computes ffo in accordance with the nareit definition  which may differ from the methodology for calculating ffo utilized by other equity reits and  accordingly  may not be comparable to such other reits computations 
the company believes that ffo is useful to investors as a measure of the performance of an equity reit because  along with cash flows from operating activities  financing activities and investing activities  ffo provides investors an understanding of the ability of the company to incur and service debt and to make capital expenditures 
ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap and therefore should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of the company s performance or to net cash flows from operating activities as determined by gaap as a measure of liquidity and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs
