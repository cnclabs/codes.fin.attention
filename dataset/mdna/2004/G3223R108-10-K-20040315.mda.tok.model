underwriting process the company offers ceding companies full service capability  including actuarial  claims  accounting and systems support  either directly or through the broker community 
the company s capacity for both property and casualty risks allows it to underwrite entire contracts or major portions thereof that might otherwise need to be syndicated among several reinsurers 
the company s strategy is to act as lead reinsurer in many of the reinsurance treaties it underwrites 
the lead reinsurer on a treaty generally accepts one of the largest percentage shares of the treaty and is in a stronger position to negotiate price  terms and conditions than is a reinsurer that takes a smaller position 
management believes this strategy enables it to more effectively influence the terms and conditions of the treaties on which it participates 
when the company does not lead the treaty  it may still suggest changes to any aspect of the treaty 
the company may decline to participate in a treaty based upon its assessment of all relevant factors 
the company s treaty underwriting process emphasizes a team approach among the company s underwriters  actuaries and claim staff 
treaties are reviewed for compliance with the company s general underwriting standards and certain larger treaties are evaluated in part based upon actuarial analyses by the company 
the actuarial models used in such analyses are tailored in each case to the exposures and experience underlying the specific treaty and the loss experience for the risks covered by such treaties 
the company does not separately evaluate each of the individual risks assumed under its treaties 
the company does  however  generally evaluate the underwriting guidelines of its ceding companies to determine their adequacy prior to entering into a treaty 
the company  when appropriate  also conducts underwriting  operational and claim audits at the offices of ceding companies to ensure that the ceding companies operate within such guidelines 
underwriting audits focus on the quality of the underwriting staff  the selection and pricing of risks and the capability of monitoring price levels over time 
claim audits  when appropriate  are performed in order to evaluate the client s claims handling abilities and practices 
the company s facultative underwriters operate within guidelines specifying acceptable types of risks  limits and maximum risk exposures 
specified classes of us risks and large premium risks are referred to everest re s new york facultative headquarters for specific review before premium quotations are given to clients 
in addition  the company s guidelines require certain types of risks to be submitted for review because of their aggregate limits  complexity or volatility  regardless of premium amount on the underlying contract 
non us risks exhibiting similar characteristics are reviewed by senior managers within the involved operations 
the company s insurance operations principally write property and casualty coverages for homogeneous risks through select program managers 
these programs are evaluated based upon actuarial analysis and the program manager s capabilities 
the company s rates  forms and underwriting guidelines are tailored to specific risk types 
the company s underwriting  actuarial  claim and financial functions work closely with its program managers to establish appropriate underwriting and processing guidelines as well as appropriate monitoring mechanisms 
risk management and retrocession arrangements the company manages its risk of loss through a combination of aggregate exposure limits  underwriting guidelines that take into account risks  prices and coverage  and retrocessional arrangements 
the company is exposed to multiple insured losses arising out of a single occurrence  whether a natural event  such as a hurricane or an earthquake  or other catastrophe  such as an explosion at a major factory 
any such catastrophic event could generate insured losses in one  several or many of the company s treaties or lines of business  including property and or casualty exposures 
the company employs various techniques  including licensed software modeling  to assess its accumulated exposure 
such techniques are inherently more difficult to apply to non property exposures 
accumulated exposures with respect to catastrophe losses are generally summarized in terms of the probable maximum loss pml 
the company defines pml as its anticipated maximum loss  taking into account contract limits  caused by a single catastrophe affecting a broad contiguous geographic area  such as that caused by a hurricane or earthquake  of such a magnitude that it is expected to occur once in every years 
management believes that the company s greatest catastrophe exposure world wide from any single event is to a european windstorm where the company estimates it has a pre tax pml exposure of million 
the company further estimates that its greatest pre tax us pml exposure  which relates to an earthquake affecting the west coast including workers compensation exposure is million 
the second largest us exposure relates to a hurricane affecting the east coast with a pml of million 
there can be no assurance that the company will not experience losses from one or more catastrophic events that exceed  perhaps by a substantial amount  its estimated pml 
the us terrorism risk insurance act of was signed into law in november this legislation provides federal reimbursement of of insured losses  in excess of statutory retention levels  due to acts of terrorism carried out by foreign powers on us soil or against us air carriers  vessels or foreign missions 
this coverage does not apply to reinsurance 
reinsurance contracts generally exclude losses arising from terrorist events  except where such coverage has been specifically included in the underwriting and pricing of the involved reinsurance 
the company does not believe that this legislation has had a significant impact on its operations 
underwriting guidelines have been established for each business unit 
these guidelines place dollar limits on the amount of business that can be written based on a variety of factors  including ceding company  line of business  geographical location and risk hazards 
in each case  those guidelines permit limited exceptions  which must be authorized by the company s senior management 
the company employs a retrocessional approach under which the company may purchase reinsurance to cover specific business written or exposure accumulations or as a corporate level retrocessional program covering the potential accumulation or aggregation of exposures across some or all of the company s operations 
all reinsurance purchasing decisions consider both the potential coverage and market conditions with respect to the pricing  terms  conditions and availability of such coverage  with the aim of securing cost effective protection 
the level of reinsurance coverage varies over time  reflecting the underwriter s and or company s view of the changing dynamics of both the underlying exposure and the reinsurance markets 
the company does not typically purchase significant amounts of reinsurance to cover specific reinsurance business written  but it does from time to time purchase retrocessional protections where underwriting management deems it to be prudent and or cost effective to reinsure a portion of the specific risks being assumed 
the company purchased an excess property facultative retrocessional program in and as well as an excess workers compensation retrocessional program in in addition  the company purchased an excess property catastrophe retrocessional program for losses incurred outside of the us in and the program  which expired on june   was not renewed 
the company also participates in common account retrocessional arrangements for certain reinsurance treaties 
common account reinsurance arrangements are arrangements whereby the ceding company purchases reinsurance for the benefit of itself and its reinsurers on one or more of its reinsurance treaties 
common account retrocessional arrangements reduce the effect of individual or aggregate losses to all participating companies  including the ceding company  with respect to the involved treaties 
the company typically considers the purchase of reinsurance to cover insurance programs written by the us insurance operation 
such consideration includes balancing the underlying exposures against the availability of cost effective reinsurance protection 
for policies incepting during or after november  the company purchased a workers compensation reinsurance program that provided for statutory limits coverage in excess of  of losses per occurrence on the company s workers compensation insurance business written prior to november  effective november  this primary workers compensation reinsurance program provided statutory limits coverage in excess of  of losses per occurrence for business written prior to december  the company has not purchased such coverage for the period subsequent to december  in addition  for the twelve month period commencing july   the company purchased reinsurance for a specific program of business 
the reinsurance  subject to certain aggregate limits  covered us longshore and harbor workers compensation act and state act workers compensation business for of loss occurrences up to million 
consistent with the million limits of the underlying policies in the program  reinsurance for of maritime employers liability and employers liability was also provided 
this program was not renewed after its expiration 
the company also considers purchasing corporate level retrocessional protection covering the potential accumulation of exposures 
such consideration includes balancing the underlying exposures against the availability of cost effective retrocessional protection 
for years ended december   and  the company purchased accident year aggregate excess of loss retrocession coverage that provided up to million of coverage for each year 
these excess of loss policies provided coverage if everest re s consolidated statutory basis accident year loss ratio exceeded a loss ratio attachment point for each year of coverage 
the attachment point was net of inuring reinsurance and included adjustable premium provisions that effectively caused the company to offset  on a pre tax income basis  up to approximately of such ceded losses 
the maximum recovery for each year is million before giving effect to the adjustable premium 
as of december   the company has ceded the maximum limits under all three contracts 
the company did not purchase similar coverage subsequent to december  although certain of the company s catastrophe and aggregate excess of loss retrocessions have terms which provide for additional premiums to be paid to the retrocessionaire in the event that losses are ceded  all aspects of the company s retrocessional program have been structured to permit these agreements to be accounted for as reinsurance under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting and reporting for reinsurance of short duration and long duration contracts 
if a single catastrophe were to occur that resulted in million of gross losses and loss adjustment expenses lae in an amount equivalent to the company s pml  management estimates that the effect on the company s income would be approximately million and million before and after taxes  respectively 
there can be no assurance that the company will not experience one or more catastrophic events that could cause these estimates to be exceeded  perhaps by a substantial amount 
in connection with the company s acquisition of mt 
mckinley in september  the company had coverage under an aggregate excess of loss reinsurance agreement provided by prudential property and casualty insurance company of indiana prupac  a wholly owned subsidiary of the prudential 
this agreement covers or million of the first million of any adverse loss reserve development on the carried reserves of mt 
mckinley at the date of acquisition and reimburses the company as such losses are paid by the company 
cessions under this reinsurance were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  exhausting the limit available under the contract at december  also in connection with the mt 
mckinley acquisition  prupac provided excess of loss reinsurance for of the first million of loss with respect to certain of mt 
mckinley s retrocessions and potentially uncollectible reinsurance coverage 
there were no cessions under this reinsurance during the years ended december  and  maintaining the limit available under the contract at million 
there was million of cessions under this reinsurance for the year ended december  as of december   the company carried as an asset  million in reinsurance receivables with respect to losses ceded 
of this amount  million  or  was receivable from subsidiaries of london reinsurance group london life  million  or  was receivable from prupac and million  or  was receivable from continental insurance company continental and million  or was receivable from tranatlantic reinsurance company 
no other retrocessionaire accounted for more than of the company s receivables 
see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial condition 
the company s arrangements with both london life and continental are managed on a funds held basis  which means that the company has not released premium payments to the retrocessionaire but rather retains such payments to secure obligations of the retrocessionaire  records them as a liability  credits interest on the balances and reduces the liability account as payments become due 
as of december   such funds had reduced the company s net exposure to london life to million  effectively of which has been secured by letters of credit  and its exposure to continental to million 
prupac s obligations are guaranteed by the prudential 
no assurance can be given that the company will seek or be able to obtain retrocessional coverage in the future similar to that in place currently or in the past 
the company continuously evaluates its exposures and risk capacities in the context of reinsurance market conditions  at both the specific and corporate level 
although management carefully selects its reinsurers  the company is subject to credit risk with respect to its reinsurance because the ceding of risk to reinsurers does not relieve the company of its liability to insureds or ceding companies 
mt 
mckinley acquisition the company completed its acquisition of gibraltar  subsequently renamed mt 
mckinley  in september in connection with the acquisition  the seller provided the reinsurance described above and the company terminated certain relationships between mt 
mckinley and its former parent  the prudential  and its affiliates 
mt 
mckinley s ongoing operations relate to servicing claims arising from insurance written by mt 
mckinley or everest re prior to  reinsurance of insurance business and certain everest re reinsurance business written prior to which had previously been reinsured with third parties and commuted with those third parties into mt 
mckinley and exposure to adverse loss reserve development on everest re s reserves as of june   which exposure was assumed by mt 
mckinley at the time of the company s initial public offering 
effective september   mt 
mckinley and bermuda re entered into a loss portfolio transfer reinsurance agreement  whereby mt 
mckinley transferred  for what management believes to be arm s length consideration  all of its net insurance exposures and reserves to bermuda re 
claims reinsurance claims are managed by the company s professional claims staff whose responsibilities include reviewing initial loss reports and coverage issues  monitoring claims handling activities of ceding companies  establishing and adjusting proper case reserves and approving payment of claims 
in addition to claims assessment  processing and payment  the claims staff selectively conducts comprehensive claim audits of both specific claims and overall claim procedures at the offices of selected ceding companies 
insurance claims  except those relating to mt 
mckinley s business  are generally handled by third party claims services providers who have limited authority and are subject to oversight by the company s professional claims staff 
the company intensively manages its asbestos and environmental a e exposures through dedicated  centrally managed claim staffs for mt 
mckinley and everest re 
both are staffed with experienced claim and legal professionals that specialize in the handling of such exposures 
these units actively manage each individual insured and reinsured account  responding to claim developments with evaluations of the involved exposures and adjustment of reserves as appropriate 
specific or general claim developments that may have material implications for the company are regularly communicated to senior management  actuarial  legal and financial areas 
meetings among these areas  claim management and senior management are held at least quarterly to review the company s overall reserve positions and make changes  if appropriate 
the company continually reviews its internal processing  communications and analytics  seeking to enhance the management of it s a e exposures  in particular in the context of changes in the landscape of asbestos claims and litigation 
reserves for unpaid property and casualty losses and loss adjustment expenses significant periods of time may elapse between the occurrence of an insured loss  the reporting of the loss to the insurer and the reinsurer and the payment of that loss by the insurer and subsequent payments to the insurer by the reinsurer 
to recognize liabilities for unpaid losses and lae  insurers and reinsurers establish reserves  which are balance sheet liabilities representing estimates of future amounts needed to pay reported and unreported claims and related expenses on losses that have already occurred 
actual losses and lae paid may deviate  perhaps substantially  from such reserves 
to the extent reserves prove to be insufficient to cover actual losses and lae after taking into account available reinsurance coverage  the company would have to augment such reserves and incur a charge to earnings  which could be material in the period such augmentation takes place 
see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations loss and lae reserves 
while the reserving process is difficult and subjective for insurance companies  the inherent uncertainties of estimating such reserves are even greater for the reinsurer  due primarily to the longer time between the date of an occurrence and the reporting of any attendant claims to the reinsurer  the diversity of development patterns among different types of reinsurance treaties or facultative contracts  the necessary reliance on the ceding companies for information regarding reported claims and differing reserving practices among ceding companies 
in addition  trends that have affected development of liabilities in the past may not necessarily occur or affect liability development to the same degree in the future 
as a result  actual losses and lae may deviate  perhaps substantially  from estimates of reserves reflected in the company s consolidated financial statements 
like many other property and casualty insurance and reinsurance companies  the company has experienced adverse loss development for prior accident years  which has led to adjustments in losses and lae reserves 
the increase in net reserves for prior accident years reduced net income for the periods in which the adjustments were made 
there can be no assurance that adverse development from prior years will not continue in the future or that such adverse development will not have a material adverse effect on net income 
changes in historical reserves the following table shows changes in historical loss reserves for the company for and subsequent years 
the table is presented on a gaap basis except that the company s loss reserves for its canadian branch operations are presented in canadian dollars  the impact of which is not material 
the top line of the table shows the estimated reserves for unpaid losses and lae recorded at each year end date 
each amount in the top line represents the estimated amount of future payments for losses and lae on claims occurring in that year and in all prior years 
the upper paid portion of the table presents the cumulative amounts paid through each subsequent year on those claims for which reserves were carried as of each specific year end 
the lower liability re estimated portion shows the re estimated amount of the previously recorded reserves based on experience as of the end of each succeeding year 
the reserve estimates change as more information becomes known about the actual claims for which the initial reserves were carried 
the cumulative redundancy deficiency line represents the cumulative change in estimates since the initial reserve was established 
it is equal to the latest liability re estimated amount less the initial reserve 
each amount other than the original reserves in the top half of the table below includes the effects of all changes in amounts for prior periods 
for example  if a loss settled in for  was first reserved in at  and remained unchanged until settlement  the  deficiency actual loss minus original estimate would be included in the cumulative redundancy deficiency in each of the years in the period through shown below 
conditions and trends that have affected development of liability in the past are not indicative of future developments 
accordingly  it is not appropriate to extrapolate future redundancies or deficiencies based on this table

some totals may not reconcile due to rounding 
the most recent five years on the above table reflect cumulative deficiencies  also referred to as adverse development  with the largest indicated deficiency in three active classes of business are the principal contributors to those deficiencies professional liability reinsurance  general casualty reinsurance and workers compensation insurance 
in addition to these active business classes  there continues to be adverse experience on a e reserves 
in the professional liability reinsurance class  the late s and early s saw a proliferation of claims relating to bankruptcies and other corporate  financial and or management improprieties 
this resulted in an increase in the frequency and severity of claims on the professional liability policies reinsured by the company 
in the general casualty area  the company continues to experience claim frequency and severity greater than expected in the company s pricing and reserving assumptions  particularly for accident years through these losses reflect unfavorable trends in litigation and economic variability 
with respect to both of these classes  another factor was the increasingly competitive conditions in insurance and reinsurance markets during this period 
while the company seeks to manage the impact of competitive condition changes on its results  it is generally unable to divorce itself entirely from the underlying industry cycles of its principal business 
see item  business competition 
in the workers compensation insurance class  the majority of which was written in california  the company has experienced adverse development primarily for accident years and as a result of significant growth in this book of business in a challenging business environment  the company s writings in this class were relatively more subject to variability than are some of its more established and or stable lines of business 
although cumulative results through continue to be profitable for this book of business  there has been some deterioration in claim frequency and severity related to accident years and  which the company generally attributes to the growth of this portfolio of business 
with respect to active business classes  the company actively manages the collection  auditing and analysis of loss data and factors the resulting information into both its reserving processes and its prospective underwriting and pricing activities on as timely a basis as possible 
for years and prior  management believes that two factors had the most significant impact on loss development 
first  through the s  a number of industry and external factors  such as the propensity of courts to award large damage awards in liability cases  combined to increase loss frequency and severity to unexpectedly high levels 
second  contracts written prior to contained coverage terms which  for the company and the industry in general  have been interpreted by courts to provide coverage for a e exposures not contemplated by either the pricing or the initial reserving of the contracts 
legal developments during the s and continuing to date have necessitated additional reserving for such exposures on both a case basis and an incurred but not reported ibnr basis 
these factors were the primary reasons for the cumulative adverse development on the and calendar year reserves 
see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies asbestos and environmental exposures 
the change between and reflects the impact of a stop loss reinsurance agreement with mt 
mckinley  which was then a subsidiary of the prudential 
this stop loss agreement commenced in when the prudential sold the stock of the company in an initial public offering and hence recoveries under this coverage are attributed to the accident year 
as a result of this agreement  reserve development arising from claims incurred prior to july  january  as respects catastrophe losses was ceded under the agreement with no impact on net development  except for a modest retention  when the adverse development reflected for accident year and prior is considered in the context of the mitigating favorable development attributed to the accident year 
this coverage became an inter affiliate reinsurance transaction with the acquisition of mt 
mckinley in  which eliminated any subsequent impact on net reserve development 
management believes that adequate provision has been made for the company s loss and lae reserves 
while there can be no assurance that reserves for and losses from these claims will not increase in the future  management believes that the company s existing reserves  reserving methodologies and retrocessional arrangements lessen the probability that any such increases would have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
these statements regarding the company s loss reserves are forward looking statements within the meaning of the us federal securities laws and are intended to be covered by the safe harbor provisions contained therein

some totals may not reconcile due to rounding 
the reserve development by accident year reflected in the above table was generally the result of the same factors discussed above that caused the deficiencies shown in the ten year gaap loss development table 
development in accident years and prior principally reflect the impact of a e exposures discussed above 
the favorable development experienced for the accident year is due to stop loss reinsurance provided to the company at the time of its initial public offering  which  when established  was specifically intended to mitigate the impact of development on reserves at june  the adverse development experienced in the through accident years relates principally to casualty reinsurance  including professional liability classes and workers compensation insurance where  in retrospect  the company s initial estimates of losses were underestimated principally as the result of unanticipated variability in the underlying exposures 
the favorable development for accident year relates primarily to favorable experience with respect to property reinsurance business 
the company s loss reserving methodologies continuously monitor the emergence of loss and loss development trends  seeking  on a timely basis  to both adjust reserves for the impact of trend shifts and to factor the impact of such shifts into its underwriting and pricing on a prospective basis

reserves for asbestos and environmental losses and loss adjustment expenses the company s reserves include an estimate of the company s ultimate liability for a e claims for which ultimate value cannot be estimated using traditional reserving techniques 
there are significant uncertainties in estimating the amount of the company s potential losses from a e claims 
see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations asbestos and environmental exposures and note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
mt 
mckinley s book of direct a e exposed insurance is relatively small and homogenous 
the book is based  principally on excess liability policies  thus the claim legal staff does not have to analyze exposure under many different policy forms  but rather can focus on a limited number of policies and policy forms 
as a result of this focused structure  the company believes that it is able to comprehensively analyze its exposures  allowing it to identify and analyze those claims on which it has unusual exposure  such as policies in which it may be exposed to pay expenses in addition to policy limits or non products asbestos claims  for concentrated ongoing attention 
the company aims to be actively engaged with every insured account posing significant potential asbestos exposure to mt 
mckinley 
such engagement can take the form of pursuing a final settlement  negotiation  litigation  or the monitoring of claim activity under coverage in place cip agreements 
cip agreements generally condition an insurer s payment upon the actual claim experience of the insured and may have annual payment caps or other measures to control the insurer s payments 
the company s mt 
mckinley operation is currently managing six cip agreements  five of which were executed prior to the acquisition of mt 
mckinley in the company s preference with respect to coverage settlements is to execute settlements that call for a fixed schedule of payments  because such settlements eliminate future uncertainty 
the company has significantly enhanced its classification of insureds by exposure characteristics  as well as its analysis by insured for those it considers to be more exposed or active 
those insureds identified as relatively less exposed or active are subject to less rigorous  but still active management  with an emphasis on monitoring those characteristics  which may indicate an increasing exposure or levels of activity 
the company continually focuses on further enhancement of the detailed estimation processes used to evaluate potential exposure of policyholders  including those that may not have reported significant a e losses 
everest re s book of assumed reinsurance is relatively concentrated within a modest number of a e exposed relationships 
because the book of business is relatively concentrated and the company has been managing the a e exposures for many years  its claim staff is familiar with the ceding companies that have generated most of these liabilities in the past and which are therefore most likely to generate future liabilities 
the company s claim staff has developed familiarity both with the nature of the business written by its ceding companies and the claims handling and reserving practices of those companies 
this level of familiarity enhances the quality of the company s analysis of its exposure through those companies 
as a result  the company believes that it can identify those claims on which it has unusual exposure  such as non products asbestos claims  for concentrated attention 
however  in setting reserves for its reinsurance liabilities  the company relies on claims data supplied by its ceding companies and brokers 
this information is not always timely or accurate and can impact the accuracy and timeliness of ultimate loss projections 
the following table summarizes the composition of the company s total reserves for a e losses  gross and net of reinsurance  for the years ended december   and years ended december  dollars in millions case reserves reported by ceding companies

investments the company s overall financial strength and results of operations are  in part  dependent on the quality and performance of its investment portfolio 
net investment income and net realized capital gains losses on the company s invested assets constituted   and of the company s revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the company s cash and invested assets totaled billion at december   of which were cash  short term investments and investment grade fixed maturities 
the company s current investment strategy seeks to maximize after tax income  through a high quality  diversified  taxable bond and tax preferenced fixed maturity portfolio  while maintaining an adequate level of liquidity 
the company s mix of taxable and tax preferenced investments is adjusted continuously  consistent with the company s current and projected operating results  market conditions and tax position 
additionally  the company invests in equity securities  which it believes will enhance the risk adjusted total return of the investment portfolio 
the board of directors of each of the company s operating subsidiaries is responsible for establishing investment policy and guidelines and  together with senior management  for overseeing their execution 
the company s investment portfolio is in compliance with the insurance laws of the jurisdictions in which its subsidiaries are regulated 
generally  an independent investment advisor is utilized to manage the company s investment portfolio within the established guidelines and is required to report activities on a current basis and to meet with the company periodically to review and discuss the portfolio structure  securities selection and performance results 
the company s investment guidelines include a general duration guideline of five to six years 
the duration of an investment is based on the maturity of the security but also reflects the payment of interest and the possibility of early prepayment of such security 
this investment duration guideline is established and periodically revised by management  which considers economic and business factors 
an important factor considered by management is the company s average duration of potential liabilities  which  at december   is estimated at approximately five years based on the estimated payouts of underwriting liabilities using standard duration calculations 
the duration of the fixed income portfolio at december  was years compared with the general guideline of five to six years 
the company made a decision to shorten the duration during the second half of by purchasing interest only strips of mortgaged back securities interest only strips 
the interest only strips give the holder the right to receive interest payments at a stated coupon rate on an underlying pool of mortgages 
the interest payments on the outstanding mortgages are guaranteed by entities generally rated aaa 
the ultimate cash flow from these investments is primarily dependent upon the average life of the underlying mortgage pool 
generally  as market interest rates and more specifically market mortgage rates decline  mortgagees tend to refinance  which will decrease the average life of a mortgage pool and decrease expected cash flows 
conversely  as market interest rates and more specifically market mortgage rates rise  repayments will slow and the ultimate cash flows will tend to rise 
accordingly  the market value of these investments tends to increase as general interest rates rise and decline as general interest rates fall 
these characteristics contribute to interest only strips generally having a significantly negative duration  estimated at for the end of year portfolio 
these movements are generally counter to the impact of interest rate movements on the company s other fixed income investments 
the market value of interest only strips in the company s portfolio was million at december  shortening the duration of the company s portfolio of fixed income securities makes the overall investment portfolio value less susceptible to valuation variability arising from movement in market interest rates 
with interest rates near record lows  the company decided to shorten the duration of its fixed income portfolio 
the company views this action as a temporary defensive measure to mitigate the potential adverse impact on bond market values  and accordingly shareholders equity  from increasing interest rates 
for each currency in which the company has established substantial reserves  the company seeks to maintain invested assets denominated in such currency in an amount approximately comparable to the estimated liabilities 
approximately of the company s consolidated reserves for losses and lae and unearned premiums represent estimated amounts payable in foreign currencies 
as of december   of the company s total investments and cash were comprised of fixed maturity investments or cash and of the company s fixed maturities consisted of investment grade securities 
the average maturity of fixed maturities was years at december   and their overall duration was years 
the overall duration excluding the impact of the interest only strips was years 
as of december   the company did not have any investments in commercial real estate or direct commercial mortgages or any material holdings of derivative investments or securities of issuers that are experiencing cash flow difficulty to an extent that the company s management believes could threaten the issuer s ability to meet debt service payments  except where other than temporary impairments have been recognized 
as of december   the company s common stock portfolio  which is comprised primarily of publicly traded equity index funds  had a market value of million  comprising of total investments and cash

ratings the following table shows the financial strength ratings of the company s operating subsidiaries as reported by am best  standard poor s rating services standard poor s and moody s investors service  inc moody s 
these ratings are based upon factors of concern to policyholders and should not be considered an indication of the degree or lack of risk involved in an equity investment in an insurance company

mckinley not rated not rated not rated everest international not rated not rated not rated am best states that the a superior rating is assigned to those companies which  in its opinion  have a superior ability to meet their ongoing obligations to policyholders based on am best s comprehensive quantitative and qualitative evaluation of a company s balance sheet strength  operating performance and business profile 
the a superior rating is the second highest of fifteen ratings assigned by am best  which range from a superior to f in liquidation 
additionally  am best has five classifications within the not rated category 
standard poor s states that the aa rating is assigned to those insurance companies which  in its opinion  have very strong financial security characteristics with respect to their ability to pay under its insurance policies and contracts in accordance with their terms 
the aa rating is the fourth highest of nineteen ratings assigned by standard poor s  which range from aaa to r 
ratings from aa to ccc may be modified by the use of a plus or minus sign to show relative standing of the insurer within those rating categories 
moody s states that insurance companies rated aa offer excellent financial security 
together with the aaa rated companies  aa rated companies constitute what are generally known as high grade companies  with aa rated companies generally having somewhat larger long term risks 
moody s rating gradations are shown through the use of nine distinct symbols  each symbol representing a group of ratings in which the financial security is broadly the same 
the aa excellent rating is the fourth highest of ratings assigned by moody s  which range from aaa exceptional to c lowest 
moody s appends numerical modifiers  and to each generic rating classification from aa through caa 
numeric modifiers are used to refer to the ranking within a group with being the highest and being the lowest 
subsidiaries other than everest re and bermuda re may not be rated by some or any rating agencies because such ratings are not considered essential by the individual subsidiary s customers or because of the limited nature of the subsidiary s operations 
in particular  mt 
mckinley is not rated because it is in run off status 
everest international has had limited business activity through if it becomes more active  the establishment of a rating will be considered 
the following table shows the debt ratings by am best  standard poor s and moody s of the holdings senior notes due march   holdings senior notes due march  and capital trust s trust preferred securities due november   all of which are considered investment grade 
debt ratings are a current assessment of the credit worthiness of an obligor with respect to a specific obligation 
am best standard poor s moody s senior notes a a a trust preferred securities a bbb baa a debt rating of a or a is assigned by am best where the issuer  in am best s opinion  has a strong ability to meet the terms of the obligation 
the a and a ratings are the sixth and seventh highest of ratings assigned by am best  which range from aaa to ccc 
a debt rating of a is assigned by standard poor s where the obligor has a strong capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation  although it is somewhat more susceptible to the adverse effects of changes in circumstances and economic conditions than obligations in higher rated categories 
standard poor s assigns a debt rating of bbb to issues that exhibit adequate protection parameters although adverse economic conditions or changing circumstances are more likely to lead to a weakened capacity of the obligor to meet its financial commitment on the obligation 
the a and bbb ratings from standard poor s are the seventh and ninth highest of ratings assigned by standard poor s  which range from aaa to d 
according to moody s  a debt rating of a is assigned to issues that are considered upper medium grade obligations and subject to low credit risk 
obligations rated baa are subject to moderate credit risk and are considered medium grade and as such may possess certain speculative characteristics 
the a and baa ratings are the seventh and eighth highest of ratings assigned by moody s  which range from aaa to c 
all of the above mentioned ratings are continually monitored and revised  if necessary  by each of the rating agencies 
the company believes that its ratings  in general  are important to its operations because they provide the company s customers and investors with an independent assessment of the company s underlying financial strength using a scale that provides for relative comparisons 
competition the worldwide reinsurance and insurance businesses are highly competitive  yet cyclical by product and market 
competition with respect to the types of reinsurance and insurance business in which the company is engaged is based on many factors  including the perceived overall financial strength of the reinsurer or insurer  am best s and or standard poor s rating of the reinsurer or insurer  underwriting expertise  the jurisdictions where the reinsurer or insurer is licensed or otherwise authorized  capacity and coverages offered  premiums charged  other terms and conditions of the reinsurance and insurance business offered  services offered  speed of claims payment and reputation and experience in lines written 
the company competes in the us  bermuda and international reinsurance and insurance markets with numerous international and domestic reinsurance and insurance companies 
the company s competitors include independent reinsurance and insurance companies  subsidiaries or affiliates of established worldwide insurance companies  reinsurance departments of certain insurance companies and domestic and international underwriting operations  including underwriting syndicates at lloyd s 
some of these competitors have greater financial resources than the company and have established long term and continuing business relationships throughout the industry  which can be a significant competitive advantage 
in addition  the potential for securitization of reinsurance and insurance risks through capital markets provides an additional source of potential reinsurance and insurance capacity and competition 
in  the improving market trends established in and have continued  generally sustaining upward pressure on pricing  continued constriction of terms  conditions and coverages and constrained capacity 
there are signs that pressures for incremental firming have abated for property classes  but these are partially offset by signs that pressures for incremental firming continue for casualty classes in general 
more broadly  the industry remains exposed to fundamental issues that negatively impacted its aggregate capacity in  including weak investment market conditions and adverse loss emergence  both of which have continued to depress the industry s aggregate financial performance and affect perceptions of the financial strength of industry participants 
these factors suggest that the current favorable market conditions are likely to persist until further corrective actions  possibly combined with improving investment market conditions  restore more normal competitive conditions 
these current trends reflect a clear reversal of the general trend from through which were characterized by increasingly competitive global market conditions across most lines of business  as reflected by decreasing prices and broadening contract terms 
the earlier trend resulted from a number of factors  including the emergence of significant reinsurance capacity in bermuda  changes in the lloyd s market  consolidation and increased capital levels in the insurance and reinsurance industries  as well as the emergence of new reinsurance and financial products addressing traditional exposures in alternative fashions 
many of these factors continue to operate and may take on additional importance as the result of the firming market conditions that have emerged 
the terrorist attacks on september  the september attacks solidified and amplified the trend reversal that began in these attacks resulted in losses which reduced industry capacity and were of sufficient magnitude to cause most companies to reassess their capital position  tolerance for risk  exposure control mechanisms and the pricing terms and conditions at which they are willing to take on risk 
the gradual and variable improving trend that had been apparent through and earlier in firmed significantly after the september attacks 
this firming generally took the form of immediate and significant upward pressure on prices  more restrictive terms and conditions and a reduction of coverage limits and capacity availability 
such pressures were widespread  with variability depending on the product and markets involved  but mainly depending on the characteristics of the underlying risk exposures 
the magnitude of the changes was sufficient to create temporary disequilibrium in some markets as individual buyers and sellers adapted to changes in both their internal and market dynamics 
through reinsurance and insurance markets generally continued to firm  reflecting the continuing implications of losses arising from the september attacks as well as aggregate company reactions to broad and growing recognition that competition in the late s reached extremes in many classes and markets  which ultimately led to inadequate pricing and overly broad terms  conditions and coverages 
the effect of these extremes  which had become apparent through excessive loss emergence  varied widely by company depending on product offerings  markets accessed  underwriting and operating practices  competitive strategies and business volumes 
across all market participants  however  the aggregate general effect was impaired financial results and erosion of the industry capital base 
coupled with deteriorating investment market conditions and results  and renewed concerns regarding longer term industry specific issues  including asbestos exposure and sub par capital returns  these financial impacts introduced substantial  and in some cases extreme  pressure for the initiation and or strengthening of corrective action by individual market participants 
these pressures  aggregating across industry participants  resulted in firming prices  more restrictive terms and conditions  tightened coverage availability across most classes and markets and increasing concern with respect to the financial security of insurance and reinsurance providers  impacts which set the stage for the trends discussed above 
the company is generally encouraged by recent industry developments  which have operated to its advantage  and more broadly  by continued favorable current market conditions 
however  the company cannot predict with any reasonable certainty whether and to what extent these conditions will persist 
employees as of march   the company employed persons 
management believes that its employee relations are good 
none of the company s employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements  and the company is not aware of any current efforts to implement such agreements 
regulatory matters the company and its insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation under the insurance statutes of the various jurisdictions in which they conduct business  including essentially all states of the us  canada  singapore  the united kingdom and bermuda 
these regulations vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and are generally designed to protect ceding insurance companies and policyholders by regulating the company s conduct of business  financial integrity and ability to meet its obligations relating to its business transactions and operations 
many of these regulations require reporting of information designed to allow insurance regulators to closely monitor the company s performance 
insurance holding company regulation

group s ability to pay dividends and its operating expenses is partially dependent upon dividends from its subsidiaries 
the payment of dividends by insurance subsidiaries is limited under bermuda law as well as the laws of the various us states in which group s insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries are domiciled or deemed domiciled 
the limitations are generally based upon net income and compliance with applicable policyholders surplus or minimum solvency margin and liquidity ratio requirements as determined in accordance with the relevant statutory accounting practices

as a long term insurer  bermuda re is also unable to declare or pay a dividend to anyone who is not a policyholder unless  after payment of the dividend  the value of the assets in its long term business fund  as certified by its approved actuary  exceeds its liabilities for long term business by at least the  minimum solvency margin 
prior approval of the bermuda monetary authority is required if bermuda re s dividend payments would reduce its prior year end total statutory capital by or more 
at december   bermuda re and everest international met their solvency and liquidity requirements by a significant margin 
the payment of dividends to holdings by everest re is subject to limitations imposed by delaware law 
generally  everest re may only pay dividends out of its statutory earned surplus  which was  million at december   and only after it has given days prior notice to the delaware insurance commissioner 
during this day period  the commissioner may  by order  limit or disallow the payment of ordinary dividends if the commissioner finds the insurer to be presently or potentially in financial distress 
further  the maximum amount of dividends that may be paid without the prior approval of the delaware insurance commissioner in any twelve month period is the greater of of an insurer s statutory surplus as of the end of the prior calendar year or the insurer s statutory net income  not including realized capital gains  for the prior calendar year 
under this definition  the maximum amount that will be available for the payment of dividends by everest re in without triggering the requirement for prior approval of regulatory authorities in connection with a dividend is million

naic risk based capital requirements 
the us national association of insurance commissioners naic employs a formula to measure the amount of capital appropriate for a property and casualty insurance company to support its overall business operations in light of its size and risk profile 
the major categories of a company s risk profile are its asset risk  credit risk  and underwriting risk 
the standards are an effort by the naic to prevent insolvencies  to ward off other financial difficulties of insurance companies and to establish uniform regulatory standards among state insurance departments 
under the approved formula  a company s statutory surplus is compared to its risk based capital rbc 
if this ratio is above a minimum threshold  no action is necessary 
below this threshold are four distinct action levels at which a regulator can intervene with increasing degrees of authority over a domestic insurer as the ratio of surplus to rbc decreases 
the mildest intervention requires the company to submit a plan of appropriate corrective actions 
the most severe action requires the company to be rehabilitated or liquidated 
based on their financial positions at december   everest re  everest national  everest indemnity and everest security exceed the minimum thresholds 
since mt 
mckinley ceased writing new and renewal insurance in  its domiciliary regulator  delaware  has exempted mt 
mckinley from complying with rbc requirements 
various proposals to change the rbc formula arise from time to time 
the company is unable to predict whether any such proposal will be adopted  the form in which any such proposals would be adopted or the effect  if any  the adoption of any such proposal or change in the rbc calculations would have on the company

the september attacks solidified and amplified the trend reversal that began in these attacks resulted in losses which reduced industry capacity and were of sufficient magnitude to cause most companies to reassess their capital position  tolerance for risk  exposure control mechanisms and the pricing terms and conditions at which they are willing to take on risk 
the gradual and variable improving trend that had been apparent through and earlier in firmed significantly after the september attacks 
this firming generally took the form of immediate and significant upward pressure on prices  more restrictive terms and conditions and a reduction of coverage limits and capacity availability 
such pressures were widespread with variability depending on the product and markets involved  but mainly depending on the characteristics of the underlying risk exposures 
the magnitude of the changes was sufficient to create temporary disequilibrium in some markets as individual buyers and sellers adapted to changes in both their internal and market dynamics 
through reinsurance and insurance markets generally continued to firm  reflecting the continuing implications of losses arising from the september attacks as well as aggregate company reactions to broad and growing recognition that competition in the late s reached extremes in many classes and markets  which ultimately led to inadequate pricing and overly broad terms  conditions and coverages 
the effect of these extremes  which had become apparent through excessive loss emergence  varied widely by company depending on product offerings  markets accessed  underwriting and operating practices  competitive strategies and business volumes 
across all market participants  however  the aggregate general effect was impaired financial results and erosion of the industry capital base 
coupled with deteriorating investment market conditions and results  and renewed concerns regarding longer term industry specific issues  including asbestos exposure and sub par capital returns  these financial impacts introduced substantial  and in some cases extreme  pressure for the initiation and or strengthening of corrective action by individual market participants 
these pressures  aggregating across industry participants  resulted in firming prices  more restrictive terms and conditions  tightened coverage availability across most classes and markets and increasing concern with respect to the financial security of insurance and reinsurance providers  impacts which set the stage for the trends discussed above 
the company is generally encouraged by recent industry developments  which have operated to its advantage  and more broadly  by continued favorable current market conditions 
however  the company cannot predict with any reasonable certainty whether and to what extent these conditions will persist

as indicated in the preceding industry conditions section  the reinsurance and insurance industry has experienced very favorable market conditions over the past three years 
the favorable market conditions coupled with the company s financial strength  strategic positioning and market and underwriting expertise enabled it to significantly increase its volume of business 
as a result  gross written premiums for the year ended december  increased by compared with the year ended december   which had increased compared with the year ended december  gross written premiums for the year ended december  had increased by compared with the year ended december  due to the nature of its businesses  the company is unable to precisely differentiate the effects of price changes as compared to changes in exposure 
similarly  because individual reinsurance arrangements often reflect revised coverages  structuring  pricing  terms and or conditions from period to period  the company is unable to differentiate between the premium volumes attributable to new business as compared to renewal business 
management believes however  that on balance  during the past three years  the more significant component of growth related to growth in exposures underwritten with a lesser but still significant component relating to increased pricing and or improved terms and conditions 
management believes further that market conditions are generally more favorable for casualty business classes than for property business classes  however  management notes that it continues to see business opportunities in virtually all operating classes and markets 
although premium volumes have increased significantly  the company continues to decline business that does not meet its objectives regarding underwriting profitability 
the other components of underwriting gain loss are highly correlated to the level of premium volume 
the amount of net written premiums reflects gross written premiums less ceded premiums 
premiums ceded were million of gross written premiums  million of gross written premiums and million of gross written premiums for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the fluctuation in ceded premiums was primarily due to adjustment premiums relating to claims made under the company s accident year aggregate excess of loss retrocessional programs 
the amount of the adjustment premiums was million  million and million for years ended december   and  respectively 
the larger amount of adjustment premium for relates primarily to losses ceded in conjunction with the september attacks and the enron bankruptcy 
the increase in ceded premiums for and relates in part to specific reinsurance programs in the us insurance segment  which totaled million and million  respectively  for the years ended december  and incurred losses and lae also increased as a result of the increased premium volume 
however  the percentage increase in losses was less than the percentage increase in premium volume since part of the premium increase represented improvement in pricing  terms and conditions  as opposed to an increase in exposures 
partially offsetting the impact of improved pricing was the effect of prior year loss reserve strengthening 
the increase in losses relating to prior period reserve strengthening was million  million and million for years ended december   and  respectively 
see item  business changes in historical reserves for additional details and explanation 
commission  brokerage and tax expense also increased as a result of the increasing premium volume as these generally vary in direct proportion to premium 
however  the percentage increase was generally less than the percentage increase in premium volume  reflecting the generally improving market conditions  which tend to provide the company a relatively greater ability to exert downward pressure on commission and brokerage rates 
the increase in net investment income to million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  is also correlated to the increased premium volume 
premiums are generally collected over the first to months of the reinsurance contract while related losses are typically paid out over numerous years  resulting in an increase in cash flow when premiums are increasing 
the company s cash flow from operations was  million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
coupled with common stock offerings and the issuance of trust preferred securities  this facilitated the growth in the company s total investments and cash to  million   million and  million as of december   and  respectively 
the impact on net investment income resulting from the growth in the investment portfolio was partially offset by an overall decline in interest rates during this same time period 
net realized capital losses of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  were primarily the result of write downs in the value of securities deemed to be impaired on an other than temporary basis  partially offset by realized gains 
the company generated an income tax expense of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  generally reflecting improved underwriting and investment income results 
the income tax benefit of million for the year ended december  primarily reflected a tax benefit from various unusual loss events in  in particular the september attacks and enron  which were partially offset by taxable income on a former client s demutualization 
the increase in net income to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  generally reflects improved underwriting and investment results partially offset by increased income taxes 
the net income of million for the year ended december  reflects the impact of the unusual loss events in as a result of the september attacks  the company incurred pre tax losses in  based on an estimate of ultimate exposure developed through a review of its coverages  of million gross of reinsurance and million net of reinsurance 
associated with this reinsurance was million of pre tax charges  predominantly from adjustment premiums  which resulted in a total pre tax loss from the september attacks of million 
after tax recoveries relating specifically to this unusual loss event totaled million 
over of the losses ceded by the company were pursuant to treaties where the reinsurers obligations are secured  which the company believes eliminates material reinsurance collection risk 
as a result of the enron bankruptcy  the company incurred losses in  amounting to million after tax and net of reinsurance 
this unusual loss reflected all of the company s exposures to this event  including underwriting  credit and investment 
the above mentioned unusual events were partially offset by the income received from a former client s demutualization 
the company s shareholders equity increased to  million   million and  million as of december   and  respectively 
this increase is due to increased net income  common stock offerings and increased unrealized appreciation on the company s investments 
management believes that the company generally has sufficient capital and resources to meet its known obligations 
segment information the company  through its subsidiaries  operates in five segments us reinsurance  us insurance  specialty underwriting  international and bermuda 
the us reinsurance operation writes property and casualty reinsurance  on both a treaty and facultative basis  through reinsurance brokers as well as directly with ceding companies within the us the us insurance operation writes property and casualty insurance primarily through general agent relationships and surplus lines brokers within the us the specialty underwriting operation writes a h  marine  aviation and surety business within the us and worldwide through brokers and directly with ceding companies 
the international operation writes property and casualty reinsurance through the company s branches in london  canada  and singapore  in addition to foreign business written through the company s miami and new jersey offices 
the bermuda operation provides reinsurance and insurance to worldwide property and casualty markets and reinsurance to life insurers through brokers and directly with ceding companies 
these segments are managed in a carefully coordinated fashion with strong elements of central control  including with respect to capital  investments and support operations 
as a result  management monitors and evaluates the financial performance of these operating segments principally based upon their underwriting results 
the company utilizes inter affiliate reinsurance but such reinsurance does not impact segment results  as business is generally reported within the segment in which the business was first produced 
the following tables present the relevant underwriting results for the operating segments for the three years ended december   and us reinsurance dollar values in thousands gross written premiums    net written premiums    earned premiums    incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses    commission and brokerage    other underwriting expenses    underwriting loss    us insurance dollar values in thousands gross written premiums    net written premiums    earned premiums    incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses    commission and brokerage    other underwriting expenses    underwriting gain loss   specialty underwriting dollar values in thousands gross written premiums    net written premiums    earned premiums    incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses    commission and brokerage    other underwriting expenses    underwriting gain loss    international dollar values in thousands gross written premiums    net written premiums    earned premiums    incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses    commission and brokerage    other underwriting expenses    underwriting gain loss    bermuda dollar values in thousands gross written premiums    net written premiums    earned premiums    incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses    commission and brokerage    other underwriting expenses    underwriting gain loss    the company has recently announced that one of its subsidiaries  everest re  has reached agreement  subject to regulatory approval  to sell its united kingdom branch to another of the company s subsidiaries  bermuda re

upon completion of the transaction  the business of this branch will be included in the bermuda segment 
appropriate disclosures will be made in future filings to address the segment financial result fluctuations caused by the transfer 
the company has also recently announced that another subsidiary  everest national  has opened a regional office in california to better serve its western us insurance business 
the additional office will not affect segment reporting 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  premiums 
gross written premiums increased to  million in from  million in  as the company took advantage of the general firming of rates  terms and conditions and selected growth opportunities  while continuing to maintain a disciplined underwriting approach 
premium growth areas included a million increase in the us reinsurance operation  principally related to a million increase in treaty casualty business  a million increase in treaty property business and a million increase in facultative business 
the international operation increased million  primarily due to a million increase in premiums from the london branch  a million increase in international business written through the miami and new jersey offices representing primarily latin american business and a million increase to canadian business 
the us insurance operation grew million  principally as a result of an million increase in workers compensation and a million increase in excess and surplus lines insurance 
the bermuda operation increased million  reflecting a shift toward more traditional business resulting from the rollout of treaty  facultative and individual risk capabilities 
the specialty underwriting operation increased million  resulting primarily from a million increase in a h business and a million decrease in marine and aviation 
ceded premiums increased to million in from million in  principally reflecting growth in specific reinsurance of the company s primary insurance business  which increased from million to million 
in addition  ceded premiums for included million in adjustment premiums relating to claims made under the accident year aggregate excess of loss element of the company s corporate retrocessional programs  while ceded premiums for included million and million in adjustment premium relating to claims made under the and accident year aggregate excess of loss elements of the company s corporate retrocessional programs  respectively 
net written premiums increased by to  million in from  million in  reflecting the increase in gross written premiums  combined with the growth in ceded premiums 
premium revenues 
net premiums earned increased by to  million in from  million in contributing to this increase was a million increase in the us reinsurance operation  a million increase in the international operation  a million increase in the us insurance operation  a million increase in the bermuda operation and an million increase in the specialty underwriting operation 
all of these changes reflect period to period changes in net written premiums and business mix together with normal variability in earnings patterns 
business mix changes occur not only as the company shifts emphasis between products  lines of business  distribution channels and markets but also as individual contracts renew or non renew  almost always with changes in coverage  structure  prices and or terms  and as new contracts are accepted with coverages  structures  prices and or terms different from those of expiring contracts 
as premium reporting and earnings and loss and commission characteristics derive from the provisions of individual contracts  the continuous turnover of individual contracts  arising from both strategic shifts and day to day underwriting  can and does introduce appreciable background variability in various underwriting line items 
expenses 
incurred loss and lae increased by to  million in from  million in the increase in incurred losses and lae was principally attributable to the increase in net premiums earned  the impact of changes in the company s mix of business and reserve adjustments for prior period losses 
net prior period reserve adjustments for non a e exposures for the year ended december  were million  which were net of a cession of million under the accident year aggregate excess of loss component of the company s corporate retrocessional program 
for the year ended december   net prior period reserve adjustments for non a e exposures were million  which were net of cessions of million and million under the and accident year aggregate excess of loss components of the company s corporate retrocessional program  respectively 
the us reinsurance segment accounted for million and million of the net prior period reserve adjustments for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the two principal underwriting areas responsible for these deficiencies are professional liability and general casualty 
during the late s and early s  there had been a proliferation of claims relating to bankruptcies and other financial management improprieties 
this increased number of claims combined with larger claims has significantly increased incurred losses on the professional liability policies 
in the general casualty area  the company continues to experience losses greater than historical trends for accident years through these losses are being driven by unfavorable trends in litigation and economic variability 
in both the professional liability and general casualty reinsurance areas  the company relies upon loss reports from ceding companies 
although the company generally records reserves at higher levels than those reported by ceding companies  actual reported results have exceeded the initial loss indications 
the reserve adjustments in these areas were partially offset by favorable reserve development relating to property reinsurance for the accident year 
the us insurance segment reflected million and million of net prior period reserve adjustments for years ended december  and  respectively  principally due to california workers compensation insurance 
this is a relatively new book of business being written in a challenging political and economical environment 
while management believes the cumulative results through remain positive  there has been some deterioration in claim frequency and severity related to accident years and the international segment had net prior period reserve adjustments of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
these reserve adjustments relate primarily to general casualty business written in the us  us and canada on both a quota share and excess basis for accident years through  with the larger development on the through years 
for accident year  the adverse general casualty experience was partially offset by favorable property experience 
the specialty underwriting segment had net prior period reserve adjustments of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the favorable adjustments  particularly for  related primarily to a h business and cessions under the corporate retrocessional program and related principally to the through accident years 
the bermuda segment reflected million of favorable net prior period reserve adjustments for the year ended december  and no development for the year ended december  reserve related to a e exposures were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the company has a e exposure related to contracts written by the company prior to and to claim obligations acquired as part of the mt 
mckinley acquisition in september the strengthening on business written by the company  net of reinsurance  was million and the net strengthening on the acquired business was million 
substantially all of the company s a e exposures relate to insurance and reinsurance contracts with coverage periods prior to incurred losses and lae include catastrophe losses  which include the impact of both current period events and favorable and unfavorable development on prior period events  and are net of reinsurance 
a catastrophe is an event that causes a pre tax loss on property exposures of at least million and has an event date of january  or later 
catastrophe losses  net of contract specific cessions  were million in  relating principally to the may tornado and hailstorm events and hurricanes fabian and isabel  compared to million in in all cases  the prior period development reflects management s judgment as to the implications of losses and claim information reported during the period on the company s reserve balances 
incurred losses and lae in reflected ceded losses and lae of million compared to ceded losses and lae in of million 
the ceded losses and lae in included million of losses ceded under the accident year aggregate excess of loss component of the company s corporate retrocessional program and million under the prupac mt 
mckinley reinsurance agreement 
the ceded losses and lae in included million and million of losses ceded under the and accident year aggregate excess of loss components of the company s corporate retrocessional program  respectively  and million under the prupac mt

s insurance operation  a million increase in the bermuda operation  partially offset by a million decrease in the specialty underwriting operation 
these changes generally reflect increases in premiums earned  changes in the current year loss expectation assumptions for business written generally reflecting continued improvement in market conditions and pricing  increase in catastrophe losses and the net prior period reserve development discussed above 
incurred losses and lae for each operation were also impacted by variability relating to changes in the level of premium volume and the mix of business by class and type

the company maintains reserves to cover its estimated ultimate liability for losses and lae with respect to reported and unreported claims 
because reserves are estimates of ultimate losses and lae  management  using a variety of statistical and actuarial techniques  monitors reserve adequacy over time  evaluating new information  as it becomes known and adjusting reserves as necessary 
management considers many factors when setting reserves  including its exposure base  generally its premiums earned  its expected loss ratios on current year writings as determined through extensive interaction between its underwriters and actuaries by product and class categories  internal actuarial methodologies which analyze the company s experience with similar cases  information from ceding companies and historical trends  such as reserving patterns  loss payments and product mix  current legal interpretations of coverage and liability  economic conditions  and the uncertainties discussed below regarding reserve requirements for a e claims 
based on these considerations  management believes that adequate provision has been made for the company s loss and lae reserves 
actual losses and lae ultimately paid may deviate  perhaps substantially  from such reserves  impacting income in the period in which the change is made

asbestos and environmental exposures 
the company continues to receive claims under expired contracts  asserting alleged injuries and or damages relating to or resulting from environmental pollution and hazardous substances  including asbestos 
the company s asbestos claims typically involve potential liability for bodily injury from exposure to asbestos or for property damage resulting from asbestos or products containing asbestos 
the company s environmental claims typically involve potential liability for a the mitigation or remediation of environmental contamination or b bodily injury or property damage caused by the release of hazardous substances into the land  air or water 
the company s reserves include an estimate of the company s ultimate liability for a e claims for which ultimate value cannot be estimated using traditional reserving techniques 
there are significant uncertainties in estimating the amount of the company s potential losses from a e claims 
among the uncertainties are a potentially long waiting periods between exposure and manifestation of any bodily injury or property damage  b difficulty in identifying sources of a e contamination  c difficulty in properly allocating responsibility and or liability for a e damage  d changes in underlying laws and judicial interpretation of those laws  e potential for an a e claim to involve many insurance providers over many policy periods  f long reporting delays  both from insureds to insurance companies and from ceding companies to reinsurers  g historical data on a e losses  which is more limited and variable than historical information on other types of casualty claims  h questions concerning interpretation and application of insurance and reinsurance coverage  and i uncertainty regarding the number and identity of insureds with potential a e exposure 
with respect to asbestos claims in particular  several additional factors have emerged in recent years that further compound the difficulty in estimating the company s liability 
these developments include a continued growth in the number of claims filed  in part reflecting a much more aggressive plaintiff bar  b a disproportionate percentage of claims filed by individuals with no functional injury from asbestos  claims with little to no financial value but that have increasingly been considered in jury verdicts and settlements  c the growth in the number and significance of bankruptcy filings by companies as a result of asbestos claims including  more recently  bankruptcy filings in which companies attempt to resolve their asbestos liabilities in a manner that is prejudicial to insurers and forecloses insurers from the negotiation of bankruptcy plans  d the growth in claim filings against defendants formerly regarded as peripheral  e the concentration of claims in a small number of states that favor plaintiffs  f the growth in the number of claims that might impact the general liability portion of insurance policies rather than the product liability portion  g responses in which specific courts have adopted measures to ameliorate the worst procedural abuses  h an increase in settlement values being paid to asbestos claimants  and i the potential that the u 
s 
congress or state legislatures may adopt legislation to address asbestos litigation issues 
management believes that these factors continue to render reserves for a e losses significantly less subject to traditional actuarial methods than reserves for other types of losses 
given these uncertainties  management believes that no meaningful range for such ultimate losses can be established 
the company establishes reserves to the extent that  in the judgment of management  the facts and prevailing law reflect an exposure for the company or its ceding companies 
in connection with the acquisition of mt 
mckinley  which has significant exposure to a e claims  prupac  a subsidiary of the prudential  provided reinsurance to mt 
mckinley covering million of the first million of any adverse development of mt 
mckinley s reserves as of september  in addition  the prudential guaranteed prupac s obligations to mt 
mckinley 
through december   cessions under this reinsurance agreement have exhausted the available remaining limits 
due to the uncertainties discussed above  the ultimate losses may vary materially from current loss reserves and  depending on coverage under the company s various reinsurance arrangements  could have a material adverse effect on the company s future financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
see also note and of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
reinsurance receivable 
the company utilizes reinsurance agreements to reduce its exposure to large claims and catastrophic loss occurrences 
these agreements provide for recovery from reinsurers of a portion of losses and loss expenses under certain circumstances without relieving the insurer of its obligation to the policyholder 
in the event reinsurers were unable to meet their obligations under these reinsurance agreements or successfully challenge losses ceded by the company under the reinsurance contracts  the company would not be able to realize the full value of the reinsurance recoverable balance 
in some cases  the company may hold partial collateral  including letters of credit and funds held arrangements  for these agreements 
the company establishes reserves for uncollectible balances based on management s assessment of the collectibility of the outstanding balances 
to minimize exposure from uncollectible reinsurance receivables  the company has a reinsurance credit security committee that generally evaluates the financial strength of a reinsurer prior to entering into a reinsurance arrangement 
additionally  creditworthy foreign reinsurers of business written in the us are generally required to secure their obligations 
management believes that adequate provision has been made for the company s uncollectible balances 
actual uncollectible amounts may vary  perhaps substantially  from such reserves  impacting income in the period in which the change is made 
see also note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
premiums written and earned 
premiums written by the company are earned ratably over the periods of the related insurance and reinsurance contracts or policies 
unearned premium reserves are established to cover the remainder of the unexpired contract period 
such reserves are established based upon reports received from ceding companies or computed using pro rata methods based on statistical data 
written and premiums earned  and the related costs  which have not yet been reported to the company are estimated and accrued 
because earned premium generally correlates with the company s estimate of its exposure base  variations in premium earnings are to a large degree offset by related variability in incurred losses and commission expense 
see also note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
investment valuation 
the company s investment portfolio consists of investments available for sale and accordingly these securities are marked to market on a quarterly basis 
most securities are traded on national exchanges where market values are readily available 
the company holds some privately placed securities that are either valued by an investment advisor or by the company using cash flow projections 
in addition  the company owns interest only strips that are accounted for in accordance with eitf  which sets forth the rules for determining when these securities must be written down to fair value due to impairment 
unrealized gains and losses from market fluctuations are reflected as comprehensive income  while market value declines that are considered other than temporary impairments are reflected in the income statement as realized capital losses 
the company considers many factors when determining whether a market value decline is other than temporary  including the length of time the market value has been below book value  the credit strength of the issuer  the issuer s market sector  the length of time to maturity and for interest only strips  increases in mortgage prepayments 
if management assessments change in the future  the company may ultimately record a realized loss after management originally concluded that the decline in value was temporary

financial condition cash and invested assets 
aggregate invested assets  including cash and short term investments  were  million at december    million at december  and  million at december  the increase in cash and invested assets in from resulted primarily from  million in cash flows from operations generated during  million of net proceeds from the offering of common shares in april and million in net unrealized appreciation of the company s investments 
the increase in cash and invested assets in from resulted primarily from million in cash flows from operations generated in  million of net proceeds from the offering of group s common shares in february  million of net proceeds from capital trust s issuance of trust preferred securities in november and million in net unrealized appreciation of the company s investments 
these increases were partially offset by million in net payments on the credit facility and million in share repurchases 
the company s current investment strategy generally seeks to maximize after tax income through a high quality  diversified  taxable and tax preferenced fixed maturity portfolio  while maintaining an adequate level of liquidity 
the company s mix of taxable and tax preferenced investments is adjusted continuously  consistent with its current and projected operating results  market conditions and tax position 
the fixed maturities in the investment portfolio are comprised of non trading available for sale securities 
commencing with the second quarter of  the company invested in interest only strips of mortgage backed securities 
these fixed maturity securities give the holder the right to receive interest payments at a stated coupon rate on an underlying pool of mortgages 
the interest payments on the outstanding mortgages are guaranteed by entities generally rated aaa 
the ultimate cash flow from these investments is primarily dependent upon the average life of the mortgage pool 
generally  as market interest rates and more specifically market mortgage rates decline  mortgagees tend to refinance which will decrease the average life of a mortgage pool and decrease expected cash flows 
conversely  as market interest rates and more specifically market mortgage rates rise  repayments will slow and the ultimate cash flows will tend to rise 
accordingly  the market value of these investments tends to increase as general interest rates rise and decline as general interest rates fall 
these movements are generally counter to the impact of interest rate movements on the company s other fixed income investments 
the market value of the interest only strips was million at december  additionally  the company invests in equity securities  which it believes will enhance the risk adjusted total return of the investment portfolio

the increases by segment generally reflect the increases in earned premium  changes in business mix and the impact of reserve recalculations together with the claim settlement activity 
the increases for a e reflect the impact of reserve re evaluations and claim settlement activity 
the company re evaluates its loss and lae reserves on an ongoing basis  including re estimates of prior period reserves  taking into consideration all available information and in particular newly reported loss and claim experience 
the effect of such re evaluations impacts incurred losses for the current period 
while there can be no assurance that reserves for  and losses from  claim obligations will not increase in the future  management believes that the company s existing reserves and reserving methodologies lessen the probability that any such increase would have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
in this context  the company notes that over the past years  its past calendar year operations have been affected variably by effects from prior period reserve re estimates with such effects ranging from a favorable million  representing of the net prior period reserves for the year in which the adjustment was made to an unfavorable million  representing of the net prior period reserves for the year in which the adjustment was made

 total net reserves excluding a e   a e all segments  na  na total net reserves  na  na  there can be no assurances that reserves will not ultimately exceed the indicated ranges requiring additional incomestatement expense 
given the uncertainties surrounding the settlement of a e losses  management is unable to establish a range for these obligations 
as a result  which relate principally to the us reinsurance and bermuda segments  have been segregated from reserves for which a range has been determined 
na  not applicable the company has included ranges for loss reserve estimates determined by the company s actuaries  which are derived through a combination of objective and subjective criteria 
depending on the specific segment  the range derived for the loss reserves  excluding reserves for a e exposures  ranges from minus to minus for the low range and from plus to plus for the high range 
the higher range is associated with the international segment  and the lower range is associated with the bermuda segment 
within each range  management s best estimate of loss reserves is based on the point estimate derived by the company s actuaries in detailed reserve studies 
such ranges are necessarily subjective due to the lack of generally accepted actuarial standards with respect to their development 
in particular  the company notes that the width of the range is dependent on the level of confidence associated with the outcome 
for the above presentation  management has assumed what it believes is a reasonable confidence level but notes that there can be no assurance that the company s claim obligations will not vary within and potentially outside of these ranges requiring incurred loss adjustments in the period the variability is recognized 
the company is not able to establish a meaningful range for a e reserves 
additional losses  including those relating to latent injuries  and other exposures  which are as yet unrecognized  the type or magnitude of which cannot be foreseen by the company  or the reinsurance and insurance industry generally  may emerge in the future 
such future emergence  to the extent not covered by existing retrocessional contracts  could have material adverse effects on the company s future financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
the company generally has exposure to a e losses through its mt 
mckinley operation with respect to insurance policies and through everest re with respect to reinsurance contracts 
in each case  the company s management and analysis of its exposures takes into account a number of features of its business that differentiate the company s exposures from many other insurers and reinsurers that have significant a e exposures 
mt 
mckinley began writing small amounts of a e exposed insurance in and increased the volume of its writings in these writings ceased in  giving mt 
mckinley an approximate year window of potential a e exposure  which is appreciably shorter than is the case for many companies with significant a e exposure 
additionally  due to changes in and standardization of policy forms  it is rare for policies in the s and s to have been issued without aggregate limits on at least the product liability coverage offered  policies issued in earlier decades are generally more at risk of not having aggregate limits 
the vast majority of mt 
mckinley s a e exposed insurance policies are excess casualty policies  with aggregate coverage limits  which by definition also have protection afforded by underlying coverage 
mt 
mckinley s attachment points vary but usually are protected by millions  often tens of millions  of dollars of underlying coverage 
the excess nature of most of mt 
mckinley s policies also offers protection against non product claims for example  claims arising under general liability coverage 
although under some circumstances an excess policy could be exposed to non product claims  such claims generally pose more of a risk to primary policies because non product claims are generally less likely to aggregate 
in addition  environmental claims arise under general liability coverage  and generally do not aggregate 
thus  these claims tend to create exposure for primary policies to a greater extent than excess policies 
virtually all of the mt 
mckinley policies that are still potentially exposed to claims have policy language providing that expenses were paid within limits rather than in addition to limits 
this is a substantial difference from primary coverage  which would most often cover expenses in addition to limits 
everest re was formed in but was not fully engaged in underwriting casualty business  under which a e exposures generally arise  until  and it effectively eliminated a e exposures through contract exclusions effected in therefore  everest re has an approximate year window of a e exposure  much shorter than that of many reinsurance companies that have significant a e exposures 
in the earlier years of its existence  everest re was not as heavily involved in casualty business as in property business  which generally is not exposed to asbestos claims 
everest re generally took smaller lines of exposure per contract than many other reinsurers operating in the casualty reinsurance market and those lines were generally also smaller than the excess limits provided by mt 
mckinley policies 
this means that the potential adverse development on everest re s reinsurance business would not be subject to the same level of volatility as would be the case for companies having greater exposures per risk 
everest re reinsured both primary and excess policies 
however  its claim experience to date indicates that the majority of its reinsurance supported excess policies 
as a result  most of everest re s exposure derives from excess policies similar to those written by mt 
mckinley 
with respect to both the mt 
mckinley and everest re operations  the company was not a member of the asbestos claims facility wellington or the center for claims resolution ccr claim settlement facilities 
insurers supporting those facilities made broad commitments concerning the application of insurance coverage to asbestos claims 
with respect to its direct insurance exposures  the fact that the company has not made those commitments may allow it to resolve insurance exposure to wellington ccr insureds more economically than if it had joined these facilities 
with respect to its reinsurance exposures  although the company was not a signatory to the wellington or ccr facilities  it has  within the bounds of its reinsurance contracts  generally supported ceding companies that were signatories 
because the insurers supporting these facilities have generally paid their exposures more quickly than non signatory insurers  the company believes that this has generally meant that it has paid its reinsurance exposure more quickly than it likely would have if it had not been subject to wellington ccr payments 
the company believes that its a e exposures are unique and differentiated from those insurers and reinsurers with appreciable a e exposure by the points noted above  but there can be no assurance that such factors will protect the company from adverse development  perhaps material  or allow it to secure advantages in the settlement of its claims obligations

at december   the gross reserves for a e losses were comprised of million representing case reserves reported by ceding companies  million representing additional case reserves established by the company on assumed reinsurance claims  million representing case reserves established by the company on direct excess insurance claims  including mt 
mckinley  and million representing reserves for ibnr 
the gross incurred losses for a e exposures increased by million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
these increases are the result of re evaluations by management reflecting additional information received from insureds and ceding companies  ongoing litigation  additional claims received and settlement activity 
management closely monitors this additional information and adjusts reserves accordingly 
the net incurred losses primarily reflect the impact of the reinsurance agreement between mt 
mckinley and prupac 
industry analysts have developed a measurement  known as the survival ratio  to compare the a e reserves among companies with such liabilities 
the survival ratio is typically calculated by dividing a company s current net reserves by the three year average of paid losses  and therefore measures the number of years that it would take to exhaust the current reserves based on historical payment patterns 
using this measurement  the company s net three year a e survival ratio was years at december  adjusting these ratios to exclude the effect of the reinsurance ceded under the reinsurance agreement with prupac  the measures rise to the equivalent of years at december  the cession of million to the stop loss reinsurance provided by prupac in connection with the acquisition of mt 
mckinley proceeds are not reflected in past net payments and effectively extend the funding available for future net payments 
because the survival ratio was developed as a comparative measure of reserve strength and not of absolute reserve adequacy  the company considers  but does not rely on  the survival ratio when evaluating its reserves 
developments in and affecting asbestos exposures in general and the company s asbestos exposures in particular  together with enhancements in the company s claim management and analytical processes  resulted in the reserve strengthening noted earlier 
these developments and actions have increased the emphasis on asbestos exposures as a separate component of the company s a e exposures 
despite the company s approach of handling a e exposures on a combined basis  management believes additional disclosure of the asbestos element of its a e exposures is appropriate 
the following tables summarize reserve and claim activity for asbestos claims  on both a gross and net of ceded reinsurance basis  for the periods indicated with particular emphasis on the differentiation of insured categories within the mt

the increase in net cash flows from operations from to was primarily due to the growth in business coupled with favorable underwriting results 
management believes that net cash flows from operating activities are generally consistent with expectations given the company s large increase in premium volume and investment portfolio 
premiums are generally collected over the policy period  which is typically one year 
however  claims related to the policies will be paid out over numerous years 
this is particularly true for casualty business 
the company is not able to predict how long this favorable premium volume trend will be sustained 
in addition to its net cash flows from operating activities  the company s investment portfolio  through normal portfolio activities  provides substantial additional liquidity

bermuda re and everest international also used trust arrangements to provide collateralization to ceding companies including affiliates 
the company generally avoids providing collateral except where required for ceding companies to receive credit from their regulators 
at december   million of letters of credit were issued and outstanding under these arrangements and substantially all were related to bermuda re and everest re s uk branch 
additionally  at december   million of assets were deposited in trust accounts 
exposure to catastrophes 
as with other reinsurers  the company s operating results and financial condition can be adversely affected by volatile and unpredictable natural and other disasters  such as hurricanes  windstorms  earthquakes  floods  fires and explosions 
any such catastrophic event could generate insured losses in one or many of the company s treaties or lines of business  including property and or casualty exposures 
although the company attempts to limit its exposure to acceptable levels  including through the purchase of reinsurance when considered to be cost effective  it is possible that an actual catastrophic event or multiple catastrophic events could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition  results of operations and cash flows of the company 
the company employs various techniques  including licensed software modeling  to assess its accumulated exposure 
such techniques are inherently more difficult to apply to non property exposures 
accumulated exposures with respect to catastrophe losses are generally summarized in terms of the probable maximum loss pml 
the company defines pml as its anticipated maximum loss  taking into account contract limits  caused by a single catastrophe affecting a broad contiguous geographic area  such as that caused by a hurricane or earthquake of such a magnitude that it is expected to occur once in every years 
management believes that the company s greatest catastrophe exposure world wide from any single event is to a european windstorm where the company estimates it has a pre tax pml exposure of million 
the company further estimates that its greatest pre tax us pml exposure  which relates to an earthquake affecting the west coast  including workers compensation exposure is million 
the second largest us exposure relates to a hurricane affecting the east coast with a pml of million 
there can be no assurance that the company will not experience losses from one or more catastrophic events that exceed  perhaps by a substantial amount  its estimated pml 
the company employs a retrocessional approach under which the company may purchase reinsurance to cover specific business written or exposure accumulations or as a corporate level retrocessional program covering the potential accumulation or aggregation of exposures across some or all of the company s operations 
all reinsurance purchasing decisions consider both the potential coverage and market conditions with respect to the pricing  terms  conditions and availability of such coverage  with the aim of securing cost effective protection 
the level of reinsurance coverage varies over time  reflecting the underwriter s and or company s view of the changing dynamics of both the underlying exposure and the reinsurance markets 
if a single catastrophe were to occur that resulted in million of gross losses and alae in an amount equivalent to the company s pml including its property and workers compensation exposures  management estimates that the effect on the company s income before and after taxes would be approximately million and million  respectively 
such impact represents approximately of the company s beginning of year capital 
for  and thus far in  the company has chosen not to purchase corporate retrocessional protection and to generally de emphasize the purchase of specific reinsurance by its underwriters reflecting the company s view that its exposures in the context of its capital and financial position do not warrant reinsurance purchases at current price levels 
for  and  the company purchased accident year aggregate excess of loss retrocession coverage  which provided up to million of recoveries per accident year if everest re s consolidated statutory basis accident year loss ratio exceeded a loss ratio attachment point provided in the contract for the respective accident years 
each arrangement provided for an adjustment premium  which reduces the net benefit by approximately  in the event that the coverage is used 
there are no remaining limits available under these coverages

the majority of these contractual obligations are the responsibility of holdings 
while the company has sufficient cash flow  liquidity  investments and access to capital markets to settle these obligations  holdings is dependent upon dividends from everest re  its operating insurance subsidiary  capital contributions from group or access to the capital markets for funding 
management is of the opinion that financial resources are or will be readily available to settle these obligations 
dividends during  and  the company declared and paid shareholder dividends of million  million and million  respectively 
as an insurance holding company  the company is partially dependent on dividends and other permitted payments from its subsidiaries to pay cash dividends to its shareholders 
the payment of dividends to group by holdings and to holdings by everest re is subject to delaware regulatory restrictions and the payment of dividends to group by bermuda re is subject to bermuda insurance regulatory restrictions 
management expects that  absent significant catastrophe losses  such restrictions should not affect everest re s ability to declare and pay dividends sufficient to support holdings general corporate needs and holdings and bermuda re s ability to declare and pay dividends sufficient to support group s general corporate needs

market sensitive instruments the sec s financial reporting release requires registrants to clarify and expand upon the existing financial statement disclosure requirements for derivative financial instruments  derivative commodity instruments  and other financial instruments collectively  market sensitive instruments 
the company does not enter into market sensitive instruments for trading purposes 
the company s current investment strategy seeks to maximize after tax income through a high quality  diversified  taxable and tax preferenced fixed maturity portfolio  while maintaining an adequate level of liquidity 
the company s mix of taxable and tax preferenced investments is adjusted continuously  consistent with its current and projected operating results  market conditions  and the company s tax position 
the fixed maturities in the investment portfolio are comprised of non trading available for sale securities 
additionally  the company invests in equity securities  which it believes will enhance the risk adjusted total return of the investment portfolio 
the company has also engaged in a small number of credit default swaps and specialized equity options 
the overall investment strategy considers the scope of present and anticipated company operations 
in particular  estimates of the financial impact resulting from non investment asset and liability transactions  together with the company s capital structure and other factors  are used to develop a net liability analysis 
this analysis includes estimated payout characteristics for which the investments of the company provide liquidity 
this analysis is considered in the development of specific investment strategies for asset allocation  duration and credit quality 
the change in overall market sensitive risk exposure principally reflects the asset changes that took place during the year  including the acquisition of interest only strips in which market value increases as interest rates rise and decreases as interest rates fall 
the addition of these securities to the portfolio has reduced the impact of interest rate shift on the entire portfolio 
the company s  million investment portfolio is principally comprised of fixed maturity securities that are subject to interest rate risk and foreign currency rate risk  and equity securities that are subject to equity price risk 
the impact of these risks on the investment portfolio is generally mitigated by changes in the value of operating assets and liabilities and their associated income statement impact 
interest rate risk is the potential change in value of the fixed maturity portfolio  including short term investments  due to change in market interest rates 
in a declining interest rate environment  it includes prepayment risk on the  million of mortgage backed securities in the  million fixed maturity portfolio 
prepayment risk results from potential accelerated principal payments that shorten the average life and thus the expected yield of the security 
the tables below display the potential impact of market value fluctuations and after tax unrealized appreciation on the fixed maturity portfolio as of december  and based on parallel basis point shifts in interest rates up and down in basis point increments 
for legal entities with a us dollar functional currency  this modeling was performed on each security individually 
to generate appropriate price estimates on mortgage backed securities  changes in prepayment expectations under different interest rate environments are taken into account 
for legal entities with a non us dollar functional currency  the effective duration of the involved portfolio of securities was used as a proxy for the market value change under the various interest rate change scenarios 
all amounts are in us dollars and are presented in millions 
in general  the reduced volatility is attributable to the company s investments in interest only strips  the effect of which was to reduce overall portfolio duration and therefore sensitivity to interest rate moves

foreign currency rate risk is the potential change in value  income and cash flow arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
each of the company s foreign operations maintains capital in the currency of the country of its geographic location consistent with local regulatory guidelines 
generally  the company prefers to maintain the capital of its foreign operations in us dollar assets  although this varies by regulatory jurisdiction in accordance with market needs 
each foreign operation may conduct business in its local currency as well as the currency of other countries in which it operates 
the primary foreign currency exposures for these foreign operations are the canadian dollar  the british pound sterling and the euro 
the company mitigates foreign exchange exposure by a general matching of the currency and duration of its assets to its corresponding operating liabilities 
in accordance with financial accounting standards board statement no 
 the company translates the assets  liabilities and income of non us dollar functional currency legal entities to the non us dollar 
this translation amount is reported as a component of other comprehensive income 
the primary functional foreign currency exposures for these foreign operations are the canadian dollar  the euro and the british pound sterling 
the tables below display the potential impact of a parallel increase and decrease in foreign exchange rates on the valuation of invested assets subject to foreign currency exposure in increments as of december  and this analysis includes the after tax impact of translation from transactional currency to functional currency as well as the after tax impact of translation from functional currency to the us dollar reporting currency 
the growth in exposure between and principally arises from increases in the level of foreign currency investments  which are generally commensurate with changes in the company s mix of business

equity risk is the potential change in market value of the common stock and preferred stock portfolios arising from changing equity prices 
the company invests in high quality common and preferred stocks that are traded on the major exchanges in the us and funds investing in such securities 
the primary objective in managing the equity portfolio is to provide long term capital growth through market appreciation and income 
the tables below display the impact on market value and after tax unrealized appreciation of a change in equity prices up and down in increments as of december  and the growth in exposure is primarily due to the growth in the equity portfolio 
all amounts are in us dollars and are presented in millions 
change in equity values in percent market value of the equity portfolio 



after tax change in unrealized appreciation change in equity values in percent market value of the equity portfolio 



after tax change in unrealized appreciation although not considered material in the context of the company s aggregate exposure to market sensitive instruments  the company has issued five specialized equity put options based on the standard poor s s p index that are market sensitive and sufficiently unique to warrant supplemental disclosure 
during  the company sold five specialized equity put options based on the s p index for total consideration  net of commission  of million 
these contracts each have a single exercise date  with maturities ranging from to years and strike prices ranging from  to 
no amounts will be payable under these contracts if the s p index is at or above the strike price on the exercise dates 
if the s p index is lower than the strike price on the applicable exercise date  the amount due will vary proportionately with the percentage the index is below the strike price 
based on historical index volatilities and trends and the december  index value  the company estimates the probability for each contract of the s p index being below the strike price on the exercise date is less than 
the theoretical maximum payouts under the contracts would occur if on each of the exercise dates the s p index value were zero 
as these specialized equity put options are derivatives within the framework of fas  the company is required to report the fair value of these instruments on its balance sheet and record any changes to fair value in its statement of operations 
the company has recorded fair values for its obligations on these specialized equity put options at december  and december  of million and million  respectively  however  the company does not believe that the ultimate settlement of these transactions is likely to require a payment that would exceed the initial consideration received or any payment at all 
as there is no active market for these instruments  the determination of their fair value is based on an industry accepted option pricing model  which requires estimates and assumptions  including those regarding volatility and expected rates of return 
the table below estimates the impact of potential movements in interest rates and the s p index  which are the principal factors affecting fair value of these instruments  looking forward from the fair value at december  and these are estimates and there can be no assurances regarding future market performance 
the asymmetrical results of the interest rate and s p index shifts reflect that the liability cannot fall below zero whereas it can increase to its theoretical maximum

safe harbor disclosure this report contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the us federal securities laws 
the company intends these forward looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward looking statements in the federal securities laws 
in some cases  these statements can be identified by the use of forward looking words such as may  will  should  could  anticipate  estimate  expect  plan  believe  predict  potential and intend 
forward looking statements contained in this report include information regarding the company s reserves for losses and lae  the adequacy of the company s provision for uncollectible balances  estimates of the company s catastrophe exposure  the effects of catastrophic events on the company s financial statements  the ability of everest re  holdings and bermuda re to pay dividends and the settlement costs of the company s specialized equity put options 
forward looking statements only reflect the company s expectations and are not guarantees of performance 
these statements involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
actual events or results may differ materially from the company s expectations 
important factors that could cause actual events or results to be materially different from the company s expectations include those discussed below under the caption risk factors 
the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
risk factors the following risk factors  in addition to the other information provided in this report  should be considered when evaluating the company 
if the circumstances contemplated by the individual risk factors materialize  the company s business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected and the trading price of the company s common shares could decline significantly 
risks relating to the company s business the company s results could be adversely affected by catastrophic events 
like all insurance and reinsurance companies  the company is exposed to unpredictable catastrophic events  including weather related and other natural catastrophes  as well as war and acts of terrorism 
any material reduction in the company s operating results caused by the occurrence of one or more catastrophes could inhibit its ability to pay dividends or to meet its interest and principal payment obligations 
the company defines a catastrophe as an event that causes a pre tax loss on property exposures of at least million and has an event date of january  or later 
by way of illustration  during the past five calendar years  pre tax catastrophe losses  net of contract specific reinsurance but before cessions under corporate reinsurance programs  were as follows calendar year pre tax catastrophe losses million million million million million if the company s loss reserves are inadequate to meet its actual losses  net income would be reduced or it could incur a loss 
the company is required to maintain reserves to cover its estimated ultimate liability of losses and loss adjustment expenses for both reported and unreported claims incurred 
these reserves are only estimates of what the company believes the settlement and administration of claims will cost based on facts and circumstances known to it 
in setting reserves for its reinsurance liabilities  the company relies on claim data supplied by its ceding companies and brokers 
this information is not always timely or accurate and can result in inaccurate loss projections 
because of the uncertainties that surround estimating loss reserves and lae  the company cannot be certain that ultimate losses will not exceed these estimates of losses and loss adjustment reserves 
if the company s reserves are insufficient to cover its actual losses and loss adjustment expenses  the company would have to augment its reserves and incur a charge to its earnings 
these charges could be material 
by way of illustration  during the past five calendar years  the reserve re estimation process affected the company s net income in the following manner calendar year effect on pre tax net income million increase million decrease no change million decrease million decrease see item  business changes in historical reserves  which provides a more detailed chart showing the effect of reserve re estimates on calendar year operating results for the past ten years 
the difficulty in estimating the company s reserves is increased because loss reserves include reserves for potential a e liabilities 
a e liabilities are especially hard to estimate for many reasons  including the long waiting periods between exposure and manifestation of any bodily injury or property damage  difficulty in identifying the source of the asbestos or environmental contamination  long reporting delays and difficulty in properly allocating liability for the asbestos or environmental damage 
legal tactics and judicial and legislative developments affecting the scope of insurers liability  which can be difficult to predict  also contribute to uncertainties in estimating reserves for a e liabilities 
the failure to accurately assess underwriting risk could reduce the company s net income or increase the company s net loss 
the company s success depends on its ability to accurately assess the risks associated with the businesses on which the risk is retained 
if the company fails to accurately assess the risks it retains  it may fail to establish adequate premium rates to cover its losses and lae 
this could reduce the company s net income and even result in an operating loss 
losses may arise from events or exposures that are not anticipated when the coverage is priced 
an example of an unanticipated event is the september attacks 
the company s loss from those attacks  after reinsurance and taxes  was million 
neither the magnitude of loss on a single line of business nor the combined impact on several lines of business from an act of terrorism on such a large scale was contemplated when the company priced its coverages 
in addition to unanticipated events  the company also faces the unanticipated expansion of its exposures  particularly in long tail liability lines 
an example of this is the ongoing expansion of the scope of insurers legal liability for a e exposures discussed above 
decreases in pricing for property and casualty reinsurance and insurance could reduce the company s net income 
the company writes primarily property and casualty reinsurance and insurance 
the worldwide reinsurance and insurance businesses are highly competitive  yet cyclical by product and market 
these cycles  as well as other business  economic and societal trends that influence aggregate supply and demand for property and casualty insurance and reinsurance products  are outside of the company s control 
the phase of the industry cycle that prevailed from through was characterized by increasingly competitive global market conditions across most lines of business  leading to decreasing prices and broadening contract terms  which in turn had a negative impact on insurers financial results and eroded the industry capital base 
these trends resulted from a number of factors  including the emergence of significant reinsurance capacity in bermuda  changes in the lloyd s market  consolidation and increased capital levels in the insurance and reinsurance industries and the emergence of new reinsurance and financial products addressing traditional exposures in alternative fashions 
this industry cycle began to reverse in  when the industry entered a period of firming prices  more restrictive terms and conditions and tightened coverage availability across most classes and markets 
these new trends were intensified and accelerated by losses from the september attacks  which reduced industry capacity and were of sufficient magnitude to cause most insurers to reassess their capital position  tolerance for risk  exposure control mechanisms and the pricing terms and conditions at which they are willing to take on risk 
additional contributing factors included deteriorating investment market conditions and results and renewed concerns regarding longer term industry specific issues  such as a e exposures 
although the industry is currently in a favorable phase of the pricing cycle  the company cannot assure that this favorable phase will continue 
many of the factors that contributed to decreasing prices during the prior phase of the cycle continue to exist and new and unanticipated factors could emerge 
any significant decrease in pricing for property and casualty insurance or reinsurance could reduce the company s ability to write business profitably and reduce its net income 
further discussion of competition issues can be found in item  business competition 
if rating agencies downgrade their ratings of the company s insurance subsidiaries  future prospects for growth and profitability could be significantly and adversely affected 
the company s insurance company subsidiaries  other than mt 
mckinley and everest international  currently hold an a superior financial strength rating from am best 
everest re  bermuda re and everest national hold an aa very strong financial strength rating from standard poor s 
everest re and bermuda re hold an aa excellent financial strength rating from moody s financial strength ratings are used by insurers and reinsurance and insurance intermediaries as an important means of assessing the financial strength and quality of reinsurers 
in addition  an unfavorable rating or the lack of a rating of its reinsurers may adversely affect the rating of a company purchasing reinsurance 
a downgrade or withdrawal of any of these ratings might adversely affect  the company s ability to market its insurance products and could have a material and adverse effect on future prospects for growth and profitability 
during the last five years  no active subsidiary of the company has experienced a credit rating downgrade 
however  the company cannot assure that no credit downgrade will ever occur in the future 
consistent with market practice  roughly to of the company s treaty reinsurance business allows the ceding company to terminate the contract or seek collateralization of the company s obligations in the event of a rating downgrade below a certain threshold 
the termination provision would generally be triggered only if a rating fell below am best s a rating level  which is three levels below everest re s current rating of a 
everest re also has more modest exposure to reinsurance contracts that contain provisions for obligatory funding of outstanding liabilities in the event of a rating agency downgrade 
that provision would also generally be triggered only if everest re s rating fell below am best s a rating level 
the company s reinsurers may not satisfy their obligations 
the company is subject to credit risk with respect to its reinsurers because the transfer of risk to a reinsurer does not relieve it of its liability to the insured 
in addition  reinsurers may be unwilling to pay the company even though they are able to do so 
the failure of one or more of the company s reinsurers to honor their obligations to it in a timely fashion would impact its cash flow and reduce its net income and could cause it to incur a significant loss 
if the company is unable or chooses not to purchase reinsurance and transfer risk to reinsurers  its net income could be reduced or it could incur a net loss in the event of an unusual loss experience 
the company is generally less reliant on the purchase of reinsurance than many of its competitors  in part because of its strategic emphasis on underwriting discipline and management of the cycles inherent in its business 
the company tries to separate its risk taking process from its risk mitigation process in order to avoid developing too great a reliance on reinsurance 
thus  the company generally evaluates  underwrites  selects and prices its products prior to consideration of reinsurance 
however  the company s underwriters generally consider purchasing reinsurance with respect to specific insurance contracts or programs  and its senior management generally considers purchasing reinsurance with respect to its overall operations  where reinsurance is deemed prudent from a risk mitigation perspective or is expected to have a positive cost benefit relationship 
since the company generally purchases reinsurance only when it expects a net benefit  the percentage of business that it reinsures  as indicated in the chart below  varies considerably from year to year  depending on its view of the relationship between cost and expected benefit for the contract period 
percentage of ceded written premiums to gross written premiums changes in the availability and cost of reinsurance  which are subject to market conditions that are outside of the company s control  have thus reduced to some extent its ability to use reinsurance to tailor the risks it assumes on a contract or program basis or to mitigate or balance exposures across its reinsurance operations 
because the company has reduced its level of reinsurance purchases  its net income could be reduced in the event of a large unreinsured event or adverse overall experience 
the company s industry is highly competitive and it may not be able to compete successfully in the future 
the company s industry is highly competitive and has experienced significant price competition over most of the last decade 
in addition  a number of new well capitalized competitors have entered the market recently  and the company expects to face further competition from new market entrants in the future 
the company competes globally in the us  bermuda and other international markets 
according to the edition of standard poor s special report on the global reinsurance industry  there are reinsurance organizations operating worldwide  from countries 
market share is largely concentrated within the top groups  one of which is the company 
the company considers the groups that have financial strength ratings generally comparable to or above it s rating to be its primary competitors 
the leaders in this market are munich re  swiss re  berkshire hathaway  hannover re and employers re 
some of these competitors have greater financial resources than the company does  have been operating for longer than the company has and have established long term and continuing business relationships throughout the industry  any of which can be a significant competitive advantage 
in addition  the company expects to face further competition in the future and may not be able to compete successfully in the future 
the company is dependent on its key personnel 
the company s success has been  and will continue to be  dependent on the ability to retain the services of existing key executive officers and to attract and retain additional qualified personnel in the future 
the loss of the services of any key executive officer or the inability to hire and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future could adversely affect the ability of the company to conduct business 
generally  the company considers key executive officers to be those individuals who have the greatest influence in setting overall policy and controlling operations chairman and chief executive officer  joseph v 
taranto age  president and chief operating officer  thomas j 
gallagher age  and executive vice president and chief financial officer  stephen l 
limauro age 
of those three officers  the company only has an employment contract with mr 
taranto 
that contract has been previously filed with the sec and was most recently amended on april  to extend mr 
taranto s term of employment from march  until march  the company is not aware that any of the above three officers are planning to leave the company or retire in the near future 
the company does not maintain any key employee insurance on any of its employees 
special considerations apply to the company s bermuda operations 
under bermuda law  non bermudians  other than spouses of bermudians and individuals holding permanent resident certificates  are not permitted to engage in any gainful occupation in bermuda without a work permit issued by the bermuda government 
a work permit is only granted or extended if the employer can show that  after a proper public advertisement  no bermudian  spouse of a bermudian or individual holding a permanent resident certificate is available who meets the minimum standards for the position 
the bermuda government has announced a policy that places a six year term limit on individuals with work permits  subject to specified exemptions for persons deemed to be key employees 
currently  all four of the company s bermuda based professional employees who require work permits have been granted permits by the bermuda government that expire at various times between july and may this includes peter j 
bennett  the chief executive officer of the company s bermuda reinsurance operation 
in the event his work permit were not renewed  the company could lose his services  thereby adversely affecting its ability to conduct its business in bermuda until it was able to replace him with an individual in bermuda who did not require a work permit or who was granted the permit 
the value of the company s investment portfolio and the investment income it receives from that portfolio could decline as a result of market fluctuations and economic conditions 
a significant portion of the company s investment portfolio consists of fixed income securities and a smaller portion consists of equity securities 
both the fair market value of these assets and the investment income from these assets fluctuate depending on general economic and market conditions 
for example  the fair market value of the company s fixed income securities generally increases or decreases in an inverse relationship with fluctuations in interest rates 
the fair market value of its fixed income securities can also decrease as a result of any downturn in the business cycle that causes the credit quality of those securities to deteriorate 
the net investment income that the company realizes from future investments in fixed income securities will generally increase or decrease with interest rates 
interest rate fluctuations also can cause net investment income from investments that carry prepayment risk  such as mortgage backed and other asset backed securities  to differ from the income anticipated from those securities at the time of purchase 
in addition  if issuers of individual investments are unable to meet their obligations  investment income will be reduced and realized capital losses may arise 
because all of the company s securities are classified as available for sale  changes in the market value of its securities are reflected in its financial statements 
similar treatment is not available for liabilities 
as a result  a decline in the value of the securities in the company s portfolio could reduce its net income or cause it to incur a loss

the company may experience foreign currency exchange losses 
the company s functional currency is the us dollar 
however  the company writes a portion of its business in currencies other than us dollars 
during the year ended december   the company wrote approximately of its reinsurance coverages in currencies other than us dollars 
the company also maintains a portion of its investment portfolio in investments denominated in currencies other than us dollars 
as of december   the company maintained approximately of its investment portfolio in investments denominated in currencies other than us dollars 
consequently  quarterly exchange rate fluctuations may have a material impact on the company s quarterly net income 
during    the impact on the company s quarterly pre tax net income from exchange rate fluctuations ranged from a loss of million to a gain of million 
further discussion of foreign currency rate risk can be found in item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations market sensitive instruments 
risks relating to regulation insurance laws and regulations restrict the company s ability to operate and any failure to comply with those laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on its business 
the company is subject to extensive regulation under us  state and foreign insurance laws 
these laws limit the amount of dividends that can be paid to the company by its operating subsidiaries  impose restrictions on the amount and type of investments that the company can hold  prescribe solvency standards that must be met and maintained and require the company to maintain reserves 
these laws also require disclosure of material intercompany transactions and require prior approval of extraordinary transactions 
these extraordinary transactions include declaring dividends from operating subsidiaries that exceed statutory thresholds 
these laws also generally require approval of changes of control of insurance companies 
the application of these laws could affect the company s liquidity and ability to pay dividends  interest and other payments on securities  as applicable  and could restrict the ability to expand business operations through acquisitions of new insurance subsidiaries 
in addition  the company cannot assure that it will have or can maintain all required licenses and approvals or that its business fully complies with the wide variety of applicable laws and regulations or the relevant authority s interpretation of the laws and regulations 
if the company does not have the requisite licenses and approvals or does not comply with applicable regulatory requirements  the insurance regulatory authorities could preclude or temporarily suspend the company from carrying on some or all activities or monetarily penalize the company 
these types of actions could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
to date  no material fine  penalty or restriction has been imposed on the company for failure to comply with any insurance law or regulation 
regulatory challenges in the us could adversely affect the ability of bermuda re to conduct business 
bermuda re does not intend to be licensed or admitted as an insurer or reinsurer in any us jurisdiction 
under current law  bermuda re generally will be permitted to reinsure us risks from its office in bermuda without obtaining those licenses 
however  the insurance and reinsurance regulatory framework has become subject to increased scrutiny 
in the past  there have been congressional and other initiatives in the us regarding increased supervision and regulation of the insurance industry  including proposals to supervise and regulate reinsurers domiciled outside the us if bermuda re were to become subject to any insurance laws of the us or any us state at any time in the future  it might be required to post deposits or maintain minimum surplus levels and might be prohibited from engaging in lines of business or from writing types of policies 
complying with those laws could have a material adverse effect on the company s ability to conduct business in the bermuda market 
bermuda re may need to be licensed or admitted in additional jurisdictions to develop its business 
as bermuda re s business develops  it will monitor the need to obtain licenses in jurisdictions other than bermuda in order to comply with applicable law or to be able to engage in additional insurance related activities 
in addition  bermuda re may be at a competitive disadvantage in jurisdictions where it is not licensed or does not enjoy an exemption from licensing relative to competitors that are so licensed or exempt from licensing 
bermuda re may not be able to obtain any additional licenses that it determines are necessary or desirable 
furthermore  the process of obtaining those licenses is often costly and may take a long time 
bermuda re s ability to write reinsurance may be severely limited if it is unable to arrange for security to back its reinsurance 
many jurisdictions do not permit insurance companies to take credit for reinsurance obtained from unlicensed or non admitted insurers on their statutory financial statements without appropriate security 
bermuda re s reinsurance clients typically require it to post a letter of credit or enter into other security arrangements 
if bermuda re is unable to obtain or maintain a letter of credit facility on commercially acceptable terms or is unable to arrange for other types of security  its ability to operate its business may be severely limited 
if bermuda re defaults on any letter of credit that it obtains  it may be required to prematurely liquidate a substantial portion of its investment portfolio and other assets pledged as collateral 
risks relating to the company s securities because of the company s holding company structure  its ability to pay dividends  interest and principal is dependent on its receipt of dividends  loan payments and other funds from its subsidiaries 
the company and holdings are holding companies  each of whose most significant assets consists of the stock of their operating subsidiaries 
as a result  each of the company s and holdings ability to pay dividends  interest or other payments on its securities in the future will depend on the earnings and cash flows of the operating subsidiaries and the ability of the subsidiaries to pay dividends or to advance or repay funds to it 
this ability is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  regulatory and other factors beyond the company s control 
payment of dividends and advances and repayments from some of the operating subsidiaries are regulated by us  state and foreign insurance laws and regulatory restrictions  including minimum solvency and liquidity thresholds 
accordingly  the operating subsidiaries may not be able to pay dividends or advance or repay funds to the company and holdings in the future  which could prevent it from paying dividends  interest or other payments on its securities 
provisions in the company s bye laws could have an anti takeover effect  which could diminish the value of its common shares 
the company s bye laws contain provisions that may entrench directors and make it more difficult for shareholders to replace directors even if the shareholders consider it beneficial to do so 
in addition  these provisions could delay or prevent a change of control that a shareholder might consider favorable 
the effect of these provisions could be to prevent a shareholder from receiving the benefit from any premium over the market price of our common shares offered by a bidder in a potential takeover 
even in the absence of an attempt to effect a change in management or a takeover attempt  these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common shares if they are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future 
for example  the company s bye laws contain the following provisions that could have an anti takeover effect election of directors is staggered  meaning that the members of only one of three classes of directors are selected each year  shareholders have limited ability to remove directors  the total voting power of any shareholder owning more than of the common shares will be reduced to of the total voting power of the common shares  the board of directors may decline to register any transfer of common shares if it has reason to believe that the transfer would result in any person that is not an investment company beneficially owning more than of any class of the issued and outstanding share capital of the company  any person holding controlled shares in excess of of any class of the issued and outstanding share capital of the company  or any adverse tax  regulatory or legal consequences to the company  any of its subsidiaries or any of its shareholders  the company also has the option to redeem or purchase all or part of a shareholder s common shares to the extent the board of directors determines it is necessary or advisable to avoid or cure any adverse or potential adverse consequences if any person that is not an investment company beneficially owns more than of any class of the issued and outstanding share capital of the company  any person holds controlled shares in excess of of any class of the issued and outstanding share capital of the company  or share ownership by any person may result in adverse tax  regulatory or legal consequences to the company  any of its subsidiaries or any other shareholder 
applicable insurance laws may also have an anti takeover effect 
before a person can acquire control of a us insurance company  prior written approval must be obtained from the insurance commissioner of the state where that insurance company is domiciled 
prior to granting approval of an application to acquire control of a domestic insurance company  a state insurance commissioner will consider such factors as the financial strength of the applicant  the integrity and competence of the applicant s board of directors and executive officers  the acquiror s plans for changes to the insurance company s board of directors and executive officers  the acquiror s plans for the future operations of the insurance company and any anti competitive results that may arise from the consummation of the acquisition of control 
because any person who acquired control of the company would thereby acquire indirect control of its insurance company subsidiaries in the us  the insurance change of control laws of delaware  arizona  california and georgia would apply to such a transaction 
this could have the effect of delaying or even preventing such a change of control 
investors in the company may have more difficulty in protecting their interests than investors in a us corporation 
the companies act of bermuda the companies act  differs in material respects from the laws applicable to us corporations and their shareholders 
the following is a summary of material differences between the companies act  as modified in some instances by provisions of the company s bye laws  and delaware corporate law that could make it more difficult for investors in the company to protect their interests than investors in a us corporation 
because the following statements are summaries  they do not address all aspects of bermuda law that may be relevant to the company and its shareholders 
alternate directors 
the company s bye laws provide  as permitted by bermuda law  that each director may appoint an alternate director  who shall have the power to attend and vote at any meeting of the board of directors or committee at which that director is not personally present and to sign written consents in place of that director 
delaware law does not provide for alternate directors 
committees of the board of directors 
the company s bye laws provide  as permitted by bermuda law  that the board of directors may delegate any of its powers to committees that the board appoints  and those committees may consist partly or entirely of non directors 
delaware law allows the board of directors of a corporation to delegate many of its powers to committees  but those committees may consist only of directors 
interested directors 
bermuda law and the company s bye laws provide that if a director has a personal interest in a transaction to which the company is also a party and if the director discloses the nature of this personal interest at the first opportunity  either at a meeting of directors or in writing to the directors  then the company will not be able to declare the transaction void solely due to the existence of that personal interest and the director will not be liable to the company for any profit realized from the transaction 
in addition  after a director has made the declaration of interest referred to above  he or she is allowed to be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present and to vote on a transaction in which he or she has an interest  unless disqualified from doing so by the chairman of the relevant board meeting 
under delaware law  a corporation may be able to declare a transaction with an interested director to be void unless one of the following conditions is fulfilled the material facts as to the interested director s relationship or interests are disclosed or are known to the board of directors and the board in good faith authorizes the transaction by the affirmative vote of a majority of the disinterested directors  the material facts are disclosed or are known to the shareholders entitled to vote on the transaction and the transaction is specifically approved in good faith by the holders of a majority of the voting shares or the transaction is fair to the corporation as of the time it is authorized  approved or ratified 
under delaware law  an interested director could be held liable for a transaction in which that director derived an improper personal benefit 
transactions with significant shareholders 
as a bermuda company  the company may enter into business transactions with its significant shareholders  including asset sales  in which a significant shareholder receives  or could receive  a financial benefit that is greater than that received  or to be received  by other shareholders with prior approval from the company s board of directors but without obtaining prior approval from the shareholders 
in the case of an amalgamation  in which two or more companies join together and continue as a single company  a resolution of shareholders approved by a majority of at least of the votes cast is required in addition to the approval of the board of directors  except in the case of an amalgamation with and between wholly owned subsidiaries 
if the company were a delaware corporation  any business combination with an interested shareholder which  for this purpose  would include mergers and asset sales of greater than of the company s assets that would otherwise be considered transactions in the ordinary course of business within a period of three years from the time the person became an interested shareholder would require prior approval from shareholders holding at least of the company s outstanding common shares not owned by the interested shareholder  unless the transaction qualified for one of the exemptions in the relevant delaware statute or the company opted out of the statute 
for purposes of the delaware statute  an interested shareholder is generally defined as a person who together with that person s affiliates and associates owns  or within the previous three years did own  or more of a corporation s outstanding voting shares 
takeovers 
under bermuda law  if an acquiror makes an offer for shares of a company and  within four months of the offer  the holders of not less than of the shares that are the subject of the offer tender their shares  the acquiror may give the nontendering shareholders notice requiring them to transfer their shares on the terms of the offer 
within one month of receiving the notice  dissenting shareholders may apply to the court objecting to the transfer 
the burden is on the dissenting shareholders to show that the court should exercise its discretion to enjoin the transfer 
the court will be unlikely to do this unless there is evidence of fraud or bad faith or collusion between the acquiror and the tendering shareholders aimed at unfairly forcing out minority shareholders 
under another provision of bermuda law  the holders of of the shares of a company the acquiring shareholders may give notice to the remaining shareholders requiring them to sell their shares on the terms described in the notice 
within one month of receiving the notice  dissenting shareholders may apply to the court for an appraisal of their shares 
within one month of the court s appraisal  the acquiring shareholders are entitled either to acquire all shares involved at the price fixed by the court or cancel the notice given to the remaining shareholders 
if shares were acquired under the notice at a price below the court s appraisal price  the acquiring shareholders must either pay the difference in price or cancel the notice and return the shares thus acquired to the shareholder  who must then refund the purchase price 
there are no comparable provisions under delaware law 
inspection of corporate records 
members of the general public have the right to inspect the public documents of the company available at the office of the registrar of companies and the company s registered office  both in bermuda 
these documents include the memorandum of association  which describes the company s permitted purposes and powers  any amendments to the memorandum of association and documents relating to any increase or reduction in the company s authorized share capital 
shareholders of the company have the additional right to inspect the company s bye laws  minutes of general meetings of shareholders and audited financial statements that must be presented to the annual general meeting of shareholders 
the register of shareholders of the company also is open to inspection by shareholders without charge  and to members of the public for a fee 
the company is required to maintain its share register at its registered office in bermuda 
the company also maintains a branch register in the offices of its transfer agent in the us  which is open for public inspection as required under the companies act 
the company is required to keep at its registered office a register of its directors and officers that is open for inspection by members of the public without charge 
however  bermuda law does not provide a general right for shareholders to inspect or obtain copies of any other corporate records 
under delaware law  any shareholder may inspect or obtain copies of a corporation s shareholder list and its other books and records for any purpose reasonably related to that person s interest as a shareholder 
shareholder s suits 
the rights of shareholders under bermuda law are not as extensive as the rights of shareholders under legislation or judicial precedent in many us jurisdictions 
class actions and derivative actions are generally not available to shareholders under the laws of bermuda 
however  the bermuda courts ordinarily would be expected to follow english case law precedent  which would permit a shareholder to bring an action in the name of the company to remedy a wrong done to the company where the act complained of is alleged to be beyond the corporate power of the company or illegal or would result in the violation of the company s memorandum of association or bye laws 
furthermore  the court would give consideration to acts that are alleged to constitute a fraud against the minority shareholders or where an act requires the approval of a greater percentage of the company s shareholders than actually approved it 
the winning party in an action of this type generally would be able to recover a portion of attorneys fees incurred in connection with the action 
under delaware law  class actions and derivative actions generally are available to stockholders for breach of fiduciary duty  corporate waste and actions not taken in accordance with applicable law 
in these types of actions  the court has discretion to permit the winning party to recover its attorneys fees 
limitation of liability of directors and officers 
the company s bye laws provide that the company and its shareholders waive all claims or rights of action that they might have  individually or in the right of the company  against any director or officer for any act or failure to act in the performance of that director s or officer s duties 
however  this waiver does not apply to claims or rights of action that arise out of fraud or dishonesty 
this waiver may have the effect of barring claims arising under us federal securities laws 
under delaware law  a corporation may include in its certificate of incorporation provisions limiting the personal liability of its directors to the corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for many types of breach of fiduciary duty 
however  these provisions may not limit liability for any breach of the duty of loyalty  acts or omissions not in good faith or that involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law  the authorization of unlawful dividends  stock repurchases or stock redemptions  or any transaction from which a director derived an improper personal benefit 
moreover  these provisions would not be likely to bar claims arising under us federal securities laws 
indemnification of directors and officers 
the company s bye laws provide that the company shall indemnify its directors or officers to the full extent permitted by law against all actions  costs  charges  liabilities  loss  damage or expense incurred or suffered by them by reason of any act done  concurred in or omitted in the conduct of the company s business or in the discharge of their duties 
under bermuda law  this indemnification may not extend to any matter involving fraud or dishonesty of which a director or officer may be guilty in relation to the company  as determined in a final judgment or decree not subject to appeal 
under delaware law  a corporation may indemnify a director or officer who becomes a party to an action  suit or proceeding because of his position as a director or officer if the director or officer acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation and if the action or proceeding involves a criminal offense  the director or officer had no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful 
enforcement of civil liabilities 
the company is organized under the laws of bermuda 
some of its directors and officers may reside outside the us a substantial portion of the company s assets are or may be located in jurisdictions outside the us a person may not be able to effect service of process within the us on directors and officers of the company and those experts who reside outside the us a person also may not be able to recover against them or the company on judgments of us courts or to obtain original judgments against them or the company in bermuda courts  including judgments predicated upon civil liability provisions of the us federal securities laws 
dividends 
bermuda law does not allow a company to declare or pay a dividend  or make a distribution out of contributed surplus  if there are reasonable grounds for believing that the company  after the payment is made  would be unable to pay its liabilities as they become due  or that the realizable value of the company s assets would be less  as a result of the payment  than the aggregate of its liabilities and its issued share capital and share premium accounts 
the share capital account represents the aggregate par value of the company s issued shares  and the share premium account represents the aggregate amount paid for issued shares over and above their par value 
under delaware law  subject to any restrictions contained in the company s certificate of incorporation  a company may pay dividends out of the surplus or  if there is no surplus  out of net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared and or the preceding fiscal year 
surplus is the amount by which the net assets of a corporation exceed its stated capital 
delaware law also provides that dividends may not be paid out of net profits at any time when stated capital is less than the capital represented by the outstanding stock of all classes having a preference upon the distribution of assets 
risks relating to taxation if us tax law changes  the company s net income may be reduced 
in the last few years  some members of congress have expressed concern about us corporations that move their place of incorporation to low tax jurisdictions 
also  some members of congress have expressed concern over a competitive advantage that foreign controlled insurers and reinsurers may have over us controlled insurers and reinsurers due to the purchase of reinsurance by us insurers from affiliates operating in some foreign jurisdictions  including bermuda 
legislation has recently been proposed in congress that would increase the us tax burden on so called inverting companies and increase the us tax burden on related party reinsurance transactions 
the company does not know whether this legislation or any similar legislation will ever be enacted into law 
if it were enacted  the us tax burden on the company s bermuda operations  or on some business ceded from its licensed us insurance subsidiaries to some offshore reinsurers  could be increased 
this could reduce the company s net income 
the company and or bermuda re may be subject to us corporate income tax  which would reduce the company s net income 
the income of bermuda re is a significant portion of the company s worldwide income from operations 
the company has established guidelines for the conduct of its bermuda operations that are designed to ensure that bermuda re is not engaged in the conduct of a trade or business in the us based on its compliance with those guidelines  the company believes that bermuda re should not be required to pay us corporate income tax  other than withholding tax on us source dividend income 
however  if the internal revenue service irs successfully contended that bermuda re was engaged in a trade or business in the us  bermuda re would be required to pay us corporate income tax on any income that is subject to the taxing jurisdiction of the us  and possibly the us branch profits tax 
even if the irs successfully contended that bermuda re was engaged in a us trade or business  the us bermuda tax treaty would preclude the irs from taxing bermuda re s income except to the extent that its income were attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by that subsidiary 
the company does not believe that bermuda re has a permanent establishment in the us if the irs successfully contended that bermuda re did have income attributable to a permanent establishment in the us  it would be subject to us tax on that income 
the company conducts its barbados operations in a manner designed to minimize its us tax exposure 
based on its compliance with guidelines designed to ensure that it generates only immaterial amounts  if any  of income that is subject to the taxing jurisdiction of the us  the company believes that it should be required to pay only immaterial amounts  if any  of us corporate income tax  other than withholding tax on us source dividend income 
however  if the irs successfully contended that the company had material amounts of income that is subject to the taxing jurisdiction of the us  it would be required to pay us corporate income tax on that income  and possibly the us branch profits tax 
even if the irs successfully contended that the company had material amounts of income that is subject to the taxing jurisdiction of the us  the us barbados tax treaty would preclude the irs from taxing its income  except to the extent that its income was attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by it in the us the company does not believe that it has material amounts of income attributable to a permanent establishment in the us if the irs successfully contended  however  that the company did have income attributable to a permanent establishment in the us  it would be subject to us tax on that income 
if bermuda re became subject to us income tax on its income or if it became subject to us income tax on more than immaterial amounts of income  its income could also be subject to the us branch profits tax 
in that event  the company and bermuda re would be subject to taxation at a higher combined effective rate than if they were organized as us corporations 
the combined effect of the us corporate income tax rate and the branch profits tax rate is a net tax rate of 
the imposition of these taxes would reduce the company s net income 
the organization for economic cooperation and development and the european union are considering measures that might increase the company s taxes and reduce our net income 
a number of multinational organizations  including the organization for economic cooperation and development the oecd  the european union  the financial action task force and the financial stability forum the fsf  have all recently identified some countries as not participating in adequate information exchange  engaging in harmful tax practices or not maintaining adequate controls to prevent corruption  such as money laundering activities 
the oecd has threatened non member jurisdictions that do not agree to cooperate with the oecd with punitive sanctions by oecd member countries  though specific sanctions have yet to be adopted by oecd member countries 
it is as yet unclear as to what these sanctions will be  who will adopt them and when or if they will be imposed 
on april   the oecd published a list of uncooperative tax havens  which are those jurisdictions from whom the oecd has not received commitments to the oecd s principles of regulatory and tax transparency and effective exchange of information 
the governments of both bermuda and barbados have made these commitments 
as a result  neither bermuda nor barbados is currently listed as an uncooperative tax haven 
however  it is possible that the oecd could change its view in the future and decide to list bermuda or barbados as an uncooperative tax haven  or that one of the other multinational organizations could take a different view from the oecd and decide to recommend sanctions against bermuda or barbados 
any sanctions imposed on bermuda or barbados could increase the company s taxes and reduce its net income 
in addition  the company is not able to predict what changes will arise from the commitments given to the oecd by the governments of bermuda and barbados or whether those changes will subject it to additional taxes 
the company and or bermuda re may become subject to bermuda tax  which would reduce the company s net income 
the company and bermuda re currently are not subject to income or capital gains taxes in bermuda 
both companies have received an assurance from the bermuda minister of finance under the exempted undertakings tax protection act of bermuda to the effect that if any legislation is enacted in bermuda that imposes any tax computed on profits or income  or computed on any capital asset  gain or appreciation  or any tax in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax  then that tax will not apply to them or to any of the company s operations or its shares  debentures or other obligations until march  this assurance does not prevent the application of any of those taxes to persons ordinarily resident in bermuda and does not prevent the imposition of any tax payable in accordance with the provisions of the land tax act of bermuda or otherwise payable in relation to any land leased to the company or bermuda re 
there are currently no procedures for extending these assurances 
as a result  the company and bermuda re could be subject to taxes in bermuda after march   which could reduce the company s net income 
the company may become subject to barbados tax  which would reduce the company s net income 
the company has obtained an international business company license under the barbados international business companies act  based on this license  the company is entitled to special tax benefits  including a preferred rate of tax on profits and gains and an exemption from withholding tax in respect of any dividends  interest  royalties  fees or management fees deemed to be paid to another international business company or to a person not resident in barbados 
the company also has obtained from the ministry of economic development a fifteen year guarantee in accordance with section of the international business companies act with regards to its continued eligibility for this preferred status 
this guarantee is applicable until and is subject to negative resolution  which means that this guarantee can be revoked at any time 
in addition  there are currently no procedures for extending this guarantee 
as a result  the company could be ineligible for these benefits after that period or earlier if the guarantee is revoked  which could reduce the company s net income 
the company s net income will be reduced if us excise and withholding taxes are increased 
bermuda re is subject to an excise tax on reinsurance and insurance premiums it collects with respect to risks located in the us in addition  bermuda re may be subject to withholding tax on dividend income from us sources 
these taxes could increase and other taxes could be imposed in the future on bermuda re s business  which could reduce the company s net income
