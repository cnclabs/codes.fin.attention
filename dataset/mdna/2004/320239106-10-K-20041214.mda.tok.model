item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the information presented in the following discussion of financial results of first financial is largely indicative of the activities of its operating subsidiary  first federal  which comprises the substantial majority of the consolidated net income  revenues and assets of the company 
another growing segment of the company is insurance activities 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected consolidated financial data contained in item of this report and the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes contained in item of this report 
first financial s net income was million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal  declining by 
basic and diluted earnings per share in declined to and  respectively  compared with and  respectively  in net income was million in  with basic and diluted earnings per share of and  respectively 
net earnings resulted in a return on average equity of  and for the years ended september   and  respectively 
the return on average assets for the three years ended september  was  and  respectively 
first financial s earnings declined in fiscal as a result of several factors 
most notable was a million decline in gains from the sales of loans  which had been expected as a result of reductions in refinance activity from fiscal to fiscal the company s net interest income declined by million during the year as compared with the prior year  due principally to a lower net interest margin of in fiscal compared with in fiscal  offset partially by a million increase in average earning assets 
excluding gains on loans sales  income from other non interest revenue sources increased million over fiscal and increases in non interest expense slowed to million from year ago levels 
first financial s net income decreased million in fiscal  or approximately  from fiscal as market interest rates declined during the period  loan production levels dramatically increased with increased refinance activity adding materially to loan sales but also resulting in lower balances of loans receivable 
the company s net interest margin declined to in fiscal from in fiscal average earning asset levels also declined and the combination of these factors lead to a million decline in net interest income 
non interest revenues increased million during fiscal while non interest expenses increased million 
the company has continued to execute stock repurchase programs 
on may   first financial announced that its board of directors had authorized the repurchase of up to  shares of first financial s common stock 
approximately  shares were repurchased under the program in fiscal and an additional  shares were repurchased during fiscal this program followed a stock repurchase program authorized by the board on october  to acquire up to  shares 
during fiscal  the company completed the repurchase program at a final cost of million 
average diluted shares for fiscal years ended september  and declined by  shares and  shares  respectively  due principally to the execution of these stock repurchase programs 
critical accounting policies first financial s accounting policies are discussed in item  note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
of these significant accounting policies  first financial has determined that accounting for allowance for loan losses  income taxes  mortgage servicing rights and accounting for acquisitions are deemed critical because of the valuation techniques used  and the sensitivity of these financial statement amounts to the methods  assumptions and estimates underlying these balances 
accounting for these critical areas requires the most subjective and complex judgments  and could be subject to revision as new information becomes available 
as explained in note and note of notes to the consolidated financial statements  the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
this estimate is based on the current economy s impact on the timing and expected amounts of future cash flows on impaired loans  as well as historical loss experience associated with homogenous pools of loans 
the company s assessments may be impacted in future periods by changes in economic conditions  the impact of regulatory examinations  and the discovery of information with respect to borrowers  which is not known to management at the time of the issuance of the consolidated financial statements 
for additional discussion concerning the company s allowance and related matters  see financial position allowance for loan losses 
accounting for mortgage servicing rights is more fully discussed in note and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements and is another area heavily dependent on current economic conditions  especially the interest rate environment  and management s estimates 
the company utilizes the expertise of a third party consultant to determine this asset s value 
the consultant utilizes estimates for the amount and timing of mortgage loan repayments  estimated prepayment rates  credit loss experience  costs to service loans and discount rates to determine an estimate of the fair value of our mortgage servicing rights asset 
management believes that the modeling techniques and assumptions used by the consultant are reasonable 
the income tax amounts disclosed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements reflect the current period income tax expense for all periods shown  as well as future tax liabilities associated with differences in the timing of expenses and income recognition for book and tax accounting purposes 
the income tax returns  usually filed nine months after year end  are subject to review and possible revision by the tax authorities up until the statue of limitations has expired 
these statues usually expire three years after the time the respective tax returns have been filed 
acquisitions by the company are made through the use of the purchase method of accounting and are more fully discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company relies heavily on third party expertise in the valuing of all acquisitions 
management relies on historical as well as pro forma balance sheet and income statement information to determine these values 
these estimated fair values are subject to change as economic and market specific conditions change 
the company tests goodwill for impairment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
potential impairment of goodwill exists when the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its implied fair value 
the fair value for each reporting unit is computed using one or a combination of the following three methods income  market value  or cost method 
the company used the cost method to determine if goodwill was impaired 
the cost method assumes the net assets of recent business combinations accounted for under the purchase method of accounting will be recorded at fair value if no event or circumstance has occurred triggering a decline in value 
to the extent a reporting unit s carrying amount exceeds its fair value  an indication exists that the reporting unit s goodwill may be impaired and a second step of impairment test will be performed 
for additional discussion  see item  note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
impairment of goodwill was not required based on the most current analysis 
acquisitions on january   first financial acquired the following companies the kimbrell company  inc  the kimbrell company  inc 
florida  preferred markets  inc  preferred markets  inc 
florida  and atlantic acceptance corporation 
the kimbrell companies are a managing general agency specializing in placing coverage within the non standard insurance market 
non standard markets offer coverage to customers that have unusual or high risk exposures 
the preferred markets companies are a managing general agency specializing in placing coverage in standard insurance markets 
atlantic acceptance corporation is a premium finance company 
on june   first financial acquired the southeast portion of the claim access and assets of mca administrators  inc based in pittsburgh  pennsylvania 
the business acquired was consolidated with benefit administrators  inc  an affiliate company of johnson insurance associates  inc johnson insurance 
johnson insurance was acquired in fiscal and is a subsidiary of fsins 
benefit administrators  inc provides third party administrative services for self insured health insurance plans 
on march   first financial acquired the operations of woodruff company  inc woodruff  an independent insurance agency based in columbia  south carolina 
woodruff s operations were merged into johnson insurance 
one of the stated long term objectives of the company is diversification of its revenue sources 
increasingly  the company has sought to achieve this objective through either the purchase of insurance agencies or assets of insurance agencies 
the company also believes these acquisitions present significant cross sales opportunities and provides the company with the ability to offer an expanded menu of products to customers 
financial position at september   first financial s assets totaled billion  increasing by  or million  from september  first financial s assets grew only moderately during the year  reflecting an increase in commercial and consumer loan demand while residential mortgage loans declined during the year 
the change in assets during fiscal was principally attributable to increases of million in investment securities available for sale  million in net loans receivable and loans held for sale  million in mortgage backed securities  million in office properties and equipment  million in intangible assets  and million in other assets 
average assets increased by during the year and average interest earning assets increased by 
at september   first financial s assets totaled billion  increasing slightly  by  or million  from september  the change in assets was principally attributable to an increase of million in mortgage backed securities  offset by a decline of million in net loans receivable and loans held for sale 
lower market interest rates in fiscal led to record fixed rate residential loan originations 
agency qualifying fixed rate mortgage loan originations are normally sold by the company  increasing loan sales substantially in fiscal and also precipitating lower levels of residential loans held in the company s loan portfolio 
investment securities and mortgage backed securities at september   available for sale securities totaled million compared to million at september  average balances of available for sale securities increased dramatically to million during fiscal from million during fiscal purchases of available for sale securities totaled million during the year ended september  the company also swapped million of family residential mortgages for additional mortgage backed securities 
the company increased purchases of mortgage backed securities to augment earning asset growth during fiscal the company has funded this growth in investments and mortgage backed securities principally with short term borrowings and proceeds from the company s issuance of debt securities 
the primary objective of the company in its management of the investment and mortgage backed securities portfolio is to maintain a portfolio of high quality  highly liquid investments with returns competitive with short term us treasury or agency securities and highly rated corporate securities 
the association is required to maintain an adequate amount of liquidity to ensure safe and sound operations 
the association has maintained balances in short term investments and mortgage backed securities based on a continuing assessment of cash flows  the level of loan production  current interest rate risk strategies and the assessment of the potential future direction of market interest rate changes 
loans receivable loans comprise the largest portion of interest earning assets of the company  accounting for and of average interest earning assets in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
compared with balances on september   net loans receivable increased by million during fiscal loans held for sale declined million to million at september  residential real estate loan originations were lower in fiscal than in fiscal primarily as a result of less demand for refinances after the record year in fiscal residential real estate loan balances declined during the period while other categories of loans increased 
the company s loan portfolio consists of real estate mortgage and construction loans  home equity  mobile home and other consumer loans  credit card receivables and commercial business loans 
the company believes that the increase in consumer and commercial loans and lower levels of single family mortgage loans will have a positive effect of the overall yield on the loan portfolio 
however  these loans generally have higher credit risks than single family residential loans  a significant factor in the growth of net loan charge offs during recent years 
asset quality the company believes it maintains a conservative philosophy regarding its lending mix as well as its underwriting guidelines 
the company also maintains loan quality monitoring policies and systems that require detailed monthly and quarterly analyses of delinquencies  nonperforming loans  real estate owned and other repossessed assets 
reports of such loans and assets by various categories are reviewed by management and the board of directors of the association 
the majority of the company s loan originations are in coastal south carolina and north carolina and inland in florence county  south carolina 
as a result of management s ongoing review of the loan portfolio  loans are classified as non accruing when uncertainty exists about the ultimate collection of principal and interest under the original terms 
the company closely monitors trends in problem assets which include non accrual loans  loans days or more delinquent  renegotiated loans  and real estate and other assets acquired in settlement of loans 
renegotiated loans are those loans on which the company has agreed to modifications of the terms of the loan such as changes in the interest rate charged and or other concessions 
the following table illustrates trends in problem assets and other asset quality indicators over the past five years 
table problem assets dollars in thousands at september  non accrual loans      accruing loans days or more delinquent renegotiated loans   real estate and other assets acquired in settlement of loans   as a percent of loans receivable and real estate and other assets acquired in settlement of loans as a percent of total assets allowance for loan losses as a percent of problem loans net charge offs to average loans outstanding problem assets were million at september   or

of loans receivable and real estate and other assets acquired in settlement of loans 
at september   problem assets were million  or 
of assets and 
of loans receivable and real estate and other assets acquired in settlement of loans 
loans on non accrual declined to million at september  from million at september  real estate and other assets in settlement of loans remained at million from september  management s long term goals continue to include lower ratios of problem assets to total assets  although management expects there will always remain a core level of delinquent loans and real estate acquired in settlement of loans from normal lending operations 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses allowance is maintained at a level sufficient to provide for estimated probable losses in the loan portfolio at each reporting date 
management reviews the adequacy of the allowance no less frequently than each quarter  utilizing its internal portfolio analysis system 
the factors that are considered in a determination of the level of the allowance are management s assessment of current economic conditions  the composition of the loan portfolio  previous loss experience on certain types of credit  a review of specific high risk sectors of the loan portfolio and selected individual loans  and concentrations of credit 
the value of the underlying collateral is also considered during such reviews 
the methodology for assessing the adequacy of the allowance establishes both an allocated and an unallocated component 
during the past few years  the calculation of the allowance was modified and refined to more closely track the company s historical loss rates 
the previous methodology used a range of reserves based on industry loss data for certain types of loans 
the allocated component of the allowance for single family loans is currently based on recent loss rates and also contains a component based on management s assessment of current economic conditions 
the allocated components for commercial real estate  multifamily loans and commercial business loans are based principally on current loan grades  recent loss rates and an allocation attributable to current economic conditions 
the allocated component for consumer loans is based on loan payment status  recent loss rates and also includes an allocation based on economic conditions 
management is current ly using the most recent prior year s loss rates in determining its allocated allowance because long term historical loss rates may not adequately reflect economic conditions since fiscal the allocation based on economic conditions is determined based on management s judgment and was reduced by five basis points in the current year based on improved economic conditions 
the unallocated component of the allowance represents the results of analyses that estimate probable losses inherent in the portfolio that are not fully captured in the allocated allowance 
these analyses include but are not limited to industry concentrations  model imprecision and the estimated impact of current economic conditions on historical loss rates 
the company continually monitors trends in loan portfolio qualitative and quantitative factors  including trends in the levels of past due  criticized and nonperforming loans 
the trends in these factors are used to evaluate the reasonableness of the unallocated component 
to determine the adequacy of the allowance and the need for potential changes to the allowance  a formal analysis is completed quarterly to assess the risk within the loan portfolio 
this assessment includes analyses of historical performance  past due trends  the level of nonperforming loans  reviews of certain impaired loans  loan activity since the last quarter  consideration of current economic conditions  and other pertinent information 
loans are assigned ratings  either individually for larger credits or in homogeneous pools  based on an internally developed grading system 
the resulting conclusions are reviewed and approved by senior management 
the allocation of the allowance to the respective loan classifications is not necessarily indicative of future losses or future allocations 
should the loan portfolio increase substantially  should current loss experience continue in future periods  or should classified and delinquent loans increase or economic conditions deteriorate further  then the provision for loan losses may increase in future periods 
the entire allowance is available to absorb losses in the loan portfolio 
assessing the adequacy of the allowance is a process that requires considerable judgment 
management s judgments are based on numerous assumptions about current events  which it believes to be reasonable  but which may or may not be valid 
thus  there can be no assurance that loan losses in future periods will not exceed the current allowance amount or that future increases in the allowance will not be required 
no assurance can be given that management s ongoing evaluation of the loan portfolio in light of changing economic conditions and other relevant circumstances will not require significant future additions to the allowance  thus adversely affecting the operating results of the company 
the allowance is also subject to examination and adequacy testing by regulatory agencies  which may consider such factors as the methodology used to determine adequacy and the size of the allowance relative to that of peer institutions  and other adequacy tests 
these regulatory agencies could require the company to adjust its allowance based on information available to them at the time of their examination 
the allowance totaled million and million  or 
and 
of net loans  at september  and  respectively 
during fiscal  first financial lowered the allowance by thousand in connection with reductions in certain types of classified assets  changes in the composition of the loan portfolio and the level of charge offs 
the ratio of the allowance to nonperforming loans  which include nonaccrual loans  accruing loans days or more delinquent and renegotiated loans  was times and times at september  and  respectively 
nonperforming loans decreased to million as of september  from million at september  see asset quality above 
the company s analysis of allowance adequacy includes an impairment analysis for each nonperforming commercial loan 
based on the current economic environment and other factors  management believes that the allowance at september  was maintained at a level adequate to provide for estimated probable losses in the company s loan portfolio 
the following two tables set forth the changes in the allowance and an allocation of the allowance by loan category at the dates indicated 
total net loan charge offs decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal net real estate loan charge offs totaled thousand in fiscal compared with net charge offs of million in fiscal consumer loan net charge offs were million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal commercial business loan net charge offs were thousand in fiscal compared with million in fiscal the company experienced charge offs on a number of larger commercial business loans in management believes that the allowance can be allocated by category only on an approximate basis 
the allocation of the allowance to each category is not necessarily indicative of future losses and does not restrict the use of the allowance to absorb losses in any category

business deposits have in the past been a less significant source of funding 
the company has set strategic targets for net growth in retail and business transaction accounts annually and in numbers of households served 
the company believes that its future focus must be on increasing the number of available opportunities to provide a broad array of products and services to retail consumers and to commercial customers 
new commercial business products have been developed and the company proactively seeks development of new business relationships 
during fiscal and in past years  the company has emphasized growing core deposits  particularly money market  checking and other such products with the goal of reducing its cost of funds 
the company s total deposits increased million during the year ended september  the company s deposit composition at september   and was as follows table deposits dollars in thousands at september  percent percent percent balance of total balance of total balance of total checking accounts    statement and other accounts    money market accounts    certificate accounts    total deposits    core deposits  which include checking accounts  statement and other accounts and money market accounts  grew by million in fiscal  or  and consumer certificate of deposit balances increased by million 
core deposits now comprise of all deposit balances at september  as of september  and  deposits as a percentage of liabilities were and  respectively 
the company expects to maintain a significant portion of its deposits in core account relationships  however  future growth in deposit balances may be achieved primarily through specifically targeted programs offering higher yielding investment alternatives to consumers 
such targeted programs may increase the company s overall cost of funds and thus affect the company s future net margins 
the company s average cost of deposits at september  was and at september  borrowings borrowings increased million during the current year to million as of september  borrowings as a percentage of total liabilities were approximately and at the end of fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
borrowings from the fhlb of atlanta increased million and other short term borrowings declined million from fiscal to fiscal long term debt increased to million as a result of issuance of debt associated with trust preferred securities 
the company s average cost of fhlb of atlanta advances  reverse repurchase agreements and other borrowings declined from during the year ended september  to during the year ended september  approximately million in fhlb of atlanta advances mature within one year 
other advances are subject to call during the next year but  based on current market interest rates  these calls will likely not be exercised by the fhlb of atlanta 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in accordance with financial interpretation number fin r  the company did not include the trust subsidiary  first financial capital trust i  in its consolidated financial statements at september  the trust subsidiary was formed to raise capital by issuing preferred securities to institutional investors

this transaction increased the company s long term debt by million  decreased debt outstanding on a line of credit with another bank by million and increased cash by million 
costs associated with the debt amounted to million  which are included in other assets 
the full and unconditional guarantee by the company for the preferred securities remains in effect

the association is required to meet the regulatory capital requirements of the ots  which currently include several measures of capital 
under current regulations  first federal meets all requirements including those to be categorized as well capitalized under risk based capital guidelines 
current capital distribution regulations of the ots allow the greatest flexibility to well capitalized institutions 
asset and liability management asset liability management is the process by which the company constantly changes the mix  maturity and pricing of assets and liabilities in an attempt to reduce a materially adverse impact on earnings resulting from the direction  frequency and magnitude of change in market interest rates 
although the net interest income of any financial institution is perceived as being vulnerable to fluctuations in interest rates  the company s management has attempted to minimize that vulnerability 
the company  working principally through the asset and liability committee of the association  has established policies and monitors results to control interest rate risk 
the company utilizes measures such as static and dynamic gap  which are measurements of the differences between interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities repricing for a particular time period including modeling that includes and excludes loan prepayment assumptions 
more important may be the process of evaluating how particular assets and liabilities are affected by changes in interest rates or selected indices as they reprice 
asset liability modeling is performed by the company to assess varying interest rate and balance sheet mix assumptions 
management may adjust the company s interest rate sensitivity position primarily through decisions on the pricing  maturity and marketing of particular deposit and loan products and by decisions regarding the structure and maturities of fhlb advances and other borrowings 
the company has continued to emphasize adjustable rate mortgage real estate lending and short term consumer and commercial business lending to accomplish its objectives 
the following table sets forth in summary form the repricing attributes of the company s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the time periods in the table represent the time period before an asset or liability matures or can be repriced 
table interest rate sensitivity analysis at september  dollars in thousands interest rate sensitivity period months over months months months years years cost interest earning assets loans      mortgage backed securities    interest earning deposits  investments and fhlb stock    total interest earning assets     interest bearing liabilities deposits checking accounts     savings accounts      money market accounts     certificate accounts     total deposits      borrowings      total interest bearing liabilities    current period gap     cumulative gap     percent of total assets assumptions fixed rate loans are shown in the time frame corresponding to contractual principal amortization schedules 
adjustable rate loans are shown in the time frame corresponding to the next contractual interest rate adjustment date 
the fixed and variable rate loans shown also take into account the company s estimates of prepayments of fixed rate loans 
mortgage backed securities are shown at repricing dates but also include prepayment estimates 
decay rates approximate in the first year and in the second year for checking accounts  in the first year and in the second year for savings accounts and in the first year and in the second year for money market accounts 
borrowings include fixed rate fhlb of atlanta advances at the earlier of maturity date or expected call dates 
for purposes of the table above  the company has assumed under current interest rates that advances with call provision will extend 
based on the company s september  dynamic gap position  which considers expected prepayments of loans and mortgage backed securities  in a one year time period million in interest earning assets will reprice and approximately billion in interest bearing liabilities will reprice 
this current dynamic gap position results in a negative one year gap position of million  or of assets 
the company s one year dynamic gap position at september  was a positive million  or of assets 
the above table does not take into consideration the repricing dynamics in adjustable rate loans  such as minimum and maximum annual and lifetime interest rate adjustments and also the index utilized and whether the index is a current or lagging index 
included in the above numbers are the company s estimates of prepayments of fixed rate loans and mortgage backed securities in a one year period and the company s expectation that und er current interest rates  certain advances of the fhlb of atlanta will not be called 
during the past five years  the company extended maturities of interest sensitive assets through retention of certain types of loans  particularly those originated under newer hybrid lending programs with both fixed rate and variable rate features 
these loans have become very popular with consumers and carry a fixed rate of interest for three  five  or seven years and then adjust annually to an established index 
under current lower levels of market interest rates  during fiscal and  the pace of prepayments increased substantially on these types of loans as consumers locked into longer term fixed rate loans  which the company generally has sold 
under normal economic conditions  a negative gap would suggest that net interest income would increase if market rates declined 
a rise in market rates would normally have a detrimental effect on net interest income based on a negative gap 
the opposite would generally occur when an institution has a positive gap position 
as market interest rates declined during fiscal through actions of the federal reserve  the company s negative gap position at that time was a factor in increasing the net interest margin 
consistently low absolute levels of market interest rates in fiscal and resulted in continued repricing of loans to lower rates while it became more difficult to continue to price deposit rates lower 
it is widely anticipated that the federal reserve will gradually raise interest rates over the next twelve months  as steps have already been taken to move the fed funds rate from to in a series of four moves since june of derivatives and hedging activities derivative transactions may be used by the company to better manage its interest rate sensitivity to reduce risks associated with its lending  deposit taking  and borrowing activities 
the company recognizes all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet and reports these instruments at fair value with realized and unrealized gains and losses included in either earnings or in other comprehensive income  depending on the purpose for which the derivative is used and whether the derivative qualifies for hedge accounting in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
by using derivative instruments  the company is exposed to credit and market risk 
credit risk  which is the risk that the counterparty to a derivative instrument will fail to perform  is equal to the extent of the fair value gain in a derivative 
credit risk is created when the fair value of a derivative contract is positive  since this generally indicates that the counterparty owes the company 
when the fair value of the derivative contract is negative  no credit risk exists since the company would owe the counterparty 
the company minimizes the credit risk in derivative instruments by entering into transactions with high quality counterparties as evaluated by management 
market risk is the adverse effect on the value of a financial instrument from a change in interest rates or implied volatility of interest rates 
the company manages the market risk associated with interest rate contracts by establishing and monitoring limits as to the ty pes and degree of risk that may be undertaken 
the market risk associated with derivatives used for interest rate risk management activity is fully incorporated into the company s interest rate sensitivity analysis 
the fair value of derivative assets related to commitments to originate fixed rate loans held for sale and forward sales commitments was not significant at september  the company s derivative and hedging activities are discussed in further detail in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item herein 
off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of operations  the company engages in a variety of financial transactions that  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  are not recorded in the financial statements  or are recorded in amounts that differ from the notional amounts 
these transactions involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit  interest rate  and liquidity risk 
such transactions are used by the company for general corporate purposes or for customer needs 
corporate purpose transactions are used to help manage credit  interest rate  and liquidity risk or to optimize capital 
customer transactions are used to manage customers requests for funding 
the company s off balance sheet arrangements  which principally include lending commitments and derivatives  are described below 
lending commitments lending commitments include loan commitments  standby letters of credit and unused business credit card lines 
these instruments are not recorded in the consolidated balance sheet until funds are advanced under the commitments 
the company provides these lending commitments to customers in the normal course of business 
for commercial customers  loan commitments generally take the form of revolving credit arrangements to finance customers working capital requirements 
for retail customers  loan commitments are generally lines of credit secured by residential property 
at september   commercial and retail loan commitments totaled million  and standby letters of credit totaled million 
standby letters of credit are conditional commitments to guarantee performance  typically of a contract or the financial integrity  of a customer to a third party 
unused business  personal and credit card lines  which totaled million at september   are generally for short term borrowings 
first financial applies essentially the same credit policies and standards as it does in the lending process when making these commitments 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item hereof for additional information regarding lending commitments 
derivatives in accordance with sfas no 
 the company records derivatives at fair value  as either assets or liabilities  on the consolidated balance sheets 
derivative transactions are measured in terms of the notional amount  but this amount is not recorded on the balance sheet and is not  when viewed in isolation  a meaningful measure of the risk profile of the instrument 
the notional amount is not exchanged  but is used only as the basis upon which interest and other payments are calculated 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item hereof for additional information regarding derivatives 
liquidity the desired level of liquidity for the company is determined by management in conjunction with the asset and liability committee of the association 
the level of liquidity is based on management s strategic direction for the company  commitments to make loans and the committee s assessment of the association s ability to generate funds 
historically  sources of liquidity have included net deposits to savings accounts  amortizations and prepayments of loans  fhlb advances  reverse repurchase agreements and sales repayments amortization of securities and loans held for sale 
proper liquidity management is crucial to ensure that the company is able to take advantage of new business opportunities as well as meet the demands of its customers 
in this process  we focus on assets and liabilities and on the manner in which they combine to provide adequate liquidity to meet our needs 
the table below summarizes future contractual obligations as of september  contractual obligations table contractual obligations in thousands at september  payments due by period within over one over two over three after one to two to three to five five year years years years years total certificate accounts      borrowings       purchases   operating leases   total contractual obligations     the company s most stable and traditional source of funding has been the attraction and retention of deposit accounts  the success of which the company believes is based primarily on the strength and reputation of the association  effective marketing and rates paid on deposit accounts 
first federal has a major market share of deposits in charleston  berkeley and dorchester counties and a significant share of deposits in georgetown  horry and florence counties 
as a relatively new entrant into beaufort county  south carolina and brunswick county  north carolina  the company holds a small but growing market share 
by continuing to promote innovative new products  pricing competitively and encouraging the highest level of quality in customer service  the company continues to successfully meet challenges from competitors  many of which are non banking entities offering investment products 
other primary sources of funds include borrowings from the fhlb of atlanta  principal repayments on loans and mortgage backed securities  reverse repurchase agreements and sales of loans 
to minimize vulnerability  the association has back up sources of funds available  including fhlb of atlanta borrowing capacity and securities available for sale 
during fiscal  the fhlb of atlanta instituted a general policy of limiting borrowing capacity to a percent of assets  regardless of the level of advances that could be supported by available collateral for such advances 
this new policy serves to define an upper cap for fhlb advances for the association of approximately million at september   based on its current approved cap 
during fiscal year the association received approval to increase its cap level up to of assets  subject to standard lending policies in effect at the fhlb of atlanta

significant operating activities of the company for fiscal included million of residential loans originated for sale with sales of million 
based on a net increase in deposits of million  issuance of long term debt of mill ion  a net increase in fhlb of atlanta advances of million  higher payments and prepayments of mortgage backed securities and slower growth in loans attributable to sales  the company was able to reduce other borrowing sources by million and fund various investing activities described above during the year ended september  proceeds from the sale of loans of million in fiscal decreased significantly from million in fiscal based on recent asset liability management objectives and low historical interest rates  management expects to continue its strategy of selling selected longer term  fixed rate loans in fiscal management  however  anticipates volume of loan sales will be relatively the same during fiscal as refinancing activity is not expected to increase 
the company will likely increase its holdings of investments and mortgage backed securities during fiscal until loan portfolio growth returns to historical levels 
parent company liquidity as a holding company  first financial conducts its business through its subsidiaries 
unlike the association  first financial is not subject to any regulatory liquidity requirements 
potential sources for first financial s payment of principal and interest on its borrowings and for its periodic repurchase programs include i dividends from first federal and other subsidiaries  ii payments from existing cash reserves and sales of marketable securities  and iii interest on its investment securities 
as of september   first financial had cash reserves and existing marketable securities of million compared with million at september  the association s ability to pay dividends and make other capital contributions to first financial is restricted by regulation and may require regulatory approval 
such distributions may also depend on the association s ability to meet minimum regulatory capital requirements in effect during the period 
current ots regulations permit institutions meeting certain capital requirements and subject to normal supervision to pay out of net income to date over the calendar year and of surplus capital existing at the beginning of the calendar year without supervisory approval 
the association is currently subject to normal supervision as to the payment of dividends 
results of operations net interest income the largest component of operating earnings for the company is net interest income 
one of the company s strategic initiatives has been to reduce the company s reliance on net interest income through expansion of other sources of revenues 
net interest income totaled million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal and million in fiscal net interest income represented approximately of the net revenues of first financial in fiscal compared with in fiscal and in fiscal the level of net interest income is determined by balances of earning assets and successfully managing the net interest margin 
changes in interest rates paid on assets and liabilities  the rate of growth of the asset and liability base  the ratio of interest earning assets to interest bearing liabilities and management of the balance sheet s interest rate sensitivity all factor into changes in net interest income 
the abs olute level of market interest rates also significantly affects the company s ability to quickly react to balance sheet changes 
net interest income decreased by to million in fiscal this followed a decrease of in fiscal and an increase of in fiscal the decrease in fiscal was principally a result of a continuing decline in average yields on interest earning assets relative to the reduction in the average cost of interest bearing liabilities 
as short term market interest rates declined  the company s interest sensitive liabilities repriced to an average cost of in fiscal from an average cost of in fiscal average yields on interest earning assets declined to in fiscal from in fiscal the company s net interest margin decreased in fiscal to from in fiscal the company s average cost of interest bearing liabilities declined to in fiscal from in fiscal average yields on interest earning assets decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal the net interest margin decreased slightly to in from in fiscal while the net interest margin during fiscal declined by basis points  more importantly  the net interest margin was during the quarter ended september   experiencing a decline of basis points from during the quarter ended june  the rate of decline has slowed over the past three quarters 
management  however  expects continued pressure on its net interest margin as a result of the amortization and maturities of loans and investment and mortgage backed securities and the need to reinvest those funds at current market interest rates 
recently  the treasury yield curve would indicate an increase in short term rates while long term rates have declined 
a continuation of this trend for a longer period would be detrimental to the company s net interest margin

the amortization of servicing rights decreased to million during fiscal from million during fiscal the company estimates the amortization of its originated servicing asset recorded at september  will likely approximate million during fiscal should market interest rates decline from current levels  it is likely the company could incur an additional impairment in its mortgage servicing asset and also incur increased amortizations of the servicing asset  both of which will result in lowerin g future servicing revenues 
the company incurred losses of million  thousand and thousand  respectively  from real estate operations and other repossession costs during fiscal  and the increase in losses from fiscal to fiscal to fiscal were principally related to increases in provisions charged as a write down to real estate and decreases in sales of real estate 
another significant increase in other income is the gain on disposition of assets 
during fiscal the company sold its previous home office building and adjacent parking lot in a sale and partial leaseback transaction resulting in a million gain of which million was recognized into income and million was deferred 
non interest expense in the more competitive financial services market of recent years  management has recognized the importance of controlling non interest expense to maintain and improve profitability 
management also recognizes that there are operational costs which continue to increase as a result of the present operating climate for regulated financial institutions 
the technical and operating environment for financial institutions continues to require a well trained and motivated staff  superior operating systems and sophisticated marketing efforts

application of accounting principles to loan commitments in march  staff accounting bulletin sab  application of accounting principles to loan commitments  was issued to provide guidance on recording a mortgage loan commitment on the balance sheet at fair value 
sab provides specific guidance on the inputs to a valuation recognition model to measure commitments accounted for at fair value 
current accounting guidance requires the loan commitment to be recognized on the balance sheet at fair value from its inception through its expiration or funding 
sab requires that fair value measurement include only differences between the guaranteed interest rate in the loan commitment and a market interest rate  excluding expected future cash flows related to the customer relationship or loan servicing 
the reporting entity should determine the fair value of the loan commitment based solely on the relationship to market interest rates  absent any expected cash flows from the customer relationship or servicing rights 
the adoption of sab was required for new commitments for loans held for sale entered into on or after april  the company previously recognized a servicing value at the time the commitment was made 
the adoption of sab had no material effect on the company 
impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements contained in item herein and related data have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars  without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time because of inflation 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than the effect of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the price of goods and services since such prices are affected by inflation 
the company is committed to continuing to actively manage the gap between its interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities
