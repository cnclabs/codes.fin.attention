item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
if we fail to compete successfully against our competitors  our sales and operating results may be negatively affected and we may not achieve future growth 
the markets for our products are highly competitive 
the market for our surgical division products is dominated by a small number of large companies 
in each of our other divisions  there are both large and small companies with which we compete 
we may not be able to meet the prices offered by our competitors or offer products similar to or more desirable than those offered by our competitors 
many of our competitors have greater financial and other resources  more widely accepted products  superior ability to maintain new product flow  greater research and development and technical capabilities  patent portfolios that may present an obstacle to our conduct of business  stronger name recognition  larger sales and distribution networks  and or international manufacturing facilities  thereby avoiding the transportation costs and foreign import duties associated with shipping domestically manufactured products to international customers 
the factors set forth above may be material to our ability to develop and sell our products 
our failure to compete effectively in developing and selling our products would have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
our future success requires the continued development or licensing of new products and the enhancement of existing products 
the market for orthopedic devices and related products is characterized by new product development and corresponding obsolescence of existing products 
our competitors may develop new medical procedures  technology or products that are more effective than our current technology or products or that render our technology or products obsolete or uncompetitive  which could have a material adverse effect on us 
we may not be able to develop successful new products or enhance existing products  obtain regulatory clearances and approval of such products  market such products in a commercially viable manner or gain market acceptance for such products 
the failure to develop or license and market new products and product enhancements could materially and adversely affect our competitive position  which could cause a significant decline in our sales and profitability 
we rely on independent sales agents and third party distributors to market and sell most of our products 
if we fail to establish new sales and distribution relationships or maintain our existing relationships  or if our independent sales agents and third party distributors fail to commit sufficient resources or are otherwise ineffective in selling our products  our results of operations and future growth will be adversely impacted 
our success depends largely upon marketing arrangements with our independent sales agents and distributors 
these persons may terminate their relationships with us or devote insufficient sales efforts to our products 
we do not control the efforts these persons make to sell our products 
our failure to attract and retain skilled independent sales agents and distributors would have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
we anticipate that a significant portion of the growth in our surgical division will require affiliating with additional sales agents 
we will face significant challenges and risks in training  managing and retaining additional qualified sales and marketing agents 
we may not be able to retain a sufficient number of additional qualified personnel to create increased demand for our products 
if we are unable to grow effectively our sales and marketing team to sell our orthopedic devices and related products  our growth may be negatively affected 
our quarterly operating results are subject to substantial fluctuations  and you should not rely on them as an indication of our future results 
our quarterly operating results may vary significantly due to a combination of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
these factors include demand for our products  our ability to meet the demand for our products  increased competition  the number  significance and timing of introduction of new products and enhancements by us or our competitors  our ability to develop  introduce and market new and enhanced versions of our products on a timely basis  changes in pricing policies by us or our competitors  changes in the treatment practices of our surgeon customers  the timing of significant orders and shipments  availability of raw materials  work stoppages or strikes in the health care industry  and general economic factors 
our quarterly sales and operating results have varied significantly in the past three years primarily as a result of our july acquisition of the assets which now comprise our soft goods division and our acquisition of chattanooga group  inc in february we believe that quarterly sales and operating results may vary significantly in the future 
period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
we cannot assure you that our sales will increase or be sustained in future periods or that we will be profitable in any future period 
any shortfalls in sales or earnings in any given period from levels expected by securities or industry analysts could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock  and any other of our securities which we may issue in the future 
if our designing and consulting surgeons do not continue their affiliation with us  we may be unable to develop  design and test new medical devices or enhance our existing medical devices 
we have existing designing and consulting arrangements with surgeons who are well recognized by other surgeons and orthopedic specialists 
we have developed and maintain close relationships with these surgeons 
these professionals often assist the company by speaking about our products at medical seminars  assisting in the training of other professionals in the use and or fitting of our products and providing us with feedback on the industry s acceptance of our new products 
if these arrangements terminate or are not renewed  our ability to develop  design and test new medical devices or enhancements to our existing medical devices  and our ability to operate successfully  could be materially and adversely affected 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in maintaining or renewing our designing and consulting arrangements with our current surgeons 
if surgeons do not recommend our surgical products  our sales may decline or we may be unable to increase our sales or generate profits 
an important factor in the overall demand for our surgical products is the recommendation by surgeons of these products to hospitals  patients and other surgeons 
we may not obtain the necessary recommendations from surgeons 
acceptance of our surgical products depends on educating the medical community as to the distinctive characteristics  perceived benefits  clinical efficacy and cost effectiveness of our surgical products compared to the products offered by our competitors and on training surgeons in the proper application of our surgical products 
if product liability lawsuits are brought against us and we do not have adequate insurance  our business may be harmed 
the manufacture and sale of medical devices exposes us to significant risk of product liability claims  lawsuits and product recalls 
in the past  as well as currently  we have been and are the subject of a number of product liability claims and lawsuits relating to our products 
in the future  we may be subject to additional product liability claims  which could be costly and divert attention of management 
we currently maintain product liability insurance with coverage limits of million per occurrence and an annual aggregate maximum of million 
insurance is expensive  continues to increase in cost  and in the future may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
our existing product liability insurance coverage may be inadequate to protect us from any liabilities we might incur  and we are exposed to the risk that our claims may be excluded and that our insurers may become insolvent 
if a product liability claim or series of claims is brought against us for uninsured liabilities or in excess of our insurance coverage  our business could suffer materially and cause our stock price to fall 
in addition  as a result of a product liability claim  we may have to recall some of our products  which could result in significant costs to us and cause our stock price to fall 
efforts to acquire other companies or product lines could adversely affect our operations and financial results 
while we have no commitments or agreements to acquire other companies or product lines  we may pursue acquisitions of other companies or additional product lines 
our ability to grow through acquisitions depends upon our ability to identify  negotiate  complete and integrate suitable acquisitions and to obtain any necessary financing  all of which can present difficulties 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify and make acquisitions on acceptable terms or that we will be able to obtain financing for such acquisitions on acceptable terms 
even if we complete acquisitions  we may experience difficulties in integrating any acquired companies  personnel and product lines into our existing business  delays in realizing the benefits of any acquired company or product lines  diversion of our management s time and attention from other business concerns  limited or no direct prior experience in new markets or countries we may enter  higher costs of integration than we anticipated  assumption of undisclosed liabilities  adverse market reaction  difficulties in retaining key employees of the acquired business who are necessary to manage these acquisitions  or additional risks we may assume in connection with our acquisitions 
in addition  an acquisition could materially impair our operating results by causing us to incur debt or requiring us to amortize acquired assets 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify and consummate any future acquisitions or that any acquisition we consummate will be successful 
we have succeeded to contingent obligations as a result of the chattanooga group acquisition and may have to use our cash to satisfy such obligations 
chattanooga group  inc is the subject of a department of commerce investigation of its export practices with respect to unlawfully trading with an embargoed country  and unlawfully preparing export documentation 
the stock purchase agreement for the chattanooga group  inc provides that the former owners shall pay us out of escrowed proceeds from their sale of stock for reasonable expenses and fines we actually incur in defending the investigation where such reasonable expenses and fines are greater than the amount that was accrued on the financial statements of chattanooga group  inc as of the date we acquired the company 
to the extent we incur monetary fines  costs  and legal expenses related to the department of commerce investigation the sellers from whom we purchased the capital stock of chattanooga group inc have agreed to indemnify us and to pay all reasonable costs  expenses  settlements  and fines in excess of the  which as of december   was the remaining amount of what was accrued as a liability on chattanooga group inc s financial statements as of the date of the acquisition up to a maximum of million 
with respect to the legal expenses  the sellers are only obligated to indemnify and reimburse us for the legal expenses of the law firm currently handling the investigation or any other law firm of their choice 
if upon final determination or settlement of the department of commerce investigation we ultimately incur total expenses or fines in an amount less than the approximately  accrual  we shall owe the sellers the remainder of the accrual 
when we acquired chattanooga group  inc  million of the sellers sale proceeds were placed in escrow to satisfy the sellers indemnity obligations to us  and currently in accordance with the terms of the purchase agreement  remains in escrow through february  for such purpose 
therefore  we will not be entitled to any such payment from escrowed proceeds until we have incurred additional expenses related to the investigation in an approximate amount of  when we acquired chattanooga group  inc  proceeds of up to a maximum of million from the former owners sale of stock to us were placed in escrow to satisfy their indemnity obligations to us 
there currently remains approximately  in escrow for such purpose 
we cannot assure you  however  that any fines or expenses incurred by the chattanooga group as a result of this investigation will be less than the amount placed in escrow by the former owners of chattanooga group  inc to satisfy their indemnity obligations to us  nor can we assure you that the remaining amounts in escrow will continue to be available as a possible source of indemnification 
furthermore  we do not appear to have the right to seek indemnification from the former owners of chattanooga group  inc for fines and expenses of the department of commerce investigation beyond fines and expenses paid from the escrowed proceeds 
our debt agreements impose restrictions on us which may limit or prohibit us from engaging in certain transactions 
if a default were to occur  our lenders could accelerate the amounts of debt outstanding  and holders of our secured indebtedness could force us to sell our assets to satisfy all or part of what is owed 
covenants relating to our million bank of america senior credit facility and our million senior subordinated notes credit facility of which million currently is outstanding as of december  held by capitalsource finance llc restrict our ability to pay dividends  restrict our ability to engage in various operational matters  and require us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy specified financial tests 
our ability to meet these financial ratios and tests may be affected by events beyond our control 
these covenants and restrictions could limit our ability to obtain future financing  make needed capital expenditures or other investments  repurchase our outstanding debt or equity  withstand a future downturn in our business or in the economy  dispose of operations  engage in strategic acquisitions or mergers or otherwise conduct necessary corporate activities 
various transactions that we may view as important opportunities  such as possible acquisitions  are also subject to the consent of lenders under the senior credit facility and under the senior subordinated notes which consent may be withheld or granted subject to conditions specified at the time that may affect the attractiveness or viability of the transaction 
we amended and restated our agreements with both of our lenders effective as of september  upon repayment of the original debt 
these amendments improved our cost of borrowing and modified our financial covenants in a manner which generally increases the likelihood of our compliance 
there can be no assurance that we will remain in compliance with these cash flow and other financial covenants or be able to obtain a waiver of default or amendments to our credit agreements in the future 
if a default under our bank of america credit facility were to occur  the lenders under the credit facility could accelerate the amounts outstanding under the credit facility and our other lenders  principally capitalsource finance llc as holder of the senior subordinated notes  could declare immediately due and payable all amounts borrowed under other instruments such as the senior subordinated notes that could contain certain provisions for cross acceleration or cross default 
similarly  a default under the senior subordinated notes could permit capitalsource finance llc  as holder  to accelerate amounts outstanding and our lenders  principally the lenders under the bank of america senior credit facility  could declare immediately due and payable all amounts borrowed under the bank of america senior credit facility because of cross acceleration and cross default rights of those lenders 
in addition  the lenders under these agreements could terminate their commitments to lend to us 
if the lenders under these agreements accelerate the repayment of borrowings  we may not have sufficient liquid assets at that time to repay the amounts then outstanding under our indebtedness or be able to find additional alternative financing 
even if we could obtain additional alternative financing  the terms of the financing may not be favorable or acceptable to us 
the existing indebtedness under our senior credit facility and our senior subordinated notes is secured by substantially all of our assets 
should a default or acceleration of this indebtedness occur  the holders of this indebtedness could sell the assets to satisfy all or a part of what is owed 
our bank of america senior credit facility also contains provisions prohibiting the modification of our outstanding senior subordinated notes held by capitalsource finance llc  as well as limiting the ability to refinance these notes 
if we lose one of our key suppliers or one of our contract manufacturers stops making our products  we may be unable to meet customer orders for our products in a timely manner or within our budget 
we rely on a limited number of foreign and domestic suppliers for the raw materials and components used in our products 
one or more of our suppliers may decide for reasons beyond our control to cease supplying us with raw materials and components 
fda regulations may require additional testing of any raw materials or components from new suppliers prior to our use of these materials or components and in the case of a device with a pre market approval  we may be required to obtain prior fda permission  either of which could delay or prevent our access or use of such raw materials or components 
if we are unable to obtain materials we need from our suppliers and we cannot obtain these materials from other sources  we may be unable to manufacture our products for a period of time or within our manufacturing budget  which could negatively impact our results of operations 
the products sold by our soft goods division are primarily manufactured by a company located in acuna  mexico  which provides the required labor to us on a contract basis 
if our agreement with the mexican company terminated and we were otherwise unable to find suitable contract labor  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our soft goods division s reliance on our contract manufacturing facility in mexico exposes us to related risks and uncertainties  including difficulties in staffing and managing international operations  controlling quality of manufacture  political  social  and economic instability  interruptions and limitations in telecommunication services  product and or material transportation delays or disruption  trade restrictions and changes in tariffs  import and export license requirements and restrictions  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  and potential adverse tax consequences 
if any of these risks materialize  our international manufacturing operations and results from our soft goods division  as well as our operating results  may be harmed 
if we cannot retain our key personnel  many of whom have been with us for less than four years  we may not be able to manage and operate successfully and we may not be able to meet our strategic objectives 
our continued success depends  in part  upon key managerial  scientific  sales and technical personnel  as well as our ability to continue to attract and retain additional highly qualified personnel 
we compete for such personnel with other companies  academic institutions  government entities and other organizations 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in retaining our current personnel or in hiring or retaining qualified personnel in the future 
many of our existing management personnel have been employed by us for four years or less  including kenneth w 
davidson  our chief executive officer  who joined us in october  paul chapman  our president and chief operating officer  who joined us when we acquired chattanooga group  inc in february and became our president on may   jack cahill  our executive vice president  president surgical division  who joined us in january  and scott klosterman  our executive vice president  president chattanooga group who joined us in february these executives have substantial experience and expertise in our business 
our future success depends to a significant extent on the ability of our executive officers and other members of our management team to operate effectively  both individually and as a group 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to efficiently allocate responsibilities or that the new members of our executive team will succeed in their roles 
issuances of our securities are subject to federal and state securities laws  and certain holders of common stock issued by us in prior offerings may be entitled to rescind their purchases 
from january through june  certain participants in our k profit sharing plan purchased shares of our common stock for inclusion in their respective k plan accounts 
by failing to register properly our k plan or the shares purchased thereunder  we may not have complied with various requirements of applicable federal securities laws 
in such situations a number of remedies may be available to regulatory authorities and the participants for whose accounts the trustee of the k plan purchased shares of our common stock  including  without limitation  a right of rescission  civil penalties  a restraining order or injunction  and a court order to pay restitution and costs 
as a result  we agreed with the underwriters of our public offering which closed august   that in the event that the daily per share closing price of our common stock as quoted on the nasdaq national market or any national securities exchange on which shares of our common stock are listed or admitted for trading falls below at any time on or prior to may  we would commence a rescission offer with respect to shares of our common stock sold to participants under our k plan within the time period covered by the rescission offer 
substantially all of the shares that were purchased by k plan participants within the time period which would be covered by the rescission offer were purchased at a price of less than per share 
even assuming the closing price of our stock were to decline to per share prior to may  thus triggering our obligation to make the rescission offer  we would be required to make an aggregate payment of less than  and the resulting recorded charge to our earnings would be less than  if all offerees whose shares were purchased for their k plan account at a price in excess of per share approximately  shares were to accept the offer 
if  at the time we are required to conduct the rescission offer  and the closing price of our common stock were to be less than per share  the amount we would be required to pay and the corresponding charge to our earnings would increase 
as of the date hereof  no claims for rescission have been made against us 
we cannot assure you  however  that we will not otherwise be subject to possible claims  litigation  penalties or fines relating to such sales 
any claims  litigation  penalties or fines which could be asserted against us relating to these sales could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and results of operations 
we derive a portion of our sales from operations in international markets  which may be subject to political  economic and social instability 
approximately of our sales for the year ended december  was derived from our international operations 
one component of our growth strategy is to expand our international sales efforts 
however  to the extent we are successful in expanding our international sales and operations  this will increasingly expose us to risks inherent in operating in foreign jurisdictions  including imposition or increase of investment and other restrictions by foreign governments  potential adverse tax consequences  including the imposition or increase of withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by foreign subsidiaries  the imposition of additional foreign governmental controls or regulations on the sale of our orthopedic devices and related products  increased instances of political  social and economic instability  currency risk between the us dollar and foreign currencies  a shortage of high quality international salespeople and distributors  changes in tariffs and other trade restrictions or barriers  exposure to different legal  regulatory and political standards in multiple countries  and acts of terrorism and acts of war  particularly in light of the terrorist attacks of september  if our patents and other intellectual property rights do not adequately protect our products  we may lose market share to our competitors and be unable to operate our business profitably 
we rely on a combination of patents  trade secrets  copyrights  trademarks  license agreements and contractual provisions to establish and protect our intellectual property rights in our products and the processes for the development  manufacture and marketing of our products 
these legal means  however  afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights 
in addition  we cannot assure you that any of our pending patent or trademark applications will issue 
the us patent and trademark office may deny or require significant narrowing of claims in our pending patent applications  and patents issuing from the pending patent applications  if any  may not provide us with significant commercial protection 
we could incur substantial costs in proceedings before the us patent and trademark office 
these proceedings could result in adverse decisions as to the priority of our inventions and the narrowing or invalidation of claims in issued patents 
in addition  the laws of some of the countries in which our products are or may be sold may not protect our products and intellectual property to the same extent as us laws  if at all 
we may be unable to protect our rights in trade secrets and unpatented proprietary technology in these countries 
in addition  we hold patent and other intellectual property licenses from third parties for some of our products and on technologies that are necessary in the designing and manufacturing of some of our products 
the loss of such licenses would prevent us from manufacturing  marketing and selling these products  which could harm our business 
other parties may have filed applications for or been issued patents and in the future may obtain additional patents and intellectual property rights related to products that compete with or are similar to our products 
we may not be aware of all patents potentially adverse to our interests that may have been issued to others  and there can be no assurance that such patents do not exist or have not been filed or issued 
if patents have been or are issued to others containing preclusive or conflicting claims and such claims are ultimately determined to be valid  we may be required to obtain licenses thereto or to develop or acquire alternate technology  which would have a material adverse affect on us 
there can be no assurance that the validity of any of the patents or other intellectual property owned by or licensed to us would be upheld if challenged by others in litigation or that our products  even if covered by our patents or other intellectual property  would not infringe patents owned by others 
we seek to protect our trade secrets  know how and other unpatented proprietary technology  in part  with confidentiality agreements and invention assignment with our employees  our designing and consulting surgeons and our other consultants 
our agreements with independent sales agents and distributors also contain confidentiality agreements 
we cannot assure you  however  that these agreements will not be breached  we will have adequate remedies for any breach  the fda or another governmental agency may require disclosure of such information in order for us to have the right to market a product  or trade secrets  know how and other unpatented proprietary technology will not otherwise become known to or independently developed by our competitors 
also  our competitors may allege that our products infringe their patents leading to voluntary or involuntary loss of sales from those products 
in addition  the cost to prosecute infringements of our patents or the cost to defend our products against patent infringement actions by others could be substantial 
if we lose any future intellectual property lawsuits  a court could require us to pay significant damages or prevent us from selling our products 
litigation involving patents and other intellectual property rights is common in the orthopedic industry  and companies in this industry have used intellectual property litigation in an attempt to gain a competitive advantage 
in the future  we may become a party to lawsuits involving patents or other intellectual property 
if we lose one of these proceedings  a court  or a similar foreign governing body  could require us to pay significant damages to third parties  require us to seek licenses from third parties and pay ongoing royalties  require us to redesign our products  or prevent us from manufacturing  using or selling our products 
in addition to being costly  protracted litigation to defend or prosecute our intellectual property rights could seriously detract from the time our management would otherwise devote to running our business 
intellectual property litigation relating to our products could cause our customers or potential customers to defer or limit their purchase or use of the affected products until resolution of the litigation 
we may be liable for contamination or other harm caused by hazardous materials that we use 
our research and development and manufacturing processes involve the use of hazardous materials 
we are subject to federal  state and local regulation governing the use  manufacture  handling  storage and disposal of hazardous materials 
we cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination or injury resulting from hazardous materials  and we may incur liability as a result of any contamination or injury 
in addition  under some environmental laws and regulations  we could also be held responsible for all of the costs relating to any contamination at our past or present facilities and at third party waste disposal sites 
we may incur significant expenses in the future relating to any failure to comply with environmental laws 
any such future expenses or liability could have a significant negative impact on our financial condition 
if a natural or man made disaster strikes our manufacturing facilities  we may be unable to manufacture our products for a substantial amount of time  which could cause our sales to decline 
we principally rely on our manufacturing facilities in austin  texas and chattanooga  tennessee  as well as a contract manufacturer located in acuna  mexico 
these facilities and the manufacturing equipment we use to produce our products would be difficult to replace and could require substantial lead time to repair or replace 
our facilities may be affected by natural or man made disasters 
in the event one of our facilities was affected by a disaster  we would be forced to rely on third party manufacturers or shift production to our other manufacturing facilities 
we currently carry insurance to protect us against disasters 
however  such insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of our potential losses or may become unavailable on acceptable terms  if available at all 
to remain competitive we may have to move more of our manufacturing operations to foreign countries 
we currently have no manufacturing operations in any foreign country other than mexico 
the cost of transporting some of our products to foreign countries is currently borne by our customers  who are usually required to pay foreign import duties on the products 
as a result  the cost of these products to customers who use or distribute them outside the united states is often greater than the cost of products manufactured in that country 
in addition  foreign manufacturers of competitive products often receive various local tax concessions  which lower their overall manufacturing costs 
in order to compete successfully in the event we are successful in expanding our international sales and operations  we may be required to open or acquire manufacturing operations abroad  which would be costly to implement and would increase our exposure to the risks of doing business in international countries 
if we were to do this  we may not be able to operate successfully our foreign manufacturing operations  which could have a material adverse effect on our international operations and on our overall business  financial condition  results of operations and future prospects 
our business plan relies on certain assumptions about the market for our products  which  if incorrect  may adversely affect our profitability 
our ability to achieve our business objectives is subject to a variety of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
for example  we believe that the relative increase in the aging of the general population and increasingly active lifestyles will continue and that these trends will increase the need for our orthopedic implant products 
the projected demand for our products could materially differ from actual demand if our assumptions regarding these trends and acceptance of our products by the medical community prove to be incorrect or do not materialize or if non surgical treatments gain more widespread acceptance as a viable alternative to orthopedic implants 
we are subject to substantial government regulation that could have a material adverse effect on our business 
government regulation in the united states and other countries is a significant factor affecting the research  development  manufacture and marketing of our products 
in the united states  the fda has broad authority to regulate the development  manufacture  marketing and sale of medical devices 
overseas  these activities are subject to foreign governmental regulation  which is in many respects similar to regulation in the united states but which vary from country to country 
us and foreign regulation continues to evolve  which could result in additional burdens on our operations 
failure to comply with applicable regulations can  among other things  result in fines  suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals  product recalls  operating restrictions  and criminal prosecution 
additionally  the cost of maintaining personnel and systems necessary to comply with applicable regulations is substantial 
many of our products required or will require regulatory approval prior to being marketed 
the process of obtaining these approvals can be lengthy and expensive 
we may not be able to obtain or maintain necessary approvals for testing or marketing our products 
moreover  regulatory approvals  if granted  may include significant limitations on the indicated uses for which our products may be marketed or other restrictions or requirements that reduce the value to us of the products 
regulatory authorities may also withdraw product approvals if we fail to comply with regulatory standards or if any problems related to our products develop following initial marketing 
we are also subject to strict regulation with respect to our manufacturing operations 
this regulation includes testing  control and documentation requirements  and compliance with the current good manufacturing practice is monitored through inspections by regulatory authorities 
delays in the receipt of  or failure to receive necessary approvals  the loss of previously obtained approvals  or failure to comply with existing or future regulatory requirements could have a significant negative effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
certain federal laws regarding medicare  medicaid and physician self referrals are far reaching and we may be required to alter one or more of our practices to be in compliance with these laws 
health care fraud and abuse regulations are complex and even minor  inadvertent irregularities in submissions can potentially give rise to claims that the statute has been violated 
any violations of these laws could result in a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if there is a change in law  regulation or administrative or judicial interpretations  we may have to change our business practices or our existing business practices could be challenged as unlawful  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
modifications to our marketed devices may require fda regulatory clearances or approvals and may require us to cease marketing or recall the modified devices until such clearances or approvals are obtained 
when required  the products we market in the united states have obtained pre market notification under section k of the federal food drug cosmetics act or were exempt from the k pre market notification process 
we have modified some of our products and product labeling since obtaining k clearance  but we do not believe these modifications require us to submit new k pre market notifications 
however  if the fda disagrees with us and requires us to submit a new k pre market notification for modifications to our existing products  we may be the subject of enforcement actions by the fda and be required to stop marketing the products while the fda reviews the k pre market notification 
if the fda requires us to go through a lengthier  more rigorous examination than we expect  our product introductions or modifications could be delayed or canceled  which could cause our sales to decline 
in addition  the fda may determine that future products will require the more costly  lengthy and uncertain pre market approval pma  process 
products that are approved through the pma process generally need fda approval before they may be modified 
our products may be subject to product recalls even after receiving clearance or approval  which would harm our reputation and our business 
the fda and foreign regulatory authorities have the authority to request and  in some cases  require the recall of products in the event of material deficiencies  design defects or manufacturing defects 
a government mandated or voluntary recall by us could occur as a result of component failures  manufacturing errors  design defects  or any other incidents related to our medical devices  including  but not limited to  adverse event recalls  cease and desist communications and any other product liability issues related to our medical devices 
any product recall would divert managerial and financial resources and harm our reputation with customers and our business 
if adequate levels of reimbursement from third party payors for our products are not obtained  surgeons and patients may be reluctant to use our products  and our sales may decline 
our sales depend largely on government health care programs such as medicare and medicaid and private health insurers reimbursing patients medical expenses 
surgeons  hospitals and other health care providers may not purchase our products if they do not receive satisfactory reimbursement from these third party payors for the cost of the procedures using our products 
consequently  we may be unable to sell our products on a profitable basis if third party payors deny coverage or reduce their current levels of reimbursement 
payors continue to review their coverage policies carefully for existing and new therapies and can  without notice  deny coverage for treatments that include the use of our products 
health care providers may attempt to control costs by i authorizing fewer elective surgical procedures  including joint reconstructive surgeries  ii by requiring the use of the least expensive implant available  or iii reducing the reimbursement for or limiting the number of authorized visits for rehabilitation procedures 
outside of the united states  reimbursement systems vary significantly by country 
many foreign markets have government managed health care systems that govern reimbursement for new devices and procedures 
canada and some european countries  in particular france  have tightened reimbursement rates 
if adequate levels of reimbursement from third party payors outside of the united states are not obtained  international sales of our products may decline 
if a significant number of shares of our common stock are sold into the market  the market price of our common stock could significantly decline  even if our business is doing well 
our stockholders may sell their common stock  and our employees  directors  officers  sales representatives and distributors may exercise their stock options in order to sell the common stock underlying their options in the market under a registration statement we have filed with the securities and exchange commission 
sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market or the perception that such sales may occur could depress the market price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of our equity securities 
as of december   galen partners beneficially owned approximately of our outstanding shares of common stock 
officers  directors and our principal stockholders owning an aggregate of approximately  shares of our common stock have agreed that they will not  without the prior written consent of the underwriters in our public offering  directly or indirectly sell any of these restricted shares  or any of the  shares of our common stock that we may issue upon the exercise of outstanding options or warrants held by such officers  directors  and principal stockholders  for days after the closing of our public offering of common stock on december  our certificate of incorporation  our bylaws and delaware law contain provisions that could discourage  delay  or prevent a takeover attempt 
provisions of our certificate of incorporation  our bylaws and delaware law may discourage  delay or prevent another company from merging with us or from acquiring us  even if our stockholders were to consider such merger or acquisition to be favorable 
item properties we own two pieces of real property in chattanooga  tennessee 
these include a  square foot facility which houses the headquarters and principal manufacturing operations of the chattanooga group division  as well as a  square foot building that houses additional manufacturing operations for the chattanooga group division 
we lease an approximately  square foot facility in austin  texas for our corporate headquarters  manufacturing facilities and warehouse for our surgical division and soft goods division business operations 
the lease term  which commenced on april   is for a period of ten years  and we have an option to renew the lease for an additional term of five years 
our monthly lease payments are approximately  for an annual lease payment of approximately  exclusive of our share of applicable common area maintenance  property taxes and public utility charges  which collectively are approximately  per month 
item legal proceedings from time to time  we are plaintiffs or defendants in various litigation matters in the ordinary course of business  some of which involve claims for damages that are substantial in amount

overview of business and results we are a diversified orthopedic company that designs  manufactures  markets and distributes a comprehensive range of high quality orthopedic devices  sports medicine equipment and other related products for the orthopedic industry 
our products are used primarily by orthopedic surgeons  physical and occupational therapists and other orthopedic specialists who treat patients with musculoskeletal conditions resulting from degenerative diseases  deformities  traumatic events and sports related injuries 
we currently market and distribute our products through three operating divisions  our surgical division  our chattanooga group division and our soft goods division 
our surgical division offers reconstructive joint products  including hip  knee and shoulder implants  trauma products and spinal implants 
our chattanooga group division is a leader in domestic sales of many of the orthopedic rehabilitation products in the market 
our soft goods division provides orthopedic soft goods that are used to assist the patient in recovery from injury or a surgical procedure and to protect against further injury 
our three divisions enable us to reach a diverse customer base through multiple distribution channels and give us the opportunity to provide a comprehensive range of orthopedic devices and related products to orthopedic specialists operating in a variety of treatment settings 
in october  we announced our strategy to expand our business through selected acquisitions of businesses or products in the orthopedic industry 
we have completed two significant acquisitions since that time that have allowed us to extend our business into two new product segments of the orthopedic market  orthopedic soft goods and rehabilitation equipment  both of which complement our surgical division 
in july  we purchased the orthopedic soft goods  patient safety devices and pressure care product lines of kimberly clark corporation 
our chattanooga group division was created in february when we purchased chattanooga group  inc  a provider of orthopedic rehabilitation products for over years 
our chattanooga group division offers a wide variety of rehabilitation and home health products making it capable of providing turn key clinics for orthopedic professionals 
we have financed our two most recent acquisitions through the sale of equity securities and incurring additional debt 
our soft goods acquisition was financed principally through a portion of the proceeds from the sale of  shares of series a preferred stock 
our rehabilitation equipment acquisition was financed with debt borrowed under a credit agreement with bank of america  national association  and a note and equity purchase agreement with capitalsource finance llc 
we expect that we will continue to utilize some combination of both debt and equity funding as we continue to implement our strategy of growth through acquisition 
the nature of our business requires significant investment in inventory  capital and new product development 
our customers expect us to maintain sufficient inventory on hand at all times to meet their needs 
our domestic customers in the surgical division require consignment product be placed at or near their respective locations 
our remaining customers across all product lines demand short delivery schedules for their orders 
we also are subject to significant needs for capital investment in manufacturing equipment and facilities and for the instrument sets required by our surgical division customers 
finally  we have placed a strong emphasis on our research and development efforts for new products 
in our surgical division  we have developed numerous products and have obtained regulatory approval for over products and product improvements focused on the orthopedic total joint  trauma and spinal segments of the surgical market 
the chattanooga group division historically has  and continues to  emphasize new product introductions 
during  we introduced the vitalstim product line in the chattanooga group division and the keramos ceramic on ceramic hip in the surgical division 
other important products introduced in the surgical division included the reverse shoulder prostheses for use in shoulder implants and the cyclone anterior cervical plate used in cervical spine fusion as well as the dknee system 
in  we posted record sales and exceeded forecasted amounts for both revenues and operating income 
the financial success achieved in our performance includes our continued increase in domestic surgical division sales as we continue to build our united states sales force for reconstruction  trauma  and spinal products 
the results also include a full year of results for our chattanooga group division  which is a leading designer  manufacturer  and distributor of rehabilitation products 
in  sales increased percent to million compared to million for gross margin as a percent of sales increased to percent in compared to percent in operating income improved percent to million in compared to million in operating cash flow increased by million to million for the year ended all three of our divisions contributed to our improved operating performance 
the surgical and chattanooga divisions provided the improvement in sales while all three divisions posted gross margin improvements 
we also controlled our operational spending across all three divisions and managed our operating assets to improve operating income and cash flow 
during  we completed two public offerings of our common stock 
in our first offering  completed august   we sold  shares and raised gross proceeds of million  million net of underwriting discounts and associated offering costs 
we used these proceeds to repay our indebtedness to capitalsource finance llc and bank of america and for general corporate purposes 
in conjunction with this offering  all of our outstanding series a preferred stock was converted to common stock  thereby simplifying our capital structure 
our second offering  completed december   raised million from the sale of  shares of common stock 
the proceeds from this offering will be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes  including possible acquisitions 
we began with million of debt and million of cash 
as a result of these two offerings  we ended with million in cash and investments and only million of debt 
key industry trends  events and uncertainties the orthopedic industry has been experiencing a growth trend which we expect to continue over the short and long term 
two primary contributing factors to this trend are the aging population and technological innovation 
the baby boom generation continues to age and  along with them  the need for reconstructive implants  sports medicine  rehabilitation equipment and related products is growing 
in addition  people are living longer and more active lives thereby increasing the frequency of injury and reducing the age at which orthopedic products and services are required 
technological innovation is also fueling growth in this industry 
improvements are continually introduced to expand the life of implants and minimize the invasiveness of the surgery required 
these innovations are reducing the average age when a patient will consider the use of implantable orthopedic devices 
on october   zimmer holdings inc announced the completion of its acquisition of centerpulse ag 
both of these companies were included in the core of largest companies in our industry 
this acquisition presents both challenges and opportunities 
although not a new challenge for our organization  the joining of two of our largest competitors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in the marketplace 
however  as these organizations merge their operating  sales  marketing and administrative departments  opportunities will arise to obtain good resources and talent that for one reason or another may no longer be with the combined organization 
results of operations the following table sets forth our statements of operations as a percentage of sales for the periods indicated year ended december  sales cost of goods sold gross margin operating expenses selling  general and administrative research and development other charges income from operations interest income interest expense early extinguishment of debt other income income loss before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net income loss beneficial conversion feature related to series a preferred stock net income loss attributable to common stock year ended december  compared to year ended december  sales 
sales for the year ended december  were million compared to million in  an increase of 
this increase was primarily a result of increases in the surgical and chattanooga group divisions  which contributed and of total sales  respectively 
the company continues to increase its market penetration in domestic surgical sales as it continues to build its united states sales force for reconstruction  trauma  and spinal products 
in the surgical division  the company had sales of million for the year ended december  compared to million in  an increase of percent 
domestic surgical division sales for grew more than percent to million compared to million in the year over year growth rate in this division increased in each quarter  from flat in the first quarter when compared to the first quarter of  to percent in the second quarter  percent in the third quarter  and percent in the fourth quarter 
the primary contributor to improved domestic sales performance in this division is the increase in the number and quality of sales representatives selling our product from at the end of to at the end of international sales also improved over the prior year from million in to million in more than two thirds of this increase can be attributed to increased purchases from our largest international distributor in japan 
the remaining increase is the result of adding new distributors outside the us in new territories 
in the chattanooga group division  the results include a full year of operations as part of the company 
the chattanooga group division had sales of million in compared to sales during the period of million  representing a percent increase for the division 
the chattanooga group division s results represent a growth rate of approximately percent compared to when the division had total revenue of million including the six week period prior to the company s february  acquisition of the chattanooga group  inc 
including the pre acquisition period of  the chattanooga group division s domestic sales increased percent for over while international sales increased percent for over this division s growth is primarily due to the introduction of new products and increased penetration in international markets 
the soft goods division contributed sales of million for the year compared to sales in of million 
this decrease is primarily a result of customers increasing inventory levels in and then reducing their inventory levels to more normalized levels during the beginning of the quarterly distribution of sales in this division illustrates this point as follows first quarter million  second quarter million  third quarter million and fourth quarter million 
the following table sets forth the geographic mix for each of our division s sales 
the amounts shown for the chattanooga group division includes the six week period prior to the company s february  acquisition of the chattanooga group  inc so as to make the comparisons more meaningful 
domestic international total growth growth growth surgical division     chattanooga group division      soft goods division      total       gross margin 
gross margin as a percentage of sales grew percentage points to in from in this increase was primarily due to favorable product mix resulting from increased sales in the surgical division which has the highest gross margins of our divisions  increased sales of new products with higher margins  and continued efforts to improve manufacturing costs 
the gross margin improvement was felt across the company 
gross margin as a percentage of sales improved for all divisions in over the surgical division s gross margin as a percentage of sales increased from in to in due largely to sales mix in favor of new products that yield higher margins and efforts to reduce manufacturing costs 
gross margin as a percentage of sales for the chattanooga group division increased percentage points to for the year ended december  due to lower manufacturing costs 
the gross margin percentage for the soft goods division improved from in to in as a result of cost reductions and the launch of several new  higher margin products 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased to million  or of total revenues  for the year ended december  from million  or of total revenues  for the year ended december  this dollar increase of was primarily due to expanded efforts to develop new products across all divisions including the keramos ceramic on ceramic acetabular hip replacement  the reverse shoulder prosthesis for use in shoulder implants  the dknee system  the cyclone anterior cervical plate and three electrotherapy products the intelect legend xt  vectra genisys  and intelect transport 
selling  general and administrative 
in absolute dollar terms  selling  general  and administrative expenses increased for the year  to million in from million in as a percentage of sales  selling  general  and administrative expenses declined from in to in the reduction of selling  general  and administrative expenses as a percent of sales is do to continued cost reduction efforts  including  but not limited to  controlling warehouse and distribution costs  which declined by almost  or year over year 
as a result of increased sales and new agent relationships  commissions and royalties expense increased by approximately million primarily due to increases in both the surgical and chattanooga group divisions 
sales and marketing expense increased by a total of million  in line with the increase in sales and related activities in the surgical and chattanooga group divisions and sales force reorganization activities in the soft goods division 
the company did incur significant costs related to compliance with new requirements for corporate governance and reporting as a result of the sarbanes oxley act of most of the remaining increase for selling  general  and administrative expenses is do to the inclusion of a full year of chattanooga group division expenses compared to a shortened period in and increased payroll costs related to performance incentives 
operating income 
operating income increased million  or  from million in to million in improved sales and margin drove this improvement in our operating results 
interest expense 
interest expense declined million from million in to million in this is the result of the elimination of a significant portion of the company s long term debt by the end of the third quarter 
during the fourth quarter  interest expense was  during the third quarter  the company completed a public offering of common stock raising gross proceeds of million 
the net proceeds of this offering were used to pay approximately million of outstanding debt 
early extinguishment of debt 
we recorded expenses in the third quarter of due to the early repayment of our outstanding debt using proceeds from the secondary offering completed in august 
all but approximately  of the million charge represented a non cash expense for unamortized warrant and debt issue costs 
net income loss 
we recorded a net loss for the year of million compared to net income of  in however  our fourth quarter result is worthy of note here as it is more indicative of our future operating performance 
we recorded net income of million for our fourth quarter compared to  in the fourth quarter of there are two factors contributing to this improvement 
first  the improvement in our operating income as discussed above and second  the elimination of our interest expense 
the adjusted income  excluding the charges for early extinguishment of debt  is million 
the following table  which has been presented on a non gaap basis  has been provided to reconcile the company s net loss for the twelve month period ended december  to adjusted income 
the adjusted income excludes the impact of the expensing of prepayment penalties and unamortized warrant and debt issue costs associated with the early extinguishment of debt during the third quarter of of which only  was cash 
the adjusted income has been included as it is deemed to provide meaningful information regarding the company s current period performance excluding the additional expense associated with the early debt extinguishment  which is a non recurring transaction the company consummated upon the closing of the million offering of the company s common stock in august the following should be read in conjunction with the company s actual financial results presented above  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
reconciliation of adjusted income twelve months ended loss before income taxes  as reported  warrant expense  debt issues costs and prepayment penalties expensed in connection with early payment of debt  income before income taxes  as adjusted  provision for income taxes  income  as adjusted  year ended december  compared to year ended december  sales 
sales were million for the year ended  representing an increase of million  or over the year ended december  the primary reason for this significant increase were sales generated as a result of the february acquisition of chattanooga group  inc the chattanooga group division s sales for represented of the company s total annual sales for in the surgical division  overall sales for of million represent a decrease when compared to sales levels of this was due to increases in price and changes in sales mix offset by decreases in volume 
however  in this division  the overall sales decrease masks the improvements made by the surgical division in expanding its domestic sales  where the company concentrated most of its division sales efforts throughout the increase in domestic sales for the surgical division was when compared to domestic sales levels 
the increase was most notable in the spine implant area where domestic sales increased over the level of spine product domestic sales for international sales in the surgical division totaled million for  which represents a decrease of when compared to the sales levels for this decrease was primarily a result of a competitor acquiring encore s primary european distributor in the fall of the chattanooga group division reported sales of million  representing a increase over its sales levels of million for the comparable period in  which were generated prior to its acquisition by encore 
the soft goods division contributed million in sales for  compared to million for  when only six months of sales were generated as a result of the july acquisition of the product lines that are sold in this division 
gross margin 
gross margin increased by million in to million as compared to million for this increase  like the increase in sales  was largely due to the acquisition of chattanooga group  inc the addition of the chattanooga group accounted for million of the increase 
the soft goods and surgical divisions increased by million and  respectively 
while gross margin grew by absolute dollar amounts  overall gross margin as a percent of sales decreased from to when compared to the surgical division s gross margins as a percent of sales improved for the year from to due primarily to the change in sales mix in favor of domestic sales that yield higher margins 
sales of soft goods division products produced a gross margin of in  compared to in and sales of rehabilitation equipment in the chattanooga group division produced a gross margin of of sales in research and development 
research and development expenses increased to million for from million in this is an increase of million or over the inclusion of research and development expenses related to the chattanooga group division primarily accounted for this increase 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general  and administrative expenses totaled million for the year  representing an increase of million  or  over expenditures that totaled million 
however  as a percentage of sales  selling  general  and administrative expenses decreased to for from in these expenses increased in part due to the acquisitions of the chattanooga group division  which incurred million of selling  general  and administrative expenses in  or of the total increase for the year  and the soft goods division which increased million to million due to the first full year of expenses related to this division 
the remaining increase is primarily attributable to two factors 
first  marketing expenses increased  due to increased activities associated with tradeshows and consulting surgeons 
second  general and administrative expenses increased  due to expanded investor relations activities  higher directors and officers liability insurance  increased strategic planning activities  and higher attorney fees related to the akthea litigation 
other charges 
unlike when million relating to specific non recurring items was reported  no non recurring charges were incurred during in  these items included  related to a senior management option exchange program   incurred in connection with a legal settlement of a lawsuit brought by a former stockholder in an attempt to stop the issuance of the series a preferred stock and  charged for the cashless exercise of options by a former employee 
operating income 
the combination of these factors resulted in a million increase in operating income to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  net income 
the large improvements in operating income were offset by increased interest expense and a high effective tax rate to produce net income of  for the year compared to net income of  for before the impact of the beneficial conversion feature related to series a preferred stock of million 
interest expense increased to million in from million in this increase of million was directly related to additional interest incurred in connection with the acquisition of chattanooga group  inc the effective tax rate rose to for the year principally due to the permanent tax differences related to the chattanooga group  inc acquisition compared to the level of pre tax income 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  management evaluates estimates  including those related to inventory  accounts receivable  deferred taxes  goodwill  and intangible assets 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
to the extent that actual events differ from our estimates and assumptions  there could be a material impact to our financial statements 
inventory reserves the nature of our business requires us to maintain sufficient inventory on hand at all times to meet the requirements of our customers 
we record inventory at the lower of cost or market  with cost based upon average actual cost 
we maintain inventory reserves for such issues as slow moving or excess inventory  product obsolescence and declines in valuation 
our inventory reserve policy is primarily based on our products and market practices 
in each division we use a specific identification methodology product rationalization  which can occur whenever there is a change in strategy 
in addition  we review sales performance on at least a quarterly basis to determine the amounts that we should add to the existing reserve 
we monitor reserves on a quarterly basis and make changes as determined by the processes referred to above 
to determine the adequacy of our reserves at each reporting period we analyze the following  among other factors current inventory quantities on hand  product acceptance in the marketplace  customer demand  historical sales  forecasted sales  product obsolescence  and technological innovations 
any modifications to our estimates of our reserves are reflected in cost of sales within the statement of operations during the period in which such modifications are determined necessary by management 
our surgical division products are sold in the united states at the time the product is used in a surgical procedure 
as such  we must maintain sufficient quantities of our products at many locations throughout the country 
this requires a large amount of inventory to be on hand for each surgical division product we sell 
it also increases the sensitivity of this line of business to obsolescence reserve estimates 
revenue recognition our surgical division products are sold through a network of independent sales representatives in the united states and by distributors outside the united states 
we record revenues from sales made by sales representatives  who are paid commissions upon the ultimate sale of the products  at the time the product is used in a surgical procedure implanted in a patient and a purchase order is received from the hospital 
we record revenues from sales to customers outside the united states at the time the product is shipped to the distributor 
our distributors  who sell the products to their customers  take title to the products  have no rights of return and assume the risk for credit and obsolescence 
distributors are obligated to pay us within specified terms regardless of when they sell the products 
in addition  there is no price protection available to distributors 
we sell our soft goods division products to distributors  retail outlets and various medical and sports establishments 
we record sales at the time the product is shipped to the customer 
customers take title to the products  assume credit and product obsolescence risks  must pay within specified periods regardless of when they sell or use the products and have no price protection except for distributors who participate in our rebate program 
we allow product returns only with our prior approval and we maintain a reserve for estimated product returns based on actual historical experience 
in addition  we grant rebates to distributors and we maintain a reserve for future rebate claims based on actual historical experience 
the reserves for estimated product returns and rebate claims are a deduction from the sales recorded for each reporting period 
we sell our chattanooga group division products to dealers who take title to the products  assume credit and product obsolescence risks  must pay within specified periods regardless of when they sell the products and have no price protection 
we record the sales when the products are shipped to the dealers 
we allow product returns only with our prior approval and we maintain a reserve for estimated product returns based on actual historical experience 
as a medical equipment manufacturer  our revenue recognition issues are generally insignificant 
our customers take title to the products  assume credit and product obsolescence risks  must pay within specified periods regardless of when they sell the products and have limited rights of return 
the surgical and chattanooga group divisions offer no price protection  however  the soft goods division grants rebates to its distributors 
we must make estimates of potential future product returns and rebates related to current period product revenue 
to do so  management analyzes historical returns  current economic trends  and changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products when evaluating the adequacy of the sales returns and other allowances 
significant management judgment must be used and estimated made in connection with establishing the sales returns  rebates and other allowances in any accounting period 
we maintain a reserve for future rebate claims based on actual historical experience which is recorded as a deduction from the sales for each reporting period 
during  average monthly rebates requested amounted to approximately  should actual future requests vary significantly from these historical averages  our operating results for this division in particular and for the company as a whole could be affected 
deferred tax asset valuation allowance in assessing the potential realization of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon whether we attain future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
based upon management s projections of future taxable income and the periods and manner in which our deferred tax assets will be available  management estimates that it is more likely than not that all of our deferred tax assets will be available to offset future taxable income 
as such  no valuation allowance has been provided against the deferred tax asset balance 
our current deferred tax asset balance is million at december  and primarily relates to inventory and other reserves  accrued compensation and a charitable contribution carryforward 
our current projections indicate we will utilize these deferred tax items in the next few years 
goodwill and intangible assets we must make estimates related to the initial recognition and measurement of intangible assets acquired in connection with a business combination or asset acquisition  as well as the ongoing measurement of the useful life and value of intangible assets and goodwill 
with respect to valuations of intangible assets acquired in connection with a business combination or asset acquisition  we use both internal and external third party evaluations in determining the respective fair values and relative allocations of acquisition cost to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
additionally  on an ongoing basis  we review our intangible assets and goodwill to determine if there has been any change in the useful life of an intangible asset or whether there has been impairment of these assets 
at december   we have million in goodwill  of which million relates to our chattanooga group division and million relates to our surgical division 
in addition  our intangible asset balance of million at december  can be allocated  based on revenues related to the intangible assets  between our three divisions as follows surgical division chattanooga group division soft goods division total recent accounting pronouncements in december  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition sab no 
 which codifies  revises and rescinds certain sections of sab no 
 revenue recognition  in order to make this interpretive guidance consistent with current authoritative accounting and auditing guidance and sec rules and regulations 
the changes noted in sab no 
did not have a material effect on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
significant demands inventory 
the nature of our business requires us to maintain sufficient inventory on hand at all times to meet the requirements of our customers 
throughout our history  our largest demand for capital has come from inventory 
our surgical division must maintain sufficient quantities of our product in consigned locations throughout the country for surgeries to be performed on a daily and timely basis 
in addition  all of our divisions must have sufficient quantities on hand to supply their dealers and distributors with product within a reasonable timeframe based on market needs 
capital expenditures 
the following table summarizes our capital expenditures during the indicated periods in thousands buildings and leasehold improvements equipment furniture and fixtures surgical instrumentation   total    we have made significant investments in the surgical implant instrumentation required to implant our surgical products 
the size of our investments in this instrumentation has increased due to the increasing size of our sales force and the expansion of our product lines 
consistent with industry practice  our sales agents often provide surgeons with the usage of necessary surgical implant instrumentation free of charge 
following surgery  the instruments are returned to our agents or us and the hospital pays us for any products used in the surgery 
in the united states  we capitalize and depreciate the surgical implant instrumentation we utilize in support of our domestic sales force  whereas the instruments are sold or leased to our international customers 
we have invested in various machine tools in order to increase our manufacturing capacity 
we primarily acquire our machinery through capital leases or acquisitions 
we have devoted significant capital resources to expanding and improving our information systems through the addition of computer hardware and software  and various other related equipment required to support a growing organization 
additionally  we acquired million of equipment in connection with the acquisition of the orthopedic soft goods  patient support  and pressure care product lines on july  we capitalized  in and  in primarily in warehouse equipment  computer equipment and software to set up information systems  network and warehousing capabilities related to the sales of these products 
we acquired million in property and equipment related to its acquisition of the chattanooga group 
we capitalized  through the end of related to the chattanooga group acquisition  which was primarily office and plant equipment 
during  we did not capitalize any items related to either acquisition 
research and development 
our industry is characterized by continual technological improvement 
our customers demand innovation for a variety of reasons including increased range of motion  faster recovery periods  ease of use  and longer product life span  among other things 
in response to this demand  we have continued to invest in research and development efforts to benefit all of our divisions 
our product enhancements and new product development processes typically require fda and international regulatory agency approval 
as such  we must invest significant time and resources in order to meet our customers expectations 
we have committed of sales during  during  and of sales during the year ended december  to these efforts 
we expect to increase this level of commitment as we continue to grow 
liquidity and capital resources on august   we sold a total of  shares of our common stock at per share in a public offering 
this offering generated total gross proceeds of approximately million  and we used the net proceeds of approximately million to repay million of indebtedness under our senior subordinated notes payable to capitalsource finance llc  million of the term loan debt under our senior credit facility with bank of america  million to repay our outstanding indebtedness under our bank of america revolving credit facility  and the remainder for general corporate purposes 
on december   we sold  shares of our common stock for per share in a public offering 
this offering generated total gross proceeds of approximately million  and we will use the net proceeds of approximately million for working capital and general corporate purposes  including potential acquisitions 
during  our operating activities provided cash and cash equivalents of million  compared to million in this increase is primarily related to the fact that cash flow from operating activities improved due to the overall improvement in our sales and gross margins and we controlled our operating expenses 
however  there were several offsetting fluctuations in our operating assets and liabilities 
our accounts receivable provided million in cash this year which is significant in light of our increased sales level 
also  our outstanding balances of accounts payable and accrued liabilities increased million mostly in accrued compensation and trade payables 
this is actually an improvement in the usage of cash of million from the prior year when we used million of cash for payables and accrued liabilities 
increasing our inventory used million of cash during primarily for the establishment of new agent relationships in the surgical division and the introduction of the new electrotherapy products in the chattanooga group division 
this represents a decrease in the usage of cash of million compared to the prior year when inventory reductions provided cash of million 
our investing activities have historically been limited to capital expenditures and  more recently  the purchase of products and companies as we have implemented our acquisition growth campaign 
we used million for capital expenditures during compared to only million in a significant portion of our capital expenditures typically relates to instrument sets required by our surgical division 
part of the increase in resulted from an  increase over purchase levels as we are building the instrument base necessary to support a growing domestic surgical sales force 
in  we completed our acquisition of the chattanooga group  inc using million in cash for this purchase 
in  we invested million in short term government securities using the cash generated from our december public offering 
with the completion of our recent acquisition campaign  our financing sources for both debt and equity securities have expanded 
cash provided by financing activities in increased by million to million in from million in this increase is the result of cash received from the resulting from two public offerings completed in august and december this increase was offset by the million in payments made to reduce our long term debt balance principally from funds generated from our august public offering 
since inception  we have financed our operations through the sale of equity securities  borrowings and cash flow from operations 
our bank of america credit facility  as amended on september   currently totals million in principal availability under a revolving line of credit facility 
the availability of funds we can borrow at any given time under the revolving line of credit depends upon the level of the borrowing base  which is based upon accounts receivable and inventory 
as of december   we had an available borrowing base of approximately million  and we had not borrowed any of this available amount 
we executed various security documents and we pledged all of our assets to the lenders to secure the financing under our bank of america credit agreement 
the interest rate under our credit facility is dependent on our total debt to ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  but based on that ratio as of december   is equal to bank of america s base rate plus  or the london interbank offered rate libor plus 
additionally  in order to finance the acquisition of chattanooga group  inc  we and our subsidiaries entered into a note and equity purchase agreement dated as of february  with capitalsource finance llc capitalsource  as agent and purchaser  pursuant to which we sold to capitalsource  in senior subordinated notes 
we  and our subsidiaries  executed various security documents whereby we pledged our assets to capitalsource in order to it to secure our obligations 
capitalsource s rights to the collateral we have pledged to them to secure the senior subordinated notes are junior and subordinate to the rights in the collateral of the various lenders and the security interests created by the security documents executed pursuant to the bank of america credit agreement 
we repaid all of the outstanding principal and accrued payment in kind interest on these notes with the proceeds of our august public offering 
our agreements with capitalsource were amended and restated as of september   and now allow us to borrow up to million  of which during october we borrowed million 
the interest rate for amounts we borrow under the senior subordinated notes payable to capitalsource will be per annum from and after our next borrowing draw request on the loan  but until then the interest rate will be equal to the citibank  na prime rate plus these debt arrangements contain operating and financial agreements and restrictions which may restrict our business and financing activities 
these debt agreements restrict our ability to i incur additional indebtedness  ii issue redeemable equity interests and preferred equity interests  iii pay dividends or make distributions  repurchase equity interests or make other restricted payments  iv make capital expenditures  v create liens  vi enter into transactions with our affiliates  vii make investments  viii sell assets  or ix enter into mergers or consolidations 
in connection with the original capitalsource note agreement  we granted to an affiliate of capitalsource a warrant to purchase through february  up to an aggregate of  shares of our common stock at a purchase price of per share 
the expense related to this warrant is being amortized to interest expense beginning february  using the original term of the note agreement five years 
in connection with the repayment of this original debt  we expensed the remaining balance of this warrant 
as stated above  we amended and restated both of our agreements with our lenders effective as of september   upon repayment of the existing debt 
these amendments improved our cost of borrowing and modified our financial covenants in a manner which generally increases the likelihood of our compliance 
we were in compliance throughout while we currently believe that we will be able to meet all of our financial covenants during and will be able to keep the need for outstanding debt under the maximum ceilings for amounts outstanding  there is no assurance that we will in fact be able to do so or that we will be able to obtain a waiver of default or amendments to our credit agreements in the future 
in addition  we believe that our existing cash  including the amounts we generated through our recent public offerings and through operations and amounts available through our existing debt agreements  will be sufficient to meet our needs through in addition to the current restrictions and requirements contained in our current loan and credit agreements  if we were to borrow under our current facilities with bank of america and capitalsource the maximum allowable  these debt levels may limit our flexibility in obtaining additional financing and in pursuing other business opportunities 
this potential high degree of leverage could have negative consequences for us  including the following i our ability to obtain additional financing  if necessary  for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions or other purposes may be impaired  or financing may not be available to us on favorable terms  ii we would need a substantial portion of our cash flow to pay the principal and interest on our indebtedness  including indebtedness that we may incur in the future  iii payments on our indebtedness would reduce the funds that would otherwise be available for operations and future business opportunities  iv a substantial decrease in net operating cash flows could make it difficult for us to meet our debt service requirements and force us to modify our operations  v our debt level could make us more vulnerable than our competitors to a downturn in either our business or the economy generally  and vi because some of our debt has a variable rate of interest  it would expose us to the risk of increased interest rates 
contractual obligations  commercial commitments  and leases the following table summarizes our contractual obligations associated with our long term debt  lease obligations and purchase obligations in thousands for periods after december  payment due by period total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations   capital lease obligations operating lease obligations   purchase obligations    total     the purchase obligations shown above include an annual commitment of  to our third party supplier in mexico who supplies the labor component necessary to assemble and finish our soft goods products  as well as approximately million committed to a manufacturer in china to build pc boards for our existing and new electrotherapy lines for our chattanooga group division

these forward looking statements are further qualified by important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements 
these factors include  without limitation  the effect of competitive pricing  our dependence on the ability of our third party manufacturers to produce components on a basis that is cost effective to us  market acceptance of our products  the ability to attract and retain competent employees  technological obsolescence of one or more products  changes in product strategies  the availability to locate acceptable acquisition candidates and then finance and integrate those acquisitions  and effects of government regulation

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to certain market risks as part of its ongoing business operations  primarily risks from changing interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates that could impact its financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
primary exposure includes changing interest rates 
currently  encore is exposed to interest rate risk in connection with our bank of america credit facility and capitalsource debt  which bear interest at floating rates based on libor or the prime rate plus an applicable borrowing margin 
outstanding balances under these agreements are zero and million  respectively  at december  encore manages its interest rate risk by balancing the amount of fixed and variable debt 
for fixed rate debt  interest rate changes affect the market value  but do not impact earnings or cash flow 
conversely  for variable rate debt  interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair market value  but do impact future earnings and cash flow  assuming other factors are held constant 
all of the bank of america facility is variable rate debt 
the capitalsource debt is also currently variable rate debt  but will convert to a fixed rate of with the next draw 
certain other debt of the company is fixed rate debt 
encore may use derivative financial instruments where appropriate to manage its interest rate risk 
however  as a matter of policy  it does not enter into derivative or other financial investments for trading or speculative purposes 
to date  we have not entered into derivate financial instruments 
historically all of the company s sales have been denominated in us dollars  and therefore the company has not been subject to foreign currency exchange risks 
however  the company has begun to directly distribute its chattanooga group division products in selected foreign markets  and some of the sales of its products in european markets are denominated in euros  which would cause currency fluctuations to more directly impact our operating results 
during  average monthly euro sales approximated
