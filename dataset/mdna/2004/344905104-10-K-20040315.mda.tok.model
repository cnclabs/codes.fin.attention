item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements  and the footnotes thereto  contained elsewhere in this report and the statements regarding forward looking information and the factors that could affect our future performance described below in this report 
our principal operating subsidiary is foothill independent bank the bank  which is a california state chartered bank and a member of the federal reserve system 
the bank accounts for substantially all of our consolidated revenues and income 
accordingly  the following discussion focuses primarily on the bank s operations and financial condition 
forward looking statements the discussion below in this section of this annual report includes forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended the act and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended the act 
those sections of the act and act provide a safe harbor for forward looking statements to encourage companies to provide prospective information about their financial performance so long as they provide meaningful  cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ significantly from projected results 
other than statements of historical fact  all statements in this report and  in particular  any projections of or statements as to our expectations or beliefs concerning our future financial performance or financial condition or trends in our business or in our markets  are forward looking statements 
forward looking statements often include the words believe  expect  anticipate  intend  plan  estimate  project  or words of similar meaning  or future or conditional verbs such as will  would  should  could  or may 
factors that could affect our future operating results and cause them to differ  possibly significantly  from those currently anticipated are described in this section of this report  including in the subsections entitled critical accounting policies and factors that could affect our future financial performance and  according  this section of this report should be read in its entirety 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap and general practices in the banking industry 
the information contained within our financial statements is  to a significant extent  based on approximate measures of the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred 
however  the carrying value of some of our assets can be affected by estimates and the judgments we make about future or anticipated events  the outcome of which  in some cases  is outside of our control and which could cause our future operating results to differ  possibly materially  from the results that are currently expected 
judgments regarding reserves for potential loan losses 
the accounting policies we follow in determining the sufficiency of the reserves we establish for possible loan losses require us to make judgments and assumptions about future economic and market conditions that can affect the ability of our borrowers to meet their loan payment obligations 
for example  if economic or market conditions were to change in an unexpectedly adverse manner or interest rates were to increase beyond the levels expected by us when we established the reserves for loan losses  such changed conditions could increase the possibility of borrower payment defaults  which could require us to increase reserves for potential loan losses 
since reserves are increased by a charge against income known as the provision for loan losses  such changed conditions could cause our earnings to decline in the period when those increases are recorded 
see results of operation provision for loan losses below in this section of this report 
additionally  conditions or events of this nature could require us to reduce the carrying values of the loans that are affected by these conditions often referred to as loan write downs or loan charge offs 
since loans represent the largest component of our total assets  unanticipated changes in economic or market conditions potentially can have a significant effect on the amount of our reported assets as set forth on our balance sheet 

table of contents utilization of deferred income tax benefits 
the provision that we make for income taxes is based on  among other things  our ability to use certain income tax benefits available under state and federal income tax laws to reduce our income tax liability 
as of december   the total of the unused income tax benefits referred to in our consolidated financial statements as a deferred tax asset  available to reduce our income taxes in future periods was  such tax benefits expire over time unless used and the realization of those benefits is dependent on our generating taxable income in the future in amounts sufficient to utilize those tax benefits prior to their expiration 
we have made a judgment  based on historical experience and current and anticipated market and economic conditions and trends  that it is more likely than not that we will generate taxable income in future years sufficient to fully utilize those benefits 
in the event  however  that our income were to decline in future periods making it less likely that those benefits could be fully utilized  we would be required to establish a valuation reserve to cover the potential loss of those tax benefits 
the creation of such an allowance would result in an increase in the provision we make for income taxes  and  therefore  would have the effect of reducing our net income 
results of operations overview of fiscal operating results 
the principal determinant of a banking organization s income is net interest income  which is the difference between the interest that a bank earns on loans  investments and other interest earning assets  and its interest expense  which consists primarily of the interest it must pay to attract and retain deposits and the interest that it pays on other interest bearing liabilities 
a bank s interest income and interest expense are  in turn  affected by a number of factors  some of which are outside of its control  including the monetary policies of the federal reserve board  national and local economic conditions  and competition from other depository institutions and financial services companies  which affect interest rates and also the demand for loans and the ability of borrowers to meet their loan payment obligations 
the following table sets forth information regarding the interest income that we generated  the interest expense that we incurred  our net interest income and our net earnings in years ended december   and year ended december  in thousands interest income interest expense net interest income net income during the federal reserve board adopted and began implementing a monetary policy that was designed to reduce market rates of interest in an effort to stimulate the us economy  which was heading into recession 
that policy continued through and  as the hoped for economic recovery has been slow to develop 
pursuant to that policy the federal reserve board reduced interest rates throughout and  as a result  the prime rate of interest charged by most banks declined from to during it remained at through most of  declining to in november  where it remained until late june of when it declined further to as a result of a further reduction in interest rates by the federal reserve board 
those monetary policies  combined with the continued softness in the united states economy  caused the average rate of interest earned on our interest earning assets to decline to in fiscal from in fiscal and in fiscal despite that decline  as indicated in the table above  we still achieved an increase of  or  in net earnings in as compared to that increase was primarily due an increase in net interest income in of  or  as compared to  which was partially offset by a  increase in non interest expense

there were three non accruing loans totaling  of total loans outstanding at december   and four non accruing loans totaling   of total loans outstanding at december  and six non accruing loans totaling  of total loans outstanding at december  includes now and money market deposit accounts 
increase in interest income 
the increase in interest income was primarily attributable to the following factors set forth in order of importance in terms of their effect on interest income an increase in loan volume  which more than offset the effect of declining rates of interest on interest income  and an increase in loan prepayment fees  due to refinancings of mortgage loans  or mortgage loan payoffs on sales of real properties  by borrowers who chose to take advantage of declining interest rates or increasing property values in our markets 
although these mortgage loan refinancings and payoffs helped to increase our interest income in  they could have the effect of reducing average yields on outstanding loans and  therefore  our net interest margin in future periods 
reduction in interest expense 
the reduction in interest expense was primarily attributable to the following factors set forth in order of importance in terms of their impact on interest expense lower rates of interest paid on deposits that resulted principally from the lowering of market rates of interest by the federal reserve board  and a reduction in the average volume of outstanding time deposits  including those in denominations of  or more  as a result of our decision to allow some of those deposits to be withdrawn on their maturity rather than seeking their renewal

rate sensitivity  net interest margins and market risk 
rate sensitivity 
like other banks and bank holding companies  our margins that is  the difference between yields we are able to realize  and therefore the interest income that we are able to generate  on loans and other interest earning assets  on the one hand  and the interest we pay on deposits  on the other hand are affected by a number of factors  including the relative percentages or the mix of our assets  between loans  on the one hand  on which we are able to obtain higher rates of interest  and investment securities  federal funds sold and funds held in interest bearing deposits with other financial institutions  on the other hand  on which yields generally are lower  variable and fixed rate loans in the loan portfolio  and demand  savings and money market deposits  on the one hand  and higher priced time deposits  on the other hand 

table of contents impact on net interest margins of the mix of fixed and variable rate loans 
as a general rule  in an interest rate environment like the one we have experienced during the past two years  a bank with a relatively high percentage of variable rate loans will experience a decline in net interest margins because those loans will reprice automatically when market rates of interest decline 
by contrast  a bank with a large proportion of fixed rates loans generally will experience an increase in net interest margins  because the interest rates on those fixed rate loans will not decline in response to declines in market rates of interest 
in a period of increasing interest rates  however  the interest margin of banks with a high proportion of fixed rate loans generally will suffer because they will be unable to reprice those loans to fully offset the increase in the rates of interest they must offer to retain maturing time deposits and attract new deposits 
a bank with a higher proportion of variable loans in an environment of increasing market rates of interest will  on the other hand  be able to offset more fully the impact of rising rates of interest on the amounts they must pay to retain existing and attract new deposits 
the following table sets forth the maturities of our loans  and the mix of fixed and variable rate loans  as of december  in thousands maturing within one year one to five years after five years total total fixed rate loans total variable rate loans total impact on net interest margins of the mix of demand  savings and time deposits 
in a period of declining market rates of interest  all other things being equal  a bank with a greater proportion of demand and savings accounts  as compared to time deposits  is likely to have  at least for the short term  a higher interest margin than a bank with a greater proportion of time deposits  because a bank must wait for its time deposits to mature before it can implement reductions in the rates of interest it must pay on those deposits in response to declining market rates of interest 
by contrast  such reductions can be implemented more quickly on savings and money market deposits 
as a result  in a period of increasing market rates of interest  all other things being equal  a bank with a higher proportion of time deposits will generally have  at least for the short term  a higher interest margin than a bank with a higher proportion of savings deposits and a lower proportion of time deposits  because a bank need not increase the interest it pays on its time deposits until they mature  while it will usually have to increase its interest rates on savings and money market deposits to be able to retain them in response to increasing market rates of interest and competition from other depository institutions 
the average amounts in thousands of and the average rates paid on deposits  by type  in the year ended december  are summarized below year ended december  average balance average rate noninterest bearing demand deposits savings deposits time deposits total deposits impact of changes in the mix of earning assets and in the mix of interest bearing liabilities 
the increase in net interest income in was not only attributable to a decline in interest rates paid on interest bearing deposits  but also to a reduction in the volume of our higher priced time deposits that resulted from a decision we made to allow some of those deposits to run off rather than to seek their renewal 
additionally  we were able to mitigate somewhat the effect of declining market rates of interest on interest income by implementing marketing programs that enabled us to increase the volume of our outstanding loans in the following table sets forth changes in interest earned  including loan fees  and interest paid in each of the years ended december  and and the extent to which those changes were attributable to changes in the volume or changes in the mix of interest earning assets and changes in the volume or changes in the mix of interest bearing liabilities 
changes in interest earned and interest paid due to both rate and volume have been allocated to the in proportion to the relationship of the absolute dollar amounts of the changes in each category 
amounts are in thousands

the interest rate on those borrowings in effect at december  was 
market risk and net interest margin in and as demonstrated by the impact of the reductions in market rates of interest during the past three years  our net interest margin and  therefore  our net interest income and net earnings are affected by changes in market rates of interest which we sometimes refer to as market risk 
we attempt to reduce our exposure to market risk associated with interest rate fluctuations by seeking i to attract and maintain a significant volume of demand and savings deposits that are not as sensitive to interest rate fluctuations as are time deposits  ii to match opportunities to reprice interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities in response to changes in market rates of interest  and iii to change the mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities in a manner that is designed to achieve increases in net interest income 
in the current interest rate environment  however  it is no longer possible to reduce the rates we pay on deposits much further in response to declining rates of interest on interest earning assets 
as a result  declining interest rates have exerted  and we expect that at least during the next months will continue to exert  downward pressure on our net interest margin as well as that of banking institutions generally 
in an effort to counteract this downward pressure on net interest margin  during the past year we have continued sales and marketing programs that are designed to increase our volume of loans  on which yields are higher than on other earning assets  and to change the mix of deposits to a greater proportion of lower cost demand and savings deposits  we have allowed some of our higher priced time deposits to run off  rather than to seek their renewal as a means of reducing our interest expense  and we adopted a new loan repricing policy which places an interest rate floor  currently at  that is applicable to all new variable rate loans that we make 

table of contents as a result of these measures  the volume of outstanding loans at december  was million  or  greater than at december  and the volume of demand  savings and money market deposits which are sometimes referred to as core deposits represented  while time deposits including those in denominations of  or more represented  of total deposits at december   as compared to and  respectively  at december  our net interest margin ie  tax adjusted net interest income stated as a percentage of average interest earning assets was for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  that decline was primarily due to the decrease in interest rates as mentioned above 
however  notwithstanding that decline  based on data obtained from the fdic  we believe that our net interest margin continues to exceed the average net interest margin for other banks and bank holding companies with assets ranging from to million the peer group banks  largely because we have been able to maintain the ratio of demand and savings deposits to total deposits at a higher level than that of our peer group banks and we were able to increase the volume of our loans which generate higher yields than do our other interest earning assets 
the ability to maintain our net interest margin is not entirely within our control  however  because the interest rates we are able to charge on loans and the interest rates we must offer to maintain and attract deposits are affected by national monetary policies established and implemented by the federal reserve board and by competitive conditions in our service areas 
in addition  the effect on a bank s net interest margin of changes in market rates of interest is affected by the types and maturities of its deposits and earning assets 
for example  a change in interest rates paid on deposits in response to changes in market rates of interest can be implemented more quickly in the case of savings deposits and money market accounts than with respect to time deposits as to which a change in interest rates generally cannot be implemented until such deposits mature 
also  a change in rates of interest paid on deposits can and often does lead consumers to move their deposits from one type of deposit to another or to shift funds from deposits to non bank investments or from such investments to bank deposit accounts or instruments  which will affect a bank s net interest margin 
following the federal reserve board s reduction in the federal funds rate in june  which led to a further reduction in market rates of interest  we experienced an increase in the number of higher interest rate loans that were either refinanced at lower rates of interest or were prepaid 
as a result  unless we are able to increase our loan volume and the volume of lower cost core deposits  we would expect our net interest margin to decline somewhat during accordingly  we have again instituted sales and marketing programs for that are designed to increase our loan volume and the volume of our core deposits 
however  we may find it necessary or prudent to increase time deposits to fund any resulting increases in loan volume 
additionally  there are a number of uncertainties and risks that could adversely affect our net interest margin in  including increased competition in our market areas  both from banks and other types of financial institutions as well as from securities brokerage firms and mutual funds that offer competing investment products  and the possibility that the economic slowdown will continue longer than is currently anticipated  which could result in reduced loan activity and in a further decline in market rates of interest 
provision for loan and lease losses 
like virtually all banking organizations  we follow the practice of maintaining a reserve the loan loss reserve for possible losses on loans and leases that occur from time to time as an incidental part of the banking business 
when it is determined that payment in full of a loan has become unlikely  the carrying value of the loan is reduced to what management estimates is its realizable value 
this reduction  which is referred to as a loan charge off  is charged against and  to that extent  reduces the amount of a reserve or allowance for potential loan losses that the bank maintains and which we will refer to as the loan loss reserve 
the loan loss reserve is increased periodically i to replenish the reserve after it has been reduced due to loan charge offs  ii to reflect changes in the volume of outstanding loans  and iii to take account of increases in the risk of potential losses due to a deterioration in the condition of borrowers or in the value of property securing non performing loans  or due to adverse changes in national or local economic conditions 
those increases and additions are made through a charge against income referred to as the provision for loan and lease losses 
recoveries of loans previously charged off are added back to and  to that extent  increase the loan loss reserve and therefore may reduce the amount of the provision that the bank would need to make to maintain the loan loss reserve at a level believed by management to be adequate 

table of contents we employ economic models that are based on bank regulatory guidelines and industry standards to evaluate and determine the adequacy of the loan loss reserve and  therefore  also the amount of the provision that we make for potential loan losses 
however  those determinations involve judgments or forecasts about future economic conditions and other events that are subject to a number of uncertainties  some of which are outside of our ability to control 
see the discussion above under the caption critical accounting policies and below under the caption factors that could affect our future financial performance 
during we made provisions for potential loan losses of  as compared to  during and  at december  the loan loss reserve was approximately  or of total loans and leases outstanding  compared to approximately  or of total loans and leases outstanding at december  as indicated below under caption financial condition loans information regarding non performing loans  the overall quality of our loan portfolio improved in  as it had in  which enabled us to reduce the provision we made for potential loan losses in as compared to and the following table sets forth an analysis of our loan and lease loss experience  by category  for the past three years with dollars stated in thousands

the following table identifies the components of and the percentage changes in non interest income in as compared to year ended december  increase decrease vs 
dollars in thousands non interest income services fees gain on sale of sba loans n m other the decrease in non interest income was primarily attributable to decreases in transaction fees and service charges collected on deposits and other banking transactions as compared to  which was partially offset by increases in other non interest income 
non interest expense 
non interest expense also sometimes referred to as other expense consists primarily of i salaries and other employee expenses  ii occupancy and furniture and equipment expenses  and iii other operating and miscellaneous expenses that include such expenses as insurance premiums  marketing expenses  data processing costs and professional fees 
in order to attract a higher volume of non interest bearing demand and lower cost savings and money market deposits as a means of maintaining the bank s net interest margin  it has been our policy to provide a higher level of personal service to our customers than the level of service that is typically provided by many of our competitors 
as a result  we have more banking personnel than many of our competitors of comparable size  which is reflected in our non interest expense 
however  we believe that this higher level of service has helped us to retain our existing deposit customers and attract new customers which has enabled us to achieve an average net interest margin that exceeds the average net interest margin of the banks in our peer group

dollars in thousands non interest expenses salaries and employee benefits net occupancy expense of premises furniture and equipment expenses other expenses efficiency ratio as the table above indicates  the increase in non interest expense in  as compared to  was primarily attributable to increases in salaries and in employee benefit expenses 
that increase  in turn  was primarily due to a general increase in employee base salaries and an increase in bonuses paid to loan officers and other employees for meeting loan and deposit growth targets established for notwithstanding that increase  however  due primarily to the increase in our net interest income in  we were able to improve our efficiency ratio to from in the efficiency ratio is  basically  the ratio of non interest expense adjusted to exclude non recurring expenses to the sum of net interest income and non interest income as adjusted to exclude any non recurring income 
income taxes 
income taxes increased by approximately  or in as compared to since our effective income tax rates were approximately the same in each of those years  that increase was primarily the result of the increases in pre tax income in as discussed above  under the caption critical accounting policies our income tax rates in and reflect the beneficial impact of our ability to use certain income tax benefits available under state and federal income tax laws 

table of contents financial condition total assets 
our total assets increased during by approximately million  or  to million at december  from million at december  contributing to the growth of our assets in were increases of million  or  in outstanding loans and million  or  in our investment portfolio 
as indicated in the table that follows  those increases were funded  in part  by a shift of funds from other earning assets  including federal funds sold  overnight repurchase agreements and time deposits held at other banks  as well as an increase in total deposits

table of contents liquidity management 
we have established liquidity management policies which are designed to achieve a matching of sources and uses of funds in order to enable us to fund our customers requirements for loans and for deposit withdrawals 
in accordance with those policies  we maintain a number of short term sources of funds to meet periodic increases in loan demand and deposit withdrawals and maturities 
at december   the principal sources of liquidity consisted of million in cash and demand balances due from other banks and million of federal funds sold and overnight repurchase agreements  which together totaled million 
other sources of liquidity include million in securities available for sale  of which approximately million mature within one year  million in securities held to maturity which mature within one year  and million in interest bearing deposits at other financial institutions  which mature in months or less 
in addition  substantially all of the bank s installment loans and leases  the amount of which aggregated million at december   require regular installment payments from customers  providing us with a steady flow of internally generated cash 
we also have a line of credit from the federal home loan bank  the amount of which was million as of december  borrowings under that credit line are secured by a pledge of some of our outstanding loans 
we also have established loan facilities that would enable us to borrow up to million of federal funds from other banks and we have an account with the federal reserve bank of san francisco that will also allow us to borrow at its discount window should the need arise 
finally  if necessary  we could obtain additional cash by selling time certificates of deposit into the cd market 
however  as a general rule  it has been and continues to be our policy to make use of borrowings under the credit line or loan facilities to fund short term cash requirements  before selling securities or reducing deposit balances at other banks and before selling time certificates of deposit 
contractual obligations 
set forth below is information regarding our material contractual obligations as of december  operating lease obligations 
as of december   our future minimum payment obligations stated in thousands under real property and equipment leases were year amount thereafter  total maturing time certificates of deposits 
set forth below is a maturity schedule  as of december   of domestic time certificates of deposit of  or more with amounts stated in thousands at december  three months or less over three through six months over six through twelve months over twelve months however  based on our historical experience  we believe that at least of these time certificates of deposit will be renewed by depositors  unless we decide to reduce the volume of such deposits by reducing the interest rates we will pay to maintain them 
deferred compensation obligations 
we maintain a nonqualified  unfunded deferred compensation plan for certain key management personnel 
under this plan  participating employees may defer compensation which will entitle them to receive certain payments upon retirement  death  or disability 
the plan provides for payments for ten years commencing upon retirement and reduced benefits upon early retirement  disability  or termination of employment 
at december   the company s aggregate payment obligations under this plan totaled million 
based on the age of the participants in the plan  it is our current expectation that this amount would be paid over a period that should range from to in order to provide funds to pay these benefits the company purchased life insurance policies on the participants in this plan  the proceeds from which are designed to cover the payments that the company will become obligated to make to plan participants 

table of contents loan commitments and standby letters of credit 
in the ordinary course of business we make commitments to extend credit and issue standby commercial letters of credit to or for our customers 
at december  and  contractual commitments to extend credit to customers totaled million and million   respectively  and obligations under standby letters of credit totaled million at the end of each of those years 
commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and the customer may be required to pay a fee and meet other conditions in order to draw on those commitments or standby letters of credit 
we expect  based on historical experience  that many of the commitments will expire without being drawn upon and  therefore  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
to varying degrees  commitments to extend credit involve elements of credit and interest rate risk for us that are in excess of the amounts recognized in our balance sheets 
our exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the customers to whom such commitments are made is equal to the amount of those commitments 
as a result  before making such a commitment to a customer  we evaluate the customer s creditworthiness using the same underwriting standards that we apply when deciding whether or not to approve loans to the customer 
in addition  we often require the customer to secure its payment obligations for amounts drawn on such commitments with collateral such as accounts receivable  inventory  property  plant and equipment  income producing commercial properties  residential properties and properties under construction 
standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the bank to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
the credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan commitments to customers 
we believe that our cash and cash equivalent resources  together with available borrowings under our line of credit and credit facilities  will be sufficient to enable us to meet any increases in demand for loans and leases or in the utilization of outstanding loan commitments or standby letters of credit and any increase in deposit withdrawals that might occur in the foreseeable future 
capital resources and dividends 
it has been and continues to be the objective of our board of directors to retain earnings that are needed to meet capital requirements under applicable government regulations and to support our growth 
at the same time  it is the policy of the board of directors to pay cash dividends if earnings exceed the amounts required to meet that objective 
pursuant to that policy  the company has paid regular quarterly cash dividends since september of and  in january of  the board of directors declared a per share cash dividend  which is the th consecutive quarterly cash dividend declared since the current dividend policy was adopted 
however  the board may change the amount or frequency of cash dividends to the extent that it deems necessary or appropriate to achieve our objective of maintaining capital in amounts sufficient to support our growth 
for example the retention of earnings in previous years enabled us to fund the opening of new banking offices and to extend the bank s market areas  all of which have contributed to our increased profitability and the maintenance of our capital adequacy ratios well above regulatory requirements 
we continue to evaluate and explore opportunities to expand our market into areas such as eastern los angeles county  western san bernardino county  north orange county and northern riverside county  all of which are contiguous to our existing markets 
the number of independent banks based in our market areas has declined significantly  due to a consolidation in the banking industry that occurred over the past several years 
we believe that this consolidation has created opportunities for us to increase our market share in those areas 
we have taken advantage of those opportunities by establishing a substantial number of new customer relationships and increasing the volume of our demand  savings and money market deposit balances 
we also believe that there are still additional expansion and growth opportunities that we will seek to take advantage of in the future 
stock repurchase program 
in january of the board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program that provided for the company to repurchase up to  of its common stock 
repurchases may be made from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions when opportunities to do so at favorable prices present themselves  in compliance with securities and exchange commission sec guidelines 
as of december   we had repurchased a total of  shares of our common stock under this program for an aggregate price of approximately 
table of contents junior subordinated debentures 
in december of we issued  of floating rate junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures the subordinated debentures in connection with the sale of floating rate trust preferred securities to an institutional investor as part of a pooled securitization transaction by that investor 
the trust preferred securities were issued and sold by foothill independent statutory trust i  a connecticut trust the trust  of which we own all of the outstanding common securities  and the net proceeds from the sale of the trust preferred securities were paid to us in exchange for the issuance of the subordinated debentures 
the subordinated debentures are subordinated to all of our borrowings and mature in years  on december   but are redeemable  at par  at our option after five years beginning december  
we are required to make quarterly interest payments on these debentures at an interest rate that is above the three month libor london inter bank offered rate  which resets quarterly 
the interest rate that we are paying on these securities for the three month period ending march is 
the interest is passed through by the trust to the holder of the trust preferred securities 
until december  we consolidated the trust into our consolidated financial statements and in accordance with a ruling issued by the federal reserve board  reported the net amount of the trust preferred securities it had issued as tier capital for regulatory purposes 
see the discussion below under the subcaption regulatory capital requirements 
in accordance with fasb interpretation fin no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
 which was adopted and became effective on december   we have ceased consolidating the trust into our consolidated financial statements 
we have been informed that the federal reserve board is evaluating whether fin no 
will have any impact on its previous ruling  however  we have been advised by the federal reserve board to continue reporting the net amount of the trust securities as part of our tier capital for regulatory purposes 
however  if the federal reserve board were to retroactively revoke its prior ruling  we will become entitled thereafter to redeem the subordinated debentures at par without having to wait until december to do so 
during the second quarter of  million of the net proceeds from the issuance of the subordinated debentures was used to purchase bank owned life insurance policies on key management employees of the bank  with the bank as the beneficiary under such policies 
the purposes of bank owned life insurance commonly known in the banking industry as boli are i to enable the bank to offer employee retirement and benefit plans designed to attract and retain key management employees  by providing the bank with a source of funds primarily from the cash surrender value of such policies that the bank can use to fund the payment of benefits under those plans  and ii to protect the bank against the costs or losses that could occur as a result of the death of any key management employee 
the remainder of the proceeds from the issuance of the subordinated debentures will be used to fund the continued growth of the bank and may also be used to repurchase our common stock under our stock repurchase plan 
regulatory capital requirements 
federal banking agencies require fdic insured banks to maintain a minimum ratio of qualifying total capital to risk adjusted assets of and a minimum ratio of tier capital essentially  the sum of a bank s capital stock and retained earnings  less any intangibles to risk adjusted assets of 
in addition to the risked based guidelines  federal banking regulators require banking organizations to maintain a minimum amount of tier capital to total average assets which is to as a bank s leverage ratio 
for these purposes  subordinated indebtedness issued in connection with a sale of trust preferred securities may comprise up to of a banking organization s tier capital and  to the extent such indebtedness exceeds that limitation  such indebtedness will constitute tier capital for regulatory capital purposes 
all of the subordinated indebtedness evidenced by the subordinated debentures that we issued in december qualifies as tier capital under federal reserve board regulations 
the federal banking agencies have adopted uniform capital requirements for the banks that they supervise and assign each of those banks to one of the following five categories based on their respective capital ratios well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized  and critically undercapitalized 
table of contents as a general rule  banks that are categorized as well capitalized are subject to less stringent supervision by their federal regulatory agencies than are banks that are classified in one of the other categories  and at each successive lower capital category  a bank is subject to greater operating restrictions and increased regulatory supervision 
set forth below are the minimum capital ratios that a bank must meet to be categorized as adequately capitalized and well capitalized  respectively  and the corresponding capital ratios of the bank at december  the bank is categorized as well capitalized for federal regulatory purposes because  as the table below indicates  the bank s capital ratios exceed the ratios required to qualify as a well capitalized bank 
to be categorized by a federal bank regulatory agency as foothill independent bank adequately capitalized well capitalized actual total capital to risk weighted assets tier capital to risk weighted assets tier capital to average assets leverage ratio risk based capital ratios are determined by weighting a bank s assets in accordance with certain risk factors  and  the higher the risk profile of the assets  the greater is the amount of capital that is required to maintain an adequate risk based capital ratio  which generally is at least factors that could affect our future financial performance statements contained in this report that are not historical facts or that discuss our expectations or beliefs regarding our future operations or future financial performance  or financial or other trends in our business  constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking statements above 
forward looking statements are based on current information and assumptions about future events over which we do not have control and that information is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause our financial condition or operating results in the future to differ significantly from those expected at the current time 
certain of those risks and uncertainties are discussed above in the section of the report entitled management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
in addition  included among the risks and uncertainties that could affect our future financial performance or financial condition are the following increased competition 
increased competition from other financial institutions  mutual funds and securities brokerage and investment banking firms that offer competitive loan and investment products could require us to reduce interest rates and loan fees in order to attract new loans or to increase interest rates that we offer on time deposits  either or both of which could  in turn  reduce our interest income or increase our interest expense  thereby reducing our net interest margin  net interest income and net earnings 
possible adverse changes in economic conditions 
a continued slowness in current economic conditions or an adverse change in future economic conditions  either national or local  could i reduce loan demand that could  in turn  reduce interest income and net interest margins  ii weaken the financial capability of borrowers to meet their loan obligations  resulting in increases in loan losses that would require us to increase reserves for possible loan losses through additional charges against income  and iii lead to reductions in real property values that  due to our reliance on real property to secure many of our loans  could make it more difficult for us to prevent losses from being incurred on non performing loans through the sale of such real properties 
possible adverse changes in federal reserve board monetary policies 
changes in national economic conditions  such as increases in inflation or declines in economic output often prompt changes in federal reserve board monetary policies that could increase the cost of funds to us or reduce yields on interest earning assets and  thereby  reduce net interest margins and net interest income and  therefore  also our net earnings 
as discussed above  in the past three years  the federal reserve board has lowered market rates of interest in an effort to stimulate the national economy 
those reductions caused our net interest margin to decline  because they led to reductions in the 
table of contents interest paid by borrowers on outstanding variable rate loans or enabled borrowers to refinance existing fixed rate loans at lower interest rates or to repay their loans 
if such conditions continue they could lead to further reductions in our net interest margin and net interest income and  therefore  in our net earnings 
in particular  the decline in prevailing interest rates and increases in real property values in in our market area resulted in an increase in loan refinancings at lower interest rates and loan prepayments by a number of our borrowers 
while those loan refinancings and prepayments increased loan fees that helped to offset a decline in yields on loans in  they may reduce our interest margins and our net interest income in  if we are not able to increase our loan volume or reduce our interest expense in amounts sufficient to offset the effects of those refinancings and prepayments on interest income in real estate mortgage loans 
approximately of the bank s loans are secured by deeds of trust or mortgages on real property 
although a significant portion of these loans were made to individuals  or entities controlled by individuals  whose businesses occupy the properties and the principal source of repayment is the cash flow from or the revenue generated by those businesses  if there was a significant decline in real property values in southern california  such a decline could result in a deterioration in some of those loans that would necessitate increases in the loan loss reserve and could result in loan write offs that would adversely affect our financial conditions and lead to reductions in earnings 
changes in regulatory policies 
changes in federal and state bank regulatory policies  such as increases in capital requirements or in loan loss reserves  or changes in required asset liability ratios  could adversely affect earnings by reducing yields on earning assets or increasing operating costs 
effects of growth 
it is our intention to take advantage of opportunities to increase our business  through acquisitions of other banks  the establishment of new banking offices or the offering of new products or services to our customers 
if we do acquire any other banks  open any additional banking offices or begin offering new products or services  we are likely to incur additional operating costs that may adversely affect our operating results  at least on an interim basis 
due to these and other possible uncertainties and risks  readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward looking statements  which speak only as of the date of this report 
the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk market risk is the risk of loss to future earnings  to fair values of assets or to future cash flows that may result from changes in the price or value of financial instruments 
the value of a financial instrument may change as a result of changes in interest rates and other market conditions 
market risk is attributed to all market risk sensitive financial instruments  including loans and investment securities  deposits and borrowings 
we do not engage in trading activities or participate in foreign currency transactions for our own account 
accordingly  our exposure to market risk is primarily a function of our asset and liability management activities and of changes in market rates of interest that can cause or require increases in the rates we pay on deposits that may take effect more rapidly or may be greater than the increases in the interest rates we are able to charge on loans and the yields that we can realize on our investments 
the extent of that market risk depends on a number of variables  including the sensitivity to changes in market interest rates and the maturities of our interest earning assets and our deposits 

table of contents the table below sets forth information concerning the interest rate sensitivity of our consolidated assets and liabilities as of december  assets and liabilities are classified by the earliest possible repricing date or maturity  whichever comes first 
three months or less over three through twelve months over one year through five years over five years non interest bearing total dollars in thousands assets interest bearing deposits in banks investment securities federal funds sold net loans noninterest earning assets total assets liabilities and stockholders equity noninterest bearing deposits interest bearing deposits short term borrowings long term borrowings other liabilities stockholders equity total liabilities and stockholders equity interest rate sensitivity gap cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap generally  where rate sensitive assets principally loans  investment securities and other interest earning assets exceed rate sensitive liabilities principally interest bearing deposits  the net interest margin will be positively impacted during periods of increasing interest rates and negatively impacted during periods of decreasing interest rates 
when rate sensitive liabilities exceed rate sensitive assets  the net interest margin generally will be negatively affected during periods of increasing interest rates and positively affected during periods of decreasing interest rates 
at december   our rate sensitive balance sheet was shown to be in a negative three month gap position because our rate sensitive liabilities exceeded our rate sensitive assets for that period 
this implies that our net interest margin would decrease in the short term if interest rates were to rise and would increase in the short term if interest rates were to fall 
however  the extent to which our net interest margin will be impacted by changes in prevailing interests rates will depend on a number of factors  including how quickly rate sensitive assets and liabilities react to changes in interest rates  which will depend on a number of factors  including the mix of interest earning assets between loans  on the one hand  and other earning assets  on the other hand  and the mix of core and time certificates of deposit 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation results of operation rate sensitivity  net interest margins and market risk we use a dynamic simulation model to forecast the anticipated impact of changes in market interest rates on our net interest income 
that model is used to assist management in evaluating  and in determining and adjusting strategies designed to reduce  our exposure to these market risks  which may include  for example  changing the mix of earning assets or interest bearing deposits
