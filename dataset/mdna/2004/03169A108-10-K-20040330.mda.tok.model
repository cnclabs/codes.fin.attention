item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview our history our company was founded in as an externally managed real estate investment trust reit 
until  substantially all of our operations consisted of the acquisition of mortgage loans for investment purposes 
in mid  our board of directors and management determined that it was in the best interest of the stockholders to pursue a different strategy 
later that year  we formed amnet  a wholly owned subsidiary  to engage in mortgage banking activities 
amnet originates mortgage loans primarily to prime credit quality borrowers secured by first trust deeds through a network of independent mortgage brokers 
it sells the loans that it originates to institutional purchasers 
in december  in connection with our new focus on developing a mortgage banking business  our management team negotiated the termination of its management contract with home asset management company  inc hamco 
prior to termination of the contract  we paid hamco management fees based on our reit portfolio and were reimbursed hamco for substantially all of our employee compensation and occupancy expenses 
since termination of the contract  we no longer pay management fees and are responsible for all compensation and occupancy expenses related to our business 
effective january   we began reporting our financial results in two segments  the mortgage banking business and the mortgage asset portfolio business 
our mortgage banking operations grew significantly in and at the same time  the mortgage asset portfolio business has significantly declined as the mortgage loans in our portfolio have been prepaid over time and have not been replenished 
as a result  over the last half of  our mortgage banking revenue significantly exceeded our mortgage asset portfolio revenue 
for the year ended december   our mortgage banking segment produced approximately million in revenue while the mortgage asset portfolio business produced approximately million which does not include non operational income from a litigation settlement of million 
for the year ended december   our mortgage banking segment produced approximately million in revenue while the mortgage asset portfolio business produced approximately million 
accordingly  our financial results presentation has been changed with expanded explanations and order of presentation to better reflect our current principal operations  the mortgage banking business 
how we generate revenue we generate revenue in our mortgage banking business segment three principal ways interest income 
from the time we originate a loan until the time we sell the loan  we earn interest on the loan  which is paid by the borrower 
the interest that we earn is partially offset by the interest we pay under our warehouse credit facilities used to finance our mortgage originations 
gain on loan sales 
we currently sell the loans that we originate to institutional purchasers  on a servicing released basis for cash 
we record the difference between the sale price of loans that we have sold and our cost to originate the sold loans as gain on loan sales revenue 
we recognize revenue at the time that we complete the loan sale  which is generally when we receive loan sale proceeds from the purchaser 
gain on loan sales also includes fees we charge for loan origination such as underwriting fees  loan document preparation fees and wiring fees hedging 
hedging instruments are used to help mitigate exposure to interest rate fluctuation 
the gains or losses from this activity will correspond to revenue derived from loan sales 
typically  higher than expected gains from the sale of loans will be offset by hedging losses  while lower than expected gains from the sale of loans will be offset by hedging gains 
therefore hedging gains or losses are included in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss as derivative financial instruments and market adjustments 
we continue to generate revenue from our mortgage asset portfolio business  although we expect that revenues from this segment of our business will continue to decline 
we generate revenue on the interest we receive on the mortgage loans we hold for investment 
our primary expense is the interest we pay on borrowings used to fund our mortgage loan portfolio 
our highlights executive overview our operating results for were dominated by the following our mortgage banking segment funded approximately billion in july of funding in december of was approximately million which represented a drop in loan originations 
this dramatic decline was a result of a rise in interest rates which impacted the entire mortgage industry and overall market demand for refinancings 
we had significant increases in revenue and expenses as the result of opening regional offices for mortgage loan production in the mortgage banking segment 
while profitable for all of at million  the last four months of the year yielded a loss of million due to the large drop in loan origination volume without adequately adjusting overhead costs 
see graph of monthly loan originations for and below 
graph graph cash and cash equivalents increased significantly during the year from million at december  to million at december   primarily due to profits and cash flow generated by amnet 
we continued to channel our resources toward the expansion of the mortgage banking business while the mortgage asset portfolio business bond collateral assets continued to decline as a result of prepayments and scheduled repayments 
we realized significant tax benefits as a result of our profitability  including a million tax benefit 
critical accounting policies the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors and circumstances 
we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable in the circumstances  however  actual results may differ significantly from these estimates and assumptions which could have a material impact on the carrying value of assets and liabilities at the balance sheet dates and our results of operations for the reporting periods 
our significant accounting policies and practices are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we believe that estimates and assumptions are the most critically important factors in the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations  in that they require management s most subjective judgments 
these critical accounting policies include the following derivative and hedging activities determination of fair values our mortgage banking business  which began in the fourth quarter of  is subject to the risk of rising as well as falling mortgage interest rates between the time the company commits to extend credit at a set interest rate rate lock and the time it sells the mortgage loans 
to mitigate this risk  we purchase optional coverage in the form of puts and  less frequently  calls on financial instruments mortgage backed securities of varying terms and enter into forward commitments to sell mortgage loans 
the nature and quantity of these hedging transactions are determined based on various factors  including changes in interest rates that may impact the volume of loans actually closed versus the volume of loans anticipated to close 
our derivative financial activities do not meet the hedging criteria under sfas and  accordingly  are accounted for in the accompanying consolidated financial statements at market value with no offsetting adjustment to the hedged items 
to the extent that our estimates regarding various factors  including the expected volume of mortgage loan originations  differ from actual results  the company s financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
in our mortgage banking business we must make a determination of fair value for our hedging instruments derivatives  loan pipeline and loans held for sale at lower of cost or market 
these are determined based on consistently applied methods which are accepted within the regulatory climate in which our company operates 
hedging instruments are marked to market according to similar or identical financial instruments available in the market place at the time of the mark 
the loan pipeline mark is determined by contacting our group of investors whom we normally sell loans to and deriving a value for those loans less a factor for loans which will not close loan fallout based on our history of pipeline fallout 
the percentage assigned to loan fallout is a critical estimate which can dramatically affect hedging cost and costs associated with loan sales 
by accounting rules  we are not allowed to recognize any revenue from loan sales until a true sale has taken place 
however  if the cost basis of the loan is more than could be obtained by sale in the marketplace  a market adjustment is recorded referred to as the lower of cost or market locom 
we adhere to this method of valuation 
it has been determined  that for book purposes at december  there is no value for our retained interest in a securitization 
income taxes and benefits 
during  we elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust reit under the internal revenue code of  as amended 
as a result of this election  we generally were not taxed at the corporate level on the income distributed to our shareholders through on july   our shareholders approved two proposals that allowed our conversion of the company from a reit to a fully taxable entity  effective january  on february   we filed a notice with the internal revenue service of its decision to de reit  effective beginning january  as a result of our profitability and conversion to a taxable entity  in we experienced three significant changes that affect the taxes reported in our operating results as of december   our amnet division had a net deferred tax asset of million comprised primarily of net operating losses nols and allowance for loan losses which was fully offset by a valuation allowance as management believed that it was more likely than not that this deferred tax asset would not be realized 
however  as a result of amnet s current profitability  management believes that a significant portion of this deferred tax asset will be realized 
accordingly  the valuation allowance has been reduced and tax benefits have been recorded for all quarters of the income tax expense of the company s amnet division has been partially reduced by these tax benefits 
moreover  as management projects future taxable income  any remaining valuation allowance if any  was reduced accordingly  with a corresponding reduction in our income tax expense 
management expects by year end that there will be no remaining valuation allowance for our mortgage asset portfolio business segment 
we rely on both external as well as internal expertise to determine the valuation allowance 
as of january   our reit division recorded a net deferred tax asset of million comprised primarily of nols and tax assets related to the company s securitizations as a result of our conversion to a taxable status 
this deferred tax asset was fully offset by a valuation allowance as management believed it was more likely than not that this deferred tax asset would not be realized 
however  as a result of amnet s current profitability management believes that this deferred tax asset will be realized 
accordingly  we have reduced our valuation allowance and recorded a tax benefit 
as this benefit is primarily the result of the utilization of net operating losses incurred in the mortgage asset portfolio segment the benefit is recorded in this segment 
as management projects future taxable income  any remaining valuation allowance will be reduced accordingly  with a corresponding increase to the tax benefit 
management expects by year end that there will be no valuation allowance for our mortgage asset portfolio business 
as a result of the termination of our reit status  we record an income tax expense on our pretax income in both segments 
the income tax rates we use to calculate our income tax expense  and the amount recorded for the related tax benefits described above  are both determined based on management s projected future taxable income 
because a significant portion of our income is earned from our mortgage banking operations  which are relatively new and have been expanding rapidly  management s estimates of future taxable income may not be accurate 
accordingly our actual income tax expense incurred could be different 
we have calculated our income tax expense for the year ended december  using an effective tax rate of approximately 
as a result  we recorded an income tax expense for the combined segments for the year ended december  of million 
we also utilized a tax benefit of million for this period 
we do not expect to record benefits from the reduction in amnet s valuation allowance in accordingly  we expect to calculate our income tax expense for using an effective tax rate of approximately 
in addition  we expect to record only a slight tax benefit described in the second bullet point above in these factors will result in a significant negative impact on after tax earnings in comparison to allowance for loan losses bond collateral mortgage loans we maintain an allowance for loan losses at an amount which we believe is sufficient to provide adequate protection against losses in the bond collateral mortgage loans portfolio 
we periodically evaluate the adequacy of the allowance based on such factors as our past loan loss experience  known and inherent risks in the portfolio  adverse situations that have occurred that may affect the borrower s ability to repay  the estimated value of underlying collateral  and economic conditions 
we utilize information currently available to evaluate the allowance for loan losses  but the allowance for loan losses is subjective and may be adjusted in the future depending on changes in economic conditions or other factors 
during the time we hold bond collateral mortgage loans  we are subject to credit risks  including risks of borrower defaults  bankruptcies and special hazard losses that are not covered by standard hazard insurance such as those occurring from earthquakes or floods 
nearly all of our bond collateral mortgage loans were made to borrowers who do not necessarily qualify for loans from conventional mortgage lenders  which may lead to higher delinquency rates and or credit losses for and thus require higher loan loss allowances 
although we have established an allowance for loan losses that we have reviewed with our audit committee and that we consider adequate  there can be no assurance that the established allowance for loan losses will be sufficient to offset losses on bond collateral mortgage loans in the future 
amortization of premiums on bond collateral mortgage loans the portfolio of bond collateral mortgage loans was acquired on a servicing retained and servicing released basis  meaning in some instances we acquired both the mortgage loans and the rights to service them 
this strategy required us to pay a higher purchase price or premium for the mortgages 
premiums are amortized written off to income using the interest method  generally over their weighted average estimated lives considering anticipated prepayments 
if these mortgage loans prepay faster than originally projected  gaap requires us to write down the remaining capitalized premium amounts at a faster speed than was originally projected  which would decrease our current net interest income 
mortgage prepayments generally increase on our adjustable rate mortgages when fixed mortgage interest rates fall below the then current interest rates on outstanding adjustable rate mortgage loans 
prepayments on bond collateral mortgage loans are also affected by the terms and credit grades of the loans  conditions in the housing and financial markets and general economic conditions 
we have sought to minimize the effects on operations caused by faster than anticipated prepayment rates by lowering premiums paid to acquire mortgage loans and by purchasing mortgage loans with prepayment penalties 
those penalties typically expire two to five years from origination 
as of december   approximately of bond collateral mortgage loans had active prepayment penalty features 
most of the intermediate adjustable rate mortgages in the cmo fasit   a and segments of the portfolio have reached their first contractual interest rate adjustment increase and many prepayment penalties on these loans have expired  resulting in a higher probability of refinancing and principal prepayments 
we anticipate that prepayment rates on the segment of loans will increase over time as the sub prime market focuses on refinancing borrowers left at historically higher interest rates 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve or maintain lower prepayment rates or that prepayment rates will not increase 
our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if prepayment levels increase significantly 
we currently employ a prepayment model to project loan prepayment activity based upon loan age  loan type and remaining prepayment penalty coverage at a loan level detail 
reasonableness tests are performed against past history  mortgage asset pool specific events  current economic outlook and loan age to verify the overall prepayment projection 
recent accounting developments in march  the sec released staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 application of accounting principles to loan commitments 
the company accounts for its commitments to extend credit as derivatives and records changes in the fair value of the commitments in the statement of operations 
the company is currently analyzing the impact that sab no 
will have on its financial statements 
in may of  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
this pronouncement would specifically apply to our company relating to the creation of a minority interest when consolidating american residential holdings  inc we have determined the impact to not be material on our consolidated financial statements 
in april  the fasb issued statement no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts collectively referred to as derivatives and for hedging activities under sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the adoption of this statement had no effect on our consolidated financial statements 
management s financial analysis we earn interest income and incur interest expense in both segments of our operations 
in the mortgage banking business  amnet earns interest on a loan from the date the loan is funded until final disposition of the loan sale 
accordingly  interest income is a function of the volume of loans funded  the interest rate on the loans and the length of time the loans are held 
to the extent amnet funds loans with borrowings under its warehouse facilities  it records interest expense based on the same factors 
similarly  in the mortgage asset portfolio business  we generate revenue from the interest we receive on the mortgage loans we hold for investment and we incur interest expense on the borrowings used to fund our loan portfolio 
because the interest income and interest expense in each segment of our business are closely related and dependant on many of the same factors  in particular the volume of loans we originate or hold for investment  management believes that it is helpful in understanding our operations to analyze the impact of interest income and expense together within each segment of our operations 
for this reason  the discussion below provides information regarding the net interest income interest income less interest expense generated by each segment 
management believes that this is consistent with how financial analysts typically consider interest in analyzing mortgage banking operations 
this reasoning also applies in our discussion of the mortgage banking business expenses 
the explanation of expenses includes a discussion of our operating expenses  which excludes interest expense 
because certain other expenses we incur in the mortgage banking business  such as commissions and contract labor  also vary with the volume of amnet s loan originations  management also believes that it is important in understanding this business to consider the variable and the fixed expenses separately 
accordingly  we have included an estimated breakdown between variable and fixed amounts for each category of our operating expenses 
management believes that this will enable a better understanding of our results and the likely impact in the future of changes in our origination volumes 
results of operations compared to mortgage banking business our mortgage banking business had record earnings in with a pretax profit at million as compared to a pretax loss of million in these results were due in large part to i the significant increase in loan funding volume reflecting amnet s continued growth and expansion since we began our mortgage banking business in late  and ii improved interest rate risk management 
through july of  interest rates remained at historic low levels and fueled a refinance mortgage business that greatly assisted our growth and profitability 
however  in august of  interest rates increased rapidly and the business for refinance loan originations slowed 
as a result  by december of  loan originations had dropped 
loan originations in july of were billion and december of loan originations were million 
we did not reduce overhead expenses fast enough to avoid losses for the last three months of totaling million 
we expect to incur a pretax loss in the first quarter of due to continued lower low production in the early part of gain on the sales of loans increased primarily due to our increase in volume of loan sales in for all of loan sales were billion  while loan sales were billion 
amnet s gain on the sale of loans was made up of a combination of various account categories which are summarized in the chart below  and quantified in basis points to loan sales volume 
amounts in s increase decrease amount income expense basis points amount income expense basis points amount basis points loans sold  net    premiums    borrower fees    mortgage broker fees    premium recapture and loan loss provisions   deferred origination costs   gain on sales of loans    premiums represent the price at which amnet sells the loans to investors in excess of the principal balance of loans sold 
borrower fees represent various charges to brokers for services rendered which are deferred and recognized as part of the gain on the sales of the loans 
premiums and borrower fees are offset by capitalized deferred loan origination costs 
the largest deferred cost associated with loan production is broker fees  or yield spread premiums 
other offsets to gain on sale include i deferred origination costs  which are recognized at the time of loan sale and ii loan premiums repaid to investors premium recapture and loan loss provisions 
premium recapture expenses represent repayment of a portion of certain loan sale premiums to investors on previously sold loans which subsequently payoff within six months of loan sale 
net gains on the sale of loans of million for the year ended december  represent approximately basis points on loan sales of billion 
comparison between and shows an increase in loan sales volume of billion 
this was the principal difference between and  however the difference in basis points for each category reveals some differences further explained here 
mortgage broker fees increased by basis points reflecting increased cost of doing business in the highest national loan origination market in history 
premiums decreased by basis points because of changes in mortgage interest rates in generally  when mortgage interest rates rise  the value of loans that we have in our pipeline declines  and when interest rates decrease the value of the loans in our pipeline increases 
we utilize hedge instruments to help protect the value of the loans in our pipeline 
consequently  basis point loan premiums  and gain on sales of loans  are best analyzed in conjunction with the basis point revenue or loss from our derivative financial instruments and market adjustment on interest rate lock commitments 
premium recapture and loss provisions increased in as declining interest rates spurred refinancing volumes  which in turn increased premium recapture expenses 
our ability to estimate potential losses is based on a greater level of experience 
during the year ended december   amnet realized net hedging gains on its derivative financial instruments and market adjustments on derivative financial instruments totaling approximately thousand 
for the same period ending december   net losses on derivative financial instruments and market adjustments totaled million 
use of derivative financial instruments is a key to protecting our profit margins between the time a loan is locked and when the loan is sold to an investor 
until august  amnet used primarily treasury futures and options to hedge its loan pipeline against declines in value caused by increases in market interest rates 
this strategy was not successful and was changed to better match hedging activity to interest rate risk 
at that time  amnet sold or closed its position in substantially all of its remaining options on treasury futures 
during the first nine months of  amnet incurred net losses on its derivative financial instruments totaling million 
a portion of these losses was offset by higher than expected gains on the sales of loans 
however  due to a variety of reasons  we estimate that approximately million of losses on treasury hedges during the second and third quarters were not offset by correspondingly larger than expected gains on loans sold 
in august of  amnet began using forward sales of mortgage backed securities tba as its primary hedging vehicle 
due to continual declines in mortgage interest rates during october through december  amnet recorded net losses on derivative financial instruments of million during the last three months of  but had offsetting higher than expected gains on sales of loans 
during all of  we continued with the same strategy of using forward sales of mortgage backed securities and were successful in protecting profit margins on loan originations 
amnet recorded interest income of million for the year ended december  amnet earns interest on a loan from the date the loan is funded until final disposition 
accordingly  interest income is a function of the volume of loans funded  the interest rate on the loans and the length of time the loans are held prior to sale 
to the extent amnet funds loans with borrowings under its warehouse facilities  it records interest expense based on the same factors 
interest expense for the period was million 
the resulting net interest income earned on loan inventories was million  representing basis points on loan production of billion 
for the comparable period ended december  interest income was million and interest expense was million 
this resulted in net interest earned of million  representing basis points on loan production of billion 
total expenses incurred in the mortgage banking business for the year ended december  were approximately million 
operating expense  which included all expenses except interest expense  employee compensation and benefits  office and occupancy expense and other operating expenses was approximately million for the year ended december  for the comparable period ended december   there were approximately million of total expenses of which approximately million were operating expenses 
for the year ended december   operating expenses totaled million as compared to million for the increase in operating expense was due to the establishment and ongoing overhead of amnet s mortgage banking operations  which are comprised of regional loan production offices and headquarters operations 
for the year ended december   expenses included approximately million in sales commissions  which represent expenses that vary in direct proportion with the volume of funded loans  or approximately basis points 
on billion in funded loans 
operating expenses that were not directly variable totaled million or approximately basis points 
on billion in funded loans for overall basis point expenses which is a measurement of the cost per loan declined for the year from basis points in to basis points in 
however  the cost per loan increased from  in to  per loan in breaking down the cost per loan in to the first nine months and comparing the cost to the last three months shows that the increase in interest rates after september cut loan production in a dramatic manner  and overhead was not aligned in time to profitably compensate for reduced loan volume 
the cost per loan in the first nine months of was  while the cost per loan in the last three months of was  overall basis point expenses which is a measurement of the cost per loan declined throughout the decline in the overall expense per loan is due to scale efficiencies and the fact that operating expenses for the twelve month period included one time start up costs 
the table below provides the relationship between estimated fixed  variable and total expenses for the years ended december  and dollars in s mortgage banking expenses estimated variable expenses estimated fixed expenses total expenses employee compensation and benefits    office and occupancy expense   professional fees    other operating expense    total operating expenses    interest expense   total expenses    mortgage banking expenses estimated variable expenses estimated fixed expenses total expenses employee compensation and benefits    office and occupancy expense   professional fees   other operating expense    total operating expenses    interest expense   total expenses    interest rate movements are difficult to predict  but it is recognized that interest rates on residential mortgages were historically low in the second half of in  while rates continued to remain at historical lows  the total number of home purchase and refinancing transactions declined  causing a significant overall contraction of the loan origination market 
our financial projections for assume a significant contraction in the size of the market by the end of the mortgage bankers association indicate in their january  forecast that mortgage financing activity will shrink to trillion from trillion in overhead has been adjusted to meet the reduced demand to achieve profitability in we are continuing our strategy of regional office expansion and increased account executives to capture market share in metropolitan service areas we do not already serve 
income tax expense recorded for the year ended december  was approximately million and the effective federal and state tax rate for this segment was estimated to be which reflected the application of a million benefit as a result of net operating losses 
the remaining income tax benefit will be significantly reduced in and therefore the effective tax rate will increase to approximately 
mortgage asset portfolio business for the years ended december  and  we generated net income of approximately million and million  respectively 
the net income in was mainly due to an income tax benefit of million as result of reasonably expecting our mortgage banking business profitability to absorb the net operating loss carry forwards of our mortgage asset portfolio business since the two entities are consolidated for income tax return purposes 
our decision to avoid portfolio acquisitions throughout  and resulted in a continued decline in the size of bond collateral mortgage loan portfolio 
this decline resulted in a decrease in net interest income from the mortgage asset portfolio 
interest rates are one of the keys to having net income in this segment of our business 
the weighted average interest rate from our bond collateral is at december  while the weighted average interest rate we pay is for the same period 
the difference represents income to us 
as our portfolio balances continue to decline  we find that key expense items continue to be premium amortization and credit losses 
our portfolio has been declining in size rapidly as a result of borrowers refinancing their mortgages which necessitates writing off our premium at accelerated rates 
credit losses on collateral are not decreasing in proportion to the decline in our portfolio balances 
less credit worthy borrowers have difficulty procuring refinancing terms while those more credit worthy are able to find lower interest rates available and opt to payoff their loans before they are due prepayment 
therefore with less credit worthy borrowers remaining in our portfolio assets  events of default occur more frequently and necessitate a higher proportion of credit reserves 
most of the intermediate adjustable rate mortgages in the cmo fasit   a  and segments of the bond collateral mortgage loans portfolio have reached their first contractual interest rate adjustment and prepayment penalties clauses on the underlying pool of loans have expired or declined  resulting in a higher probability of refinancing principal prepayments 
there can be no assurance that prepayment rates will not increase 
our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected if prepayment levels increase significantly 
for the year ended december   total expenses decreased approximately million from million to million over the year ended december  during  our company incurred decreases in all of the major expense categories 
the primary decrease included the following interest expense decreased approximately million as a result of the approximate decrease of million in bond collateral  premium amortization decreased by approximately million  provision for loan losses decreased by approximately million  other operating expenses decreased approximately thousand 
operating expenses remained relatively constant despite a shift in portfolio size 
premium amortization expense represents the amortization of purchase premiums paid for bond collateral mortgage loans acquired in excess of the par value of the loans

results of operations compared to mortgage banking business our mortgage banking business began in the third quarter of comparisons between and have large differences as a result of limited operating activity in as compared to significant growth throughout specifically  we incurred approximately million of start up operating expenses in as compared to million in operating expenses in we had virtually no revenues in this segment in as compared to million in  amnet recorded gain on sales of loans revenue totaling million on loan dispositions totaling billion 
this represents new activity for the company  for the comparable period ended december   there was a thousand loss on the sale of loans 
amnet s increase in net gains on the sales of loans is the result of the increase in its loan production volume 
this revenue was offset by a loss on the company s derivative financial instruments totaling million in  and thousand in amnet recorded interest income of million for the year ended december  interest expense for the period was million 
the resulting net interest income earned on loan inventories was million  representing basis points on loan production of billion 
we had insignificant interest income in mortgage asset portfolio business for the years ended december  and  we generated net income of approximately million and a net loss of million  respectively 
the net income in was mainly due to non operational income from the settlement of litigation for million 
the net loss in was due to several events  each of which had a significant impact 
these events include purchase of the management contract for million  adoption of sfas which resulted in a write down of cap agreements for approximately million  and transaction fees related to the management contract buyout of approximately million

liquidity and capital resources general our current sources of liquidity primarily consist of the following borrowings under our warehouse and other credit facilities  revenues generated by our mortgage banking operating activities including interest  branch fees  loan sale proceeds and hedge proceeds 
excess interest spread and over collateralization step down payments related to the mortgage asset portfolio business  net of repayments to servicers for past principal and interest advances on completed real estate owned dispositions 
our primary cash requirements include funding our mortgage loan originations  interest expense under our warehouse facilities  operating expenses  including commissions  repayment of our borrowings  and maintaining a restricted cash account  which includes amounts required to be held by certain of our correspondent investors that may not be used in our operations or as equity for other warehouse lines of credit  as well as amounts held in escrow for third parties 
as our mortgage banking operations have grown and our mortgage asset portfolio has declined  our cash flow from investment activities has continued to decline in amounts and materiality 
cash generated by and used in our operations during the year ended december   on a consolidated basis we generated a net positive cash flow of million 
this net positive number can be better understood by explaining the major components mortgage banking business cash reserves were increased by million as a result of significant gains in loan production in we originated billion in and billion in our warehouse line lending agreements allow us to borrow from to of par for each mortgage loan

lastly  a small portion of our loan inventory is funded with equity capital 
we typically have cash invested totaling between to of the principal amount of loans held for sale  which is recouped when the loans are purchased by investors 
should we increase the amount of loan inventory  either by holding loans for longer periods  or due to increased loan funding volume  the cash reserves necessary to carry loan inventories will increase in direct proportion to the inventory held 
our financial condition can be affected by fluctuations in world markets  which could directly impact domestic liquidity 
as stated earlier  we intend to renew existing financing facilities  and seek new financing sources as the need arises 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to secure new short or long term financing or that financing will be available on favorable terms 
on a go forward basis  we anticipate our liquidity will be predominantly impacted by the mortgage banking activity 
in we will continue to expand our regional office presence in various metropolitan service areas 
typically new offices have a cash negative period of three to six months and our planned expansion will slow cash accumulation 
we expect to originate million to billion per month of new mortgage loans and fund these originations with equity capital and warehouse facility borrowings 
we also expect to continue to engage in hedging transactions that may require cash investment to maintain or adjust hedged positions 
furthermore  we anticipate greater general and administrative costs associated with the operations of our mortgage banking business 
we intend to use cash reserves  borrowings under the warehouse facilities and the subordinated debt facility and cash flow generated by the mortgage asset portfolio  as well as cash flow generated from the origination and sale of mortgage loans  to fund our operations 
we are therefore dependent on significant levels of warehouse financing to help execute our mortgage banking strategy 
furthermore  we must originate minimum levels of loans to remain profitable

short term debt as of december   short term debt consists of revolving credit lines warehouse facilities used to fund our lending activities 
as of december   mortgage loans held for sale totaling million were pledged as collateral for the warehouse facilities 
the warehouse facilities consists of borrowings of million with four financial institutions 
at december   our maximum available borrowings combined  from these four financial institutions is billion 
these facilities typically advance to of the par balances of the loans pledged as collateral 
such financing is currently provided primarily under i a day secured mortgage warehousing revolving credit agreement  dated as of november   the bank credit agreement and entered into by amnet  american residential investment trust and jpmorgan chase  ii a day secured mortgage warehousing revolving credit agreement  dated as of march   the ubs warburg agreement and entered into by amnet and ubs warburg real estate securities inc  iii a day secured mortgage warehousing revolving credit agreement  dated as of october   the countrywide agreement and entered into by amnet  american residential investment trust and countrywide  and iv a day secured mortgage warehousing revolving credit agreement  dated as of september   the gmac agreement and entered into by us  amnet and gmac 
these warehouse facilities are repaid as principal payments on mortgage loans are received  or as the mortgage loans are sold 
the agreements governing these facilities contain a number of covenants  including covenants based on tangible net worth  cash flows  net income  and liquidity of our company 
as of december  we are in compliance with these covenants 
our short term sources of liquidity also include a million renewable day senior subordinated secured revolving loan agreement between american residential investment trust and tcw crescent mezzanine llp on december  the subordinated debt facility 
the subordinated debt facility is secured by residual interest spread investment certificates on the segment of the bond mortgage loan portfolio 
there were million of borrowings outstanding under this agreement at december   which matures on april  of long term debt non recourse mortgage backed notes our long term debt consists of non recourse mortgage backed notes  which are principally secured by bond collateral mortgage loans and bond collateral real estate owned 
obligations under the mortgage backed notes are payable solely from the proceeds from the bond collateral and are otherwise non recourse to our company 
the maturities of the mortgage backed notes are directly affected by the rate of principal repayments on the related bond collateral 
the notes are also subject to redemption according to the specific terms of the indentures pursuant to which they were issued 
as a result  the actual maturities are likely to occur earlier than the stated maturities 
in the event that a master servicer  servicer or trustee elects to redeem the debt of any of our long term debt issuances  we would receive cash from the clean up call at an earlier date than would be expected if the debt issuance was allowed to reach its stated maturity 
the components of the long term debt at december   are summarized below dollars in thousands securitization a securitization securitization securitization securitization total long term debt long term debt      capitalized costs on long term debt total long term debt      weighted average financing rates rate lock commitments to borrowers and commitments to sell loans in the ordinary course of business  we have commitments to fund mortgages 
we enter into financial commitments with interest rate risks through the origination and sale of mortgage loans 
we must manage the potential loss exposure caused by fluctuations in interest rates 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit mortgage loan pipeline and mandatory forward commitments to sell loans 
the following is a summary of our pipeline of loans in process and mandatory forward commitments to sell loans at december  and dollars in thousands unaudited commitments to originate loans at set interest rate   commitments expected to close   forward sales of mortgage backed securities tba   mandatory commitments to sell mortgage loans held for sale  for the purposes of hedging our interest rate exposure on commitment to originate loans  we make various assumptions to estimate those mortgage loans which will not close fallout 
the rate of fallout is applied to the total pipeline of mortgage loans to arrive at the net exposure to interest rate changes in the market 
the loans expected to close are hedged utilizing forward sales of mortgage backed securities and options 
some of these commitments will ultimately be denied by our company or declined by the borrower  and therefore  the commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
lease and long term debt commitments in order to better understand our future obligations under our leases and long term debt agreements  the table below shows our expected future payments for these debt instruments 
payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years dollars in thousands long term debt      operating leases    total      long term debt is in the form of bonds which are directly tied to bond collateral assets and are in the form of mortgage loans 
these assets have payment schedules associated with each loan but can be paid off by the borrower at any time 
our history of bond collateral reduction indicates that we can reasonably project that bond collateral will continue on a path of accelerated reduction 
by the terms of the long term debt agreements  a reduction in the bond collateral will also result in a reduction of long term debt 
therefore the above reductions in long term debt are based on our projections for reduction in bond collateral 
operating leases are for regional office locations around the continental united states of america 
based on these lease agreements  the amounts shown represent payments due within the time periods shown 
mortgage asset portfolio business cash flow from our mortgage asset portfolio was positive at approximately million 
the mortgage asset portfolio business generates cash from interest and principal received from bond collateral and proceeds from the sale of real estate owned bond collateral 
the bond trustees master servicer offset this cash by paying interest and principal to bondholders  paying servicer and trustee fees  bond insurance premiums and reimbursing servicers for any advances made on real estate owned dispositions 
any excess cash flow is remitted to us from the bond trustees on a monthly basis 
there are various factors that affect this flow  such as market interest rate changes 
additionally  our bond agreement provisions  specify the requirements for over collateralization accounts 
if overcollateralization accounts are deficient  this can restrict our receipt of excess cash flow and be used instead by the bond trustee to pay down long term debt 
cash flow from the mortgage asset portfolio is expected to decline in due to a decline in the size of the portfolio  and potential increases in overcollateralization accounts 
administrative expenditures for our mortgage asset portfolio business aggregated approximately million 
administrative expenses allocated to our mortgage asset portfolio business included portfolio management payroll allocations of approximately thousand  general legal expenses of approximately thousand  professional and consulting fees of approximately thousand  director fees of thousand  and liability insurance of approximately thousand 
however  we do expect director fees and general legal and professional expenses to increase due to the implementation of various new corporate governance measures required by the sarbanes oxley act of item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk a primary market risk facing our company is interest rate risk  which is highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental monetary and tax policies  domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors beyond our control 
we attempt to manage this risk in our mortgage banking and mortgage asset portfolio businesses 
mortgage banking business interest rate risk rate lock commitments and mortgage loans held for sale loan pipeline are subject to market price fluctuation until committed for sale 
these fluctuations are primarily tied to changes in market interest rates and the relationship of short term rates to long term rates yield curve 
in order to mitigate this risk  a variety of financial derivative instruments including forward mandatory mortgage security sale tba and options on mortgage backed securities are utilized to hedge or mitigate market price fluctuations 
these hedge positions are continually adjusted based on routine and ongoing quantification of our risk  but hedges may or may not be fully successful in complete risk mitigation 
in particular  our capital markets personnel must make estimates of the percentage of rate lock commitments expected to close under different interest rate changes 
losses on the sale of mortgage loans or hedging activity could adversely impact results of operations and our financial position 
other risks our ability to generate gains on the sales of mortgages is largely dependent upon the continuation of correspondent investor programs offered by large institutions 
typically these institutions have mortgage banking operations with which we compete 
at any point in time an investor could discontinue our business relationship and therefore narrow the scope of our investor loan sale programs 
we attempt to mitigate this risk by selling our loans to several investors and are constantly trying to develop new business relationships 
the mortgage banking business has many companies competing for mortgage loan originations who are much larger and more experienced in the business 
during the first half of we were in a business environment of unprecedented low interest rates and we were fortunate to capture market share during a period of historic high levels of mortgage loan activity 
as interest rates rose in the second half of  and we expect  will continue to rise in  we need to be highly competitive against larger more experienced companies 
we will mitigate this risk by being a niche market participant dealing exclusively with loan brokers and providing a higher level of personal service than our competitors 
mortgage asset portfolio business interest rate risk our operating results for this business segment will depend in large part on differences between the income from our assets net of credit losses and our borrowing costs 
all of this business segment s mortgage assets are pledged as collateral for long term debt securitizations 
in most cases  the income from assets will respond more slowly to interest rate fluctuations than the cost of borrowings  which creates a mismatch between asset yields and borrowing rates 
consequently  changes in interest rates  particularly short term interest rates  may influence the mortgage asset portfolio business net income 
long term debt interest rates are tied to libor 
increases in these rates will tend to decrease net income 
a significant increase in short term interest rates  where the one month libor exceeded  could result in interest expense exceeding interest income and would result in operating losses 
in the past  we have attempted to mitigate interest rate gap risk through hedging instruments called interest rate caps 
the majority of mortgages held in the portfolio are adjustable rate mortgages arm s which adjust every six months 
consequently our gap risk is limited and at the present time we do not believe that the cost of hedging our gap risk is justified 
currently we do not have any interest rate caps in place 
other risks the value of mortgage portfolio assets may be affected by prepayment rates on bond collateral mortgage loans 
prepayment rates are influenced by changes in current interest rates and a variety of economic  geographic and other factors beyond our control 
partial protection comes in the form of prepayment penalties but since our portfolio is becoming more mature  most of the prepayment penalty clauses have expired 
increases in delinquency rates and defaults by borrower on their mortgages can also negatively impact the financial results of the mortgage asset portfolio business 
we monitor delinquencies and defaults and adjust the loan loss provision and interest reserves accordingly 
all of our issuances of long term debt have provisions permitting us to redeem the debt when the remaining collateral has been paid down to or less of its initial amount 
in certain of these issuances  the master servicer  servicer or trustee may elect to redeem the debt if we do not 
such clean up calls are typical in mortgage securitizations to avoid the inefficiencies associated with servicing and administering small pools of assets 
in the event of a clean up call being exercised  the remaining collateral may be sold at a price below its remaining book value at the time  resulting in a loss 
alternatively  the remaining collateral may be retained by us  but subject to financing and servicing arrangements that are less attractive than under the long term debt arrangements 
in such event  our costs of carrying the assets could increase 
sensitivity analyses we have performed various sensitivity analyses that quantify the net financial impact of changes in interest rates on our interest rate sensitive assets  liabilities and commitments 
these analyses presume an instantaneous parallel shift of the yield curve 
various techniques are employed to value the underlying financial instruments and rely upon a number of critical assumptions 
the scenarios presented are illustrative 
actual experience may differ materially from the estimated amounts presented for each scenario 
to the extent that yield curve shifts are non parallel and to the extent that actual variations in significant assumptions differ from those applied for purposes of the valuations  the resultant valuations can also be expected to vary 
such variances may prove material
