item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview eagle materials inc is a diversified producer of basic construction products used in residential  industrial  commercial and infrastructure construction 
information presented for fiscal and reflects the company s four businesses segments  consisting of cement  gypsum wallboard  recycled paperboard and concrete and aggregates 
certain information for each of concrete and aggregates is broken out separately in the segment discussions 

table of contents continued strong residential construction and mild winter weather in the company s markets helped to increase fiscal sales volume  revenues and net earnings 
demand in all of the company s markets was strong as the company reported increased sales volume in each of its segments for the fiscal year ended march  the majority of the earnings improvement were in the gypsum wallboard  paperboard and concrete and aggregates operations 
fiscal revenues increased to million  net earnings were up to million and diluted earnings per share were up to 
fiscal was the th consecutive sold out year for the company s cement operations 
although cement sales volume increased  operating earnings declined from last year due to lower net sales prices and increased production costs 
gypsum wallboard sales volume was up due to record industry demand and operating earnings increased due to increased sales volume 
paperboard reported record sales volume and operating earnings due to increased shipments to the company s wallboard operations and higher net sales prices 
concrete and aggregates earnings improved from a  loss last fiscal year to million operating profit this fiscal year due primarily to the losses incurred with the closing of the georgetown facility last year 
corporate expenses increased million due primarily to the cost associated with the spin off from centex corporation 
manufacturing costs in fiscal were negatively impacted by increased natural gas  coal  power and maintenance costs

downturns in overall economic activity usually have a significant adverse effect on cyclical businesses due to decreased demand and reduced pricing 
recently  wallboard demand has been favorably impacted by strong residential construction due to low interest rates 
rising interest rates could bring an erosion in new residential construction activity 
however  commercial and industrial activity  which are showing signs of improvement  may help to offset reduced demand in the residential construction sector if interest rates increase 
cement demand continues to be positively impacted by a strong national highway funding program 
the funds to be allocated in the current re authorization proposals in congress exceed the prior highway funding program 
us cement consumption continues to be strong 
total us cement shipments of million short tons for calendar were above calendar cement imports for calendar were million short tons  below last year s imports 
the us cement industry has been sold out for the last years as a result of a domestic capacity deficit 
current us demand requires over of imports to supplement domestic capacity 
the us cement industry is anticipating a tight supply of imported cement this year due to higher freight rates and increasing consumption in world markets 
although cement pricing has declined slightly over the past three years  prospects for future price increases are favorable 
strong demand from new housing and residential remodeling resulted in record wallboard consumption for calendar according to the gypsum association  national wallboard consumption of billion square feet for calendar  the highest level on record  was up from last year s consumption 
industry utilization rates have been trending upward toward the level  resulting in the firming of wallboard pricing 
the company implemented a price increase in january and another in march prospects for future price increases are favorable 
the company s paperboard mill continued operational and marketing improvements and is now producing at above its original design capacity 
profitability in aggregates improved in fiscal as a result of the issues related to the closing of the georgetown quarry last year

income taxes 
the effective tax rate for fiscal and was critical accounting policies certain of the company s critical accounting policies require the use of judgment in their application or require estimates of inherently uncertain matters 
although the company s accounting policies are in compliance with generally accepted accounting principles  a change in the facts and circumstances of the underlying transactions could significantly change the application of the accounting policies and the resulting financial statement impact 
listed below are those policies that the company believes are critical and require the use of complex judgment in their application 
impairment of long lived assets 
the company assesses long lived assets in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
requires that long lived assets be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
these evaluations for impairment are 
table of contents significantly impacted by estimates of revenues  costs and expenses and other factors 
if these assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
goodwill 
with the adoption of sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is no longer subject to amortization 
rather  goodwill is subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment by applying a fair value based test 
the company has elected to test for goodwill impairment in the first quarter of each calendar year 
the goodwill impairment test is a two step process  which requires management to make judgments in determining what assumptions to use in the calculation 
the first step of the process consists of estimating the fair value of each reporting unit based on a discounted cash flow model using revenues and profit forecasts and comparing those estimated fair values with the carrying value  a seconds step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment by determining a implied fair value of goodwill 
similar to the review for impairment of other long lived assets  evaluations for impairment are significantly impacted by estimates of future prices for the company s products  capital needs  economic trends and other factors 
environmental liabilities 
the company s operations are subject to state  federal and local environmental laws and regulations  which impose liability for cleanup or remediation of environmental pollution and hazardous waste arising from past acts  and require pollution control and prevention  site restoration and operating permits and or approvals to conduct certain of its operations 
the company records environmental accruals when it is probable that a reasonably estimable liability has been incurred 
environmental remediation accruals are based on internal studies and estimates  including shared financial liability with third parties 
environmental expenditures that extend the life  increase the capacity  improve the safety or efficiency of assets or mitigate or prevent future environmental contamination may be capitalized 
other environmental costs are expensed when incurred 
valuation of accounts receivable 
the company evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances when the company is aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligation to the company  the balance in the reserve for doubtful accounts is evaluated  and if determined to be deficient  a specific amount will be added to the reserve 
for all other customers  the reserve for doubtful accounts is determined by the length of time the receivables are past due or the status of the customer s financial condition 
liquidity and capital resources the company funds the growth of its business through internal generation of cash flow from operations and from bank borrowings  when needed 
liquidity is not currently dependent on the use of off balance sheet transactions 
the company currently believes that cash on hand  cash provided by operations and funds available under its two credit facilities should be sufficient to cover working capital needs  capital expenditures  dividends and debt service requirements for the next twelve months 
the company had paid off its debt during the third quarter of fiscal on january   the company paid a special dividend approximately million funded with million of borrowings by the company under a new bank credit agreement and cash on hand 
on march   pursuant to the second amended and restated credit agreement  the company amended its then existing credit facility to reduce the facility amount from million to million  modify certain financial and other covenants and extend the maturity date three years the amended credit facility 
the principal balance of the amended credit facility was paid off and terminated on december  and replaced with a new million credit facility the new credit facility 
the principal balance of the new credit facility matures on december  at march   the company had million borrowings outstanding under the new credit facility 
the borrowings under the new credit facility are guaranteed by all major operating subsidiaries of the company 
at the option of the company  outstanding principal amounts on the new credit facility bear interest at a variable rate equal to i libor  plus an agreed margin ranging from to basis points  
table of contents which is to be established quarterly based upon the company s ratio of consolidated ebitda to its consolidated indebtedness  or ii an alternate base rate which is the higher of a the prime rate or b the federal funds rate plus per annum  plus an agreed margin ranging from to basis points 
interest payments are payable monthly or at the end the libor advance periods  which can be up to a period of six months at the option of the company 
under the new credit facility  the company is required to adhere to a number of financial and other covenants  including covenants relating to the company s interest coverage ratio  consolidated funded indebtedness ratio and minimum tangible net worth 
the company had a total of million of borrowings available at march  under this facility 
during august  the company paid off the  balance remaining under the senior subordinated notes the notes that was assumed as part of certain assets purchased on november  on june   the company entered into a million trade receivables securitization facility the receivables securitization facility  which was funded through the issuance of commercial paper and backed by a day committed bank liquidity arrangement 
the receivables securitization facility had a termination date of june   subject to a day bank commitment that was renewed on june  for another day period terminating on june  the company did not renew the facility for the third year and paid off the receivables securitization facility on june  on february   the company entered into a new million trade receivables securitization facility the new receivables securitization facility  which was funded through the issuance of commercial paper and backed by a day committed bank liquidity arrangement 
the new receivables securitization facility has a termination date of february   subject to a day bank commitment 
the purpose of the new receivables securitization facility is to obtain financing at an interest rate lower than the new credit facility interest rate by pledging accounts receivable 
the new receivables securitization facility has been fully consolidated on the consolidated balance sheet 
subsidiary company receivables are sold on a revolving basis first to the company and then to a wholly owned special purpose bankruptcy remote entity of the company 
this entity pledges the receivables as security for advances under the facility 
initially  the borrowed funds are used to pay down borrowings under the new credit facility 
outstanding principal amounts under the new receivables securitization facility bear interest at the commercial paper rate plus a facility fee 
under the new receivables securitization facility  the company is required to adhere to certain financial and other covenants that are similar to those in the new credit facility 
the company had million of borrowings outstanding at march  under the new receivables securitization facility 
other than the new receivables securitization facility and the new credit facility  the company has no other source of committed external financing in place 
in the event the new receivables securitization facility is terminated  funds should be available under the new credit facility to repay borrowings 
however  if the new credit facility is terminated  no assurance can be given as to the company s ability to secure a new source of financing 
consequently  if a balance is outstanding on the new credit facility at the time of termination  and an alternative source of financing cannot be secured  it would have a material adverse impact on the company 
none of the company s debt is rated by the rating agencies 
the company previously entered into an interest rate swap agreement which had the effect of converting a portion of the company s debt from a variable rate of interest to a fixed rate of interest 
the agreement expired on august  the company currently is not a party to any interest rate swap or other arrangement that provides protection against increases in interest rates  and accordingly expects that it would incur higher interest expense in the event of an increase in the floating rate interest rates applicable to borrowings under the new credit facility

the annual dividend amount increased from approximately million to approximately million 
the company historically has financed routine capital expenditures and expansion projects with cash from operations and borrowing under its revolving credit facilities 
the fiscal capital expenditures budget is estimated currently at million  an increase of million over fiscal based on its financial condition at march   along with the prospects of higher net earnings in fiscal  the company believes that its internally generated cash flow coupled with funds available under various credit facilities will enable it to provide adequately for its current operations  dividends  capital expenditures and future growth 
the company was in compliance at march  and during the twelve months ended march  with all the terms and covenants of its credit agreements and expects to be in compliance during the next twelve months 
working capital at march  was million compared to million at march  the increase resulted from a million increase in accounts and notes receivable  a million decline in notes payable  a million increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities netted against a million decrease in cash 
cash and cash equivalents decreased million from march  to million at march  the net cash provided by or used in the operating  investing  and financing activities for the fiscal years ended march  and is summarized below for the years ended march  dollars in thousands net cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities net decrease increase in cash net cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the million decrease in operating cash flows resulted from a million negative year to year swing in accounts receivable due to increased fiscal sales volume and million decrease in deferred taxes  partially offset by increased earnings  a million change in year to year inventory levels and a million swing in accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
the decline in deferred taxes is due to the lower tax depreciation

inflation and changing prices inflation has become less of a factor in the us economy as the rate of increase has moderated during the last several years 
the consumer price index rose approximately in calendar  in  and in prices of materials and services  with the exception of power  energy and transportation freight  have remained relatively stable over the three year period 
strict cost control and improving productivity also minimize the impact of inflation 
the ability to recover increasing costs by obtaining higher sales prices varies with the level of activity in the construction industry  the number  size  and strength of competitors and the availability of products to supply a local market 

table of contents general outlook cement demand in calendar is expected to remain strong 
the us cement industry is anticipating a tight supply of imported cement due to higher freight rates and increasing consumption in world markets 
price increases of to per ton were implemented in all of exp s markets on april   except texas  where a per ton price increase in january has substantially held 
gypsum wallboard demand continues to remain high and supply tight due to favorable levels of activity in residential and repair remodel construction 
the price increase implemented in mid march substantially held and another price increase was implemented in late may however  costs are expected to be negatively impacted in fiscal due to increased natural gas  coal  power  freight and employee benefit costs

those risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to levels of construction spending 
demand for the company s products is directly related to the level of activity in the construction industry  which includes residential  commercial and infrastructure construction

the seasonal nature of the company s business

the company s ability to successfully identify  complete and efficiently integrate acquisitions 
integrating acquired businesses requires a significant amount of management time and skill and may 
table of contents place significant demands on the company s operations and financial resources 
the company may not be able to successfully integrate acquired businesses into its operations  which could have a material effect on its business and results of operations 
if the company is unable to achieve the anticipated synergies from an acquisition  the costs of such an acquisition could exceed the net income the company derives from the acquired operations
