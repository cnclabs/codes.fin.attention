item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview on august   we changed our name to scottish re group limited from scottish annuity life holdings  ltd 
in addition  our wholly owned subsidiaries world wide holdings limited and world wide reassurance company limited changed their names to scottish re holdings limited and scottish re limited  respectively 
we are a holding company organized under the laws of the cayman islands with our principal executive office in bermuda 
we are a reinsurer of life insurance  annuities and annuity type products 
these products are written by life insurance companies and other financial institutions located principally in the united states  as well as around the world 
we refer to this portion of our business as life reinsurance north america 
scottish re holdings limited and its subsidiary  scottish re limited  specialize in niche markets in developed countries and broader life insurance markets in the developing world 
we refer to this portion of our business as life reinsurance international 
life reinsurance north america and life reinsurance international together are a reporting operating segment 
to a lesser extent  we directly issue variable life insurance and variable annuities and similar products to high net worth individuals and families for insurance  investment and estate planning purposes 
we refer to this portion of our business as wealth management  which is another reportable operating segment 
other revenues and expenses not related to life reinsurance or wealth management are reported in the other segment 
on december   we completed the acquisition of of the outstanding capital stock of erc life reinsurance corporation  which we refer to as erc life  for million in cash  subject to certain closing adjustments 
erc life was a subsidiary of general electric s employers reinsurance corporation  which we call ge erc  and was one of the companies through which ge erc conducted life reinsurance business in the united states 
erc life s business consists primarily of a closed block of traditional life reinsurance with a face amount of billion 
at the date of acquisition  erc life had billion in total assets 
ge erc has agreed to administer the business of erc life for a fixed monthly fee for up to nine months from the date of acquisition and to assist with the transition of the business to scottish re s systems 
no ge erc employees will transfer to scottish re 
the transaction has increased the number of lives reinsured in north america from approximately million to approximately million and has increased our gross face amount of in force business in north america from approximately billion to approximately billion 
erc life is rated a excellent by am best company  which is the fourth highest of sixteen rating levels 
all amounts are reported in thousands of united states dollars  except per share amounts 
revenues we derive revenue from four principal sources o premiums from reinsurance assumed on life business  o fee income from our variable life insurance and variable annuity products and from financial reinsurance transactions  o investment income from our investment portfolio  and o realized gains and losses from our investment portfolio 
premiums from reinsurance assumed on life business are included in revenues over the premium paying period of the underlying policies 
when we acquire blocks of in force business  we account for these transactions as purchases  and our results of operations include the net income from these blocks as of their respective dates of acquisition 
reinsurance assumed on annuity business does not generate premium income but generates investment income over time on the assets we receive from the ceding company 
we also earn fees in our financial reinsurance transactions with us insurance company clients 
because some of these transactions do not satisfy the risk transfer rules for reinsurance accounting  the premiums and benefits are not reported in the consolidated statements of income 
a deposit received on a funding agreement also does not generate premium income but does create income to the extent we earn an investment return in excess of our interest payment obligations thereon 
in our wealth management business  when we sell a variable life insurance policy or a variable annuity contract  we charge mortality  expense and distribution risk fees that are based on total assets in each policyholder s separate account 
in the case of variable life insurance policies  we also charge a cost of insurance fee based on the amount necessary to cover the death benefit under the policy 
our investment income includes interest earned on our fixed income investments and income from funds withheld at interest under modified coinsurance agreements 
under gaap  because our fixed income investments are held as available for sale  these securities are carried at fair value  and unrealized appreciation and depreciation on these securities is not included in investment income on our statements of income  but is included in comprehensive income as a separate component of shareholders equity 
realized gains and losses include gains and losses on investment securities that we sell during a period and write downs of securities deemed to be other than temporarily impaired 
expenses we have five principal types of expenses o claims and policy benefits under our reinsurance contracts  o interest credited to interest sensitive contract liabilities  o acquisition costs and other insurance expenses  o operating expenses  and o interest expense 
when we issue a life reinsurance contract  we establish reserves for future benefits 
these reserves are our estimates of what we expect to pay in claims and policy benefits and related expenses under the contract or policy 
from time to time  we may change the reserves if our experience leads us to believe that benefit claims and expenses will ultimately be greater than the existing reserve 
we report the change in these reserves as an expense during the period when the reserve or additional reserve is established 
in connection with reinsurance of annuity and annuity type products  we record a liability for interest sensitive contract liabilities  which represents the amount ultimately due to the policyholder 
we credit interest to these contracts each period at the rates determined in the underlying contract  and the amount is reported as interest credited to interest sensitive contract liabilities on our consolidated statements of income 
a portion of the costs of acquiring new business  such as commissions  certain internal expenses related to our policy issuance and underwriting departments and some variable selling expenses are capitalized 
the resulting deferred acquisition costs asset is amortized over future periods based on our expectations as to the emergence of future gross profits from the underlying contracts 
these costs are dependent on the structure  size and type of business written 
for certain products  we may retrospectively adjust our amortization when we revise our estimate of current or future gross profits to be realized 
the effects of this adjustment are reflected in earnings in the period in which we revise our estimate 
operating expenses consist of salary and salary related expenses  legal and professional fees  rent and office expenses  travel and entertainment  directors expenses  insurance and other similar expenses  except to the extent capitalized in deferred acquisition costs 
interest expense consists of interest charges on our borrowings 
factors affecting profitability we seek to generate profits from two principal sources 
first  in our life reinsurance business  we seek to receive reinsurance premiums and financial reinsurance fees that  together with income from the assets in which those premiums are invested  exceed the amounts we ultimately pay as claims and policy benefits  acquisition costs and ceding commissions 
second  within our investment guidelines  we seek to maximize the return on our unallocated capital 
the following factors affect our profitability o the volume of business we write  o our ability to assess and price adequately for the risks we assume  o the mix of different types of business that we reinsure  because profits on some kinds of business emerge later than on other types  o our ability to manage our assets and liabilities to manage investment and liquidity risk  and o our ability to control expenses 
in addition  our profits can be affected by a number of factors that are not within our control 
for example  movements in interest rates can affect the volume of business that we write  the income earned from our investments  the interest we credit on interest sensitive contracts  the level of surrender activity on contracts that we reinsure and the rate at which we amortize deferred acquisition costs 
other external factors that can affect profitability include mortality experience that varies from our assumed mortality  changes in regulation or tax laws which may affect the attractiveness of our products or the costs of doing business and changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
critical accounting policies statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises applies to our traditional life policies with continuing premiums 
for these policies  future benefits are estimated using a net level premium method on the basis of actuarial assumptions as to mortality  persistency and interest established at policy issue 
assumptions established at policy issue as to mortality and persistency are based on anticipated experience  which  together with interest and expense assumptions  provide a margin for adverse deviation 
acquisition costs are deferred and recognized as expense in a constant percentage of the gross premiums using these assumptions established at issue 
should the liabilities for future policy benefits plus the present value of expected future gross premiums for a product be insufficient to provide for expected future benefits and expenses for that product  deferred acquisition costs will be written off and thereafter  if required  a premium deficiency reserve will be established by a charge to income 
changes in the assumptions for mortality  persistency and interest could result in material changes to the financial statements 
sfas no 
accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises for certain long duration contracts and for realized gains and losses from the sale of investments applies to investment contracts  limited premium contracts  and universal life type contracts 
for investment and universal life type contracts  future benefit liabilities are held using the retrospective deposit method  increased for amounts representing unearned revenue or refundable policy charges 
acquisition costs are deferred and recognized as expense as a constant percentage of gross margins using assumptions as to mortality  persistency  and expense established at policy issue without provision for adverse deviation and are revised periodically to reflect emerging actual experience and any material changes in expected future experience 
liabilities and the deferral of acquisition costs are established for limited premium policies under the same practices as used for traditional life policies with the exception that any gross premium in excess of the net premium is deferred and recognized into income as a constant percentage of insurance in force 
should the liabilities for future policy benefits plus the present value of expected future gross premiums for a product be insufficient to provide for expected future benefits and expenses for that product  deferred acquisition costs will be written off and thereafter  if required  a premium deficiency reserve will be established by a charge to income 
changes in the assumptions for mortality  persistency  maintenance expense and interest could result in material changes to the financial statements 
our premiums earned are recorded in accordance with information received from our ceding companies  or are estimated where this information is not current with the reporting period 
these premium estimates are based on historical experience as adjusted for current treaty terms and other information 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
management monitors actual experience  and should circumstances warrant  will revise its estimates of premiums earned 
the development of policy reserves and amortization of deferred acquisition costs for our products requires management to make estimates and assumptions regarding mortality  lapse  expense and investment experience 
such estimates are primarily based on historical experience and information provided by ceding companies 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
management monitors actual experience  and should circumstances warrant  will revise its assumptions and the related reserve estimates 
in the normal course of business  we acquire in force blocks of business 
the determination of the fair value of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed require management to make estimates and assumptions regarding mortality  lapse rates and expenses 
these estimates are based on historical experience  actuarial studies and information provided by the ceding companies 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
present value of in force business is established upon the acquisition of a subsidiary and is amortized over the expected life of the business at the time of acquisition 
the amortization each year will be a function of the gross profits or revenues each year in relation to the total gross profits or revenues expected over the life of business  discounted at the assumed net credit rate 
the determination of the initial value and the subsequent amortization require management to make estimates and assumptions regarding the future business results that could differ materially from actual results 
estimates and assumptions involved in the present value of in force business and subsequent amortization are similar to those necessary in the establishment of reserves and amortization of deferred acquisition costs 
goodwill is established upon the acquisition of a subsidiary 
goodwill is calculated as the difference between the price paid and the value of individual assets and liabilities on the date of acquisition 
we account for goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill deemed to have an indefinite life is subject to an annual impairment test 
goodwill recognized in the consolidated balance sheet relates to our acquisition of scottish re holdings limited and has been tested for impairment 
we have determined that there is no impairment 
fixed maturity investments are evaluated for other than temporary impairments in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities sfas and emerging issues task force recognition of interest income and impairment on purchased and retained beneficial interest in securitized assets eitf as described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
under these pronouncements  realized losses are recognized on securities if the securities are determined to be other than temporarily impaired 
factors involved in the determination of potential impairment include fair value as compared to amortized cost  length of time the value has been below amortized cost  credit worthiness of the issuer  forecasted financial performance of the issuer  position of the security in the issuer s capital structure  the presence and estimated value of collateral or other credit enhancement  length of time to maturity  interest rates and our intent and ability to hold the security until the market value recovers 
our funds withheld at interest arise on modified coinsurance and funds withheld coinsurance transactions 
derivatives implementation group issue no 
b embedded derivatives bifurcation of a debt instrument that incorporates both interest rate and credit rate risk exposures that are unrelated or only partially related to the creditworthiness of the issuer of that instrument dig b indicates that these transactions contain embedded derivatives 
the embedded derivative feature in our funds withheld treaties is similar to a fixed rate total return swap on the assets held by the ceding companies 
the swap consists of two parts 
the first is the market value of the underlying asset portfolio and the second is a hypothetical loan to the ceding company 
the hypothetical loan is based on the expected cash flows of the underlying reinsurance liability 
we have developed models to systematically estimate the value of the total return swap 
the fair value of the embedded derivative is affected by changes in expected cash flows  credit spreads of the assets and changes in risk free interest rates 
the change in fair value is included in our calculation of estimated gross profits and  therefore  also affects the amortization of deferred acquisition costs 
in addition to our quota share indemnity funds withheld contracts  we have entered into various financial reinsurance treaties that  although considered funds withheld  do not transfer significant insurance risk and are recorded on a deposit method of accounting 
as a result of the experience refund provisions of these treaties the value of the embedded derivative is currently considered immaterial 
changes in our expectations of future cash flows could result in material changes to the financial statements 
our accounting policies addressing premiums earned  reserves  deferred acquisition costs  value of business acquired  goodwill  investment impairment and embedded derivatives involve significant assumptions  judgments and estimates 
changes in these assumptions  judgments and estimates could create material changes in our consolidated financial statements 
results of operations consolidated results of operations our results of operations for the year ended december  do not include the results of operations of scottish re holdings limited  which we acquired at the close of business on december  our results of operations for the years ended december  and do not include the results of operations of erc life  which we acquired on december  the results for the year ended december  include net income of million in respect of the results of erc life for the period from december  to december  year ended year ended year ended december december december premiums earned    investment income  net    fee income    realized losses    change in value of embedded derivatives  total revenues    claims and other policy benefits    interest credited to interest sensitive contract liabilities    acquisition costs and other insurance expenses  net    operating expenses    interest expense    total benefits and expenses    income before income taxes and minority interest    income tax benefit expense   income before minority interest    minority interest income from continuing operations before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle    cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  loss from discontinued operations  net income    during the year ended december   total revenues increased by to million 
total revenues include premiums earned in our life reinsurance operations  investment income on our invested assets  fee income on our life reinsurance and wealth management operations  realized losses on our investment portfolio and the change in the value of embedded derivatives 
the increase in premiums earned is primarily due to continued growth in our life reinsurance north america and life reinsurance international segments 
the increase in investment income is due to growth in our invested assets  which arises from business growth  our equity offering in july and our debt offerings in november and december the change in value of the embedded derivatives arises from the application of digb during the year ended december  revenues increased by million or to million in comparison with the same period in the increase is primarily due to the acquisition of scottish re holdings limited  the growth in our life reinsurance north america operations and an increase in investment income primarily due to the growth in our invested assets 
the growth in our invested assets is due to the new business and the equity offering in april during the year ended december   total benefits and expenses increased by to million from to the increase was due to continued growth in our life reinsurance north america and life reinsurance international segments  a million charge to account for revised reporting by a ceding company client in connection with two fixed annuity reinsurance contracts  additional operating costs required to meet the growth in our business and additional interest expense arising from the debt issuance in november and december total benefits and expenses increased by to million from to the increase in benefits and expenses is primarily due to the acquisition of scottish re holdings limited and the growth in our life reinsurance north america operations 
during the year ended december  we implemented the requirements of dig b which addresses whether sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities requires bifurcation of a debt instrument into a debt host contract and an embedded derivative if the debt instrument incorporates both interest rate risk and credit risk exposures that are unrelated or only partially related to the creditworthiness of the issuer of that instrument 
under dig b modified coinsurance and coinsurance funds withheld reinsurance agreements where interest is determined by reference to a pool of fixed maturity assets  are arrangements containing embedded derivatives requiring bifurcation 
in addition  reinsurance contacts with experience refunds are also considered to be arrangements containing embedded derivatives requiring bifurcation 
dig b was effective for fiscal quarters beginning october  we reviewed all contracts at october  and determined that the value of this derivative  net of related deferred acquisition costs  after taxation was a loss of million 
this is shown in the consolidated statements of income as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle for the year ended december  the change in value of the derivative  net of related deferred amortization costs  during the quarter ended december  amounted to a gain of million 
during  we decided to discontinue our wealth management operations in luxembourg 
we have transferred our luxembourg wealth management business to third parties  closed the luxembourg office and are in the process of liquidating our luxembourg subsidiary 
we have reported the results of the luxembourg wealth management activities as discontinued operations 
losses incurred in respect of these operations in the year ended december  and amounted to million and million  respectively 
during the year ended december  we implemented the requirements of eitf eitf applies to all securities  which represent beneficial interests in securitized assets  unless they meet certain exception criteria 
a decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis is considered to be an other than temporary impairment whenever there is an adverse change in the amount or timing of cash flows to be received  regardless of the resulting yield  unless the decrease is solely a result of changes in market rates 
at june  we reviewed all applicable securities and identified a write down of  this is shown in the consolidated statements of income as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle

the growth in both income from continuing operations and diluted earnings per share arises from the reasons discussed above 
the growth in diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was offset by the increase in the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding due to the public offering of  ordinary shares in july as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
diluted earnings per ordinary share amounted to and for the year ended december  and  respectively 
diluted earnings per ordinary share for decreased due to the adoption of dig b and the resultant cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
in addition  the number of weighted average shares outstanding increased mainly due to the public offering of  ordinary shares in july as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
income from continuing operations for the year ended december  increased to million from million in the increase in is attributable to the inclusion of scottish re holdings limited for the first time since its acquisition  continued growth in our life reinsurance north america operations  and an increase in investment income primarily due to the increase in average invested assets 
the contribution to net income from continuing operations by scottish re holdings limited amounted to million for the year ended december  the increase in income from continuing operations was offset in part by an increase in realized losses on fixed maturity investments and unit linked securities  and by losses incurred in our wealth management and other segments 
realized losses were million for the year ended december   compared to realized losses of million in the year ended december  the losses in our wealth management operations arose principally from increased commission costs and severance payments 
the losses in our other segment arose because of reductions in investment income as we deployed more capital in the life reinsurance north america segment and increased costs in the first full year of our operations in bermuda 
diluted earnings per ordinary share from continuing operations before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle amounted to for the year ended december  an increase of from diluted earnings per ordinary share for the year ended december  increased to from in diluted earnings per share increased as a result of the growth in net income described above 
this increase has occurred despite the increase in the number of ordinary shares outstanding 
the increase in the number of ordinary shares outstanding is a result of shares issued in the acquisition of scottish re holdings limited and the equity offering in april discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
premiums earned premiums earned during the year ended december  increased by to million from million in premiums earned in our life reinsurance north america segment during the year ended december  increased to million from million in the increase is due to increases in the amounts of life insurance in force on existing traditional solutions treaties and on new business written during the year 
as of december   premiums earned in our life reinsurance north america segment excluding erc life relates to the reinsurance of approximately billion of life insurance in force on million lives and our average benefit coverage per life of  as of december   we reinsured approximately billion of life insurance in force on million lives and our average benefit coverage per life was  premiums earned in our life reinsurance international segment during the year ended december  increased by to million in comparison with million in our life reinsurance international segment completed the acquisition of an in force reinsurance transaction effective october  this transaction has contributed million to premiums earned during the year compared to million of premiums earned in premiums earned on other life reinsurance business increased million in the year ended december  in comparison with the prior year 
the increase is due to an increase in the number of contracts to  in the current year from  in the prior year 
of the million  million relates to revisions in estimates of premiums earned 
the majority of business in our life reinsurance international segment is in respect of short duration contracts 
we have experienced considerable reporting delays from some of our cedents on this business 
as part of the implementation of this segment s new administrative system  improved data has been compiled which allowed us to more accurately estimate our premium earned 
premiums earned on aircrew loss of license insurance increased to million during the current year in comparison with million in the prior year due principally to new business 
at december   there were loss of license contracts in comparison with at december  premiums earned during the year ended december  increased to million compared with the same period in premiums earned in increased due to the acquisition of scottish re holdings limited and the growth in the number of clients in our life reinsurance north america operations

fee income is as follows year ended december  dollars in thousands life reinsurance north america    wealth management    total    fee income in our life reinsurance north america segment increased by to million for the year ended december  in comparison with the prior year period 
the increases are due to continued growth in fee generating business in our life reinsurance north america segment 
wealth management fees increased by to million during the year ended december  the overall growth in fees is principally due to the growth in segregated account balances  which is due to improved investment performance

yields on floating rate assets are indexed to libor 
the yield on our floating rate assets increased to from  and the yield on our cash and cash equivalents decreased to from 
the market value of floating rate assets increased to million in from million in as a result of our increased floating rate funding agreements and our increased floating rate liabilities 
during the year ended december   average book yields were lower than in  particularly on floating rate assets and cash 
on the billion portfolio managed by our external investment managers the yields on fixed rate assets were and at december  and  respectively

during the year ended december   we recognized million in losses in respect of other than temporary impairments on investments  impairment losses of million under eitf and million net of related deferred acquisition costs of other than temporary impairment losses notified by ceding companies on contracts written on a modified coinsurance basis 
these losses were offset by realized exchange gains of million and net gains and losses on disposals of investments amounting to million 
at december   we held unit linked securities amounting to million 
these securities comprised investments in a unit trust denominated in british pounds 
these securities were acquired as part of the purchase of scottish re holdings limited and were recorded at quoted market value 
changes in market value were recorded as net realized gains or losses 
during  we novated our liabilities on our unit linked contracts as discussed in claims and other policy benefits 
the liabilities were settled by transferring a portion of the unit linked securities to the original ceding company 
the remaining unit linked securities were sold realizing a gain of million during the year 
during the year ended december   changes in market value of those securities of million were recognized as realized losses 
during the year ended december   realized losses amounted to million net of associated amortization of deferred acquisition costs 
the losses in consist of realized investment losses on unit linked securities held by scottish re holdings limited of million  impairment losses recognized under eitf of million and other than temporary impairments on fixed maturity investments of million 
these losses were partially offset by net realized gains on the sales of fixed maturity investments of million 
during the year ended december  realized losses included amounts recognized as other than temporary impairments on fixed maturity investments of million 
the realization of losses in was due to the sale and write down of carrying values of securities  predominately securities issued by enron and its affiliate  osprey 
these losses were offset in part by gains realized primarily for tax purposes on bonds in the portfolio of scottish re us  inc and gains of  on assets sold to fund part of the recapture of a block of business by one client on april  during  we also recognized in income unrealized losses of million on certain structured securities in accordance with the requirements of eitf management reviews securities with material unrealized losses and tests for other than temporary impairments on a quarterly basis 
factors involved in the determination of impairment include fair value as compared to amortized cost  length of time the value has been below amortized cost  credit worthiness of the issuer  forecasted financial performance of the issuer  position of the security in the issuer s capital structure  the presence and estimated value of collateral or other credit enhancement  length of time to maturity  interest rates and our intent and ability to hold the security until the market value recovers 
we review all investments with fair values less than amortized cost  and pay particular attention to those that have traded continuously at less than of amortized cost for at least six months or of amortized cost for at least months and other assets with material differences between amortized cost and fair value 
investments meeting those criteria are analyzed in detail for other than temporary impairment 
when a decline is considered to be other than temporary a realized loss is incurred and the cost basis of the impaired asset is adjusted to its fair value 
under eitf  a decline in fair value below amortized cost basis is considered to be an other than temporary impairment whenever there is an adverse change in the amount or timing of cash flow to be received  regardless of the resulting yield  unless the decrease is solely a result of changes in market interest rates

these gains have been calculated in accordance with dig b and are stated net of related deferred acquisition costs 
claims and other policy benefits claims and other policy benefits increased by to million in the year ended december  from million in the same period of claims and other policy benefits in our life reinsurance north america segment increased by to million in the year ended december  from million in the increase is as a result of the increased number of clients and the increase in our traditional solutions business from these clients as previously described 
death claims are reasonably predictable over a period of many years  but are less predictable over shorter periods and are subject to fluctuation from year to year 
claims and other policy benefits in our life reinsurance international segment increased by to million in the year ended december  from million in the increase is a result of the increased volume of business as previously described  the revisions of estimates of premiums earned as previously discussed together with the acquisition of an in force block of business effective october claims on the in force block amounted to million and million for the year ended december  and  respectively 
the estimate process contributed a further million to claims and other policy benefits 
during  through our life reinsurance international segment  we entered into an agreement to novate our unit linked liabilities 
the outstanding liabilities were settled by transferring an agreed number of unit linked securities to the novation agreement counter party 
the settlement was less than the liability previously recorded of million and therefore resulted in a release of liabilities of million 
claims and other policy benefits increased by to million in the year ended december  from million in the same period of the increase is a result of the acquisition of scottish re holdings limited  the increased number of clients and the increase in our traditional solutions business from these clients in our life reinsurance north america segment 
scottish re holdings limited s claims and other policy benefits were million for the year ended december  our targeted maximum corporate retention in our life reinsurance north america segment on any one life is million  however  we currently retrocede any liability in excess of  our targeted maximum corporate retention per life in our life reinsurance international segment is  in addition  we maintain catastrophe cover on our entire retained life reinsurance business  which provides reinsurance for losses of million in excess of  this catastrophe cover includes protection for nuclear  biological and chemical risks 
interest credited to interest sensitive contract liabilities for the year ended december  interest credited to interest sensitive contract liabilities increased by million or to million from million in included in interest credited to interest sensitive contract liabilities during the year ended december  is million due to revised reporting by a ceding company client in connection with two fixed annuity reinsurance contracts 
interest credited includes interest in respect of funding agreements

in the event of insolvency of the ceding companies on these arrangements we would need to exert a claim on the assets supporting the contract liabilities

we must have sufficient assets available for use as collateral to support borrowings  letters of credit  and certain reinsurance transactions 
with these reinsurance transactions  the need for collateral or letters of credit arises in four ways o when scottish annuity life insurance company cayman ltd  scottish re dublin limited or scottish re limited enters into a reinsurance treaty with a us customer  we must contribute assets into a reserve credit trust with a us bank or issue a letter of credit in order that the ceding company may obtain reserve credit for the reinsurance transaction  o when scottish re us  inc enters into a reinsurance transaction  it typically incurs a need for additional statutory capital this need can be met by its own capital surplus  an infusion of cash or assets from scottish re or an affiliate or by ceding a portion of the transaction to another company within the group or an unrelated reinsurance company  in which case that reinsurer must provide reserve credit by contributing assets in a reserve credit trust or a letter of credit  o scottish re us  inc is licensed  accredited  approved or authorized to write reinsurance in states and the district of columbia 
when scottish re us  inc enters into a reinsurance transaction with a customer domiciled in a state in which it is not a licensed  accredited  authorized or approved reinsurer  it likewise must provide a reserve credit trust or letter of credit  o erc life is licensed  accredited  approved or authorized to write reinsurance in states  the district of columbia  guam and the federated states of micronesia 
when erc life enters into a reinsurance transaction with a customer domiciled in a state in which it is not a licensed  accredited  authorized or approved reinsurer  it likewise must provide a reserve credit trust or letter of credit  and o even when scottish re us  inc is licensed  accredited  approved or authorized to write reinsurance in a state  it may agree with a customer to provide a reserve credit trust or letter of credit voluntarily to mitigate the counter party risk from the customer s perspective  thereby doing transactions that would be otherwise unavailable or would be available only on significantly less attractive terms

scottish re and scottish annuity life insurance company cayman ltd 
have executed similar agreements for scottish re dublin limited and may  from time to time  execute additional agreements guaranteeing the performance and or obligations of their subsidiaries 
our business is capital intensive 
we expect that our cash and investments  together with cash generated from our businesses  will be sufficient to meet our current liquidity and letter of credit needs

changes in accounting standards in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  an amendment of fasb statement no 

in prior years  we applied the intrinsic value based expense provisions set forth in abp opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
effective january   we have prospectively adopted the fair value based stock option expense provisions of sfas no 
as amended by sfas no 
this has resulted in a charge to income of  for the year ended december  in may  fasb issued sfas no 
accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equities 
this sfas establishes standards for classification of financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
we have adopted the provisions of sfas there were no changes to our financial position or results of operations 
in july  the accounting standards executive committee issued statement of position sop  accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises for certain nontraditional long duration insurance contracts and for separate accounts 
this sop provides guidance on accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises for certain nontraditional long duration contracts and for separate accounts and is effective for financial statements for fiscal years beginning after december  at the date of initial application of this sop  we are required to make various determinations  such as qualification for separate account treatment  classification of securities in separate account arrangements  significance of mortality and morbidity risk  adjustments to contract holder liabilities  and adjustments to estimated gross profits as defined in sfas no 
 accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises for certain long duration contracts and for realized gains and losses from the sale of investments 
we do not believe the implementation of this sop will have a material effect on our financial statements 
the derivative implementation group has released dig b that addresses whether sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities requires bifurcation of a debt instrument into a debt host contract and an embedded derivative if the debt instrument incorporates both interest rate risk and credit risk exposures that are unrelated or only partially related to the creditworthiness of the issuer of that instrument 
under dig b modified coinsurance and funds withheld coinsurance reinsurance agreements where interest is determined by reference to a pool of fixed maturity assets are arrangements containing embedded derivatives requiring bifurcation 
our funds withheld at interest  which arise under modified coinsurance and coinsurance funds withheld agreements are therefore considered to contain embedded derivatives requiring bifurcation 
the market value of funds withheld at interest was billion at december  and its carrying value was billion 
we adopted dig b on october  the initial adoption has resulted in a loss  after tax and after related amortization of deferred acquisition costs of million 
this has been recorded as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in our consolidated statement of income for the year ended december  the change in fair value of the derivative between october  and december  was a gain of million  net of related amortization of deferred acquisition costs

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we measure and manage market risks and other risks as part of an enterprise wide risk management process 
the market risks described in this section relate to financial instruments  primarily in our investment portfolio  that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  credit risk premiums or spreads  foreign exchange rates and equity prices 
our investments  which are primarily fixed income securities  are subject to market value  reinvestment  and liquidity risk 
our invested assets are funded not only by capital but also by the proceeds of reinsurance transactions  some of which entail substantial deposits of funds or assets 
the cash flows required to pay future benefits are subject to actuarial uncertainties and  in some cases  the policies that we reinsure contain provisions that tend to increase benefits to customers depending on movements in interest rates 
we analyze the potential results of a transaction  including the cash flows of the liabilities and of the related assets  and any risk mitigation measures  and we price transactions to cover our costs  including estimated credit losses  and earn a desirable risk adjusted return under various scenarios 
although we have not done so in the past  we may use interest rate swaps and other hedging instruments as tools to mitigate these risks 
we may also retrocede some risks to other reinsurers 
interest rate risk interest rate risk consists of two components in a falling rate scenario  we have reinvestment risk  which is the risk that interest rates will decline and funds reinvested will earn less than is necessary to match anticipated liabilities  and in a rising rate scenario  we have the risk that cash outflows will have to be funded by selling assets  which will then be trading at depreciated values 
with some annuity liabilities  these risks are compounded by variability in liability cash flows arising from adverse experience in withdrawals  surrenders  mortality  and election of early retirement 
we mitigate both components of risk through asset liability management  including the technique of simulating future results under a variety of interest rate scenarios and modifying the investment and hedging strategy to mitigate downside risk to earnings 
our investment portfolio is composed of fixed maturity bond investments  of which the majority are at fixed interest rates 
for fixed rate investments backing reinsurance liabilities  the maturity structure has been designed to have approximately the same exposure to changes in interest rates as the related liabilities 
floating rate liabilities  including borrowings  are backed primarily by floating rate assets 
in the capital account  however  we own investments that are also sensitive to interest rate changes and this sensitivity is not offset by liabilities 
our overall objective is to limit interest rate exposure 
credit risk credit risk relates to the uncertainty associated with the continued ability of a given obligor to make timely payments of principal and interest 
we measure and manage credit risk not only of bond issuers but also of counter parties in reinsurance  retrocession and hedging transactions 
in our investment portfolio  credit risk is manifested in three ways o actual and anticipated deterioration in the creditworthiness of an issue  as may be reflected in downgrades in its ratings  tend to reduce its market value  o our managers might react to the actual or expected deterioration and or downgrade of an issuer by selling some or all of our positions  realizing a loss or a profit smaller than would have been realized if the deterioration or downgrade had not occurred  and o the issuer may go into default  ultimately causing us to realize a loss 
one of our key objectives in managing credit risk is to keep actual credit losses below both the amounts that we have assumed and allowed for in pricing reinsurance transactions and the amounts we would have lost  given the general level of experience for comparably rated securities of the same type in the general market 
we seek to prevent credit risk  in the aggregate  from becoming the dominant source of risk in our overall book of retained risks as a reinsurer 
we mitigate credit risk by adopting an investment policy  approved by our board of directors  which limits overall exposure to credit risk and requires diversification by limiting exposure to any single issuer 
we also use outside professional money management firms and monitor their capabilities  performance and compliance with our investment and risk management policies 
foreign currency risk our functional currency is the united states dollar 
however  our uk subsidiaries  scottish re holdings limited and scottish re limited  maintain a part of their investment portfolio and operating expense accounts in british pounds and receive other currencies in payment of premiums 
all of scottish re limited s original us business is settled in united states dollars  all canadian  latin american and certain asia and middle east business is converted and settled in united states dollars  and all other currencies are converted and settled in british pounds 
the results of the business in british pounds are then translated to united states dollars 
scottish re attempts to limit substantial exposures to foreign currency risk  but does not actively manage currency risks 
to the extent our foreign currency exposure is not properly managed or otherwise hedged  we may experience exchange losses  which in turn would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
we may enter into investment  insurance and reinsurance transactions in the future in currencies other than united states dollars 
our objective is to avoid substantial exposures to foreign currency risk 
we will manage these risks using policy limits  asset liability management techniques and hedging transactions 
sensitivity analysis change in interest rates we regularly conduct analyses to gauge the financial impact of changes in interest rates on our financial condition 
techniques include  but are not limited to  comparison of option adjusted duration of assets and liabilities and simulation of future asset and liability cash flows under multiple interest rate scenarios 
financial simulations are also used to evaluate exposure to credit spreads and will be used as we consider investments and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
on a monthly basis  we measure the gap between the effective duration of the investments and the target duration 
for assets supporting liabilities  we set the target duration to minimize interest rate risk for each liability transaction 
our investment policy limits the duration gap to years 
for floating rate borrowings and liabilities  we target floating rate assets  which have a duration near zero 
for capital account assets  we target a duration of years 
quantitative disclosure of interest rate risk the following tables provide information as of december  about the interest rate sensitivity of the portion of our investment portfolio managed by external managers 
the tables do not include other cash balances of million  or modified coinsurance assets of billion 
the tables show the aggregate amount  by book value and fair value  of the securities that are expected to mature in each of the next five years and thereafter  as well as the weighted average book yield of those securities 
the expected maturity is the weighted average life of a security and takes into consideration par amortization for mortgage backed securities  call features and sinking fund features
