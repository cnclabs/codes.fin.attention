per diluted share net of tax in the second quarter of fiscal as a result of a prepayment penalty paid to lenders in connection with the complete refinancing of the company s debt following the sale of the manufacturing and marketing segment 
the loss was originally shown as an extraordinary item  net of tax  in fiscal however  under a new accounting pronouncement adopted in fiscal  the loss is treated as an ordinary rather than extraordinary item  and accordingly  fiscal results of continuing operations have been restated to reflect this change in accounting treatment 
textile services segment revenues of million in fiscal were million or percent above the prior year 
over one half of the revenue increase was due to net new business additions new business installed less lost business 
the remaining increase in revenue was primarily attributable to the rd week and fourth quarter fiscal acquisitions 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  textile services acquired a healthcare laundry plant and business located in tampa  fl with annual revenues of approximately million  and customer contracts and selected assets of a competitor in batavia  ny with annual revenues of approximately million 
gross margin in this segment decreased to percent in fiscal from percent in fiscal margins were negatively affected by increases of million in utilities and delivery fuel  and million in workers compensation and other insurance costs over the prior year 
competitive pricing pressures in the marketplace have limited textile services ability to offset these cost increases with higher prices charged to its customers 
these cost increases  along with start up costs for the new phoenix  az and columbia  sc plants  were mitigated to an extent by favorable impacts from improved linen management  net new business added during the year and the extra week 
operating income of the textile services segment showed a slight decrease of percent to million in fiscal from million in fiscal net retail sales in the life uniform segment totaled million in fiscal  down million or percent from million in fiscal a same store sales decline of percent for the year accounted for million of the decrease  partially offset by million of sales in the extra week 
sales also decreased million in fiscal due to the closing of stores in the past two years 
gross margin of the life uniform segment of percent in fiscal was lower than the percent of a year ago 
fiscal gross margin included a gain of 
million  or percent of sales  from the reversal of an intercompany profit deferral due to the sale of the manufacturing and marketing segment 
as noted above  a pretax charge of million was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal to write down the carrying amounts of long lived assets in certain underperforming stores to their fair values 
including the asset impairment charge  life uniform posted an operating loss of million in fiscal compared with operating income of million in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses increased percent in fiscal  but declined as a percent of combined sales and revenues  from percent in fiscal to percent in fiscal lower incentive compensation accruals across the company and decreases in life uniform store operating expenses due to fewer stores were offset by increases in operating expenses for support and maintenance of new information systems at life uniform and corporate costs related to the company s search for  and transition to  a new chief executive officer 
the reduction in interest expense of million or percent in fiscal reflects the lower debt level and lower interest rates following the complete refinancing of the company s debt in the second quarter of fiscal taxes on income from continuing operations were provided for at an effective tax rate of percent in fiscal the lower effective tax rate on income from continuing operations of percent in fiscal was primarily due to the effect of the aforementioned restatement of the extraordinary loss which was tax effected at the incremental tax rate as a separate component of income from continuing operations in fiscal in accordance with sfas no

per share in fiscal compared with a net loss of per share diluted in fiscal revenues of the textile services segment in fiscal were million  an increase of million or percent from the prior year 
net new business additions were strong in fiscal  although slightly below the record level in fiscal the sale of the denver  co plant in fiscal negatively affected revenues by million  offset in part by an acquisition of selected assets and textile linen management services of a hospital owned laundry in macon  ga 
gross margin benefited from control of linen expense and other production costs  offset to some extent by significantly higher workers compensation costs 
as a result of the gross margin and revenue improvements  operating income of the textile services segment increased percent in fiscal fiscal earnings also included a gain on the sale of the denver  co plant of 
million reported in other operating expense  net 
sales at life uniform increased percent to million from million in fiscal same store sales increased percent in fiscal compared with a percent decrease in fiscal  although the increase in the fourth quarter of fiscal was the smallest of the year at percent 
sales from this segment s catalogue and e commerce distribution channels increased percent to million 
life uniform s fiscal sales were negatively affected by approximately million resulting from having fewer stores in operation compared with fiscal gross margins improved in both the stores and the catalogue e commerce operation 
operating income of the life uniform segment was million in fiscal compared with an operating loss of million in fiscal including restructuring and other charges  as a result of the improved gross margins  closing of restructured and other unprofitable stores as well as the higher sales levels 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased percent in fiscal  representing percent of combined sales and revenues compared with percent in fiscal the increase was due mainly to filling several new sales and administrative positions at textile services  higher incentive compensation expense as a result of improved operating results  and increased employee healthcare costs 
interest expense decreased million in fiscal to million resulting from the lower debt level and lower interest rates following the aforementioned debt refinancing 
the effective tax rate on income from continuing operations of percent in fiscal is higher than the percent tax rate in the prior year due to the impact of permanent differences on the relatively low level of income in fiscal financial condition receivables and linens in service increased million and million  respectively  in fiscal due to businesses acquired by the textile services segment in the fourth quarter of fiscal and the revenue increase in textile services 
days outstanding in receivables were at the end of fiscal versus at the end of fiscal increases in total property and equipment of million and goodwill and other acquired assets of million reflect the cost of businesses acquired by textile services  as well as capital expenditures related to the new phoenix  az and columbia  sc laundry facilities 
at the end of fiscal  the company s working capital of million and current ratio of to were both lower than million and to at the end of fiscal accrued wages declined million at the end of fiscal as a result of lower incentive compensation accruals and the payment of severance costs associated with the fiscal sale of the manufacturing and marketing segment 
total debt of million at fiscal year end was 
million lower than a year ago  and represented percent of total capitalization versus percent at the end of fiscal book value per share increased percent to at the end of fiscal liquidity and capital resources cash and short term investments of million at the end of fiscal decreased million from fiscal year end 
cash flow provided by operating activities of continuing operations increased percent to million in fiscal in fiscal  the company received cash of million in connection with the life insurance company liquidation referred to above  and a federal income tax refund of million due mainly to the loss on the sale of the manufacturing and marketing segment recorded in prior fiscal years 
capital expenditures for property and equipment increased million in fiscal primarily due to the new textile services plants 
cash flows from discontinued operations reflect the proceeds from the liquidation of assets of the manufacturing and marketing segment  principally accounts receivable and inventories  substantially completed in fiscal  net of the payment of certain sale related liabilities 
as discussed in note  the company s total debt at the end of fiscal consisted principally of the amount outstanding under a revolving bank line of credit 
as of fiscal year end  the amount available to borrow under the line of credit was million 
on march   the company amended the terms of the credit facility to increase the maximum borrowing capacity by million to million  and extend the maturity date to may  with two optional one year extensions 
in addition to the bank credit  the company has significant borrowing capacity against the cash value of its company owned life insurance policies 
management believes that the company s financial condition  operating cash flow and available sources of external funds are sufficient to satisfy the company s requirements for debt service  capital expenditures  acquisitions  dividends and working capital over the course of the next months 
contractual obligations future payments due under contractual obligations  aggregated by type of obligation  as of the end of fiscal are as follows dollars in thousands payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt  including interest    capital lease obligations  including interest operating leases      purchase obligations linen contracts   natural gas contracts   deferred compensation and pension liabilities      total      future payments of long term debt reflect the amended terms of the credit facility on march   as discussed in note discontinued operations in january  the company s board of directors approved a plan to discontinue the manufacturing and marketing segment 
at that time  the assets of the segment were written down and a loss on disposal of million net of tax was recorded based on the estimated net realizable value from the pending sale of the business  as well as estimates of the costs of disposal and transition 
during fiscal  the sale and transition of the business to the buyers was completed and the assets of the segment were substantially liquidated 
an additional loss on disposal of million net of tax was recorded in fiscal to reflect the actual value received upon ultimate disposition of the segment s assets  including actual costs of disposition and transition 
of this amount  million was due to a reduction in the value of the inventories realized 
the remaining assets of the segment of million as of january   primarily accounts receivable and inventory  were disposed of in fiscal for amounts approximating their carrying values 
operating results of the manufacturing and marketing segment in fiscal prior to its discontinuation are included in the consolidated statements of income as net loss from operations of discontinued segment 
as discussed in note  on february   the company s board of directors approved a plan to exit and discontinue the life uniform segment 
accordingly  the assets and liabilities of life uniform will be segregated  and its results of operations reported in discontinued operations  effective in the first quarter of fiscal although the segment is being actively marketed for sale  the company intends to continue to operate it pending completion of a sale 
management has expressed a willingness to exclude certain underperforming retail stores from a potential sale 
as noted above  an asset impairment charge of million pretax was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal related to certain underperforming life uniform stores 
the final sale price and the costs associated with exiting stores that are not included in the sale will determine whether the sale will result in recognition of a gain or a loss 
although consummation of a sale of the business is anticipated in fiscal  there is a risk that the company will be unable to sell the life uniform segment under financial terms and conditions that are acceptable which could result in losses upon the closing of stores and liquidation of the assets 
should the company be unable to successfully conclude the sale of life uniform  it is expected that the company would wind down life s operations in a manner to maximize the recovery of the asset values 
the net book value of the life uniform segment at january  was million 
restructuring activities in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company developed plans to close underperforming life uniform retail stores which collectively lost 
million in fiscal and exit the hospitality line of business in the life uniform segment 
at that time  the company recorded restructuring and other charges of million pretax relating to these activities 
during fiscal  the company closed of the life uniform stores included in the plan of restructuring and liquidated the hospitality non healthcare line of inventory 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  management decided that the remaining two stores included in the restructuring plan would not be closed  and reversed 
million of the restructuring charge related to these two stores 
in fiscal  the company reversed into income from continuing operations 
million of the original restructuring charge recorded in fiscal due to terminations of store leases for amounts less than reserved and management s revised estimate of the reserve required to terminate the remaining store leases 
it is management s opinion that the remaining restructuring reserve is adequate  however  there is a risk that additional costs could result from the company s inability to terminate the leases of the remaining closed stores for the amounts reserved 
conversely  any remaining restructuring reserve not needed for its original intended purpose will be reversed into income in the period such determination is made 
critical accounting policies the company s significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
certain of these policies as discussed below require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting appropriate assumptions for calculating amounts to record in the consolidated financial statements 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
inventories and linens in service substantially all of the company s inventories are finished goods held for resale in life uniform s retail stores and catalogue e commerce operation 
these inventories are stated at the lower of cost or fair market value  net of a reserve for inventory shrinkage based upon a percentage of sales 
inventory costs are determined principally by the use of the retail inventory method 
linens in service represent the unamortized cost of textile and linen products purchased for service in the textile services segment 
linens in service are amortized on a straight line basis over their expected useful lives of one to two years 
self insurance liabilities the company self insures liabilities for non union employee medical coverage and liabilities for casualty insurance claims  including workers compensation  general liability and vehicle liability  up to certain levels 
the company purchases insurance coverage for large claims over the self insured retention levels 
in fiscal  the company negotiated a buyout of all casualty claims occurring prior to february  the liability for casualty claims as of january  includes losses for claims that occurred since the buyout date 
self insurance liabilities are estimated using actuarial methods and historical data for payment patterns  cost trends and other relevant factors 
while management believes that the estimated liabilities recorded for casualty and employee medical claims as of january  are adequate  and that appropriate judgment has been applied in determining the estimates  such estimated liabilities could differ materially from actual liabilities resulting from the ultimate disposition of the claims 
deferred income taxes the company recognizes deferred income tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of the assets and liabilities 
balances in the deferred income tax accounts are regularly reviewed for adequacy and recoverability by analyzing the expected income necessary to realize the deferred assets  the anticipated tax rates applicable when the deferred items are expected to be recognized and the ability to utilize carryforward items 
the company does not provide for deferred tax liabilities related to the cash surrender value of its company owned life insurance under the assumption that these policies will be held by the company until death of the insured 
it is management s opinion that adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all periods presented  and all net deferred tax assets will be fully recovered 
stock based compensation the company applies apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  in accounting for its stock based compensation plans 
accordingly  no compensation expense has been recognized for the issuance of stock options to employees and directors 
under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  companies are encouraged but not required to adopt a fair value based method to recognize compensation expense of equity instruments awarded to employees 
had the company recorded compensation expense for stock options issued consistent with sfas no 
 the company s net income and earnings per share would approximate the pro forma amounts disclosed in note impairment of long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 the company considers the possible impairment of its long lived assets  excluding goodwill  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
indications of possible impairment include  but are not limited to  operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of a long lived asset  or a current expectation that  more likely than not  a long lived asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
to determine the potential impairment of long lived assets  the company is required to make estimates of the projected future cash flows associated with the use of the assets  as well as their fair values 
management believes that the carrying values of the company s long lived assets as of january   as adjusted for the fiscal asset impairment charge discussed in note  are fully recoverable 
forward looking statements any forward looking statements made in this document reflect the company s current views with respect to future events and financial performance and are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in these statements 
these potential risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  competitive and general economic conditions  the ability to retain current customers and to add new customers in competitive market environments  competitive pricing in the marketplace  delays in the shipment of orders  availability of labor at appropriate rates  availability and cost of energy and water supplies  the cost of workers compensation and healthcare benefits  the ability to attract and retain key personnel  actual charges to the restructuring reserve significantly different from estimated charges  disruption to the company s operations by union activities  the ability of the company to sell the life uniform segment under financial terms and conditions currently anticipated  the ability of the company to accomplish its strategy of re directing its resources to its healthcare linen management business in a timely and financially advantageous manner  unusual or unexpected cash needs for operations or capital transactions  the effectiveness of certain expense reduction initiatives  the ability to obtain financing in required amounts and at appropriate rates  the ability to identify  negotiate  fund and integrate acquisitions  and other factors which may be identified in the company s filings with the securities and exchange commission 
factors that may affect future results certain matters discussed in this form k or in other documents  a portion of which are incorporated herein by reference  constitute forward looking statements and are based upon management s expectations and beliefs concerning future events impacting the company 
there can be no assurance that these events will occur or that the company s results will be as estimated 
such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in these statements 
the following factors  as well as factors described elsewhere in this form k  or in other sec filings  could cause the company s future results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by  or on behalf of  the company 
such factors are described in accordance with the provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of  which encourages companies to disclose such factors 
competitive environment the company experiences significant competition in its major markets from its competitors 
the principal elements of competition include quality  reliability and price 
while many competitors are independent and privately owned  certain of the company s competitors are publicly owned and have greater financial and other resources 
in addition  in some markets  the company competes with smaller regional competitors with significant market share 
there can be no assurance that these competitors will not substantially increase the resources devoted to the development and marketing  including discounting  of products and services that compete with those offered by the company 
significant price competition could seriously harm the company s revenue  operating margins and market share 
cost of linens and textiles in the company s textile services business segment  the acquisition cost of linens and other textiles rented to customers comprises just under percent of the company s revenues 
during the past fiscal year  the cost of cotton increased approximately percent  and  like most commodities  is subject to regular fluctuation 
significant increases in the price of cotton could result in higher linen costs and  consequently  have an adverse effect on the company s earnings if the company is not successful in offsetting such increases through cost reduction efforts  prices for the company s services are not adjusted or if adjustments significantly trail the increases in linen costs 
utility and energy costs the company s operations utilize natural gas  electricity  gasoline and diesel fuel 
the company s energy purchases vary as to price  payment terms  quantities and timing 
the company s energy costs are also affected by various market factors including the availability of supplies of particular forms of energy  energy prices and local and national regulatory decisions 
there can be no assurance that the company will be fully protected against substantial changes in the price or availability of energy sources 
workers compensation costs the company is primarily self insured with respect to workers compensation costs 
self insurance liabilities are estimated using actuarial methods and historical data for payment patterns  cost trends and other relevant factors 
to the extent that actual liabilities resulting from the ultimate disposition of workers compensation claims exceed the amount of the company s reserve  the company s financial results could be negatively impacted 
collective bargaining agreements approximately two thirds of our hourly employees  principally at our laundry facilities  are represented by collective bargaining agreements with contracts that expire on varying dates 
additionally  unite formerly the union of needletrades  industrial and textile employees  the labor union that currently represents many of those employees  has recently initiated a corporate campaign targeting the company s non union facilities 
it is believed that the intent of this campaign is to persuade the company to recognize the union as the bargaining representative for the company s non union workers  without providing those workers the opportunity to vote  through a secret ballot election supervised by the us national labor relations board  as to whether or not they wish to be represented by unite 
the company has expended considerable resources resisting these efforts 
therefore  the company is at greater risk of work interruptions or stoppages than are non union competitors who are not the target of campaigns such as that undertaken against the company by unite 
any work interruptions or stoppages could significantly impact the company s operations 
in addition  the existence of collective bargaining agreements may limit or impair the company s ability to optimize production efficiencies and reduce labor costs 
labor costs direct and indirect labor costs  coupled with related fringe benefit costs  represent approximately percent of revenues of the textile services segment 
as wage rates  health insurance premiums and workers compensation costs increase  there can be no guarantee the company will be able to offset these increases with higher prices charged to its customers 
acquisitions and integration of acquired businesses the company s long term growth strategy depends  in part  on its ability to acquire and successfully integrate and operate additional businesses 
there can be no assurances that the company can successfully identify  negotiate  complete and integrate acquisitions 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to commodity price risk related to the use of natural gas in laundry plants of the textile services segment 
the total cost of natural gas in fiscal was million 
to reduce the uncertainty of fluctuating energy prices  the company has entered into fixed price contracts for approximately percent of the segment s estimated natural gas purchase requirements in the next months 
a hypothetical percent increase in the cost of natural gas not covered by these contracts would result in a reduction of approximately 
million in annual pretax earnings 
the company is also exposed to commodity price risk resulting from the consumption of gasoline and diesel fuel for delivery trucks in the textile services segment 
the total cost of truck fuel in fiscal was million 
a hypothetical percent increase in the cost of delivery fuel would result in a decrease of approximately 
million in annual pretax earnings 
the company s exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to its variable rate revolving debt agreement entered into in the second quarter of fiscal as of january   there was million of outstanding debt under the credit facility  of which million bears interest at a fixed rate of percent plus a margin under an interest rate swap agreement entered into by the company with one of its lenders to moderate the exposure 
amounts borrowed under the credit facility in excess of the million covered by the interest rate swap agreement bear interest at a rate equal to either i libor plus a margin  or ii a base rate  defined as the higher of a the federal funds rate plus 
percent or b the prime rate 
the margin is based on the company s ratio of funded debt to ebitda  as each is defined in the loan agreement 
as of january   the margin was percent 
a hypothetical increase of basis points in short term interest rates applicable to the outstanding debt not covered by the interest rate swap agreement would result in a reduction of approximately 
million in annual pretax earnings
