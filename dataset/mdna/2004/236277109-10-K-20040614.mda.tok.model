overview based on revenue  we are one of the largest independent providers of office imaging equipment  document solutions and related services and supplies in the united states and europe 
we offer a wide range of state of the art office imaging products  peripherals and solutions that primarily include digital and color copiers  digital and color mfps  facsimile machines and software 
we also provide a wide range of contract services  including professional and consulting services  maintenance  supplies  leasing arrangements  technical support and training on the installed base of equipment created primarily by our retail equipment and related sales 
we operate in countries and employ approximately  individuals 
since fiscal year  we focused our strategic efforts on positioning our business for profitable growth through the following initiatives introduced value added service offerings designed to generate revenue growth  including professional services  which provides consulting services to our customers to help them reduce print costs  optimize the use of their office imaging equipment and improve their employees 
table of contents productivity by integrating our proven software solutions to leverage their investment in their imaging equipment  and danka the desktop  our software solution designed to optimize the use of a customer s digital copiers  mfps and network printers by guiding the end users print jobs to the most efficient printing device  and techsource  which is our multi vendor services offering whereby we provide servicing for all of our customers office equipment  including traditional copiers and printers  facsimile machines  scanners  mfps  pcs  laptops  servers and network components 
in the us  completed the transition to a new enterprise resource planning system engineered by oracle  or the oracle erp system 
we expect the oracle erp system will allow us to improve our business and financial control systems  reduce our general and administrative expenses  more effectively track information concerning our customers and support our revenue growth initiatives 
in the second half of fiscal year  we formulated plans to significantly reduce our sg a costs by consolidating our back office functions in the united states  exiting non strategic real estate facilities and reducing headcount in the united states  europe and international businesses 
as part of these plans  we recorded a million restructuring charge in the third quarter of fiscal year that included million related to severance for employees and million related to future lease obligations for facilities that were vacated by december  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded a million restructuring charge that included million related to severance for employees and million related to future lease obligations for facilities that were vacated by march  as part of these cost reduction plans and other cost saving initiatives  the company expects to generate annual savings of approximately million to million  primarily resulting from headcount and facility reductions 
our reportable segments are united states  europe and international 
our reportable segments do not include the discontinued operations of danka services international or dsi 
with respect to our operations around the world that are experiencing difficulties  we continue to evaluate the viability and future prospects of these businesses 
further  should we decide to downsize or exit any of these businesses  we could incur costs in respect of severance and closure of facilities  and we may also be required to recognize cumulative translation losses that would reduce our earnings 
we disposed of our hungarian and polish operations in fiscal year critical accounting policies and estimates our management strives to report our financial results in a clear and understandable manner  even though in some cases accounting and disclosure rules are complex and require technical terminology 
we follow us generally accepted accounting principles in preparing our consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere herein  which require us to make certain estimates and apply judgments that affect our financial position and results of operations 
our management continually reviews our accounting policies including how they are applied and how they are reported and disclosed in our financial statements 
following is a summary of our critical accounting policies and how they are applied in the preparation of our financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts we provide an allowance on our accounts receivable for estimated losses 
our estimates are based upon the aging of our receivable accounts and expected credits to our customers due to billing disputes and inaccuracies 
if the financial condition of any of our customers were to deteriorate and result in the impairment of their ability to make payments to us or if actual credits exceed estimated credits  an additional allowance may be required 
subsequent to the implementation of our vision oracle erp system  we formulated a plan to validate the credits in our united states customer accounts from the legacy systems in the fourth quarter of fiscal year as part of this plan we issued account statements to some of our customers in the fourth quarter of fiscal year we anticipate that all customers will receive a statement by the end of the first quarter of fiscal year after allowing time for statement reconciliations  we will true up customers 
table of contents credit balances in the second quarter of fiscal year the following table summarizes our net accounts receivable 
as of in thousands march  march  accounts receivable allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable  net allowance for doubtful accounts as a of gross accounts receivable inventories we acquire inventory based on our projections of future demand and market conditions 
any unexpected decline in demand and or rapid product improvements or technological changes may cause us to have excess and or obsolete inventories 
the transition of our industry from analog to digital photocopiers has resulted in the obsolescence of some of our retail equipment  supplies and parts 
additional obsolescence could occur for some of our remaining retail equipment  supplies and parts  particularly as it relates to our kodak installed base  which is primarily analog 
we have provided appropriate reserves against these items in current and prior periods 
on an ongoing basis  we review for estimated obsolete or unmarketable inventories and write down our inventories to their estimated net realizable value based upon our forecasts of future demand and market conditions using historical trends and analysis 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than our forecasts due  in part  to a greater acceleration within the industry to digital office imaging equipment  additional inventory write downs may be required 
our estimates are influenced by a number of considerations including  but not limited to  the following decline in demand due to economic downturns  rapid product improvements and technological changes  and our ability to return to vendors a certain percentage of our purchases 
revenue recognition wholesale and retail equipment and related sales are recognized upon acceptance of delivery by the customer 
in the case of equipment sales financed by third party finance leasing companies or financed by us  retail equipment and related sales are recognized upon acceptance of delivery by the customer and credit acceptance by the finance leasing company or us  if later 
in addition  for the sale of certain digital equipment that requires a comprehensive setup by us before it can be used by a customer  such as a heidelberg or equivalent type of equipment  revenue is recognized upon acceptance of delivery and installation by the customer and written confirmation of installation by a company representative 
supply sales to customers are recognized at the time of shipment unless supply sales are included in a service contract  in which case supply sales are recognized upon equipment usage by the customer 
rental operating lease income is recognized straight line over the lease term 
retail service revenues  which includes techsource service contract revenues are generally recognized ratably over the term of the underlying maintenance contracts 
under the terms of the retail service contract  the customer is billed a flat periodic charge and or a usage based fee 
we record revenue for the flat periodic charge each period and for actual or estimated usage every period 
deferred income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we have to estimate our income and corporation taxes in each of the taxing jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax expense loss carryforwards together with assessing any temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of certain items  such as the timing for recognizing revenues and expenses for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences and loss carryforwards may result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary 
table of contents differences become deductible 
our past financial performance is a significant factor which contributes to our inability  pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas  to use projections of future taxable income in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets 
management therefore is limited to considering the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
due to the inability to use projections of future taxable income in making its assessment in most jurisdictions and changes in available tax planning strategies  management concluded that it is not more likely than not we will realize the benefits of the deferred tax assets at march  in most jurisdictions and  therefore  a valuation allowance has been recorded to reserve our deferred tax assets at march  in addition  we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions 
these audits can involve complex issues  which may require an extended period of time to resolve 
in management s opinion  adequate provisions for income and corporation taxes have been made for all years 
goodwill we review our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets annually for possible impairment  or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
separable intangible assets that have finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
we had goodwill of million as of march  if it is determined under statement of financial accounting standard no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas that our goodwill is impaired  we will be required to write down the value of such goodwill in amounts that could be material 
we performed our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year  under the requirements of sfas based on the results of that impairment test  no adjustments for impairment were necessary 
accounting for stock based compensation as permitted by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas we account for our stock option plans under the intrinsic value recognition and measurement principles of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
as the exercise price of all options granted under these plans was equal to the market price of the underlying common stock on the grant date  no stock based employee compensation cost is recognized in net earnings 
in general  these options expire in ten years and vest over three years 
the proceeds from options exercised are credited to shareholders equity deficit 
for disclosure purposes we compute the impact to earnings loss of stock based compensation using the black scholes option pricing model 
sfas requires the use of option pricing models that were not developed for use in valuing employee stock options 
the black scholes option pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of short lived exchange traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
in addition  option pricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the option s expected life and price volatility of the underlying stock 
because our stock options have characteristics significantly different from those traded options  and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate  in the opinion of management  the existing model does not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of employee stock options

fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenue in fiscal year  our revenue decreased by from fiscal year  with the united states segment decreasing  the european segment up and the international segment up 
our revenue for fiscal 
table of contents year was positively impacted by million of foreign currency movement of which europe contributed million and international contributed million 
the foreign currency benefit was percentage points for danka overall  percentage points for europe and percentage points for international 
our fiscal year retail equipment and related sales declined by in fiscal year from fiscal year  with the united states segment down  the european segment up and the international segment up 
the decline in the united states was due to turnover of sales staff and increasing competition 
the european and the international segments were also affected by increasing competition  but benefited from positive foreign currency benefits of percentage points for europe and percentage points for international 
our retail service revenue declined by in fiscal year from fiscal year with the united states segment down  the european segment up and the international segment down 
the overall decrease was due to the continuing industry wide conversion from analog to digital equipment 
partially offsetting the overall revenue decline was a foreign currency benefit of percentage points for europe and percentage points for international 
our retail supplies and rentals revenue declined by in fiscal year from fiscal year with the united states segment down  the european segment up and the international segment up 
the overall decrease was primarily due to the past downsizing of the capital intensive united states and european rental businesses 
partially offsetting the overall revenue decline was a foreign currency benefit of percentage points for europe and percentage points for international 
the decline in our revenue was primarily due to the following factors the transition in our industry from analog to digital products and the resulting lower retail placements and reduced machines in field or mifs  increased competition as a result of technology convergence  such as the advent of mfp s  and an increase in the migration of copy volume from copiers to network printers  and weaker global economic conditions which resulted in reduced or delayed capital spending by customers 
our fiscal year wholesale revenue increased from fiscal year this increase was primarily due to the positive impact of million of foreign currency movements partially offset by declines in revenue due to increasing competition 
gross profit for fiscal year  our consolidated gross profit decreased from fiscal year our consolidated gross profit margin decreased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year the primary reasons for the decrease in our consolidated gross profit margin were due to a shift in the mix of our sales toward lower margin  large enterprise accounts in the united states  lower margins for our retail supplies and rental activity and a decrease in united states equipment leasing income of million related to lease and residual equipment payments from a diminishing external lease funding program which contributed million to gross margins in the year ago period 
the gross profit margin for the united states segment decreased to from while the european segment decreased to from and the international segment increased to from 
the total and international gross profit percentage for the year ago period was adversely affected by a million charge that consisted primarily of write downs of inventory and residual values in canada 
retail equipment margins decreased to for fiscal year from for fiscal year  due to a shift in the mix of our sales toward lower margin equipment sales and lower lease and residual payments in the united states 
retail service margins were essentially flat 
retail supplies and rental margins decreased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year  decreases in our european and international segments were 
table of contents offset in part by improvements in the united states 
wholesale margins increased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year primarily due to higher margin transactions in the current year 
selling  general and administrative our selling  general and administrative expenses  or sg a  declined in fiscal year from fiscal year due to progress in the implementation of our worldwide restructuring program and million of one time pension adjustments in our european segment 
as a percentage of total revenue  sg a expenses were essentially flat in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year restructuring charges credits in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year  we formulated plans to significantly reduce our sg a costs by consolidating our back office functions in the united states  exiting non strategic real estate facilities and reducing headcount in the united states  europe and international businesses 
as part of those plans  we recorded a million restructuring charge in fiscal year that included million related to severance for employees and million related to future lease obligations for facilities 
the fiscal year restructuring charges were partially offset by a million reversal of prior years restructuring charges 
other income expense other income expense was million of expense in fiscal year versus million of income in fiscal year this change was primarily due to a million foreign exchange gain in fiscal year versus a million gain in fiscal year operating earnings loss from continuing operations the operating loss from continuing operations was million in fiscal year versus earnings of million in fiscal year the decline in the operating loss was due to the million restructuring charge and the million reduction in gross profit

interest income was flat at million 
income taxes our income tax expense was million for fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year the effective income tax rate was negative for fiscal year compared to for fiscal year the change in the effective tax rate is primarily due to the increase in the valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets

the participating shares are entitled to dividends equal to the greater of per annum or ordinary share dividends on an as converted basis 
dividends are cumulative and are paid in the form of additional participating shares through december at that time  we will be obliged to pay the participating share dividends in cash 
however  the terms of the participating shares permit us to continue to pay payment in kind dividends following december  if our then existing principal indebtedness  which includes our new credit facility and debt securities issued in an aggregate principal amount in excess of million in a bona fide underwritten public or private offering  prohibits us from paying cash dividends 
further  if we are not permitted by the terms of the participating shares to pay payment in kind dividends following 
table of contents december  and we have insufficient distributable reserves under english law to pay cash dividends  the amount of any unpaid dividend will be added to the liquidation return of each participating share 
the participating shares are currently convertible into ordinary shares at a conversion price of per ordinary share equal to per ads  subject to adjustment in certain circumstances to avoid dilution of the interests of participating shareholders

if the price set out in b above is applicable  we are permitted to convert the participating shares into the number of ordinary shares into which they are convertible instead of making the cash payment 
if our senior convertible participating shares do not convert into ordinary shares by december   we will be required to satisfy the liquidation value for the participating shares on that date of million 
that satisfaction combined with the million of senior notes that come due in june  make it likely that we will either pursue financing arrangements to satisfy such requirements or seek to modify such requirements 
in the event of liquidation of danka  participating shareholders will be entitled to receive a distribution equal to the greater of a the liquidation return per share initially  and subject to upward adjustment on certain default events by us plus any accumulated and unpaid dividends accumulating from the most recent dividend date and b the amount that would have been payable on each participating share if it had been converted into ordinary shares if the market value of those shares exceed the liquidation value of the participating shares

at this time  we have insufficient  accumulated realized profits to pay dividends to shareholders

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the principal market risks ie the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices to which we are exposed include foreign exchange risk and interest rates on debt 
interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk primarily on our fleet credit facility and our abn credit facility 
we have fixed interest rates on our senior and subordinated notes 
our exposure to interest rate risk primarily relates to our fleet and abn credit facilities 
we estimate that a change in interest rates would not have a material impact on our results of operations for the fleet credit facility bears interest at an annual rate equal to  at our option  a the sum of the rate of interest publicly announced from time to time by fleet national bank as its prime or base rate of interest plus the applicable margin thereon or b the sum of libor for interest periods at our option of one  two  three or six months plus the applicable margin thereon 
the applicable interest rate margin on loans for which interest is calculated by reference to the base or prime rate  or base rate loans  will range from to per annum  and the applicable interest rate margin on loans for which interest is calculated by reference to the libor rate  or libor rate loans  will range from to per annum  in each case based on average adjusted availability  or availability under the fleet credit facility plus cash 
the abn credit facility bears interest at an annual rate equal to abn s euro base rate plus 
as of march   we did not have a balance outstanding under either of the credit facilities discussed above 
abn s euro base rate as of march  was approximately foreign currency exchange risk operating in international markets involves exposure to the possibility of volatile movements in foreign exchange rates 
these exposures may impact future earnings and or cash flows 
revenue from foreign locations primarily europe  canada  south america  central america and australia represented approximately of our consolidated revenue in the economic impact of foreign exchange rate movements is complex because such changes are often linked to variability in real growth  inflation  interest rates  governmental actions and other factors 
these changes  if material  could cause us to adjust our financing and operating strategies 
therefore  to soley isolate the effect of changes in currency does not accurately portray the effect of these other important economic factors 
as foreign exchange rates change  translation of the income statements of our international subsidiaries into us dollars affects year over year comparability of operating results 
while we may hedge specific transaction risks  we generally do not hedge translation risks because we believe there is no long term economic benefit in doing so 
at march   we had no outstanding forward contracts or option contracts to buy or sell foreign currency 
for the three year period ended march   there were no gains or losses included in our consolidated statements of operations on forward contracts and option contracts 

table of contents assets and liabilities are matched in the local currency  which reduces the need for dollar conversion 
any foreign currency impact on translating assets and liabilities into dollars is included as a component of shareholders equity 
our revenue results for fiscal year were positively impacted by a million foreign currency movement  primarily due to the strengthening of the euro and the united kingdom pound against the dollar 
changes in foreign exchange rates that had the largest impact on translating our international operating profits for related to the euro and the british pound versus the us dollar 
we estimate that a adverse change in foreign exchange rates would have decreased our revenues by approximately million in  assuming no changes other than the exchange rate itself 
as discussed above  this quantitative measure has inherent limitations 
further  the sensitivity analysis disregards the possibility that rates can move in opposite directions and that gains from one currency may or may not be offset by losses from another currency 
seasonality we have experienced some seasonality in our business 
our european and canadian operations have historically experienced lower revenue for the second quarter of our fiscal year  which is the three month period ended september th 
this is primarily due to increased vacation time by european and canadian residents during july and august 
this has historically resulted in reduced sales activity and reduced usage of photocopiers  facsimiles and other office imaging equipment during that period 
market risk our market risk is primarily limited to fluctuations in interest rates as it pertains to our borrowings under our credit facilities while the senior notes and the subordinated notes bear a fixed rate
