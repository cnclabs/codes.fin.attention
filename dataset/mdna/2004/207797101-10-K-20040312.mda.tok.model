part i item business the company the registrant  connecticut water service  inc referred to as the company  we or our was organized in connecticut water service  inc is a non operating holding company  whose income is derived from the earnings of its eleven wholly owned subsidiary companies 
in approximately of the company s earnings were attributable to water activities carried out within its five regulated water companies the connecticut water company  the gallup water service  incorporated  the crystal water company of danielson  the barnstable water company and the unionville water company 
these five companies supply water to  customers in towns throughout connecticut and massachusetts 
each of these companies is subject to state regulation regarding financial issues  rates  and operating issues  and to various other state and federal regulatory agencies concerning water quality and environmental standards 
in addition to its regulated utilities  the company owns six unregulated companies chester realty  inc  a real estate company in connecticut  new england water utility services  inc  which provides contract water and sewer operations and other water related services  connecticut water emergency services  inc  a provider of drinking and pool water by tanker truck  crystal water utilities corporation  a holding company which owns the crystal water company of danielson and three small rental properties  barlaco  a real estate company in massachusetts  and barnstable holding company  a holding company which owns the barnstable water company and barlaco 
in  these unregulated companies  in conjunction with the regulated water companies  contributed the remaining of the company s earnings through real estate transactions as well as services and rentals

our regulated business our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations and weather variations 
the demand for water is generally greater during the warmer months than the cooler months due to customers high water consumption related to cooling systems and various outdoor uses such as private and public swimming pools and lawn sprinklers 
demand will vary with rainfall and temperature levels from year to year and season to season  particularly during the warmer months 
in general  the profitability of the water utility industry is largely dependent on the timeliness and adequacy of rates allowed by utility regulatory commissions 
in addition  profitability is affected by numerous factors over which we have little or no control  such as costs to comply with security  environmental  and water quality regulations 
inflation and other factors also impact costs for construction  materials and personnel related expenses 
costs to comply with environmental and water quality regulations are substantial 
since the enactment of the safe drinking water act we have spent approximately  in constructing facilities and conducting aquifer mapping necessary to comply with the requirements of the safe drinking water act  and other federal and state regulations  of which  was expended in the last five years 
we are presently in compliance with current regulations  but the regulations are subject to change at any time 
the costs to comply with future changes in state or federal regulations  which could require us to modify existing filtration facilities and or construct new ones  or to replace any reduction of the safe yield from any of our current sources of supply  could be substantial 
our water companies derive their rights and franchises to operate from special state acts that are subject to alteration  amendment or repeal and do not grant us exclusive rights to our service areas 
our franchises are free from burdensome restrictions  are unlimited as to time  and authorize us to sell potable water in all the towns we now serve 
there is the possibility that a state could revoke our franchises and allow a governmental entity to take over some or all of our systems 
from time to time such legislation is contemplated 

table of contents the rates we charge our water customers are established under the jurisdiction of and are approved by a state regulatory agency 
it is our policy to seek rate relief as necessary to enable us to achieve an adequate rate of return 
the following table shows information related to each of our water companies most recent general rate filing 
date of last allowed allowed rate return on return on decision equity rate base barnstable connecticut water crystal gallup n a n a unionville n a gallup s rates were based on its net income requirement  not on a rate of return methodology 
unionville s rates were based on a return on equity methodology  not a rate base methodology 
beginning mid  unionville began imposing a surcharge on its customers water bills to recover financing and operating costs related to the construction and use of a water interconnection with a neighboring water supplier 
annually the surcharge is subject to a retroactive refund to ratepayers if total revenue for unionville exceeds certain stipulated amounts 
as part of the decision authorizing the surcharge  the connecticut department of public utility control also limited the conditions upon which unionville may seek a rate increase prior to september  our water systems our water infrastructure consists of noncontiguous water systems in the state of connecticut and one water system in massachusetts 
our system  in total  consists of  miles of water main and reservoir storage capacity of billion gallons 
the safe  dependable yield from our active wells and reservoirs is approximately million gallons per day 
water sources vary among the individual systems  but overall approximately of the total dependable yield comes from reservoirs and from wells 
we supply water  and in most cases  fire protection to all or portions of towns in connecticut and massachusetts 
the following table lists the customer count  operating revenues and customer water consumption for each of our water companies as of december  number water customer water of revenues consumption water company customers s millions of gallons barnstable water company connecticut water company crystal water company gallup water service unionville water company total 
table of contents the following table breaks down the above total figures by customer class water customer water number of revenues consumption customer class customers s millions of gallons residential commercial industrial public authority fire protection other including non metered accounts total disposition of property our water companies own various small  discrete parcels of land that are no longer required for water supply purposes 
at december  this land totaled approximately acres 
over the past years we have been slowly disposing of such excess land 
the largest transaction to date has been the donation of land by the crystal water company to the town of killingly for protected open space purposes over a three year period  in january  the final parcel of land was transferred to the town 
over the three year period the following acreage was donated to the town under this agreement year acres after tax profit primarily due to a connecticut corporate tax credit  which was legislatively enacted in  the donation of land for protected open space purposes results in a greater after tax profit to the company than a sale of the land would provide 
future disposition of land by our connecticut regulated water companies is limited by the memorandum of understanding that the company entered into with the connecticut department of environmental protection on december  see moratorium on land sales in the commitments and contingencies section of item of this form k 
we also have a limited amount of land held by our unregulated companies 
included in this category is approximately acres of land held by barlaco inc  which we acquired in february in conjunction with the company s acquisition of the barnstable holding company 

table of contents competition our water companies face competition  presently not material  from a few private water systems operating within  or adjacent to  their franchise areas and from municipal and public authority systems whose service areas in some cases overlap portions of our water companies franchise areas 
employees as of december   we employed a total of persons 
our employees are not covered by collective bargaining agreements 
we believe that our relations with our employees are good 
segments of our business for management purposes we divide our business into three business segments water activities  real estate transactions  and services and rentals 
the water activities segment is comprised of our core regulated water activities to supply public drinking water to our customers 
this segment encompasses all transactions of all our regulated companies with the exception of real estate transactions and service and rental activities 
our real estate transactions segment involves the sale or donation for income tax benefits of our limited excess real estate holdings 
these transactions can be effected by either our regulated or unregulated companies 
a breakdown of the net profits of this segment between our regulated and unregulated companies for the past three years is as follows net income from real estate transactions regulated unregulated total our services and rentals segment provides contracted services to water and wastewater utilities and other clients and also leases certain of our properties to third parties 
both our regulated and unregulated companies offer these transactions 
the types of services provided include contract operations of water and wastewater facilities  linebacker  our service line protection plan for public drinking water customers  and providing bulk deliveries of emergency drinking water to businesses and residences via tanker truck 
our lease and rental income comes primarily from telecommunication antennas placed on our water storage tanks by telecommunication companies  as well as from the renting of residential and commercial property 

table of contents some of the services listed above  including the service line protection plan and antenna leases  have little or no competition 
but there can be considerable competition for contract operations of large water and wastewater facilities and systems 
however  we have sought to develop a niche market by seeking to serve smaller facilities and systems in our service areas where there is less competition 
the services and rentals segment  while relatively new and a small portion of our overall business  has grown significantly over the past five years and now provide nearly eight percent of our overall net income 
the table below describes the net profits generated by this segment of our business from our regulated and unregulated companies for the past three years net income from real estate transactions regulated unregulated total item properties the properties of our water companies consist of land  easements  rights including water rights  buildings  reservoirs  standpipes  dams  wells  supply lines  treatment plants  pumping plants  transmission and distribution mains and conduits  mains and other facilities and equipment used for the collection  purification  storage and distribution of water 
although  our regulated water companies own their principal properties in fee  substantially all of the properties owned by barnstable water  connecticut water  crystal water and unionville water companies are subject to liens as security for outstanding debt 
in addition  in certain cases  our water companies are parties to limited contractual arrangements for the provision of water supply from neighboring utilities 
we believe that our properties are in good operating condition 
water mains are located  for the most part  in public streets and  in a few instances  are located on land that we own in fee and land utilized pursuant to easement right  most of which are perpetual and adequate for the purpose for which they are held 
the net utility plant balances of the water companies at december  were as follows net utility plant barnstable connecticut water crystal gallup unionville total 
table of contents sources of water supply owned  maintained  and operated by our regulated water companies include eighteen reservoirs and fifty five well fields 
in addition  connecticut water has an agreement with the metropolitan district commission mdc a public water and sewer authority presently serving the city of hartford and portions of surrounding towns  which provides  among other things  for the operation and maintenance by mdc of a filtration plant to supply up to  gallons of treated water per day for connecticut water s collinsville system 
collectively  these sources have the capacity to deliver approximately fifty one million gallons of potable water daily to the sixteen major operating systems in the following table 
in addition to the principal systems identified  our regulated water companies own  maintain  and operate fifteen small  non interconnected satellite and consecutive water systems that  combined have the ability to deliver about one million gallons of additional water per day to their respective systems 
for some small consecutive water systems  purchased water may comprise substantially all of the total available supply of the system 
our regulated water companies own and operate fifteen water filtration facilities  having a combined treatment capacity of approximately million gallons per day 
of these facilities  twelve are owned by connecticut water  two by unionville water  and one by crystal water 
gallup and barnstable water do not have  or require  water filtration facilities 
the companies estimated available water supply  not including water purchases or non principal systems  is as follows estimated available supply million gallons per day barnstable connecticut water guilford system chester system naugatuck system terryville system thomaston system collinsville system northern western system somers system stafford system crystal danielson system plainfield system thompson system kip system gallup unionville total as of december   the transmission and distribution systems of our five water companies consisted of approximately  miles of main 
on that date  approximately percent of our mains were eight inch diameter or larger 
substantially all new main installations are cement lined ductile iron pipe of eight inch diameter or larger 

table of contents the size of each company s system s in terms of miles of mains is as follows miles of transmission and distribution water mains barnstable water connecticut water crystal gallup unionville total we believe that our properties are maintained in good condition and in accordance with current regulations and standards of good waterworks industry practice 
item legal proceedings we are involved in various legal proceedings from time to time 
although the results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty  there are no pending legal proceedings to which we  or any of our subsidiaries are a party  or to which any of our properties is subject  that presents a reasonable likelihood of a material adverse impact on the company

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial condition overview the company is a non operating holding company  whose income is derived from the earnings of its eleven wholly owned subsidiary companies 
in  approximately of the company s earnings were attributable to water activities carried out within its five regulated water companies the connecticut water company  the gallup water service  incorporated  the crystal water company of danielson  the barnstable water company and the unionville water company 
over of this water activity income comes from the connecticut water company connecticut water our largest subsidiary and water company 
connecticut water has not had an increase in its rates since primarily due to the construction of six major water treatment plants during the late s and throughout the s  our overall investment in gross utility plant increased by  or  from to which resulted in our water rates being amongst the highest in connecticut 
in we began developing opportunities to increase revenues and earnings without raising regulated water rates 
through these efforts we have successfully increased our consolidated earnings each year since without increasing water rates  and  continued increasing our common dividend payments per share during this period 
we believe that it is likely that we will have to seek regulatory approval to increase rates charged at some or all of our regulated water companies during the next years 
the material factors that will affect our decision to consider rate increases in the next years are expected increases in infrastructure investment are necessary to insure a safe  reliable water system remains in place  modest historical and projected annual growth in regulated water sales of approximately  and  increases in operating costs such as wage  pension  medical and insurance costs 
on a year to year basis our earnings are primarily influenced by weather patterns that affect our customers water usage and thereby our revenues 
our revenues may fluctuate by as much as million or over or under a normal year because customers use more water in hot  dry years and less water in cool  rainy years 
regulatory matters and inflation the company  like all other businesses  is affected by inflation  most notably by the continually increasing costs required to maintain  improve and expand its service capabilities 
the cumulative effect of inflation over time results in significantly higher operating costs and facility replacement costs  which must be recovered from future cash flows 

table of contents our water companies are also subject to environmental and water quality regulations 
costs to comply with environmental and water quality regulations are substantial 
we are currently in compliance with current regulations  but the regulations are subject to change at any time 
the costs to comply with future changes in state or federal regulations  which could require us to modify current filtration facilities and or construct new ones  or to replace any reduction of the safe yield from any of our current sources of supply  could be substantial 
our water companies ability to recover their increased expenses and or investment in utility plant is dependent on the regulatory rates they charge their customers 
changes to these rates must be approved by the appropriate regulatory authority through formal rate proceedings 
the rates of our four connecticut based water companies are regulated by the connecticut department of public utility control and our massachusetts water company s rates are regulated by the massachusetts department of telecommunications and energy 
due to the subjectivity of certain items involved in the process of establishing rates such as future customer growth  inflation and allowed return on investment  we have no assurance that our water companies will be able to raise their rates to a level we consider appropriate  or to raise their rates at all  through any future rate proceeding 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america gaap and as directed by the regulatory commissions to which the company s subsidiaries are subject 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our significant accounting policies 
the company believes the following policies and estimates are critical to the presentation of its consolidated financial statements 
public utility regulation statement of financial accounting standards financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation fas  requires cost based  rate regulated enterprises such as the company s water companies to reflect the impact of regulatory decisions in their financial statements 
the state regulators  through the rate regulation process  can create regulatory assets that result when costs are allowed for ratemaking purposes in a period after the period in which costs would be charged to expense by an unregulated enterprise 
the balance sheet includes regulatory assets and liabilities as appropriate  primarily related to income taxes and post retirement benefit costs 
the company believes  based on current regulatory circumstances  that the regulatory assets recorded are likely to be recovered and that its use of regulatory accounting is appropriate and in accordance with the provisions of fas material regulatory assets are earning a return 
revenue recognition revenue from metered customers includes billings to customers based on quarterly meter readings plus an estimate of water used between the customer s last meter reading and the end of the accounting period 
the unbilled revenue amount is listed as a current asset on the balance sheet 
the amount recorded as unbilled revenue is generally higher during the summer months when water sales are higher 
based upon historical experience  management believes the company s estimate of unbilled revenues is reasonable 

table of contents pension plan accounting the discount rate assumption we use to value our pension benefit obligations has a material impact on the amount of pension expense we record in a given period 
our and pension expense was calculated using assumed discount rates of and  respectively 
in our pension expense will be calculated with an assumed discount rate of 
the following shows how much a one percent change in our assumed discount rate would have changed our reported pension expenses increase decrease in expense a increase in the discount rate a decrease in the discount rate outlook the company s profitability is primarily attributable to the sale and distribution of water  the amount of which is dependent on seasonal weather fluctuations  particularly during the summer months when water demand will vary with rainfall and temperature levels 
after the terrorist strike on september   water companies have had to increase security on their water supplies and facilities 
this has resulted in increases in operating and capital costs related to security  which are typically recoverable in a rate proceeding 
financial condition liquidity and capital resources in recent years  we have attempted to limit our investment in utility plant to the amount of funds generated from our consolidated operations 
under this policy  the company has not been required to significantly increase its long term debt obligations in order to fund its annual construction program 
the following table shows the total construction expenditures for each of the last three years and what we expect to invest on construction projects in construction gross funded by construction construction developers funded by expenditures others company projected 
table of contents we currently fund our working capital requirements through our lines of credit with three banks  which provide liquidity to satisfy ongoing cash needs 
we consider the current aggregate  lines of credit to be adequate to finance any expected short term borrowing requirements that may arise in all the lines have one year lives and will expire at different dates in we expect to renew the lines in the interest rates payable are variable and fluctuate over time based on financial conditions 
the weighted average interest rate on the  balance outstanding at december  was 
during interest rates fell to historically low levels 
we took advantage of the low rates and refinanced a portion of our long term debt in the fourth quarter of on october   connecticut water borrowed million from the issuance of water facilities refunding revenue bonds by the connecticut development authority 
the bonds were sold in two series with the following terms a series  non amt c series  amt maturing maturing the proceeds of the transaction were used to redeem the series r and s first mortgage bonds of connecticut water company and paid for a portion of the expenses associated with the issuance 
during the first quarter of  connecticut water refinanced an additional portion of its long term debt through the issuance of  of variable rate  taxable debenture bonds series with a maturity date of january  the bonds have been secured by an irrevocable direct pay letter of credit issued by a financial institution  with a five year term expiring in march the proceeds of the sale of the bonds  which are general debt obligations of connecticut water  will be used to redeem the  aggregate principal amount of connecticut water s first mortgage bonds series v and to pay a portion of the expenses associated with the bonds refunding 
in connection with the issuance of the bonds  connecticut water entered into an interest rate swap transaction with a counterparty in the notional principal amount of  the interest rate swap agreement provides that  beginning in april and thereafter on a monthly basis  connecticut water will pay the counterparty a fixed interest rate of on the notional amount for a period of five years 
in exchange  the counterparty will  beginning in april and thereafter on a monthly basis  pay connecticut water a floating interest rate based on of the us dollar one month libor rate on the notional amount for a period of five years 
the purpose of the interest rate swap is to manage the company s exposure to fluctuations in prevailing interest rates 
during the first six months of  unionville expects to secure million through the drinking water state revolving fund for costs incurred in developing a water interconnection with a neighboring water supplier 
the funds will be used to pay off a portion of the balances outstanding under bank lines of credit 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations we do not use off balance sheet arrangements such as securitization of receivables with any unconsolidated entities or other parties 
the company does not engage in trading or risk management activities and does not have material transactions involving related parties other than the interest rate swap agreement discussed above 
the following table summarizes the company s future contractual cash obligations as of december  payments due by periods in thousands of dollars less more than years years than contractual obligations total year and years long term debt operating lease obligations purchase obligations total includes long and short term capital purchase obligations 
purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on the registrant and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities  fixed minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
interim bank loans payable at year end was  which is  higher than at the end of during  the company incurred approximately million of construction expenditures 
the company financed such expenditures through internally generated funds  customers advances  contributions in aid of construction and short term borrowings 
the board of directors has approved an million construction budget for  net of amounts to be financed by customer advances and contributions in aid of construction 
funds primarily provided by operating activities are expected to finance this entire construction program given normal weather patterns and related operating revenue billings 
refer to note  utility plant and construction program  in notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of the company s future construction program 
results of operations overview of results earnings for were higher than due to increased profits in our real estate and services and rentals business segments  which more than offset a reduction in profits from our water activities segment 

table of contents the profits generated by the real estate segment increased from primarily because the most valuable parcel of the three parcels being donated to the town of killingly  ct over a three year period was donated in the net profits tax benefits by year from donations under this agreement are donated in january  the net profits generated from the services and rental segment increased by from in  we increased the profit margins generated by our service contract operations  increased customer enrollment in our service line maintenance program and increased the number of leases we have with telecommunications companies that lease space on our water storage tanks for their antenna sites 
we have been working hard to grow this segment of the business and are optimistic that we can continue to do so 
our net profits and growth rates for this segment over the last thee years are services and rental increased net profit over prior year increase earnings from our core water activities segment declined in the unusually rainy and cool weather experienced during caused our customers on average to use less water than they would normally use 
operating revenues overall were approximately million lower in than they would have been in a normal weather year 
this segment also experienced a increase in operation and maintenance expense in in addition to picking up additional months of expenses associated with unionville  which was acquired on october   this segment experienced higher wages  medical  pension  insurance  and power costs 
there was also a higher than normal incidence of weather related main breaks in addition to the normal increases in depreciation and property tax expense related to the company s increased investment in utility plant 
somewhat offsetting these negative impacts on earnings was a increase in the number of utility customers plus a lower effective income tax rate due to book tax timing differences  lower pre tax income and a reduction in estimated tax liabilities associated with non current periods 

table of contents results on a comparable basis because we acquired unionville on october   and because we accounted for the acquisition of unionville under the purchase method of accounting  our consolidated income statements include different amounts of unionville operating results in years  and number of months of unionville operating results to assist us and our investors in analyzing operating results by income statement line  company management internally looks at our consolidated results without unionville to measure performance on a comparable company basis

moratorium on land sales on december   the company entered into a memorandum of understanding mou with the state of connecticut department of environmental protection dep 
the mou provides for a voluntary two year moratorium on the sale of approximately  acres of undeveloped class i  ii  and iii water company lands held by the company s connecticut water company subsidiaries 
class i and ii water company lands  as defined by public health code regulations  are those that are within the watershed or drainage area of a public water supply 
class iii lands are those that are not located within the watershed 
under the terms of the mou  the dep in cooperation with the company s connecticut water companies will assess and evaluate all undeveloped class i  ii and iii land holdings to determine the desirability of the state of connecticut s acquiring the land for open space and to develop strategies to fund the acquisitions of such properties in fee or by easement from the company

these forward looking statements are based on current information and expectations  and are subject to risks and uncertainties  which could cause the company s actual results to differ materially from expected results 
our water companies are subject to various federal and state regulatory agencies concerning water quality and environmental standards 
generally  the water industry is materially dependent on the adequacy of approved rates to allow for a fair rate of return on the investment in utility plant 
the ability to maintain our operating costs at the lowest possible level  while providing good quality water service  is beneficial to customers and stockholders 
profitability is also dependent on the timeliness of rate relief  when necessary  and numerous factors over which we have little or no control  such as the quantity of rainfall and temperature  industrial demand  financing costs  energy rates  tax rates  and stock market trends which may affect the return earned on pension assets  and compliance with environmental and water quality regulations
