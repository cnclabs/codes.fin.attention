item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction the company designs  manufactures and markets radiators  radiator cores  heater cores  air conditioning parts including condensers  compressors  accumulators and evaporators and other heat transfer products for the automotive and light truck aftermarket 
in addition  the company designs  manufactures and distributes radiators  radiator cores  charge air coolers  oil coolers and other specialty heat exchangers for original equipment manufacturers oems of heavy trucks and industrial and off highway equipment and the heavy duty heat exchanger aftermarket 
the company is organized into two strategic business groups based upon the type of customer served automotive and light truck and heavy duty 
management evaluates the performance of its reportable segments based upon operating income loss before taxes as well as cash flow from operations which reflects operating results and asset management 
in order to evaluate market trends and changes  management utilizes a variety of economic and industry data including miles driven by vehicles  average age of vehicles  gasoline usage and pricing and automotive and light truck vehicle population data 
in the heavy duty segment  we also utilize class and truck production data and industrial and off highway equipment production 
management looks to grow the business through a combination of internal growth  including the addition of new customers and new products  and strategic acquisitions 
at the end of  the company acquired certain assets of fedco automotive components company 
this acquisition strengthened our position in the heater core market  provided the company with a new major customer  provided the capability for in house production of aluminum heaters and allowed us to maximize the benefits generated by the in house production of copper brass heaters at our mexican plant 
during  the company completed the million restructuring program that it had commenced during the third quarter of the program was designed around business initiatives to improve the company s operating performance  including the redesign of our distribution system  headcount reductions  the transfer of production between manufacturing facilities and a reevaluation of our product offerings 
the company also added approximately million of new restructuring programs in to include the relocation of fedco s inventory and machinery to mexico and salaried headcount reductions made in order to lower overall operating costs 
total restructuring and other special charges  including amounts charged to cost of sales  of million  million and million were recorded during  and  respectively 
while the company has begun to see benefits from these initiatives in its results  management believes that they will serve as a foundation for improvements expected in results of operations comparison of year ended december  to for the year ended december   net sales were million  lower than the million reported in sales for the automotive and light truck sbg were million  compared with net sales of million in the same period last year 
heat exchanger product sales were above last year as the impact of the acquisition of fedco and the impact of new customer programs were partially offset by changes in customer mix  ongoing pricing pressure  a soft and shorter selling season and a decline in unit volume as many of our major customers took actions to lower their own inventory levels 
net sales of our temperature control products were below a year ago as the impact of several new customer programs were more than offset by an unseasonably short selling season and changes in customer buying habits caused by their inventory reduction efforts 
as we believe we have not lost any significant business with the major customer group of our automotive and light truck segment  it is anticipated that should benefit from a return to normal customer buying habits more in line with their product sell through 
heavy duty sbg sales in of million were below the million reported last year 
heavy duty oem product sales were below those for the full year  reflecting declines experienced during the first three quarters of due to the phase out of certain oem programs during the fourth quarter of and higher customer purchase levels in in anticipation of changes in emission regulations which became effective in the fourth quarter of in the fourth quarter of  heavy duty oem sales were above the same period a year ago primarily due to the impact of new customer programs with monaco coach and other existing customers 
heavy duty aftermarket sales for the full year were below those of this decline reflects the continued softness in all markets served by these products and a declining demand for certain product categories 
it is anticipated that heavy duty oem sales will benefit from new customer programs  which have been announced  while the heavy duty aftermarket will make new product introductions in an effort to continue strengthening this business unit 
gross margins  as a percentage of sales  were in compared to in excluding the million of restructuring charges recorded in gross margin in  which were associated with the closure of a manufacturing plant in maquoketa  iowa  the gross margin percentage would have been 
the year over year decline in the gross margin percentage was primarily the result of production cutbacks instituted at the automotive and light truck heat exchanger plants 
these cutbacks resulted in higher actual inventory costs at the end of  which translated into an approximately million reduction in gross margin as the products were sold during the first quarter of start up problems with our new aluminum tube mill during the first half of  along with an increase in price competition and changes in customer mix  also adversely impacted margins for the year 
in addition  during the fourth quarter of  production at our temperature control plant was significantly cut back in response to the shorter than normal air conditioning components selling season  resulting in lower margins due to unabsorbed overhead costs 
these items offset the favorable impacts of the company s cost reduction activities  which have resulted in lower product costs 
the cost reductions implemented during should translate into a year over year improvement in gross margins during the first quarter of selling  general and administrative expenses in of million were million below the prior year 
as a percentage of sales  expenses in were compared to in expenses of fedco incurred during the first quarter of  prior to the completion of the integration program and higher levels of costs for major system improvements  have been offset by benefits of the company s cost reduction initiatives along with incentive and other expense reductions reflecting the current market conditions and the company s financial results 
in  the company completed its million restructuring program  which started in initiatives during included the closure of two regional heavy duty aftermarket plants in north kansas city  missouri and phoenix  arizona  and the closure of the charlotte  north carolina branch facility 
during  the company also added programs  totaling million for the relocation of fedco copper brass inventory and machinery to mexico and a cost reduction program of salaried headcount reductions 
the salaried headcount reduction actions taken during the last three quarters of are expected to lower spending levels by approximately million on an annualized basis 
the company has already seen in its results some of the impacts of completed actions under the restructuring programs 
future benefits from these actions will be dependent on business conditions

this accelerated collection was done in an effort to offset the continuing trend towards longer customer payment terms by blue chip customers  at a cost effective discount rate 
the company anticipates that more of its major customers will make available this type of program during inventory levels grew million due to the soft market conditions experienced for most of the year  which included a shorter than normal peak selling season for heat exchanger and air conditioning products 
in addition  the higher inventory levels reflected the purchase of a competitor s inventory from a major customer during the fourth quarter and the requirement to build inventory in anticipation of new automotive and light truck customer programs expected to commence in early accounts payable rose by million as a result of the growth in inventory levels as well as our effort to balance payables with the ongoing shift in customer receivables mix toward longer payment cycles 
during  operations used million of cash 
accounts receivable grew by million during the period due to higher sales levels approximately million  extended terms on the new customer business added during the year approximately million and an ongoing shift in receivables mix toward longer payment cycles with blue chip customers approximately million 
these increases were partially offset by improved collections 
while these customers generally all have high grade credit  the company will be seeking ways to improve its performance in this area 
net inventories rose million as the company was unable to offset the higher inventory levels at the end of the third quarter  caused by increased sales  extra purchases of certain difficult to obtain inventory and the west coast dock strike  through cutback actions taken during the fourth quarter 
while these cutbacks in production levels and incoming receipts of finished product resulted in a year over year improvement in inventory turns to  they also resulted in a higher cost of production which adversely impacted results in the first quarter of as the product was sold 
in december  the company contributed an additional million to its pension trust in order to reduce the impact on shareholders equity from the minimum pension adjustment 
these outflows were partially offset by funds provided from operations and an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
during  the company generated million of cash flow from operations  principally due to lower inventories  which generated million of cash  while accounts receivable collections generated million despite ongoing pressures from customers to adjust payment terms 
the inventory reduction actions were incorporated in the company s initiative program  and the results were achieved without adversely impacting customer service levels 
a portion of these funds was utilized to get accounts payable payment policies in line with vendor terms and for operations 
capital expenditures were million for  compared with million in expenditures for were primarily made to enhance our production capabilities in mexico and improve and expand our information systems 
at december   there are no material outstanding capital commitments 
on may   the company completed the sale of its gando drive headquarters facility in new haven  connecticut and entered into a lease of its currently occupied space used for offices  test facility and tube mill operations

net assets acquired included million of receivables  million of inventory  million of fixed assets  million of intangible assets  million of accounts payable and accrued liabilities and million of accrued severance and relocation costs 
cash dividends paid to a preferred shareholder were approximately million in  and total debt at the end of was million compared with million a year ago 
this million reduction reflects the pay down of the million industrial revenue bond  at the time the company s headquarters facility was sold  and the utilization of cash flow generated by operations 
at december   the company had million available for future borrowings under its loan agreement 
during  total debt increased by million 
these funds were utilized to meet working capital needs  primarily the increase in trade accounts receivable terms and the acquisition of fedco 
on september   the company entered into an amendment to its loan agreement which provided for a temporary increase in the maximum credit line from million to million effective july   with scheduled reductions through december  back down to million 
on november   the loan agreement was amended to permanently increase the maximum credit line to million 
on december   in conjunction with the acquisition of fedco  the loan agreement and the term promissory note with congress financial corporation were amended to permanently increase the maximum credit line to million and extend the credit line through december  in addition  the interest rate was decreased to the prime rate from the prime rate plus 
the company also has the option to elect a eurodollar based interest rate  which has been decreased from plus to plus 
the amended loan and security agreement is comprised of a million revolving credit facility and a million term loan 
there were no changes to the minimum thresholds for net worth or working capital  which remain at million and million respectively 
the extension and amendment to the credit line provided the company with additional flexibility to meet ongoing developmental needs and lowered borrowing costs 
in  funds provided by the loan agreement  which was entered into on january   were utilized to repay the previous revolver and provide funds for operating activities 
during  the company was able to repay million of its outstanding debt 
the future liquidity and ordinary capital needs of the company in the short term are expected to be met from a combination of cash flows from operations and borrowings under the loan agreement 
the company s working capital requirements peak during the second and third quarters  reflecting the normal seasonality in the automotive and light truck segment 
in addition  the company s future cash flow may be impacted by industry trends lengthening customer payment terms 
during  the company began utilizing a customer sponsored program administered by a financial institution in order to accelerate the collection of funds and offset the impact of these lengthening terms 
the company intends to continue utilizing this program as long as it is a cost effective tool to accelerate cash flow and will expand its usage as other customers make it available 
the company believes that its cash flow from operations  together with borrowings under its loan agreement  will be adequate to meet its near term anticipated ordinary capital expenditures and working capital requirements 
however  the company believes that the amount of borrowings available under the loan agreement would not be sufficient to meet the capital needs for major growth initiatives  such as significant acquisitions 
if the company were to implement major new growth initiatives  it would have to seek additional sources of capital 
however  no assurance can be given that the company would be successful in securing such additional sources of capital 
the following table summarizes the company s outstanding material contractual obligations as of december

borrowings classified as a current liability in the consolidated balance sheet included in this report 
pension plan contributions reflect expected disbursements in as calculated by the company s third party actuary 
estimated contributions for future years are not currently determinable as they will be impacted by changes in discount rates  pension plan performance and other factors 
purchase obligations for goods and services outstanding at the end of the year which normally are consumed over a period of less than months 
this is not reflective of total consumption over a month period 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
a company s critical accounting estimates  as set forth by the us securities and exchange commission  are those which are most important to the portrayal of its financial condition and results of operations and often require the utilization of estimates or subjective judgment 
based upon this definition  we have identified the critical accounting estimates addressed below 
although we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable  they are based upon information presently available 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company also has other key accounting policies  which involve the use of estimates  which are further described in note  summary of significant accounting policies  in item of this report 
revenue recognition 
sales are recognized either when products are shipped to the customer or when products are received by the customer in accordance with the invoice shipping terms 
accruals for warranty costs  sales returns and allowances are provided at the time of sale based upon historical experience or agreements currently in place with customers 
the company will also accrue for unusual warranty exposures at the time the exposure is identified and quantifiable based upon analyses of expected product failure rates and engineering cost estimates 
in connection with multi year agreements with certain customers  the company incurs customer acquisition costs which are capitalized and amortized over the life of the agreement 
the company also establishes reserves for uncollectible trade accounts receivable based upon historical experience  anticipated business trends and the current economic conditions 
changes in our customers financial condition or other factors could cause our estimates of uncollectible accounts receivable or the amortization periods of customer acquisition costs to vary 
inventory valuation 
inventories are valued at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market 
this requires the company to make judgments about the likely method of disposition of its inventory and expected recoverable value upon disposition 
inventories are reviewed on a continuing basis  and provisions are also made for slow moving and obsolete inventory based upon estimates of historical or expected usage as well as the expected recoverable value upon disposition 
impairment of long lived assets 
in the event that facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of a business unit s long lived assets may be impaired  an evaluation of recoverability would be performed 
if an evaluation is required  the estimated future undiscounted cash flows of the business unit  associated with the long lived assets  would be compared to the asset s carrying amount to determine if a writedown is required 
if this review indicates that the assets will not be recoverable  the carrying value of the company s assets would be reduced to their estimated fair value 
the estimates used in determining whether an impairment exists involve future cash flows of each business unit  which are based upon expected revenue trends  cost of production and operating expenses 
income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amount of deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that those such assets will not be realized 
changes to the valuation allowance are based on the evaluation of all available evidence supporting the company s ability to utilize tax benefits prior to their expiration 
pension plans 
the company establishes and periodically reviews the assumptions used in the measurement of its retirement plans 
the discount rate will change in relation to increases or decreases in applicable published bond indices 
the return on assets reflects the long term rate of return on plan assets expected to be realized over a ten year or longer period 
as such  it will normally not be adjusted for short term trends in the stock or bond markets 
in addition  the rate of return will reflect the investment allocation currently used to manage the pension portfolio 
the company s pension assumptions currently include a long term annual rate of return  which is based upon the current portfolio allocation  long term rates of return for similar investment vehicles and economic and other indicators of future performance 
differences between actual and assumed portfolio performance as well as the impact of changes in discount rates are included in the calculation of the company s accrued pension costs by a third party actuary 
as the performance of the pension portfolio during and was below the actuarial assumption and the discount rate was reduced by in both years  the unrecognized component of accrued pension costs changed from a gain of million at december  to a loss of million at december  and a loss of million at december  during  the discount rate was again reduced by  however  the impact this had on the minimum pension liability was offset by improved performance of the portfolio resulting in an increase in the unrecognized component of accrued pension costs to million 
in the future  this unrecognized loss  along with changes in any of the underlying pension assumptions  and the ongoing performance of the plan assets  will impact future funding requirements  minimum pension liability adjustments and net pension cost amounts 
inflation the overall impact of the low rate of inflation in recent years has resulted in no significant impact on labor costs and general services utilized by the company 
the principal raw materials used in the company s original equipment and replacement radiator and heater core product lines are copper and brass 
the company also requires aluminum for its radiator  charge air cooler  condenser and heater core product lines 
copper  brass  aluminum and other primary metals used in the company s business are generally subject to commodity pricing and variations in the market prices for such materials 
although these materials are available from a number of vendors  the company has chosen to concentrate its sources with a limited number of long term suppliers 
the company typically executes purchase orders for its copper and brass requirements three to nine months prior to the actual delivery date 
in periods of abnormally high commodity market prices  the company will place orders only for its current requirements 
in either case  the purchase price for such copper  brass and aluminum is established at the time such orders are placed by the company and not at the time of delivery 
the company also manages its metals commodity pricing exposure by attempting to pass through any cost increases to its customers 
during  commodity prices have increased significantly over the prior year 
selling price increases  impacting most product lines  are currently being implemented in order to recover these cost increases 
although the company has been successful in passing through price increases to its customers to offset a portion of past commodity cost increases  there is no assurance that the company will continue to be successful in raising prices in the future 
the company currently does not use financial derivatives or other methods to hedge transactions with respect to its metals consumption 
environmental matters the company is subject to federal  state and local laws designed to protect the environment and believes that  as a general matter  its policies  practices and procedures are properly designed to reasonably prevent risk of environmental damage and financial liability to the company 
on january   the company signed a consent agreement with the state of connecticut department of environmental protection 
under the agreement the company will voluntarily initiate the investigation and cleanup of environmental contamination on property occupied by a wholly owned subsidiary of the company over years ago
