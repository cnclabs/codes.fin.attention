item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations highlights sales increased in fiscal over fiscal fiscal included weeks which represented an additional week over the weeks in fiscal this additional week represented an estimated of the sales increase in fiscal gross margins as a percent of sales for fiscal decreased from the prior year due to the impact of product cost increases and changes in customer mix  segment mix and product mix 
operating expenses as a percent of sales for fiscal decreased from the prior year due to operating efficiencies and operating costs increasing at lower rates than the sales price increases driven by product cost increases 
operating expenses were negatively impacted by increased net pension costs and expenses incurred in connection with the national supply chain project and were favorably impacted by gains recorded related to the cash surrender value of life insurance assets 
primarily as a result of these factors  net earnings increased in fiscal over fiscal the earnings increases in fiscal over fiscal also include the impact of the additional week in fiscal the impact on our customers of a prolonged period of rising product costs  internally estimated at for the fiscal year and for the fourth quarter of fiscal  has contributed to a softer foodservice market 
management believes that the softness in the foodservice market together with general economic conditions contributed to a slowing of sales growth for the company in the latter half of the fourth quarter of fiscal which is continuing in the first quarter of fiscal the company has renewed its focus on expense controls in fiscal  including managing labor costs and productivity and ongoing benchmarking and sharing of best practices at the operating companies 
overview sysco distributes food and related products to the foodservice industry  including restaurants  healthcare and educational facilities  lodging establishments and other foodservice customers 
sysco s operations are located throughout the united states and canada and include broadline companies  specialty produce companies  custom cut meat operations  asian cuisine foodservice  hotel supply operations  sygma  the company s chain restaurant distribution subsidiary  and a company that distributes to internationally located chain restaurants 
the company estimates that it serves more than of an approximately billion annual foodservice market that includes the north american foodservice  non food and hotel amenity  furniture and textile markets 
the foodservice  or food prepared away from home  market represents approximately one half of the total food purchases made at the consumer level 
this share has grown from about in  since food purchases in the foodservice industry have grown more rapidly than food purchases in the retail grocery industry over most of that time period 
factors influencing this trend  and therefore sysco s growth  include increases in dual worker and single parent families  busier lifestyles  the general aging of the population  growing affluence  and the increasing demand for the variety  convenience and entertainment afforded by the proliferation of restaurants and other foodservice operations 
industry statisticians and demographers expect most of these general trends to continue  although they may not continue at the same pace 
general economic conditions and consumer confidence can have an effect on the frequency and amount spent by consumers for food prepared away from home and therefore on sysco 
however  we have consistently grown at a faster rate than the overall industry and have grown our market share in this fragmented industry 
the company intends to continue to expand its market share and grow earnings through strategies which include profitable sales growth in addition to expansion through foldouts new operating companies created in established markets previously served by other sysco operating companies and a disciplined acquisition program  refining the use of customer purchasing potential and profitability data in targeting new customers  deepening relationships with existing customers  tailoring products and services and allocating associated resources by customer  and managing the profitability of  or exiting  low profit or unprofitable customers 
brand management leveraging brand strength to grow sales and profitability while ensuring strict quality control processes and providing greater value to customers 
productivity deploying the latest technology and leveraging best business practices to improve operating efficiencies and leverage expenses to sales growth 
sales force effectiveness targeted recruiting  training and compensation of marketing associates 
expanding the business development and business review functions to further strengthen our marketing associate customer relationships 
supply chain optimization creating a more efficient and effective supply chain infrastructure through the national supply chain project 
the company s national supply chain project is intended to optimize the supply chain activities for certain products from sysco s operating companies in each respective region and as a result  reduce inventory and operating costs  working capital requirements and future facility expansion needs at sysco s operating companies while providing greater value to our suppliers and customers 
the company expects to build from five to ten regional distribution centers over a period of ten years 
the first regional distribution center in the northeast is expected to be operational during the third quarter of fiscal results of operations the following table sets forth the components of the results of operations expressed as a percentage of sales for the periods indicated sales costs and expenses cost of sales operating expenses interest expense other  net total costs and expenses earnings before income taxes income taxes net earnings the following table sets forth the change in the components of the results of operations expressed as a percentage increase or decrease over the prior year sales costs and expenses cost of sales operating expenses interest expense other  net total costs and expenses earnings before income taxes income taxes net earnings basic earnings per share diluted earnings per share average shares outstanding diluted shares outstanding sales sales increased in fiscal and in fiscal over the prior years 
the additional week contributed approximately to the overall sales growth rate for fiscal because the fourth quarter of fiscal contained an additional week as compared to fiscal  sales growth for fiscal is not directly comparable to the prior year 
in order to provide a more comparable picture of sales growth during fiscal  management believes that it is appropriate to adjust the sales figures for fiscal by the estimated impact of the additional week 
as a result  sales for fiscal presented in the table below are adjusted by one fourteenth of total sales for the fourth quarter 
failure to make these adjustments might cause investors to overstate the amount of actual sales growth due to the additional week of sales included in fiscal set forth below is a reconciliation of actual sales growth to adjusted sales growth for the periods presented sales for the week periods   estimated sales for the additional week  adjusted sales   actual percentage increase adjusted percentage increase acquisitions contributed to the overall sales growth rate for fiscal and for fiscal estimated product cost increases  an internal measure of inflation  were during fiscal as compared to a flat rate during fiscal sysco generally expects to pass product cost increases to its customers  however  the actual amount of inflation reflected as sales price increases is difficult to quantify 
management believes that sysco s restaurant operator customers have experienced softness in their rate of sales growth as cost and price increases impact customer spending 
product cost increases in the fourth quarter of fiscal reached 
management believes that the softness in the foodservice market together with general economic conditions contributed to a slowing of sysco s sales growth in the latter half of the fourth quarter of fiscal which is continuing in the first quarter of fiscal industry sources estimate the total foodservice market experienced a real sales decline of approximately in calendar year and real sales growth of in calendar year a comparison of the sales mix in the principal product categories during the last three years is presented below fresh and frozen meats canned and dry products frozen fruits  vegetables  bakery and other poultry dairy products fresh produce paper and disposables seafood beverage products equipment and smallwares janitorial products medical supplies a comparison of sales by type of customer during the last three years is presented below restaurants hospitals and nursing homes schools and colleges hotels and motels all other cost of sales cost of sales as a percentage of sales was in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal management believes that cost of sales as a percentage of sales in fiscal was impacted by several factors  including product cost increases and changes in customer mix  segment mix and product mix  however  the specific impact of each factor is difficult to quantify 
product cost increases in substantially all product categories also had the impact of reducing gross margins as a percentage of sales  as gross profit dollars are earned on a higher sales dollar base 
dairy and meat products  which are especially affected by product cost increases since they are often sold on a cost per pound plus a fee basis rather than a percentage markup  experienced the highest rates of inflation 
the result was a higher sales price but a lower gross margin as a percentage of sales even as gross margin dollars were maintained or even increased 
multi unit customer sales in the broadline segment  which traditionally yield lower gross margins and lower expenses than marketing associate served customer sales  grew faster than sales to marketing associate served customer sales 
sales at the sygma and the other segments  which traditionally have lower margins than the broadline segment  grew faster than sales at the broadline segment 
in the area of product mix  meat sales continued to grow as a percentage of overall sales and also experienced a high rate of cost increases 
meat products typically generate higher prices and higher gross margin dollars per case than the average of other products  but lower gross margins as a percentage of sales 
therefore  increased sales of these products had the effect of decreasing overall gross margins as a percentage of sales even as gross margin dollars were maintained or increased 
the increase in cost of sales as a percentage of sales in fiscal was primarily a result of two factors 
first  multi unit sales growth was greater than marketing associate served sales growth 
second  fresh cut meat sales grew as a percentage of overall sales 
in fiscal  cost of sales was influenced by sysco s overall customer and product mix  economies realized in purchasing and increased sales of sysco brand products 
operating expenses operating expenses include the costs of warehousing and delivering products as well as selling  administrative and occupancy expenses 
these expenses as a percent of sales were for fiscal  for fiscal and for fiscal changes in the percentage relationship of operating expenses to sales result from an interplay of several factors  including improved efficiencies  customer mix  and product cost increases 
the decrease in expenses as a percentage of sales in fiscal as compared to fiscal was attributable to several factors including improved operating efficiencies as demonstrated by improving trends in key expense metrics tracked at the broadline operating companies  including pieces sold per delivery  product line items sold per delivery  pieces per trip and pieces per error 
increases in product costs and the resulting increased average sales price per item also favorably impacted expenses as a percentage of sales as operating costs increased at a lower rate 
operating expenses were negatively impacted by increases in net pension costs of  and by increases in expenses related to the national supply chain project of  over fiscal management estimates that the company will incur an additional  to  in expenses related to the national supply chain project in fiscal over what was incurred in fiscal  including depreciation of the first redistribution center 
operating expenses were also favorably impacted by the recognition of income in fiscal of  to adjust the carrying value of life insurance assets to their cash surrender value 
the gains in fiscal were recognized in the first weeks with a modest loss of  in the fourth quarter of fiscal this contrasted with fiscal where a gain of  was recognized in the fourth quarter reversing the majority of prior losses recognized in the first weeks and resulting in a net loss of  for the fiscal year 
the company has renewed its focus on expense controls in fiscal  including managing labor costs and productivity and ongoing benchmarking and sharing of best practices at the operating companies 
the decrease in expenses as a percentage of sales in fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily attributable to improved operating efficiencies  as demonstrated by improving trends in key expense metrics  including pieces sold per delivery and product line items sold per delivery 
these operating expense improvements were partially offset by increases in net pension costs of  and by increases in expenses incurred in connection with the national supply chain project of  over fiscal operating expenses in fiscal were negatively impacted by increases in marketing associate served sales  for which higher expenses are incurred to serve these customers 
interest expense interest expense decreased in fiscal and increased in fiscal over the prior years 
the decrease in interest expense in fiscal was primarily due to lower borrowing rates offsetting moderately higher borrowing levels 
the lower average borrowing rates of the company in fiscal were due to lower short term market interest rates and the use of interest rate swaps which converted the fixed rates of interest on a portion of sysco s long term debt to lower variable rates of interest 
the increase in interest expense in fiscal was primarily due to increased borrowings  partially offset by decreases in interest rate levels 
other  net other  net was income of  in fiscal   in fiscal and  in fiscal changes between the years result from fluctuations in miscellaneous activities  primarily gains and losses on the sale of surplus facilities 
earnings before income taxes earnings before income taxes increased in fiscal and in fiscal over the prior years 
the increases were due to the factors discussed above 
the additional week also contributed to the earnings growth in fiscal provision for income taxes the effective tax rate was in fiscal and in fiscal and net earnings fiscal represents the twenty eighth consecutive year of increased earnings before the cumulative effect of accounting changes 
net earnings increased in fiscal and in fiscal over the prior periods 
the increases were due to the factors discussed above 
return on average shareholders equity the return on average shareholders equity was approximately in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal the increase in net earnings and share repurchases in fiscal  reduced by the reversal of a portion of minimum pension liability  contributed to the increase in fiscal since its inception  sysco has averaged approximately return on average shareholders equity

acquisitions contributed to the overall sales growth rate for fiscal and in fiscal the fiscal sales growth was due to increased sales to marketing associate served customers and multi unit customers  including increased sales of sysco brand products  and price increases resulting from higher product costs 
the additional week also contributed to the sales growth in fiscal the fiscal sales growth was due primarily to increased sales to marketing associate served and multi unit customers  including increased sales of sysco brand products  as well as the acquisition of a canadian broadline foodservice operation 
the sales growth in both years was obtained through increased sales to the existing customer base as well as the acquisition of new customers 
broadline segment sales as a percentage of total sysco sales were in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal the decrease in fiscal was due primarily to strong sales growth in the custom cut meat  sygma and lodging industry product segments outpacing the broadline sales growth  as well as the acquisition of the asian cuisine foodservice operations during fiscal the increase in fiscal was due primarily to the acquisition of a canadian broadline foodservice operation 
marketing associate served sales as a percentage of broadline sales in the us decreased to in fiscal as compared to in fiscal the decrease in fiscal was due to the rate of sales increase to multi unit customers exceeding the rate of sales increase to marketing associate served customers 
the growth in sales to multi unit customers was fueled by increased sales to existing locations and the addition of new locations 
sysco brand sales as a percentage of broadline sales in the us increased to for fiscal as compared to in fiscal earnings before income taxes for the broadline segment increased in fiscal and in fiscal over the prior years 
the increase in earnings before income taxes for fiscal year was primarily due to increased sales and reduced expenses as a percentage of sales  which more than offset reduced margins as a percentage of sales 
reduced expenses as a percentage of sales is attributable to several factors including improved operating efficiencies 
the decrease in margins and expenses as a percentage of sales was also impacted by increases in product costs and the resulting increase in the average sales price per item 
the additional week also contributed to the earnings growth in fiscal the increases in earnings before income taxes for fiscal years and were primarily due to increases in sales and lower expenses as a percentage of sales 
sygma segment sygma segment sales increased in fiscal and in fiscal over the prior years 
acquisitions contributed to the overall sales growth rate for fiscal and in fiscal the fiscal sales growth was due primarily to sales to new customers  sales growth in sygma s existing customer base related to new locations added by those customers  as well as increases in sales to existing locations  price increases resulting from higher product costs and sales from acquisitions 
the additional week also contributed to the sales growth in fiscal the fiscal sales growth was primarily due to sales growth in sygma s existing customer base as well as the acquisition of two quickservice operations 
sygma segment sales as a percentage of total sysco sales were in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal earnings before income taxes for the sygma segment increased in fiscal and in fiscal over the prior years 
the increase in fiscal was primarily due to the increased sales offset by increased expenses incurred related to implementation of new systems  severance payments related to certain personnel changes  costs related to worker s compensation insurance claims and pension costs 
the additional week also contributed to the earnings growth in fiscal the increase in fiscal was primarily due to increased sales 
during fiscal and continuing in the first quarter of fiscal  sygma is discontinuing servicing a portion of its largest customer s locations due to that customer s geographic supply chain realignment 
sygma expects to offset these lost sales by obtaining sales from additional locations from this customer and obtaining new business from other customers 
in many cases  this new business will be served out of different sygma locations than those that served the business that was discontinued 
as a result  during fiscal  sygma incurred additional expenses including severance payments and equipment moving costs as it transitioned its operations to serve these new customers 
sygma expects to incur similar expenses during the first and second quarter of fiscal as it continues to transition to serve these new customers 
any net lost sales and the related additional expenses are not expected to be material to sysco overall  and we expect sygma to continue to be a profitable segment 
other segments other segment sales increased in fiscal and in fiscal over the prior years 
acquisitions contributed to the overall sales growth rate for fiscal and in fiscal the increase in fiscal was primarily attributable to increased sales to the existing customer base  sales to new customers  price increases resulting from higher product costs and sales from acquisitions 
the additional week also contributed to the sales growth in fiscal the increase in fiscal was primarily attributable to sales growth in our custom meat cutting operations as well as the timing of acquisitions made during the year 
other segment sales as a percentage of total sysco sales were in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal earnings before income taxes for the other segment increased in fiscal and in fiscal over the prior years 
the increase in fiscal was primarily due to increases in sales  acquisitions and reduced expenses as a percentage of sales  which more than offset reduced gross margins as a percentage of sales 
the additional week also contributed to the earnings growth in fiscal the increase in fiscal was due primarily to acquisitions  increased earnings from increased gross margins and operating efficiencies at our specialty produce operations  and increased earnings from increased sales and gross margins at the company s specialty lodging industry products operations 
these were offset by expenses incurred on a start up operation supplying the health care industry and decreased earnings at the company s specialty meat cutting operations 
liquidity and capital resources sysco provides marketing and distribution services to foodservice customers primarily throughout the united states and canada 
the company intends to continue to expand its market share through profitable sales growth  foldouts and acquisitions 
the company also strives to increase the effectiveness of its marketing associates  its consolidated buying programs and the productivity of its warehousing and distribution activities 
these objectives require continuing investment 
sysco s resources include cash provided by operations and access to capital from financial markets 
sysco s operations historically have produced significant cash flow 
cash generated from operations is first allocated to working capital requirements  investments in facilities  fleet and other equipment required to meet customers needs  cash dividends  and acquisitions compatible with the company s overall growth strategy 
any remaining cash generated from operations may  at the discretion of management  be applied toward a portion of the cost of the share repurchase program  while the remainder of the cost may be financed with additional long term debt 
sysco s share repurchase program is used primarily to offset shares issued under various employee benefit and compensation plans  for acquisitions  to reduce shares outstanding  which may have the net effect of increasing earnings per share  and to aid in managing the ratio of long term debt to total capitalization 
management targets a long term debt to total capitalization ratio between and 
the ratio may exceed the target range from time to time  due to borrowings incurred in order to fund acquisitions and internal growth opportunities  and due to fluctuations in the timing and amount of share repurchases 
the ratio also may fall below the target range due to strong cash flow from operations and fluctuations in the timing and amount of share repurchases 
this ratio was and at july  and june   respectively 
the reversal of a portion of the minimum pension liability adjustments in other comprehensive income contributed to the decrease in the ratio at july  the company generated net cash from operations of  in fiscal   in fiscal  and  in fiscal several factors contributed to the decrease in cash flow from operations in fiscal during the second quarter of fiscal  the company began reorganizing its supply chain to maximize consolidated efficiencies and increase the effectiveness of the merchandising and procurement functions performed for the benefit of customers 
the structure results in the deferral of certain federal and state income tax payments  as supply chain distributions are not included in taxable income until distributed in periods subsequent to when they are recognized in book income 
fiscal is the first period that supply chain distributions were included in taxable income since the company began deferring these items for tax purposes in fiscal as a result of the impact of these items and other temporary differences  including the utilization of us federal net operating loss carryforwards  excess tax depreciation and pension contributions  taxes paid during fiscal increased to  as compared to  in fiscal the company expects the net cash flow impact of deferrals in fiscal and beyond to be incrementally positive when compared to what would have been paid on an annual basis without the deferral  due to the company s belief that its volume through the new structure will continue to grow 
cash flow from operations for fiscal was negatively impacted by increases in accounts receivable and inventory balances  partially offset by increases in accounts payable balances and increases in accrued expenses and other liabilities 
increased sales volumes over the prior periods partially contributed to the increase in accounts receivable balances 
sysco has also experienced sales increases with multi unit customers that have outpaced the sales increases from marketing associate served customers 
multi unit customers payment terms are traditionally longer than the sysco average 
inventory levels also increased over prior year levels  partially due to the increased sales volumes 
in addition  inventory levels at the end of fiscal  measured as a function of average days sales outstanding  exceeded the levels at the end of fiscal  which in turn were lower than those at the end of fiscal this relative increase in inventory levels negatively impacted cash flow from operations for fiscal the increase in accounts payable balances was partially due to the increased inventory balances but was also negatively impacted by decreases in accounts payable days outstanding over the prior periods 
a significant reason for the decrease in accrued expenses and other long term liabilities in fiscal was the increase in pension contributions from  in fiscal to  in fiscal pension contributions in fiscal were  the company anticipates pension contributions in fiscal will be approximately  cash used for investing activities was  in fiscal   in fiscal  and  in fiscal expenditures for facilities  fleet and other equipment were  in fiscal   in fiscal  and  in fiscal fiscal capital expenditures included the construction of fold out facilities in oxnard  california and fargo  north dakota  replacement or significant expansion of facilities in billings  montana  cleveland  ohio  jacksonville  florida  miami  florida  and san antonio  texas  and continued expenditures related to the national supply chain project 
the capital expenditures in fiscal included the construction of fold out facilities in las vegas  nevada and oxnard  california  replacement facilities in cleveland  ohio  dallas  texas  and miami  florida and the northeast redistribution center in front royal  virginia first phase of the national supply chain project 
fiscal expenditures included construction of fold out facilities located in sacramento  california  columbia  south carolina  and las vegas  nevada  as well as costs incurred on the construction or expansion of facilities in dallas  texas  norman  oklahoma  baraboo  wisconsin  and jersey city  new jersey 
total expenditures in fiscal are expected to decrease slightly to the range of  to  due to completion of several major replacements and fold outs in fiscal fiscal expenditures will include the continuation of the fold out program  facility  fleet and other equipment replacements and expansions  the company s national supply chain project  and investments in technology 
cash expenditures for acquisitions of businesses were  in fiscal   in fiscal and  in fiscal the national supply chain project is expected to create a more efficient and effective supply chain infrastructure for sysco  its suppliers and its customers 
the project entails the implementation of regional distribution centers  which will aggregate inventory demand to optimize the supply chain activities for certain products from all sysco operating companies in the region 
the project is expected to achieve lower costs of inventory  transportation  product handling and transaction processing in addition to lowering working capital and future facility expansion needs at the operating companies 
the northeast redistribution center is expected to be operational in the third quarter of fiscal the center will receive and distribute food and food related products to sysco operating companies in the northeast  creating benefits for customers and suppliers  as well as for sysco 
fiscal capital expenditures related to the national supply chain project were  bringing the total amount of capital expenditures on the project since inception to  cash used for financing activities was  in fiscal   in fiscal  and  in fiscal in july  the board authorized the repurchase of an additional  shares  which was completed during fiscal in september  the board authorized the repurchase of an additional  shares 
the number of shares acquired and their cost during the past three fiscal years was  shares for  in fiscal   shares for  in fiscal  and  shares for  in fiscal an additional  shares have been purchased at a cost of  through august   resulting in  shares remaining available for repurchase as authorized by the board as of that date 
dividends paid were  in fiscal   in fiscal  and  in fiscal sysco began paying the current quarterly dividend rate of per share in january  an increase from the per share that became effective in january in may  sysco declared its regular quarterly dividend for the first quarter of fiscal of per share  which was paid in july in september  sysco also declared its regular quarterly dividend for the second quarter of fiscal of per share  payable in october in november  the company filed with the securities and exchange commission a shelf registration statement covering  shares of common stock to be offered from time to time in connection with acquisitions 
as of august    shares remained available for issuance under this registration statement 
in june  the company filed with the securities and exchange commission a shelf registration statement covering  in debt securities 
as of august   there was  in principal amount outstanding under the registration statement  leaving  available for issuance 
in march  sysco issued notes totaling  due march  in a private offering 
proceeds from the notes were utilized to retire commercial paper borrowings 
the fixed rate of interest on these notes was effectively converted to variable rates of interest through the interest rate swap agreements entered into in april and may of sysco has uncommitted bank lines of credit  which provided for unsecured borrowings for working capital of up to  of which none was outstanding as of july  and  was outstanding as of august  sysco has a commercial paper program in the united states which is supported by a bank credit facility in the amount of  maturing in fiscal sysco also has a commercial paper program in canada which is supported by a bank credit facility in the amount of cad  maturing in fiscal during fiscal  and  aggregate commercial paper and short term bank borrowings ranged from approximately  to   to  and  to  respectively 
commercial paper borrowings were  as of july  and  as of august  the company intends to settle outstanding commercial paper borrowings when they come due by issuing additional debt or retiring them utilizing cash generated from operations 
total debt at july  was  of which approximately was at fixed rates averaging and the remainder was at floating rates averaging  as adjusted for the effect of the interest rate swaps outstanding as of july  sysco continues to have borrowing capacity available and alternative financing arrangements are evaluated as appropriate 
as part of normal business activities  sysco issues letters of credit through major banking institutions as required by certain vendor and insurance agreements 
as of july  and june   letters of credit outstanding were  and  respectively 
in summary  sysco believes that through continual monitoring and management of assets  together with the availability of additional capital in the financial markets  it will meet its cash requirements while maintaining proper liquidity for normal operating purposes 
contractual obligations the following table sets forth certain information concerning sysco s obligations and commitments to make contractual future payments payments due by period total over obligations year years years years in thousands short term debt and commercial paper   long term debt      capital lease obligations      long term non capitalized leases      deferred compensation      purchase obligations   total contractual cash obligations      the estimate of the timing of future payments under the executive deferred compensation plan involves the use of certain assumptions  including retirement ages and payout periods 
for purposes of this table  purchase obligations include agreements for purchases of product in the normal course of business  for which all significant terms have been confirmed 
such amounts included in the table above are based on estimates 
certain acquisitions involve contingent consideration  typically payable only in the event that certain operating results are attained or certain outstanding contingencies are resolved 
aggregate contingent consideration amounts outstanding as of july  included approximately  shares of sysco s common stock and  in cash 
these amounts are not included in the table above 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  sales and expenses in the accompanying financial statements 
significant accounting policies employed by sysco are presented in the notes to the financial statements 
critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations 
these policies require management s most subjective or complex judgments  often employing the use of estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
senior management has reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates and this related disclosure 
sysco s most critical accounting policies pertain to the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable  self insurance programs  pension plans and accounting for business combinations 
allowance for doubtful accounts sysco evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable and determines the appropriate reserve for doubtful accounts based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where the company is aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligation  a specific allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded to reduce the receivable to the net amount reasonably expected to be collected 
in addition  allowances are recorded for all other receivables based on analysis of historical trends of write offs and recoveries 
the company utilizes specific criteria to determine uncollectible receivables to be written off  including bankruptcy  accounts referred to outside parties for collection and accounts past due over specified periods 
if the financial condition of sysco s customers were to deteriorate  additional allowances may be required 
self insurance program sysco maintains a self insurance program covering portions of workers compensation  group medical  general liability and vehicle liability costs 
the amounts in excess of the self insured levels are fully insured by third party insurers 
liabilities associated with these risks are estimated in part by considering historical claims experience  demographic factors  severity factors and other actuarial assumptions 
projections of future loss expenses are inherently uncertain because of the random nature of insurance claims occurrences and could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends 
in an attempt to mitigate the risks of workers compensation  vehicle and general liability claims  safety procedures and awareness programs have been implemented 
pension plans sysco maintains defined benefit and defined contribution retirement plans for its employees 
the company also contributes to various multi employer plans under collective bargaining agreements 
sysco maintains a qualified retirement plan retirement plan for its employees which pays benefits to employees at retirement  using formulas based on a participant s years of service and compensation 
sysco also maintains a non qualified  unfunded supplemental executive retirement plan serp which provides additional retirement benefits to certain key employees 
in order to meet its obligations under the serp  the company maintains life insurance policies on the lives of participants 
sysco is the sole owner and beneficiary of such policies  which are excluded from plan assets in arriving at prepaid accrued benefit cost 
cash surrender values of such policies were  at july  and  at june  sysco accounts for its defined benefit pension plans in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  as amended by sfas no 
 employers disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits an amendment of fasb statements no 
  and these statements require that the amounts recognized in the financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis 
three of the more critical assumptions in the actuarial calculations are the discount rate for determining the current value of plan benefits  the assumption for the rate of increase in future compensation levels and the expected rate of return on plan assets 
for guidance in determining the discount rate  sysco refers to rates of return on high quality fixed income investments  including  among other items  moody s long term aa corporate bond yields 
the discount rate utilized by sysco was and as of july  and june   respectively 
the discount rate assumption is reviewed annually and revised as deemed appropriate  as it was at july   when the discount rate was increased to from and at june  when the discount rate was reduced to from the discount rate assumption utilized impacts the recorded amount of net pension costs 
the decrease in the discount rate used at june  increased sysco s net pension costs for fiscal by approximately  the increase in the discount rate of at july  will decrease sysco s net pension costs for fiscal by approximately  sysco looks to actual plan experience in determining the rates of increase in compensation levels 
sysco used a plan specific age related set of rates equivalent to a single rate of for the retirement plan  as of july  and june  the serp assumes annual salary increases of through fiscal and thereafter as of july  and annual salary increases of through fiscal and thereafter as of june  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets of the retirement plan was and as of july  and june   respectively 
the expectations of future returns are derived from a mathematical asset model that incorporates assumptions as to the various asset class returns  reflecting a combination of rigorous historical performance analysis and the forward looking views of the financial markets regarding the yield on long term bonds and the historical returns of the major stock markets 
although not determinative of future returns  the effective annual rate of return on plan assets  developed using geometric compound averaging  was approximately   and over the year  year  year and year periods ended december   respectively 
in addition  in nine of the last fifteen years  the actual return on plan assets has exceeded 
the rate of return assumption is reviewed annually and revised as deemed appropriate  as it was for fiscal when the expected return was reduced to from 
the expected return on plan assets impacts the recorded amount of net pension costs 
the decrease in the assumed rate of return in fiscal increased sysco s net pension costs for fiscal by approximately  a increase decrease in the assumed rate of return for fiscal would decrease increase sysco s net pension costs for fiscal by approximately minimum pension liability adjustments are recorded so that the recorded pension liability is at least equal to the accumulated benefit obligation 
minimum pension liability adjustments are non cash adjustments that are reflected as an increase or decrease in the pension liability and an offsetting charge to shareholders equity  net of tax  through comprehensive income or loss 
during fiscal  a minimum pension liability adjustment of  was recorded as a debit to the company s net pension balance as of july  of this adjustment   was recorded to reverse all minimum pension liability adjustments recorded in prior years related to the retirement plan 
at july   the fair value of plan assets of the retirement plan exceeded the accumulated benefit obligation  eliminating the need for a minimum pension liability adjustment 
the change in the company s funded position related to the retirement plan was due primarily to the better than expected return on plan assets in fiscal of approximately  as compared to an expected return of approximately  voluntary contribution to the qualified pension trust in fiscal of  and the increase in the discount rate at july  to 
at july   the accumulated benefit obligation of the serp continued to exceed the fair value of plan assets and required an additional minimum pension liability adjustment of  during fiscal to increase the accrued pension cost related to the serp 
during fiscal  a minimum pension liability adjustment of  was recorded as a credit to the company s net pension balance as of june  this adjustment was due to the company s accumulated benefit obligations exceeding the fair value of plan assets for both the retirement plan and the serp and was due to lower than expected returns on plan assets and the decrease in the discount rate at june  to 
amounts reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income loss related to minimum pension liability  net of tax  were  as of july   and  as of june  the company s prepaid pension cost prior to the recognition of the additional minimum pension liability was  and  at july  and june   respectively 
included in arriving at accrued benefit cost as of july  and june   respectively  are  and  in deferred net actuarial losses resulting from the variance of actual experience from that projected by actuarial assumptions 
a portion of this unrecognized loss is amortized and recognized in accordance with sfas no

accounting for business combinations goodwill and intangible assets represent the excess of consideration over the fair value of tangible net assets acquired 
certain assumptions and estimates are employed in determining the fair value of assets acquired  including goodwill and other intangible assets  as well as determining the allocation of goodwill to the appropriate reporting unit 
in addition  sysco assesses the recoverability of these intangibles by determining whether the fair values of the applicable reporting units exceed their carrying values 
the evaluation of fair value requires the use of projections  estimates and assumptions as to the future performance of the operations in performing a discounted cash flow analysis  as well as assumptions regarding sales and earnings multiples that would be applied in comparable acquisitions in the industry 
actual results could differ from these assumptions and projections  resulting in the company revising its assumptions and  if required  recognizing an impairment loss 
new accounting standards sysco adopted the provisions of emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  effective at the beginning of fiscal eitf addresses how to account for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables and provides guidance relating to when such arrangements should be divided into components for revenue recognition purposes 
the adoption of this consensus did not have a material impact on sysco s consolidated financial statements 
sysco adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin arb no 
 effective at the beginning of fiscal this interpretation introduces a new consolidation model  the variable interests model  which determines control and consolidation based on potential variability in gains and losses of the entity being evaluated for consolidation 
the adoption of this interpretation did not have a material impact on sysco s consolidated financial statements 
sysco adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity  effective at the beginning of fiscal sfas no 
establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
the adoption of this statement did not have a material effect on sysco s consolidated financial statements 
sysco adopted the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
revised  employers disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits  in the third quarter of fiscal the standard requires that companies provide additional financial statement disclosures for defined benefit plans in annual and interim financial statements  which are found under the discussion of employee benefit plans in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in march  the fasb issued an exposure draft  share based payment  an amendment of statements no 
and the proposed change in accounting would replace existing requirements under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation and apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
under the proposal  all forms of share based payments to employees  including employee stock options  would be expensed  recognizing the cost in the income statement 
the expense of each award would generally be measured at fair value at the grant date 
as proposed  sysco would have to adopt the new statement beginning in fiscal the adoption of this proposed standard is expected to have a material impact on sysco s consolidated financial statements  as the company currently accounts for its stock compensation plans using the intrinsic value method provided by apb no 
and thus has not recorded any compensation expense with respect to stock option grants to date 
risk factors low margin business  inflation and economic sensitivity the foodservice distribution industry is characterized by relatively high inventory turnover with relatively low profit margins 
sysco makes a significant portion of its sales at prices that are based on the cost of products it sells plus a percentage markup 
as a result  sysco s profit levels may be negatively impacted during periods of product cost deflation  even though sysco s gross profit percentage may remain relatively constant 
prolonged periods of product cost inflation may also have a negative impact on the company s profit margins and earnings to the extent such product cost increases are not passed on to customers due to resistance to higher prices 
the foodservice industry is sensitive to national and regional economic conditions 
inflation  fuel costs and other factors affecting consumer confidence and the frequency and amount spent by consumers for food prepared away from home may negatively impact sysco s sales and operating results 
sysco s operating results are also sensitive to  and may be adversely affected by  other factors  including difficulties with the collectability of accounts receivable  competitive price pressures  severe weather conditions and unexpected increases in fuel or other transportation related costs 
although these factors have not had a material adverse impact on sysco s past operations  there can be no assurance that one or more of these factors will not adversely affect future operating results 
leverage and debt service because historically a substantial part of sysco s growth has been the result of acquisitions and capital expansion  sysco s continued growth depends  in large part  on its ability to continue this expansion 
as a result  its inability to finance acquisitions and capital expenditures through borrowed funds could restrict its ability to expand 
moreover  any default under the documents governing the indebtedness of sysco could have a significant adverse effect on the market value of sysco s common stock 
further  sysco s leveraged position may also increase its vulnerability to competitive pressures 
product liability claims sysco  like any other seller of food  faces the risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of products sold by the company causes injury or illness 
with respect to product liability claims  sysco believes it has sufficient primary or excess umbrella liability insurance 
however  this insurance may not continue to be available at a reasonable cost  or  if available  may not be adequate to cover all of sysco s liabilities 
sysco generally seeks contractual indemnification and insurance coverage from parties supplying its products  but this indemnification or insurance coverage is limited  as a practical matter  to the creditworthiness of the indemnifying party and the insured limits of any insurance provided by suppliers 
if sysco does not have adequate insurance or contractual indemnification available  product liability relating to defective products could materially reduce sysco s net earnings and earnings per share 
interruption of supplies sysco obtains substantially all of its foodservice and related products from third party suppliers 
for the most part  sysco does not have long term contracts with its suppliers committing them to provide products to sysco 
although sysco s purchasing volume can provide leverage when dealing with suppliers  suppliers may not provide the foodservice products and supplies needed by sysco in the quantities requested 
because sysco does not control the actual production of the products it sells  it is also subject to delays caused by interruption in production based on conditions outside its control 
these conditions include job actions or strikes by employees of suppliers  weather  crop conditions  transportation interruptions  and natural disasters or other catastrophic events 
sysco s inability to obtain adequate supplies of its foodservice and related products as a result of any of the foregoing factors or otherwise  could mean that sysco could not fulfill its obligations to customers  and customers may turn to other distributors 
labor relations as of july   approximately  employees at operating companies were members of different local unions associated with the international brotherhood of teamsters and other labor organizations 
in fiscal  agreements covering approximately  employees will expire 
failure of the operating companies to effectively renegotiate these contracts could result in work stoppages 
although sysco s operating subsidiaries have not experienced any significant labor disputes or work stoppages to date  and sysco believes they have satisfactory relationships with their unions  a work stoppage due to failure of one or more operating subsidiaries to renegotiate a union contract  or otherwise  could have a material adverse effect on sysco 
integration of acquired companies if sysco is unable to integrate acquired businesses successfully and realize anticipated economic  operational and other benefits in a timely manner  its profitability may decrease 
integration of an acquired business may be more difficult when sysco acquires a business in a market in which it has limited or no expertise  or with a corporate culture different from sysco s 
if sysco is unable to integrate acquired businesses successfully  it may incur substantial costs and delays in increasing its customer base 
in addition  the failure to integrate acquisitions successfully may divert management s attention from sysco s existing business and may damage sysco s relationships with its key customers and suppliers 
charter and stockholder rights plan under its restated certificate of incorporation  sysco s board of directors is authorized to issue up to million shares of preferred stock without stockholder approval 
issuance of these shares could make it more difficult for anyone to acquire sysco without approval of the board of directors  depending on the rights and preferences of the stock issued 
in addition  if anyone attempts to acquire sysco without approval of the board of directors of sysco  the stockholders of sysco have the right to purchase preferred stock of sysco pursuant to its stockholder rights plan  which could result in substantial dilution to a potential acquiror 
the existence of either of these provisions could deter hostile takeover attempts that might result in an acquisition of sysco that could otherwise have been financially beneficial to sysco s stockholders 
forward looking statements certain statements made herein that look forward in time or express management s expectations or beliefs with respect to the occurrence of future events are forward looking statements under the private securities litigation reform act of they include statements about sysco s ability to increase its market share and sales  long term debt to capitalization target ratios  anticipated capital expenditures  timing and expected benefits of the national supply chain initiative and related regional distribution centers  and sysco s ability to meet future cash requirements and remain profitable 
these statements are based on management s current expectations and estimates  actual results may differ materially due in part to the risk factors discussed above 
in addition  sysco s ability to increase its market share and sales  meet future cash requirements and remain profitable could be affected by conditions in the economy and the industry and internal factors such as the ability to control expenses 
the ability to meet long term debt to capitalization target ratios may also be affected by share repurchases  cash flow  acquisitions and internal growth 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk sysco does not utilize financial instruments for trading purposes 
sysco s use of debt directly exposes the company to interest rate risk 
floating rate debt  where the interest rate fluctuates periodically  exposes the company to short term changes in market interest rates 
fixed rate debt  where the interest rate is fixed over the life of the instrument  exposes the company to changes in market interest rates reflected in the fair value of the debt and to the risk that the company may need to refinance maturing debt with new debt at a higher rate 
sysco manages its debt portfolio to achieve an overall desired position of fixed and floating rates and may employ interest rate swaps as a tool to achieve that goal 
the major risks from interest rate derivatives include changes in the interest rates affecting the fair value of such instruments  potential increases in interest expense due to market increases in floating interest rates and the creditworthiness of the counterparties in such transactions 
at july   the company had outstanding  of commercial paper at variable rates of interest with maturities through october  the company s total long term debt obligations of  were primarily at fixed rates of interest 
in addition  the company has entered into interest rate swap agreements totaling  in notional amount whereby the company receives interest payments at fixed rates of interest and pays interest at variable rates
