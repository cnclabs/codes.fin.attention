index to financial statements part i item business overview we are a supplier of semiconductor manufacturing equipment and software to the global semiconductor industry 
we were formed on april   to succeed the wafer prober business conducted by the electroglas division of general signal corporation  our former parent 
immediately prior to the closing of the initial public offering of our common stock  or ipo  on july   we assumed the assets and liabilities of the electroglas division in the asset transfer 
following our ipo  we commenced operations as an independent corporation 
we  through our predecessors  have been in the semiconductor equipment business for more than years 
our primary product line is automated wafer probing equipment and related network software to manage information from that equipment 
in conjunction with automated test systems from other suppliers  our logo the eg argos  electroglas highest accuracy mm wafer prober  is designed for extremely tight pitch probing on leading edge devices  which allows chipmakers to address the latest technology challenges semiconductor manufacturing customers use our wafer probers and network software to test semiconductor wafers for quality and to improve their productivity and control their processes  optimizing manufacturing efficiency 
electroglas s installed base is one of the largest in the industry  having sold over  wafer probers 
in january  we acquired statware inc  of corvallis  oregon  to further expand our network software product offerings in the test management area 
today  the statware technology is the basis for our web based applications that allow our customers to monitor and control probers from any location  as well as collect  analyze  and report critical test process information and automatically direct corrective action needed 
we are also involved in the development  manufacture  marketing  and servicing of test handlers as part of our strategy to be a comprehensive semiconductor test solutions provider

industry background semiconductor devices are fabricated by repeating a complex series of process steps on a substrate  or wafer  that is usually made of silicon 
wafers are typically sent through a series of to process steps 
a finished wafer consists of many integrated circuits  each referred to as a device or die or chip  the number of which depends on the area of the circuits and the size of the wafer 
these wafers measure from mm to mm  or to inches  in diameter 
manufacturers have increasingly utilized larger diameter wafers to achieve more cost effective production 
the move to mm inch wafers  a significant trend for equipment manufacturers  began in the manufacture of semiconductor devices is very capital intensive 
a typical state of the art facility  usually called a wafer fab  will cost more than billion 
the purchase of semiconductor manufacturing equipment and spare parts  the integration of such equipment into production lines  and the training of employees on a particular supplier s equipment require significant expenditures by semiconductor manufacturers 
wafer probing a wafer prober successively positions each die on the wafer so that the electrical contact points  or pads  on the die align under and make contact with probe pins  which are located on a probe card mounted on the wafer prober 
the probe card  which is generally custom made by other suppliers for the specific device being tested  is logo wafter probing requires sophisticated machine vision and software capabilities to align each die on a wafer often to accuracies as tight as m to pins on a probe card connected to a tester that measures electrical performance connected to a test system  also supplied by other suppliers  which performs the required parametric or functional test 
parametric testing is performed during the wafer fabrication process  referred to as in line testing  and at the completion of the wafer fabrication process  referred to as end of line testing  to measure electrical parameters that verify the reliability of the wafer fabrication process 
functional testing is performed after the completion of wafer fabrication to identify devices that do not conform to particular electrical specifications or performance criteria 
this process is typically called wafer sort 
wafers often go through several wafer probing steps during the manufacturing process 
automatic wafer probers are primarily used during this wafer sort process  which occurs after the fabrication steps are completed and before the separation and packaging of each individual device 
wafer probers are also increasingly used during in line parametric testing 
in line testing requires special equipment features such as cleanroom compatibility and low noise electrical measurement capability  as tests are carried out during the fabrication process 
this testing is done to verify the quality of the manufacturing process while wafers are in an unfinished state where corrective action can occur 
a small number of probers are also used for research and development  and quality and process control applications 
we estimate  based upon our experience  that wafer sort applications represent as much as of the market for automatic wafer probers 
the remaining is divided between in line and end of line testing and laboratory applications 

table of contents 
index to financial statements there is a growing trend for semiconductor manufacturers to contract with other companies to perform their wafer sort operations 
these contract test companies  typically called test houses  perform the wafer testing service and often provide assembly and packing services as well 
a semiconductor manufacturer typically purchases wafer probers when outfitting a new wafer fabrication facility or expanding an existing facility 
wafer probers are also purchased to replace equipment in response to major changes in technology such as larger wafer sizes and greater device complexity 
a semiconductor fabrication facility typically requires to probers to meet testing requirements on a timely basis 
a test house may require hundreds of wafer probe systems to support the testing requirements of the companies that contract with them 
final test wafers are sent from the wafer sort operation to assembly where they are cut apart with wafer saws  and put into individual protective packages 
once packaged  chips are tested again to make sure they function properly before being shipped to a distribution center 
ultimately  these chips will find their way into electronic systems and then into homes  cars  offices  and so on 
a revolution in semiconductor packaging is currently being driven by the trend to shrink the size and weight of consumer electronics devices  such as mobile phones  personal digital assistants pdas  and notebook computers  while increasing performance 
this has caused the advent of very small chip scale packages csp and ever more dense ball grid array bga packages  which have made it increasingly difficult to handle devices individually 
manufacturers and test houses are looking for new and more efficient methods to handle these types of packages 
for traditional packages  the desire to reduce the cost of assembly and test has chipmakers looking for ways to increase test efficiency 
as demand continues to grow for the highest volume leadframe based packages  such as soic s  there is increasing need to find new test methods to improve test throughput and lower the cost of test 
one of the primary new technologies for meeting these needs is testing devices while in strip or panel format 
the simplest and most commonly known type of strip is the lead frame used during assembly of conventional packages 
with csp s and bga s  many new types of strips are being introduced 
when devices are tested while still held in position on these strips  small high speed devices can be accurately positioned and numerous devices can be tested and handled simultaneously 
csp and bga packages are growing much faster than the industry in general 
combined with growing adoption of strip testing for the high volume leadframe based packages  such as soic  the market for strip handlers is also expanding rapidly 
logo packaging trends provide new opportunities for electroglas as final test becomes more like wafer test with large arrays of devices on a substrate  very small package size and contacts  and a need for higher levels of test parallelism to drive down costs another strong trend is the increasing number of devices that are being shipped as known good die kgd  that is  bare die  without any packaging 
these devices are typically assembled into multi chip modules or mounted directly to circuit boards 
also  micro electro mechanical structures mems are emerging as an important market 
these devices have been traditionally used in pressure sensors and accelerometers  but have recently expanded into photonics and light handling applications 
finally  there are applications  such as chips for 
table of contents 
index to financial statements smart cards  which require wafers to be thinned below microns 
wafers this thin become difficult to test with conventional handling 
in summary  chip scale and ball grid array packages are increasingly being tested in strip or panel format 
also  bare die and micro electro mechanical structures are emerging as important markets along with ultra thin die for smart card applications 
these new demands dictate a whole new class of film frame and strip handlers that represent new markets for electroglas 
software software plays an important role in the integrated circuit ic manufacturing process 
capital and operating costs of a fabrication facility are very high so semiconductor manufacturers are seeking ways to improve overall equipment efficiency oee and optimize their processes 
manufacturers are seeking ways to produce  correlate  manage  and analyze data in the production processes 
in a wafer sort area  network software is increasingly being used to manage wafer information  product specific recipes and equipment information 
software tools are used to bring together disparate data to help determine which process zones or tools contribute most significantly to yield loss and to automate and optimize the operational efficiency of the semiconductor fabrication facility 
the software provides a common location and format for presenting this data and doing cross correlation between data types for the purpose of overall equipment efficiency analysis and  ultimately  manufacturing process optimization 
historically  the semiconductor manufacturing companies have maintained an in house  dedicated software development group to develop much of the software used in this market 
this results in highly customized solutions that are inflexible and expensive to maintain 
we believe that many organizations are now looking to third party providers of both standard and customizable solutions to lower their support costs  maximize their engineers productivity and increase the overall functionality of their analysis tools 
our strategy we are a major supplier of wafer probers due to a combination of strengths  including a large installed base  advanced technical capabilities  close relationships with the leading manufacturers of integrated circuits  a broad logo from the sort floor to final test  electroglas hardware and software enable chipmakers to collect  share  analyze and act on essential semiconductor test data saving significant time  increasing yields and improving profitability line of high quality products  and a well established  highly qualified distribution organization

the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  inventory valuation  warranties  allowance for doubtful accounts  and minority equity investments 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments or estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
senior management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue on the sale of our semiconductor manufacturing equipment when we have received a customer purchase order or contract  when we have delivered the products or services  when we can be assured of the total purchase price without making significant concessions and when we are assured of our ability to collect from our customer 
we sell to an industry that is highly cyclical with periods of high demand and significant oversupply 
the companies in the semiconductor equipment manufacturing industry continue to consolidate as they are faced with rapidly increasing capital requirements and expensive technological change 
in recognizing revenue we make certain assumptions and estimates  namely for our established products  we recognize revenue upon product shipment or delivery on the basis that we have a legally enforceable claim on payment and for our newer products  we recognize revenue upon signed customer acceptance 
new products are defined as products that have a substantially different platform than our established products 
we consider a substantially different platform to be a system that performs a different function from our established products or significantly different functionality in our established products eg  wafer probing systems compared to existing wafer probers 
we consider a new system routinely accepted in the marketplace when three to five successful installations based on our acceptance criteria have been put into customer production 
with respect to collections from our customers  we assume that  based on past history  we will continue to collect our receivables from them without significant delays in payments or product concessions  despite the fact that they have larger financial size relative to us and despite our dependence on them in a heavily concentrated industry 
in an arrangement with multiple deliverables typically a tool sale bundled with any of the following a training  b installation and c maintenance and service  the delivered items are considered a separate unit of accounting if all of the following criteria are met i the delivered items have value to the customer on a stand alone basis  ii objective and reliable evidence of fair value of the undelivered item exists  and iii if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to a delivered item  delivery or performance of the undelivered item is considered probable and substantially in the control of electroglas 
revenue related to maintenance and service contracts is recognized ratably over the duration of the contracts 
we also derive revenue from software licenses and post contract customer support pcs under statement of position sop software revenue recognition 
pcs includes telephone support  bug fixes  and rights to upgrades on a when and if available basis 
we recognize the revenue allocable to software licenses and specified upgrades upon delivery of the software product or upgrade to the end user  unless the fee is not fixed or determinable or collectibility is not probable 
we consider all arrangements with payment terms longer than 
table of contents 
index to financial statements normal not to be fixed or determinable 
if the fee is not fixed or determinable  revenue is recognized as payments become due from the customer 
if collectibility is not considered probable  revenue is recognized when the fee is collected 
we may enter into licenses to provide software to customers for a period of time  during which the customer  for a single fee  is entitled to receive unspecified products as well as maintenance and support until the end of the contract term 
for these contracts  total contract revenue is recognized on a straight line basis over the contract term 
in software arrangements that include rights to multiple software products and or services  we use the residual method  under which revenues are allocated to the undelivered elements based on vendor specific objective evidence of fair value of such undelivered elements and the residual amount of revenues are allocated to the delivered elements 
for those contracts that consist solely of license and maintenance  we recognize licenses based upon the residual method after all licensed software products have been delivered as prescribed by statement of position modification of sop no 
with respect to certain transactions 
we recognize maintenance revenues over the term of the maintenance contract 
vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of maintenance for license agreements is determined by reference to the price paid by the company s customers when maintenance is sold separately that is  the renewal rate 
inventory valuation inventories are stated at lower of cost or market estimated net realizable value using the first in  first out fifo method 
we may record charges to write down inventory due to excess  obsolete and slow moving inventory based on an analysis of the impact of changes in technology on our products including engineering design changes  the timing of these changes and estimates of future sales volumes 
the projections of changes in technology and forecasts of future sales are estimates 
we write down inventory to net realizable value based on anticipated product orders  product order history  forecasts and backlog to assess our inventory requirements 
if there is weak demand in the semiconductor equipment markets and orders fall below our forecasts  additional write downs of inventories may be required which may negatively impact gross margins in future periods 
we periodically review the carrying value of our inventories by evaluating material usage and requirements to determine obsolescence and excess quantities  and reduce the value when appropriate 
as a result of these analyses  we wrote down inventories by million  million and million in  and  respectively 
warranty we generally warrant our products for a period of twelve months and we accrue a current liability for the estimated cost of warranty upon shipment 
for our established products  this accrual is based on historical experience  and for our newer products  this accrual is based on estimates from similar products 
in addition  from time to time  specific warranty accruals are made for specific technical problems 
if we experience unforeseen technical problems with our products in future periods to meet our product warranty requirements  revisions to our estimated cost of warranty may be required  and our gross margins will be negatively impacted 
allowance for doubtful accounts we closely monitor the collection of our accounts receivables and record a reserve for doubtful accounts against aged accounts and specifically identified amounts that we believe are not recoverable 
we sell primarily to large  well established semiconductor manufacturers and semiconductor test companies and we have not experienced significant accounts receivable losses in the past 
we have  however  experienced slow downs in receivable collections  especially during semiconductor equipment down cycles  as customers extend their payment schedules to conserve their cash balances 
if our customers continue to experience down cycles or their financial conditions were to deteriorate  we may be required to increase our reserve for doubtful accounts 
long lived assets we evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets  consisting primarily of property  plant and equipment  whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
in assessing the recoverability of long lived assets  we compare the carrying value to the undiscounted future cash flows the assets are expected to generate 
if the total of the undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the assets  the assets will be written down to their estimated fair value 
significant judgments and assumptions are required in the forecast of future operating results used in the preparation of the estimated future cash flows  including long term forecasts of overall market conditions and our market share 
further  in the course of reviewing our business operations  we may consider divesting certain business operations 
changes in these estimates and business divestures could have a material adverse effect on

charges related to asset impairments are recorded in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
minority equity investments we have two minority equity investments in non publicly traded companies that are recorded at the original cost reduced by assessed impairment in value  where appropriate 
in determining if and when certain minority equity investment s decline in value below cost is other than temporary  we evaluate the market conditions  equity securities offering prices  trends of earnings  price multiples  and other key measures for our investments accounted for at cost 
when we believe such a decline to be other than temporary  we recognize an impairment loss in the current period s operating results to the extent of the decline 
for securities that do not have a readily determinable market price  we compare the net carrying amount of our cost method investments to similar equity securities with quoted prices when possible after giving effect to differences in risk premiums  estimated future cash flows  and other factors influencing the market value of the securities 
when comparisons to quoted securities are not practical  we estimate the fair value based on recent sales and purchases of similar unquoted equity securities  independent appraisals  or internally prepared appraisals to estimate the fair value 
results of operations the components of our statements of operations  expressed as a percentage of net sales  are as follows years ended december  net sales cost of sales gross profit loss operating expenses engineering  research and development expenses sales  general and administrative expenses in process research and development charges restructuring charges impairment charges total operating expenses operating loss interest income interest expense gain on revaluation of warrants gain on sales of product lines other income  net loss before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net loss net sales net sales were million in  down from million in net sales were million in  down from million in these decreases were due primarily to lower revenue on system sales of our core prober business as a result of lower sales prices in versus following the downturn in the semiconductor industry as our customers continued to curtail their capital spending in response to persisting excess production capacity conditions as well as a decrease in our market share for prober products 

table of contents 
index to financial statements despite the overall decline in prober revenue in  shipments of prober systems increased in versus historically  the semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industries have been cyclical 
we continue to have limited visibility with respect to the level of orders for the coming quarters 
net sales in were also down from due to the sale of our software sold in the third quarter of and inspection sold in the fourth quarter of product lines 
sales to related parties are priced in the same manner as other customers 
net sales are comprised of prober systems  inspection products  software  and aftermarket sales  consisting primarily of after sales services  spare parts  upgrades and training 
service revenue was less than of annual net sales during the last three fiscal years 
net sales of our products are as follows years ended december  in thousands prober systems inspection products software products aftermarket sales international sales as a percentage of total sales for the years  and were  and  respectively 
the increase in international sales as a percentage of total sales in from was primarily due to an increase in asian sales relative to a decline in north american sales 
the decrease in international sales as a percentage of total sales in from was primarily due to a greater decrease in european sales relative to the decrease in north american sales 
during  and  we experienced weakness across all of our major geographic regions 
sales in france included in international sales represented  and of our net sales in  and  respectively 
sales to the rest of asia and europe were primarily denominated in united states dollars  except for france where the invoiced currency was a mix of the united states dollar and the euro 
we expect international sales to represent a significant percentage of net sales and fluctuate as a percentage of total sales as individual manufacturers and semiconductor test companies address their capacity needs at differing stages of the semiconductor production cycle 
gross profit loss gross profit loss  as a percentage of sales  was  and in  and  respectively 
the improvement in gross profit in compared to was due to lower manufacturing overhead expenses as a result of our relocation of manufacturing operations from the us to singapore and other restructuring efforts 
this decrease in expenses was offset somewhat by lower revenue per system due to lower average selling prices in as compared to the decrease in gross profit in compared to was due primarily to reduced unit sales volumes in and high fixed manufacturing costs as a percentage of total costs in resulting from redundant us manufacturing operations as we established our new manufacturing operations in singapore in in addition  we wrote down inventories by million  million and million in  and  respectively 
we periodically review the carrying value of our inventories by evaluating material usage and manufacturing requirements to determine inventory obsolescence and excess quantities  and we reduce the carrying value of inventory when appropriate 
the write down in fiscal resulted primarily from identified obsolescence of discontinued and sold product lines as we focused our business on our core prober products 
the write down in fiscal increased over as the outlook for demand in semiconductor equipment in the cyclical downturn continued to be weak 
we generally warrant our products for a period of twelve months and accrue the estimated cost of warranty upon shipment 
in  due to the sale of the inspection product lines  the accrued liability for estimated cost of warranty was increased by million for additional costs to outsource support of customers through the end of their warranty term and for additional warranties associated with discontinuing and selling the product lines 
in due to the establishment of new manufacturing operations in singapore and the potential for higher defect rates from 
table of contents 
index to financial statements the new plant  the accrued liability for estimated cost of warranty was increased by million from the previous year 
we believe that our gross profit will continue to be affected by a number of factors  including changes in demand for semiconductors  competitive pressures on average selling prices  product mix  the level of software sales  our share of the available market  excess manufacturing capacity costs and the proportion of international sales 
continued weak demand and changes in market conditions may cause orders to be below forecasts  which may result in additional excess inventory  which would cause additional write downs of inventories and would negatively impact gross profit in future periods 
engineering  research and development expenses engineering  research and development  or er d expenses were  and  as a percentage of sales  for  and  respectively 
in  er d expenses were million  down from million in this decrease  as a percentage of sales and in spending year over year  was primarily due to reduced employee headcount and related costs  reductions in outside services and reduced costs due to the sale of software product lines to fei company during er d expenses were million in and while er d spending was the same in total for both and  in there were increases in outside service and consulting costs related to product development and increased travel  offset by decreased engineering development and reduced headcount related expenses as compared to in the current business climate  we intend to control discretionary expenses and continue investing in selective new product development programs 
however  we expect engineering  research and development expenses to decrease in from levels in absolute dollar value due to the sales of our inspection products and software product lines during engineering  research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries  project materials  consultant fees  and other costs associated with our ongoing efforts in hardware and software product development and enhancement  including expenses for tailoring our products to conform to customer requirements 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative  or sg a expenses were  and  as a percentage of sales  in  and  respectively 
in  sg a expenses were million  down from million in this decrease was primarily due to headcount reductions and other cost savings as a result of spending restrictions and cost control measures 
these decreases were partially offset by increased commissions to outside sales representatives because of increased sales to asia 
these savings were somewhat offset by the additional rent charge of million recorded in the quarter ended march  related to the amortization of the deficiency between the fair value and the guaranteed residual value of our san jose campus 
in  sg a expenses were million  up from million in this increase was primarily due to increased promotional and trade show expenses as well as additional rent charges of million related to the amortization of our san jose campus  partially offset by reduced employee costs and sales commissions because of reduced year over year headcount levels 
restructuring charges singapore relocation and us workforce reduction in january  we announced a restructuring plan to reduce our us workforce and exit certain facilities in connection with the relocation of our manufacturing operations to singapore 
as a result of the continued semiconductor equipment downturn  and to better align our cost structure with the market demand for our products  we announced further workforce reductions in october overall  employees were designated for termination and employees were terminated 
we recorded a restructuring charge of million in during  an additional employees were designated for termination and were terminated 
we recorded a restructuring charge of million in  primarily for severance packages 

table of contents 
index to financial statements international office closures during september and october of  we announced plans to close our sales office in japan and other offices in europe and asia 
during the fourth quarter of  employees were designated for termination and were terminated 
in  we recorded a restructuring charge of million for severance payments  legal and accounting fees related to the closures  and asset write downs 
in  nine employees designated to be terminated in were removed from the termination list  primarily due to the sale of certain product lines 
further  we recorded an additional restructuring charge of million in  primarily due to additional costs for office closures 
as a result of these restructuring efforts and the sales of product lines in  we expect payroll and benefit payments to decrease by million to million in compared to restructuring charges of million are included in accrued liabilities and are anticipated to be substantially paid in impairment charges in as a result of our assessment of current semiconductor capital equipment market conditions and the related effect on our business  we concluded that there were indicators of impairment of our long lived assets 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we performed an impairment test  which compared currently utilized property and equipment and non current assets net book values with the expected undiscounted cash flows from these assets 
the estimated undiscounted cash flows of the assets currently in use were sufficient to recover the net book value of these assets 
due to continued declines in corporate real estate values in the san jose area  management concluded that there were indicators of impairment for the portion of the corporate campus that is currently not being utilized and undertook a review of the value of these assets for possible impairment 
based on management s evaluation and the results of an independent appraisal  we recorded an impairment charge of million for the unused portion of our corporate campus 
in addition  we recorded a million impairment charge for fixed assets that were no longer in use 
in  we performed a similar impairment test of property and equipment and non current assets 
based on the quoted market price of the estimated fair value of the assets  we recorded an impairment charge of million to write down the carrying value of certain fixed assets and non current assets held for use in the prober division to their estimated fair values 
we also recorded million related to the write down of our long term minority equity investment in nanonexus 
although we do not anticipate that we will be required to record additional impairment charges  the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and the severity of these cycles is difficult to predict 
during a down cycle  we must be in a position to adjust our cost and expense structure to prevailing market conditions  which could therefore affect the sufficiency of estimated future cash flows to recover net book value of these assets and require us to record additional impairment charges 
interest income interest income was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the year over year decreases were principally due to declining interest rates and lower average yearly cash and short term investment balances  which declined each year 
also  in march  we used funds to purchase our corporate campus and we used cash in operations in and interest expense interest expense was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the year over year increases were principally due to a full year of interest paid on convertible notes in and one half year paid in the change in over also included a million non cash interest expense charge related to the beneficial conversion feature triggered during the first quarter of related to our convertible subordinated notes see note  convertible subordinated notes and warrants

provision benefit for income taxes the income tax provision benefit was million  million and million in  and respectively 
the income tax benefit resulted from a reversal of previously recorded income tax reserves based on changes in estimated exposures in tax jurisdictions 
the income tax benefit primarily resulted from a million additional refund due to a change in tax law arising from the enactment of the job creation and worker assistance act of and a million reversal of previously recorded income tax reserves for tax years up to and including relating principally to changes in estimates of these tax reserves 
the tax provision of million in resulted from the establishment of a full valuation allowance against total net deferred tax assets 
realization of our deferred tax assets depends on us generating sufficient taxable income in future years in appropriate tax jurisdictions to obtain benefit from the reversal of temporary differences and from net operating loss and credit carryforwards 
due to the uncertainty of the timing and amount of such realization  our management concluded that a full valuation allowance of million was required at december  synthetic lease of corporate campus in march  we entered into a million  five year synthetic lease for approximately acres of land in san jose  california 
a synthetic lease is a lease that is treated as an operating lease for accounting purposes and a capital lease for tax purposes 
under our synthetic lease  third party lessors funded of the acquisition and construction costs relating to properties leased to us for our corporate campus 
in january  we provided the lessors with a notice to purchase the san jose  california property by march in december  we received a fair market appraisal of the property for million  million less than the guaranteed residual lease value of million 
under eitf  implementation issues in accounting for leasing transactions involving special purpose entities  beginning on the date the deficiency becomes probable  the expected deficiency is accrued by the lessee using the straight line method over the remaining term of the lease 
because we provided the lessor with a notice to purchase the leased assets by march

index to financial statements  the gross lease payments were calculated over the remaining four months of the lease 
thus  we began amortizing the million deficiency at million per month effective december  and recorded million of additional rent expense in the first quarter of we completed the purchase of the property in march the long term lease receivable and cash collateral were used to fund the purchase price 
the land and buildings were recorded at fair value plus closing costs  approximately million and the accrued rent of million was paid 
as a result of the purchase  depreciation expense has increased by approximately million per year  and rent expense and interest income has decreased by approximately million and million  respectively  per year based on current interest rates  effective the second quarter of liquidity and capital resources our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaled million at december   a decrease of million from million at december  cash used in operating activities was million for the year  an improvement of million over million used in operating activities in our net loss decreased by million in to million compared to million in the million improvement in cash used in operating activities in reflects the cash savings from the reduced net loss as adjusted for an increase in non cash charges of million to million in from million in and an increase in changes in current assets and liabilities of million to million in from million in the non cash charges of million in consisted primarily of million depreciation and amortization  million in lease impairment charges  million of inventory write downs  million of asset impairment charges  and million interest expense on our convertible notes  partially offset by a million gain on the sale of our software and inspection product lines 
the change in net operating assets of million in primarily resulted from a decrease of million in inventories  net of million in inventory write downs and million inventory disposed through the sale of the inspection product lines  and an increase of million in accounts payable  partially offset by an increase of million in accounts receivable and a decrease of million in accrued liabilities primarily due to the elimination of synthetic lease obligations through the purchase of our san jose campus in march we expect cash used in operating activities to decrease further in compared to due to anticipated increased gross margins in on increased sales  anticipated savings from restructuring efforts and anticipated lower spending levels due to the sale of the software and inspection product lines in this will be somewhat offset by payment of approximately million of restructuring charges in cash provided by investing activities was million in largely due to proceeds received from sale of investments 
our utilization of investments decreased by million in to million as compared to million in the release of million restricted cash from the synthetic lease of our corporate campus was offset by the purchase of the campus for million in march in addition  we received net proceeds from the sale of our inspection products and software product lines of million 
cash used in financing activities in was million primarily due to million in interest payments on convertible subordinated notes partially offset by million proceeds of sales of common stock to employees 
cash provided by financing activities in of million was primarily the million net proceeds raised from the issuance of convertible subordinated notes and million proceeds of sales of common stock to employees  partially offset by a million payment made on our japan credit facility and a million interest payment on the convertible subordinated notes 
in june  we completed a million private placement of fixed rate convertible subordinated notes due and warrants to purchase  shares of common stock 
the net proceeds from this placement were million

index to financial statements price of per share 
the notes contain a beneficial conversion feature  which was triggered on february  as a result  the conversion price was lowered to per share and an additional  common shares will be issuable upon conversion of the notes 
this adjustment to the conversion price resulted in a million non cash charge to interest expense in our first quarter of in january  we entered into a three year operating lease for a  square foot manufacturing facility in singapore with annual lease payments of approximately million 
our principal source of liquidity as of december  consisted of million of cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments 
during  we took a number of steps to reduce our utilization of cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments  including the sales of product lines  spending controls and headcount reductions 
as a result  our utilization of cash in operating activities declined over the year from million in the first quarter to million in the second quarter  million in the third quarter and cash provided by operating activities of million in the fourth quarter 
cash provided from operations in the fourth quarter of was primarily due to a decrease in inventory and accounts receivable and an increase in accrued liabilities and accounts payable 
we currently anticipate that our available cash and cash equivalents at december  should be sufficient to meet our anticipated needs for working capital and capital expenditures to support planned activities through we are committed to the successful execution of our operating plan and will take further action as necessary to align our operations and reduce expenses 
however  we may require additional capital to fund our future operations 
external financing vehicles have been and are expected to continue to be available to us 
if adequate funds are not available or are not available on terms favorable to us  we may not be able to continue to operate our business pursuant to our current business plan and our ability to run our business would be impaired

however  if we enter into any such arrangement with a variable interest entity in the future  our consolidated financial position or results of operations may be adversely impacted 
because we completed the purchase of our san jose  california corporate campus in march  fin does not have an impact on our current financial statements 
factors that may affect results and financial condition semiconductor industry downturns adversely affect our revenues and operating results 
our business largely depends on capital expenditures by semiconductor manufacturers and semiconductor test companies  which in turn depend on the current and anticipated market demand for integrated circuits and products that use integrated circuits 
the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and has historically experienced periods of oversupply resulting in significantly reduced demand for capital equipment 
the most recent downturn  which began in has been severe and prolonged 
as a result  our ability to accurately forecast future revenues and expense levels is limited 
during a down cycle  we must be in a position to adjust our cost and expense structure to prevailing market conditions 
our ability to reduce expenses may be limited by the need to invest in the engineering  research and development and marketing required to penetrate targeted markets and maintain extensive customer service and support 
during periods of rapid growth  we must be able to rapidly increase manufacturing capacity and personnel to meet customer demand 
we cannot assure you that these objectives can be met  which would likely have a material and adverse effect on our business and operating results 
we have recently experienced substantial declines in revenues and increases in operating losses  and we may experience additional declines in revenues and increases in operating losses in the future 
our historical financial results have been  and our future financial results are anticipated to be  subject to substantial fluctuations 
our total revenues in were million compared to million in this decline was due primarily to lower revenue on system sales of our core prober business as a result of the current semiconductor industry downturn  excess capacity and the global economic slowdown combined with lower software and inspection products revenues due to the sale of our software and inspection product lines during we incurred a net loss of million in compared to a net loss of million in continued current economic slowdown and continued decline in demand for our products and services and other factors could continue to adversely affect our business in the near term and we may continue to experience additional declines in revenue and increases in operating losses 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to return to profitability or that  if we do  we will be able to sustain it 
we currently anticipate that our future cash from operations  available cash and cash equivalents at december   should be sufficient to meet our anticipated needs for working capital and capital expenditures through the next twelve months 
however  we may require additional capital to fund our future operations 
if adequate funds are not available or are not available on terms favorable to us  we may not be able to continue to operate our business pursuant to our current business plan and our ability to run our business would be impacted 
our quarterly results are subject to variability and uncertainty  which could negatively impact our stock price 
we have experienced and expect to continue to experience significant fluctuations in our quarterly results 
our backlog at the beginning of each quarter does not necessarily determine actual sales for any succeeding period 
our sales will often reflect orders shipped in the same quarter that they are received 

table of contents 
index to financial statements moreover  customers may cancel or reschedule shipments  and production difficulties could delay shipments 
for the years ended december   and  five of our customers accounted for  and  respectively  of our net sales 
if one or more of our major customers delayed  ceased or significantly curtailed its purchases  it could cause our quarterly results to fluctuate and would likely have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
other factors that may influence our operating results in a particular quarter include the timing of the receipt of orders from major customers  product mix  competitive pricing pressures  the relative proportions of domestic and international sales  our ability to design  manufacture and introduce new products on a cost effective and timely basis  the delay between expenses to further develop marketing and service capabilities and the realization of benefits from those improved capabilities  and the introduction of new products by our competitors 
accordingly  our results of operations are subject to significant variability and uncertainty from quarter to quarter  which could adversely affect our stock price 
if we do not continue to develop and successfully market new products  our business will be negatively affected 
we believe that our future success will depend in part upon our ability to continue to enhance existing products and to develop and manufacture new products  particularly those related to the implementation of our strategy to become a process management tool provider 
as a result  we expect to continue investing in selective new wafer prober product development programs  although we expect engineering  research and development expenses to decrease in due to the sales of our inspection and software product lines 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in the introduction  marketing and cost effective manufacture of any of our new products  that we will be able to develop and introduce new products in a timely manner  enhance our existing products and processes to satisfy customer needs or achieve market acceptance  or that the new markets for which we are developing new products or expect to sell current products  such as the market for mm wafer probers  markets related to the growth of the strip test market for final test will develop sufficiently 
to develop new products successfully  we depend on close relationships with our customers and the willingness of those customers to share information with us 
the failure to develop products and introduce them successfully and in a timely manner could adversely affect our competitive position and results of operations 
if we do not successfully compete in the markets in which we do business  our business and results of operations will be negatively affected 
our major competitors in the prober market are tokyo electron limited tel and tokyo seimitsu tsk  both of which are based in japan 
some of our competitors have greater financial  engineering and manufacturing resources than we do as well as larger service organizations and long standing customer relationships 
our competitors can be expected to continue to improve the design and performance of their products and to introduce new products with competitive price performance characteristics 
competitive pressures may force price reductions that could adversely affect our results of operations 
although we believe we have certain technological and other advantages over our competitors  maintaining and capitalizing on these advantages will require us to continue a high level of investment in engineering  research and development  marketing  and customer service and support 
we can not assure you that we will have sufficient resources to continue to make these investments or that we will be able to make the technological advances necessary to maintain such competitive advantages 
our outstanding convertible notes may be required to be repaid if not converted prior to their maturity  and may  if converted  result in additional dilution to holders of our common stock  all of which may adversely affect the value of our common stock 
in june  we issued million in convertible notes and related warrants 
the notes entitle the holders to convert the notes into an aggregate of  shares of our common stock at a conversion price of per share  significantly in excess of recent trading prices of our common stock 
in connection with the issuance of the notes  we also issued warrants for the purchase of  shares of our common stock that are exercisable at a price of per share  also significantly in excess of recent trading prices of our common stock 
in certain circumstances  we may force the conversion of all or a portion of the notes and may also redeem the notes 
however  unless prior to june the price of our common stock exceeds at least per share  we cannot force the automatic conversion of the notes and we will be obligated to pay the notes in full at maturity 
we may voluntarily redeem the notes between june and june for an aggregate redemption price of as high as approximately million plus accrued interest

if we do not successfully protect our intellectual property  our business could be negatively impacted 
our success depends in significant part on our intellectual property 
while we attempt to protect our intellectual property through patents  copyrights and trade secrets  we believe that our success will depend more upon innovation  technological expertise and distribution strength 
there can be no assurance that we will successfully protect our technology or that competitors will not be able to develop similar technology independently 
no assurance can be given that the claims allowed on any patents we hold will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology 
in addition  we cannot assure you that any patents issued to us will not be challenged  invalidated or circumvented  or that the rights granted thereunder will provide us with competitive advantages 
some customers using certain of our products have received letters from technivison corporation and the lemelson medical education research foundation  or lemelson  alleging that the manufacture of semiconductor products infringes certain patents currently held by lemelson 
we believe that our products do not infringe the lemelson patents and to the best of our knowledge  lemelson has not asserted that we may be liable for infringing its patents 
however  we have received notice from some of the customers receiving letters from lemelson that  in the event it is determined that the customers actions infringe the lemelson patents  the customers may seek reimbursement from us for some damages or expenses resulting from the infringement 
we have in turn notified our suppliers that we may seek reimbursement from them for any resultant costs and fees we incur as a consequence of our customers being held liable for infringement of the lemelson patents 
in addition  some of our suppliers were notified that their equipment may infringe certain lemelson patents 
these suppliers are currently engaged in litigation with lemelson as regards fourteen of lemelson s patents 
in january  the trial court held that the patent claims at issue were invalid  unenforceable and not infringed by the suppliers 
lemelson has announced that it will appeal this decision 
we cannot predict the outcome of this or similar litigation or the effect of such litigation on our business 
disruptions or termination of some of our key sources of supplies could damage our customer relations and harm our business 
we use numerous suppliers to supply components and subassemblies for the manufacture and support of our products and systems 
while we make reasonable efforts to ensure that such components and subassemblies are available from multiple suppliers  this is not always possible 
although we seek to reduce our dependence on these limited source suppliers  disruption or termination of certain of these sources could occur and such disruptions could have at least a temporary adverse effect on our results of operations and damage customer relationships 
moreover  a prolonged inability to obtain certain components  or a significant increase in the price of one or more of these components  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if we do not successfully address the challenges inherent in conducting international sales and operations  our business and results of operations will be negatively impacted 
we have experienced fluctuations in our international sales and operations 
international sales accounted for  and of our net sales for  and  respectively 
we expect international sales to continue to represent a significant percentage of net sales 
we are subject to certain risks inherent in doing business in international markets  one or more of which could adversely affect our international sales and operations  including the imposition of government controls on our business and or business partners  fluctuations in the us dollar  which could increase our foreign sales prices in local currencies  export license requirements  restrictions on the export of technology  changes in tariffs  legal and cultural differences in the conduct of business  difficulties in staffing and managing international operations

index to financial statements longer payment cycles  difficulties in collecting accounts receivable in foreign countries  withholding taxes that limit the repatriation of earnings  trade barriers and restrictions  immigration regulations that limit our ability to deploy employees  political instability  war and acts of terrorism  and variations in effective income tax rates among countries where we conduct business 
although these and similar regulatory  geopolitical and global economic factors have not yet had a material adverse effect on our operations  there can be no assurance that such factors will not adversely impact our operations in the future or require us to modify our current business practices 
in addition  the laws of certain foreign countries where we do business may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
further  we have found it difficult to penetrate the large japanese market  which represents a significant percentage of the worldwide wafer prober market 
we recently changed our sales strategy in japan from a direct sales strategy to the use of distributors  and we closed our sales office in japan 
our past sales in japan have not been significant and we cannot assure you that the use of distributors will result in an increase in sales in this market 
our business will be harmed if we cannot hire and retain key employees 
our future success partly depends on our ability to hire and retain key personnel 
we also need to attract additional skilled personnel in all areas to grow our business 
while many of our current employees have many years of service with us  there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain our existing personnel or attract additional qualified employees in the future 
our common stock is currently trading at a price significantly below the exercise price of most of our outstanding stock options 
as a result  these under water options are less useful as a motivation and retention tool for our existing employees 
on july  we filed a schedule to with the securities and exchange commission in connection with an exchange offer to exchange certain options of eligible employees for new options with a new exercise price in order to increase the motivational and retention value of our stock option program 
during the third quarter of  employees elected to participate in this program 
our charter documents and shareholders rights plan  as well as delaware law  could make it difficult for a third party to acquire us 
our shareholders rights plan and certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and delaware law could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in our control 
such provisions could diminish the opportunities for a stockholder to participate in tender offers  including tender offers at a price above the then current market value of our common stock 
such provisions may also inhibit fluctuations in the market price of our common stock that could result from takeover attempts 
in addition  the board of directors  without further stockholder approval  may issue additional series of preferred stock that could have the effect of delaying  deterring or preventing a change in our control 
the issuance of additional series of preferred stock could also adversely affect the voting power of the holders of common stock  including the loss of voting control to others 
we have no current plans to issue any preferred stock
