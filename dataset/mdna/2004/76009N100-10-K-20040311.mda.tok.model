item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are the largest rent to own operator in the united states with an approximate market share based on store count 
at december   we operated  company owned stores nationwide and in puerto rico  including stores located in wisconsin and operated by our subsidiary get it now  llc under the name get it now 
another of our subsidiaries  colortyme  is a national franchisor of rent to own stores 
at december   colortyme had franchised stores in states  of which operated under the colortyme name and stores of which operated under the rent a center name 
our stores generally offer high quality durable products such as home electronics  appliances  computers  and furniture and accessories under flexible rental purchase agreements that generally allow the customer to obtain ownership of the merchandise at the conclusion of an agreed upon rental period 
these rental purchase agreements are designed to appeal to a wide variety of customers by allowing them to obtain merchandise that they might otherwise be unable to obtain due to insufficient cash resources or a lack of access to credit 
these agreements also cater to customers who only have a temporary need  or who simply desire to rent rather than purchase the merchandise 
we have pursued an aggressive growth strategy since we have sought to acquire underperforming stores to which we could apply our operating model as well as open new stores 
as a result  the acquired stores have generally experienced more significant revenue growth during the initial periods following their acquisition than in subsequent periods 
because of significant growth since our formation our historical results of operations and period to period comparisons of such results and other financial data  including the rate of earnings growth  may not be meaningful or indicative of future results 
on march   we completed the purchase of five canadian rent to own stores for million canadian dollars million us dollars 
the five stores are located in the cities of edmonton and calgary in the province of alberta 
this acquisition marks the commencement of our business operations in canada 
we plan to accomplish our future growth through selective and opportunistic acquisitions  with an emphasis on new store development 
typically  a newly opened store is profitable on a monthly basis in the ninth to twelfth month after its initial opening 
historically  a typical store has achieved cumulative break even profitability in to months after its initial opening 
total financing requirements of a typical new store approximate  with roughly of that amount relating to the purchase of rental merchandise inventory 
a newly opened store historically has achieved results consistent with other stores that have been operating within the system for greater than two years by the end of its third year of operation 
as a result  our quarterly earnings are impacted by how many new stores we opened during a particular quarter and the quarters preceding it 
there can be no assurance that we will open any new stores in the future  or as to the number  location or profitability thereof 
in addition  to provide any additional funds necessary for the continued pursuit of our operating and growth strategies  we may incur from time to time additional short or long term bank indebtedness and may issue  in public or private transactions  equity and debt securities 
the availability and attractiveness of any outside sources of financing will depend on a number of factors  some of which will relate to our financial condition and performance  and some of which are beyond our control  such as prevailing interest rates and general economic conditions 
there can be no assurance additional financing will be available  or if available  will be on terms acceptable to us 
if a change in control occurs  we may be required to offer to repurchase all of our outstanding subordinated notes at of their principal amount  plus accrued interest to the date of repurchase 
our senior credit facility restricts our ability to repurchase the subordinated notes  including in the event of a change in control 
in addition  a change in control would result in an event of default under our senior credit facilities  which would allow our lenders to accelerate the indebtedness owed to them 
in the event a change in control occurs  we cannot be sure we would have enough funds to immediately pay our accelerated senior credit facility obligations and all of the subordinated notes  or that we would be able to obtain financing to do so on favorable terms  if at all 

table of contents forward looking statements the statements  other than statements of historical facts  included in this report are forward looking statements 
forward looking statements generally can be identified by the use of forward looking terminology  such as may  will  would  expect  intend  could  estimate  should  anticipate or believe 
we believe the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are accurate 
however  we cannot assure you that such expectations will occur 
our actual future performance could differ materially from such statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to uncertainties regarding our ability to open new stores  our ability to acquire additional rent to own stores on favorable terms  our ability to enhance the performance of these acquired stores  our ability to control store level costs  our ability to realize benefits from our margin enhancement initiatives  the results of our litigation  the passage of legislation adversely affecting the rent to own industry  interest rates  our ability to collect on our rental purchase agreements  changes in our effective tax rate  changes in our stock price and the number of shares of common stock that we may or may not repurchase  and the other risks detailed from time to time in our sec reports 
additional factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our expectations are discussed under the section entitled risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
you should not unduly rely on these forward looking statements  which speak only as of the date of this report 
except as required by law  we are not obligated to publicly release any revisions to these forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this report or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events 
critical accounting policies involving critical estimates  uncertainties or assessments in our financial statements the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
in applying accounting principles  we must often make individual estimates and assumptions regarding expected outcomes or uncertainties 
as you might expect  the actual results or outcomes are generally different than the estimated or assumed amounts 
these differences are usually minor and are included in our consolidated financial statements as soon as they are known 
our estimates  judgments and assumptions are continually evaluated based on available information and experience 
because of the use of estimates inherent in the financial reporting process  actual results could differ from those estimates 
actual results related to the estimates and assumptions made by us in preparing our consolidated financial statements will emerge over periods of time  such as estimates and assumptions underlying the determination of our self insurance liabilities 
these estimates and assumptions are closely monitored by us and periodically adjusted as circumstances warrant 
for instance  our liability for our self insured retentions related to our workers compensation  general liability  medical and auto liability may be adjusted based on higher or lower actual loss experience 
although there is greater risk with respect to the accuracy of these 
table of contents estimates and assumptions because of the period over which actual results may emerge  such risk is mitigated by our ability to make changes to these estimates and assumptions over the same period 
in preparing our financial statements at any point in time  we are also periodically faced with uncertainties  the outcomes of which are not within our control and will not be known for prolonged periods of time 
as discussed in part i  item legal proceedings and the notes to our consolidated financial statements  we are involved in actions relating to claims that our rental purchase agreements constitute installment sales contracts  violate state usury laws or violate other state laws enacted to protect consumers  claims asserting violations of wage and hour laws in our employment practices  as well as claims we violated the federal securities laws 
we  together with our counsel  make estimates  if determinable  of our probable liabilities and record such amounts in our consolidated financial statements 
these estimates represent our best estimate  or may be the minimum range of probable loss when no single best estimate is determinable 
we  together with our counsel  monitor developments related to these legal matters and  when appropriate  adjustments are made to liabilities to reflect current facts and circumstances 
we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets  on january  it requires suspension of amortization on intangible assets with indefinite lives and establishes a requirement to test goodwill for impairment annually or at other times if events have occurred or circumstances exist that indicate the carrying value of goodwill may no longer be recoverable 
the impairment test for goodwill involves a two step process step one consists of a comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including the goodwill allocated to each reporting unit 
if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value  step two requires the comparison of the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill 
any excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill over the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill will be recorded as an impairment loss 
fair value of the business units is determined using the income approach 
under the income approach  value is dependent on the present value of future cash flows and discount rates 
based on an assessment of our accounting policies and the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies  we believe that our consolidated financial statements fairly present in all material respects the financial condition  results of operations and cash flows of our company as of  and for  the periods presented in this report 
however  we do not suggest that other general risk factors  such as those discussed elsewhere in this report as well as changes in our growth objectives or performance of new or acquired stores  could not adversely impact our consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows in future periods 
significant accounting policies our significant accounting policies are summarized below and in note a to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein 
revenue 
merchandise is rented to customers pursuant to rental purchase agreements which provide for weekly or monthly rental terms with non refundable rental payments 
generally  the customer has the right to acquire title either through a purchase option or through payment of all required rentals 
rental revenue and fees are recognized over the rental term 
no revenue is accrued because the customer can cancel the rental contract at any time and we cannot enforce collection for non payment of rents 
get it now s revenue from the sale of merchandise through an installment credit sale is recognized at the time of the sale  as is the cost of the merchandise sold  net of a provision for uncollectable accounts 
franchise revenue 
revenue from the sale of rental merchandise is recognized upon shipment of the merchandise to the franchisee 
franchise fee revenue is recognized upon completion of substantially all services and satisfaction of all material conditions required under the terms of the franchise agreement 
depreciation of rental merchandise 
we depreciate our rental merchandise using the income forecasting method 
the income forecasting method of depreciation we use does not consider salvage value and does not allow the depreciation of rental merchandise during periods when it is not generating rental revenue 
the objective of this method of depreciation is to provide for consistent depreciation expense while the 
table of contents merchandise is on rent 
on july   we began accelerating the depreciation on computers that are months old or older and which have become idle using the straight line method for a period of at least six months 
the purpose for this change is to better reflect the depreciable life of a computer in our stores and to encourage the sale of older computers 
though this method will accelerate the depreciation expense on the affected computers  we do not expect it to have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows in future periods 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses include all corporate overhead expenses related to our headquarters such as salaries  taxes and benefits  occupancy  administrative and other operating expenses  as well as regional directors salaries  travel and office expenses

effective january   under sfas all goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer subject to amortization

liquidity requirements 
our primary liquidity requirements are for debt service  rental merchandise purchases  capital expenditures  and our store expansion program 
our primary sources of liquidity have been cash provided by operations  borrowings and sales of debt and equity securities 
in the future  we may incur additional debt  or may issue debt or equity securities to finance our operating and growth strategies 
the availability and attractiveness of any outside sources of financing will depend on a number of factors  some of which relate to our financial condition and performance  and some of which are beyond our control  such as prevailing interest rates and general economic conditions 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available  or if available  that it will be on terms we find acceptable 
we believe that the cash flow generated from operations  together with amounts available under our senior credit facilities  will be sufficient to fund our debt service requirements  rental merchandise purchases  capital expenditures  and our store expansion programs during our revolving credit facilities provide us with revolving loans in an aggregate principal amount not exceeding million  of which million was available at march  at march   we had million in cash 
while our operating cash flow has been strong and we expect this strength to continue  our liquidity could be negatively impacted if we do not remain as profitable as we expect 
deferred taxes 
on march   president bush signed into law the job creation and worker assistance act of  which provides for accelerated tax depreciation deductions for qualifying assets placed in service between september  and september  under these provisions  percent of the basis of qualifying property is deductible in the year the property is placed in service  with the remaining percent of the basis depreciated under the normal tax depreciation rules 
for assets placed in service between may  and december   the jobs and growth tax relief reconciliation act of increased the percent of the basis of qualifying property deductible in the year the property is placed in service from to 
accordingly  our cash flow will benefit from having a lower current cash tax obligation  which in turn will provide additional cash flows from operations until the deferred tax liabilities begin to reverse 
we estimate that our operating cash flow will have increased by approximately million through before the deferred tax liabilities begin to reverse over a three year period beginning in rental merchandise purchases 
we purchased million  million and million of rental merchandise during the years  and  respectively 
capital expenditures 
we make capital expenditures in order to maintain our existing operations as well as for new capital assets in new and acquired stores 
we spent million  million and million on capital expenditures in the years  and  respectively  and expect to spend approximately million in acquisitions and new store openings 
during  we continued our strategy of increasing our store base through opening new stores  as well as through opportunistic acquisitions 
we spent approximately million acquiring stores and accounts for the year ended december  it is our intention to increase the number of stores we operate by an average of approximately per year over the next several years 

table of contents in february  we completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of rent to own stores from rent way  inc for an aggregate purchase price of million in cash 
of the aggregate purchase price  we held back million to pay for various indemnified liabilities and expenses  if any  of which million has been repaid and up to million we expect will be repaid in august of we funded the acquisition entirely from cash on hand 
of the stores acquired  stores were merged with our existing store locations 
on february   we announced that we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire rainbow rentals  inc  a rent to own operator  for in cash per share of rainbow common stock 
the acquisition consists of rent to own stores in states 
the agreement also provides that each holder of options of rainbow will receive an amount equal to the difference between and the exercise price of the option 
we intend to fund the acquisition primarily with cash on hand 
the acquisition  which is expected to be completed in the second quarter of  is conditioned upon customary closing conditions for a transaction of this nature  including the receipt of requisite regulatory approval and approval of rainbow s shareholders 
the profitability of our stores tends to grow at a slower rate approximately five years from the time we open or acquire them 
as a result  in order for us to show improvements in our profitability  it is important for us to continue to open stores in new locations or acquire underperforming stores on favorable terms 
there can be no assurance we will be able to acquire or open new stores at the rates we expect  or at all 
we cannot assure you the stores we do acquire or open will be profitable at the same levels that our current stores are  or at all 
borrowings 
the table below shows the scheduled maturity dates of our senior debt outstanding at december  year ending december  in thousands thereafter senior credit facilities 
on may   we entered into a new senior credit facility provided by a syndicate of banks and other financial institutions led by lehman commercial paper  inc  as administrative agent

our senior credit facilities require us to comply with several financial covenants  including a maximum consolidated leverage ratio  a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio

this is defined to include the case where a third party becomes the beneficial owner of or more of our voting stock or certain changes in our board of directors occurs 
senior subordinated notes 
on may   we issued million in senior subordinated notes due  bearing interest at notes  pursuant to an indenture dated may   among rent a center  inc  its subsidiary guarantors and the bank of new york  as trustee 
the proceeds of this offering were used to fund the repurchase and redemption of our then outstanding senior subordinated notes 
the indenture contains covenants that limit rent a center s ability to incur additional debt  sell assets or our subsidiaries  grant liens to third parties  pay dividends or repurchase stock  and engage in a merger or sell substantially all of its assets 
events of default under the indenture include customary events  such as a cross acceleration provision in the event that we default in the payment of other debt due at maturity or upon acceleration for default in an amount exceeding million 
the notes may be redeemed on or after may   at our option  in whole or in part  at a premium declining from 
the notes also require that upon the occurrence of a change of control as defined in the indenture  the holders of the notes have the right to require us to repurchase the notes at a price equal to of the original aggregate principal amount  together with accrued and unpaid interest  if any  to the date of repurchase 
this would trigger an event of default under our senior credit facilities

economic conditions 
although our performance has not suffered in previous economic downturns  we cannot assure you that demand for our products  particularly in higher price ranges  will not significantly decrease in the event of a prolonged recession 
seasonality 
our revenue mix is moderately seasonal  with the first quarter of each fiscal year generally providing higher merchandise sales than any other quarter during a fiscal year  primarily related to the exercise of early purchase options due to our customers receiving federal income tax refunds 
generally  our customers will more frequently exercise their early purchase option on their existing rental purchase agreements or purchase pre leased merchandise off the showroom floor during the first quarter of each fiscal year 
we expect this trend to continue in future periods 
furthermore  we tend to experience slower growth in the number of rental purchase agreements on rent in the third quarter of each fiscal year when compared to other quarters throughout the year 
as a result  we would expect revenues for the third quarter of each fiscal year to remain relatively flat with the prior quarter 
we expect this trend to continue in future periods unless we add significantly to our store base during the third quarter of future fiscal years as a result of new store openings or opportunistic acquisitions

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate sensitivity as of december   we had million in subordinated notes outstanding at a fixed interest rate of  and million in term loans outstanding at interest rates indexed to the eurodollar rate 
the fair value of the subordinated notes is estimated based on discounted cash flow analysis using interest rates currently offered for loans with similar terms to borrowers of similar credit quality 
the fair value of the subordinated notes at december  was million  which is million above their carrying value 
unlike the subordinated notes  the million in term loans have variable interest rates indexed to current eurodollar rates 
as of december   we have not entered into any interest rate swap agreements with respect to term loans under our senior credit facilities 
market risk market risk is the potential change in an instrument s value caused by fluctuations in interest rates 
our primary market risk exposure is fluctuations in interest rates 
monitoring and managing this risk is a continual process carried out by the board of directors and senior management 
we manage our market risk based on an ongoing assessment of trends in interest rates and economic developments  giving consideration to possible effects on both total return and reported earnings 
interest rate risk we hold long term debt with variable interest rates indexed to prime or eurodollar rate that exposes us to the risk of increased interest costs if interest rates rise
