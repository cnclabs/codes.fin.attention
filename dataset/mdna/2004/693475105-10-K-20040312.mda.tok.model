item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive summary the pnc financial services group  inc 
the corporation is one of the largest diversified financial services companies in the united states  operating businesses engaged in regional community banking  wholesale banking  wealth management  asset management and global fund processing services 
the corporation provides certain products and services nationally and others in pnc s primary geographic markets in pennsylvania  new jersey  delaware  ohio and kentucky 
the corporation also provides certain banking  asset management and global fund processing services internationally 
pnc s strategies to enhance shareholder value include expanding its deposit driven banking franchise through internal growth and  as opportunities arise  through targeted acquisitions 
in addition  the corporation plans to leverage its customer base and leading technology to grow the asset management and processing businesses in an efficient and effective manner 
efforts in recent years to reduce risk  grow deposits and diversify the corporation s revenue mix have enabled pnc to improve liquidity and build a strong capital position 
overview of key factors affecting financial performance the financial performance of financial services companies such as pnc is affected by a variety of key factors 
given the nature of its business  pnc s performance is substantially dependent on general economic factors such as overall economic activity  loan demand  interest rates and the shape of the yield curve  and the performance of the equity and debt markets 
pnc  like other financial services companies  does not have the ability to exercise control over these economic factors  although it can manage its business to take advantage of the opportunities offered and to mitigate the risks presented by changes in these factors 
on the other hand  pnc s performance also relies on its ability to develop and execute effective business plans and to maintain an effective risk management program 
during  pnc was able to achieve success in a number of critical areas  impacting pnc s results in and contributing to pnc s ability to continue to grow its businesses and to respond to the challenges it expects to face in and thereafter 
one significant example of these successes was the improvement in client acquisition and retention across most of pnc s businesses 
further  the success of pnc s efforts to enhance cross selling to its client base is evidenced by the year over year increase in fee based income 
on the expense side  pnc s efficiency initiative identified and realized almost million in savings on a run rate basis into  and the corporation is building on this initiative as it moves into managing and deploying capital in a disciplined fashion was another critical factor that affected pnc s financial performance in and should help build its foundation for the future 
pnc deployed excess economic capital to strengthen its banking businesses by acquiring united national  it returned additional excess capital to its shareholders by increasing the quarterly dividend by four percent and repurchasing approximately million of its shares 
economic factors  however  had a negative impact on pnc s overall growth  with a continuation of historically low interest rates and weak loan demand both having a major effect on performance in these economic factors are the areas that pnc s management sees as presenting the greatest challenges for indeed  the key factor affecting pnc s results of operations for that is neither readily predictable nor responsive to actions substantially within pnc s control is likely to be the timing and extent of changes in market interest rates 
also  loan demand should respond positively to improving economic conditions  but the timing and extent of increased loan demand is not now predictable  depending in substantial part on the nature of the continuing economic recovery 
pnc is thus not assuming that its results will reflect significant improvement in this area 
as part of its enhanced risk management framework  pnc has avoided the temptation to respond to the pressures presented by these economic factors by increasing the corporation s risk profile in an effort to bolster short term earnings 
in addition to the need to manage its business effectively to deal with these and other critical economic factors  pnc s success in will depend on its success in a number of other key areas  including maintaining stable asset quality  leveraging the corporation s customer base to deepen relationships and drive revenue growth  leveraging pnc s operating and technology platform to improve efficiency  managing the revenue expense relationship  and building best of class corporate governance and risk management systems

net charge offs for included a million charge off related to a single loan to a wholesale goods retail customer 
a reserve has been provided at december  in connection with this customer s remaining balance 
this is the largest single nonperforming relationship in this business and was supported more by its franchise value than a collateral value 
approximately of the total portfolio in this business is underwritten based on the value of collateral 
pnc business credit loans  including those acquired in the nboc acquisition  are primarily secured loans to borrowers  many of whom are highly leveraged  experiencing rapid growth  or have elected to utilize asset based financing 
as a result  the risk profile of these loans typically reflects a higher risk of default and a greater proportion being classified as nonperforming 
the impact of these loans on the provision for credit losses and the level of nonperforming assets may be even more pronounced during periods of economic downturn 
the ability of customers to borrow under these loan agreements is typically constrained by the amount of collateral that the customer has available to support the loan 
collateral is monitored and periodically audited by pnc business credit to verify its existence and condition 
therefore  other than the charge off described above  net charge offs on asset based loans have historically been relatively low due to recoveries provided by the underlying collateral 
compensation for this higher risk of default is obtained by way of higher interest rates charged 
total noninterest expense increased million in compared with  primarily due to higher average ftes and benefit costs

blackrock earned million for compared with million for earnings increased for compared with the prior year as higher revenue  driven by increases in assets under management and blackrock solutions assignments  and higher investment income more than offset increases in marketing and other operating expenses 
during  blackrock continued to operate in a global marketplace characterized by volatility and economic weakness 
management believes the following factors contributed to financial results in and position the business to continue to produce solid financial performance going forward 
assets under management at december  increased billion  or  compared with assets under management at december  growth in fixed income assets managed by blackrock was the primary factor in the increase from the increase in assets under management reflected net subscriptions of billion and net market appreciation of billion 
over the past five years  assets under management have grown at a compound annual rate of  the majority of which was attributable to new business activity 
the business ended with competitive investment performance in fixed income and liquidity products and continued to experience favorable operating leverage in these areas 
the equity business was restructured with the hiring of a quantitative team to lead the us large cap equity management effort 
new business opportunities remain strong  particularly for international clients and in the insurance sector 
higher revenue in reflected increases in separate account base fees and other income that were partially offset by decreases in separate account performance fees earned on blackrock s fixed income hedge fund and mutual fund revenue 
blackrock will not earn additional performance fees on the fixed income hedge fund until such time as positive investment performance exceeds the high water mark  which  assuming historical returns  could be expected to occur in the second quarter of the increase in separate account base fees resulted from strong growth in fixed income separate account assets

table of contents risk factors the corporation is subject to a number of risks potentially impacting its business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
in addition to the risks described in other parts of this report  including the supervision and regulation section of item and in the risk management and cautionary statement regarding forward looking information sections of this item  the following are key risk factors affecting the corporation 
business and economic conditions the corporation s business and results of operations are sensitive to general business and economic conditions in the united states 
these conditions include the level and movement of interest rates  inflation  monetary supply  fluctuations in both debt and equity capital markets  and the strength of the us economy  in general  and the regional economies in which the corporation conducts business 
a sustained weakness or weakening of the economy could decrease the value of loans held for sale  decrease the demand for loans and other products and services offered by the corporation  increase or decrease usage of unfunded commitments or increase the number of customers and counterparties who become delinquent  file for protection under bankruptcy laws or default on their loans or other obligations to the corporation 
an increase in the number of delinquencies  bankruptcies or defaults could result in a higher level of nonperforming assets  net charge offs  provision for credit losses  and valuation adjustments on loans held for sale 
changes in interest rates could affect the value of certain on balance sheet and off balance sheet financial instruments of the corporation 
changes in interest rates could also affect the value of assets under management or for which processing services are provided 
in a period of rapidly rising interest rates  such assets would likely be negatively impacted by reduced asset values and increased redemptions 
also  changes in equity markets could affect the value of equity investments and the value of net assets under management and for which processing services are provided 
a more detailed description of aspects of the interest rate and market risks facing pnc is included in the risk management section of item of this report 
monetary and other policies the activities and results of operations of bank holding companies and their subsidiaries are affected by monetary  tax and other policies of the government and its agencies  including the board of governors of the federal reserve system federal reserve board 
an important function of the federal reserve board is to regulate the national supply of bank credit 
the federal reserve board employs open market operations in us government securities  changes in the discount rate on bank borrowings and changes in reserve requirements on bank deposits to implement its monetary policy objectives 
these instruments of monetary policy are used in varying combinations to influence the overall level of bank loans  investments and deposits  the interest rates charged on loans and paid for deposits  the price of the dollar in foreign exchange markets and the level of inflation 
the federal reserve board s policies influence the rates of interest that pnc charges on loans and pays on borrowings and interest bearing deposits and can also affect the value of on balance sheet and off balance sheet financial instruments 
those policies also influence  to a significant extent  the cost of funding for the corporation 
it is not possible to predict the nature or timing of future changes in monetary  tax and other policies or the effect that they may have on the corporation s activities and results of operations 
competition pnc operates in a highly competitive environment  both in terms of the products and services offered and the geographic markets in which pnc conducts business 
this environment could become even more competitive in the future  as a result of legislative  regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation in the financial services industry 
the corporation competes with local  regional and national banks  thrifts  credit unions and non bank financial institutions  such as investment banking firms  investment advisory firms  brokerage firms  investment companies  private equity firms  mutual fund complexes and insurance companies  as well as other entities that offer financial and processing services  and through alternative delivery channels such as the internet 
technological advances and legislation  among other changes  have lowered barriers to entry  have made it possible for non bank institutions to offer products and services that traditionally have been provided by banks  and have increased the level of competition faced by the corporation 
many of the corporation s competitors benefit from fewer regulatory constraints and lower cost structures  allowing for more competitive pricing of products and services 
as a result  pnc could lose business to competitors or be forced to price its products and services on less advantageous terms to retain customers 
disintermediation disintermediation is the process of eliminating the role of the intermediary in completing a transaction 
for the financial services industry  this means eliminating or significantly reducing the role of banks and other depository institutions in completing transactions that have traditionally involved banks 
disintermediation could result in  among other things  the loss of customer deposits and decreases in transactions that generate fee income 
asset management performance asset management revenue is primarily based on a percentage of the value of assets under management and performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on assets under management 
a decline in the value of debt and equity instruments  among other things  could cause asset management revenue to decline 
investment performance is an important factor for the level of assets under management 
poor investment performance could impair revenue and growth as existing clients might withdraw funds in favor of better performing products 
also  performance fees could be lower or nonexistent 
additionally  the ability to attract funds from existing and new clients might diminish 

table of contents fund servicing fund servicing fees are primarily derived from the market value of the assets and the number of shareholder accounts administered by the corporation for its clients 
a rise in interest rates or a sustained weakness  weakening or volatility in the debt and equity markets could influence an investor s decision to invest or maintain an investment in a mutual fund or other pooled investment product 
as a result  fluctuations may occur in the level or value of assets for which pnc provides processing services 
a significant investor migration from mutual fund and other pooled investments could have a negative impact on the corporation s revenues by reducing the assets and the number of shareholder accounts it services 
the fund servicing business is also highly competitive with a relatively small number of providers 
there has been and continues to be merger  acquisition and consolidation activity in the financial services industry 
in the future  mergers or consolidations of financial institutions or other financial intermediaries could impact the number of existing or potential fund servicing clients 
acquisitions the corporation expands its business from time to time by acquiring other financial services companies 
factors pertaining to acquisitions that could adversely affect the corporation s business and earnings include  among others anticipated cost savings or potential revenue enhancements that may not be fully realized or realized within the expected time frame  key employee  customer or revenue loss following an acquisition that may be greater than expected  and costs or difficulties related to the integration of acquired businesses that may be greater than expected 
the corporation could also be prevented from pursuing attractive acquisition opportunities due to regulatory restraints 
see the cautionary statement regarding forward looking information section in item of this report for additional information regarding risk factors in connection with the united national acquisition in particular and acquisitions in general 
terrorist activities and international hostilities the impact of terrorist activities and responses to such activities and of international hostilities cannot be predicted with respect to severity or duration  but may adversely affect the economy and financial and capital markets generally  or specific industries and the corporation specifically 
the impact could adversely affect the corporation in a number of ways including  among others  an increase in delinquencies  bankruptcies or defaults that could result in a higher level of nonperforming assets  net charge offs and provision for credit losses 
critical accounting policies and judgments the corporation s consolidated financial statements are prepared based on the application of certain accounting policies  the most significant of which are described in note accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
certain of these policies require numerous estimates and strategic or economic assumptions that may prove inaccurate or be subject to variations which may significantly affect pnc s reported results and financial position for the period or in future periods 
the use of estimates  assumptions  and judgments are necessary when financial assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at  or adjusted to reflect  fair value 
assets and liabilities carried at fair value inherently result in more financial statement volatility 
fair values and the information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based on either quoted market prices or are provided by other independent third party sources  when available 
when such information is not available  management estimates valuation adjustments primarily by using internal cash flow and other financial modeling techniques 
changes in underlying factors  assumptions  or estimates in any of these areas could have a material impact on pnc s future financial condition and results of operations 
allowances for credit losses and unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit the allowances for credit losses and unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit are calculated with the objective of maintaining reserve levels believed by management to be sufficient to absorb estimated probable credit losses 
management s determination of the adequacy of the allowances is based on periodic evaluations of the credit portfolio and other relevant factors 
however  this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates  including  among others  expected default probabilities  loss given default  exposure at default  the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans  value of collateral  estimated losses on consumer loans and residential mortgages  and general amounts for historical loss experience 
the process also considers economic conditions  uncertainties in estimating losses and inherent risks in the various credit portfolios 
all of these factors may be susceptible to significant change 
also  the allocation of the allowance for credit losses to specific loan pools is based on historical loss trends and management s judgment concerning those trends 
commercial loans are the largest category of credits and are the most sensitive to changes in assumptions and judgments underlying the determination of the allowance for credit losses 
approximately million  or  of the total allowance for credit losses at december  has been allocated to the commercial loan category 
this allocation also considers other relevant factors such as actual versus estimated losses  regional and national economic conditions  business segment and portfolio concentrations  industry competition and consolidation  the impact of government regulations  and risk of potential estimation or judgmental errors 
to the extent actual outcomes differ from management estimates  additional provision for credit losses may be required that would adversely impact earnings in future periods 
see the following for additional information allowances for credit losses and unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit in the credit risk management section of item of this report  and note 
table of contents accounting policies  note allowances for credit losses and unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit  and allocation of allowance for credit losses in the statistical information section of item of this report 
loans and commitments held for sale at the time management intends to sell credit exposure  management designates the exposure as held for sale 
at the initial transfer date to held for sale  any lower of cost or market locom adjustment is recorded as a charge off  which on an outstanding loan results in a new cost basis 
on the unfunded portion of the total exposure  a liability is established 
any subsequent adjustment as a result of locom is recorded as a valuation allowance through noninterest income on the loan portion classified as held for sale 
any permanent reduction of the exposure  such as sale or termination of the exposure  may have a positive or negative impact on the exposure s valuation allowance or liability 
this change in valuation allowance or liability is recorded through noninterest income 
although the market value for certain held for sale assets may be readily obtainable  the majority of these types of assets require significant judgments by management as to the value that could be realized at the balance sheet date 
these assumptions include  but are not limited to  the cash flows generated from the asset  the timing of a sale  the value of any collateral  the market conditions for the particular credit  overall investor demand for these assets and the determination of a proper discount rate 
changes in market conditions and actual liquidation experience may result in additional valuation adjustments that could adversely impact earnings in future periods 
see the loans and loans held for sale sections of the consolidated balance sheet review included in item of this report and note accounting policies included in item of this report for additional information 
equity management asset valuation equity management private equity assets are valued at each balance sheet date based on primarily either  in the case of limited partnership investments  the financial statements received from the general partner or  with respect to direct investments  the estimated fair value of the investments 
there is a time lag in the corporation s receipt of the financial information that is the primary basis for the valuation of its limited partnership interests 
pnc will recognize in the first quarter of valuation changes related to limited partnership investments that reflect the impact of fourth quarter market conditions and performance of the underlying companies 
due to the nature of the direct investments  management must make assumptions as to future performance  financial condition  liquidity  availability of capital  and market conditions  among others  to determine the estimated fair value of the investments 
the valuation procedures applied to direct investments include techniques such as multiple of cash flow of the entity  independent appraisals of the entity or the pricing used to value the entity in a recent financial transaction 
general partnership interests are valued based on the underlying investments of the partnership utilizing procedures consistent with those applied to direct investments 
changes in the value of equity management investments are reflected in the corporation s results of operations 
market conditions and actual performance of the companies invested in could differ from these assumptions resulting in lower valuations that could adversely impact earnings in future periods 
accordingly  the valuations may not represent amounts that will ultimately be realized from these investments 
see note accounting policies in item of this report for additional information 
commercial mortgage servicing rights commercial mortgage servicing rights msr are intangible assets that represent the value of rights that arise from the servicing of commercial loan contracts 
while servicing is inherent in most financial assets  it becomes a distinct asset when a contractually separated from the underlying financial asset by sale or securitization of the asset with servicing retained or b through the separate purchase and assumption of the servicing 
the corporation s msr asset value both originated and purchased arises from estimates of future revenues from contractually specified servicing fees  interest income and other ancillary revenues  net of estimated operating expenses  which are expected to yield an acceptable level of risk adjusted return for the servicer 
the fair value of the corporation s msr asset is estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology  which calculates the net present value of future cash flows of the servicing portfolio over the estimated life of the asset based on various assumptions and market factors  the most significant of which include interest rates for escrow and deposit balance earnings  estimated prepayment speeds  estimated servicing costs  portfolio stratification  and discount rates 
the reasonableness of these factors is reviewed by management and is based on expectations of the portfolio  market conditions  and loan characteristics 
the corporation s commercial loan servicing portfolio is subject to various risks  the most significant being interest rate and prepayment risk  which subject the msr asset to impairment risk 
while the msr asset is amortized over its estimated life in proportion to estimated net servicing income  it is also tested for impairment at a strata level on a quarterly basis 
the impairment testing includes a positive and negative scenario for sensitivity characteristics 
if the estimated fair value of the msr is less than the carrying value  an impairment loss would be recognized in the current period  however  any fair value in excess of the cost basis would not be recognized as income 
see note accounting policies and note securitizations included in item of this report for additional information 
lease residuals leases are carried at the aggregate of lease payments and the estimated residual value of the leased property  less unearned income 
the corporation provides financing for various types of equipment  aircraft  energy and power systems  rolling stock and vehicles through a variety of lease arrangements 
a significant portion of the residual value is covered by residual value insurance and or operating reserves or is guaranteed by governmental entities 
residual values are subject to judgments as to the value of the underlying equipment that can be affected by changes in economic and market conditions and the financial viability of the residual guarantors and insurers 
to the extent not guaranteed or assumed by a third party  or otherwise reserved or insured against  the corporation bears the risk of ownership of the leased assets including the risk that the actual value of the leased assets at the end of the lease term will be less than the residual value which could result in a charge and adversely impact earnings in future periods 
see note accounting policies included in item of this report for additional information 

table of contents goodwill goodwill arising from business acquisitions represents the value attributable to unidentifiable intangible elements in the business acquired 
the majority of the corporation s goodwill relates to value inherent in fund servicing and banking businesses 
the value of this goodwill is dependent upon the corporation s ability to provide quality  cost effective services in the face of competition from other market leaders on a national and global basis 
this ability in turn relies upon continuing investments in processing systems  the development of value added service features  and the ease of access to the corporation s services 
as such  goodwill value is supported ultimately by earnings  which is driven by the volume of business transacted and  for certain businesses  the market value of assets under administration or for which processing services are provided 
a decline in earnings as a result of a lack of growth or the corporation s inability to deliver cost effective services over sustained periods can lead to impairment of goodwill  which could result in a charge and adversely impact earnings in future periods 
total goodwill was billion at december  see note accounting policies and note goodwill and other intangible assets included in item of this report for additional information 
revenue recognition pnc derives interest and noninterest income from various sources including lending  investment management and fund servicing  customer deposits  loan servicing  brokerage services  sale of loans  certain private equity activities and derivatives trading activities 
fees and commissions are also earned from issuing loan commitments  standby letters of credit and financial guarantees  selling various insurance products  providing treasury management services and participating in certain capital market transactions 
the timing and amount of revenue recognized in any period is dependent on estimates  judgments  assumptions  and interpretation of contractual terms 
changes in these factors can have a significant impact on revenue recognized in any period due to changes in products  market conditions or industry norms 
status of defined benefit pension plan the corporation has a noncontributory  qualified defined benefit pension plan plan or pension plan covering most employees 
retirement benefits are derived from a cash balance formula based on compensation levels  age and length of service 
pension contributions are based on an actuarially determined amount necessary to fund total benefits payable to plan participants 
plan assets are currently approximately invested in equity investments with most of the remainder invested in fixed income instruments 
plan investment policy is determined and reviewed by plan fiduciaries 
on an annual basis  management reviews the actuarial assumptions related to the pension plan  including the discount rate  rate of compensation increase and the expected return on plan assets 
the expense associated with the pension plan is calculated in accordance with sfas  employers accounting for pensions  and utilizes assumptions and methods determined in accordance therewith  including a policy of reflecting trust assets at their fair market value 
the expense is not significantly affected by the discount rate or compensation increase assumptions  but is significantly affected by the expected return on asset assumption  which was changed from to for  causing expense to increase by approximately million 
the expense is also significantly affected by actual trust returns  with each one percentage point difference in actual return versus the expectation causing the following year s expense to change by as much as million 
management currently estimates expense for the pension plan to be approximately million  compared with million for lower amortization of actuarial losses from prior years due to improved returns on trust assets in is the primary reason for the expected decrease in pension expense in in accordance with sfas and sfas revised  employers disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits  the corporation may be required to eliminate any prepaid pension asset and recognize a minimum pension liability if the accumulated benefit obligation exceeds the fair value of plan assets at year end 
the corresponding charge would be recognized as a component of other comprehensive income and reduce total shareholders equity  but would not impact net income 
at december   the fair value of plan assets was billion  which exceeded the accumulated benefit obligation of million 
the status at year end will depend primarily upon trust returns and the level of contributions  if any  made to the plan by the corporation during contribution requirements are primarily affected by trust investment performance and are not particularly sensitive to actuarial assumptions 
although there were no required contributions to the pension plan during or  the corporation continued its strategy of fully funding the plan at maximum tax deductible levels  contributing million in and million in if future investment performance exceeds that of recent years  the permitted tax deductible contribution in future years will be significantly reduced 
in any case and irrespective of any factors  any large near term contributions to the plan will be at the discretion of management as the minimum required contributions under current law are expected to be zero for several years 
blackrock long term retention and incentive plan blackrock s long term retention and incentive plan ltip permits the grant of up to million in deferred compensation awards the ltip awards  subject to the achievement of certain performance hurdles by blackrock no later than march the compensation committee of blackrock s board of directors may vest a portion of the ltip awards  in its sole discretion  if blackrock achieves certain alternative performance hurdles during the vesting period 

table of contents there will be no expense recognition associated with the ltip awards unless vesting occurs or a partial vesting determination is considered probable and estimable 
blackrock s compensation and audit committees have determined  based on current conditions  that the probability of indicating any partial vesting prior to the opportunity for commencement of full vesting of the program at the conclusion of the first quarter of is unlikely 
the ltip was constructed such that the expected increase in value to stockholders necessary to fully vest the program had to result from continued growth in blackrock s earnings rather than from changes in the financial markets 
as such  a minimum performance period through december  was established under which no vesting of the program would occur 
at such time  the compensation and audit committees will evaluate the likelihood that blackrock will complete the program term with alternative vesting criteria performance in excess of ltip requirements 
blackrock will accrue expense for this contingency accordingly 
if the performance hurdles are achieved  the ltip awards will be funded with up to million shares of blackrock common stock to be surrendered by pnc and distributed to ltip participants  less income tax withholding 
in addition  distributed shares to ltip participants will include an option to put such distributed shares back to blackrock at fair market value 
blackrock will fund the remainder of the ltip awards with up to million in cash

risk management the corporation encounters risk as part of the normal course of its business and designs risk management processes to help manage these risks 
this section will first provide an overview of the governance structure  measurement  control strategies  and monitoring aspects of the corporation s corporate level risk management processes generally 
following this discussion is an analysis of the same aspects of the risk management process for what management views as the corporation s primary areas of risk credit  operational  liquidity  and market 
the corporation s use of financial and other derivatives as part of its overall asset and liability risk management process is also addressed within the risk management section of this report 
in appropriate places within this section  historical performance is also addressed 
overview as a financial services organization  the corporation takes a certain amount of risk in every business decision 
for example  every time the corporation opens an account or approves a loan for a customer  processes a payment  hires a new employee  or implements a new computer system  the corporation incurs a certain amount of risk 
as an organization  the corporation must balance revenue generation and profitability with the risks associated with its business activities 
risk management is not about eliminating risks  but about accepting risks that are expected to optimize shareholder value and that the corporation seeks to effectively manage 
the key to effective risk management is to be proactive in seeking to identify  measure  control  and monitor risk on an ongoing basis 
risk management practices support decision making  improve the success rate for new initiatives  and strengthen the organization 
corporate level risk management overview governance structure risk management is supported through a governance structure at the board and management level  and through a risk organization structure at both the corporate and business unit level 
these structures are designed to provide active and effective management of risks 
although the board as a whole is responsible generally for oversight of risk management  committees of the board provide oversight to specific areas of risk with respect to the level of risk and risk management structure 
the board committees with primary responsibility for risk management oversight are as follows audit committee major financial risk exposures  compliance with legal and regulatory requirements  internal and disclosure controls  and the corporation s code of business conduct and ethics credit committee risk within the corporation s lending and credit related activities finance committee the risk management process and internal control structure relating to interest rate and liquidity risks  trading activities  capital management activities  equity investments  and fiduciary activities operations and technology committee operations and operational risk management  and activities related to information technology and information security nominating and governance committee recommendation of nominees for the corporation s board and implementation of appropriate corporate governance practices management level risk committees are designed to help ensure that business decisions are executed within the board s desired risk profile 
the executive risk management committee ermc  consisting of senior management executives  provides oversight for the establishment and implementation of new comprehensive risk management initiatives  reviews risk profiles and discusses key risk issues 
there are several other management level risk management committees charged with various risk management oversight responsibilities 
within each of the corporation s major businesses  a business risk officer serves an important role by helping the business to identify risks and develop action plans to manage those risks 
by acting as partners to business managers and corporate risk officers  business risk officers help ensure that strategic business goals  including acceptable levels of risk  are achieved 

table of contents the following tables outline the three primary corporate level risk management areas area risk management executive chief risk officer key roles of corporate team facilitates the identification  assessment and monitoring of risk across the corporation sets risk tolerance limits has authority to review and challenge all risk taking activities provides support and oversight to the businesses identifies and implements risk management best practices area regulatory relations and compliance executives chief regulatory officer chief compliance officer key roles of corporate team facilitates the identification  assessment and monitoring of regulatory and compliance risk throughout the corporation facilitates relationships with regulatory agencies and serves as liaison to the businesses provides compliance support and oversight at the corporate level and to the businesses administers the corporation s ethics and business conduct programs area legal executives vice chairman  legal and governance general counsel key roles of corporate team facilitates the identification  assessment  and monitoring of legal risk throughout the corporation provides legal counsel to the corporation and across all businesses and staff areas each corporate risk management area is empowered and actively involved in risk identification  measurement  control and monitoring across the corporation 
risk measurement risk measurement activities are conducted specific to the area of risk 
corporate risk management is involved in the development of models and analytic tools to evaluate the level of risk  providing a holistic approach to aggregating and understanding enterprise wide risk 
the primary vehicle for aggregation of enterprise wide risk is a new comprehensive risk management methodology developed during that is based on economic capital 
this primary risk aggregation measure is augmented with secondary measures of risk to arrive at an estimate of enterprise wide risk 
the economic capital framework is a measure of potential losses above and beyond expected losses 
potential one year losses are capitalized to a level commensurate with a financial institution with an a rating by the credit rating agencies 
economic capital incorporates risk associated with potential credit losses credit risk  fluctuations of the estimated market value of financial instruments market risk and other risks such as the failure of people  processes or systems operational risk 
management has not previously used economic capital in evaluating the performance of its business segments  and this methodology has not been used in the calculation of return on assigned capital for or business segment performance as disclosed in the review of businesses section of item of this report 
management plans to use economic capital to evaluate each of the corporation s business segment s performance in risk control strategies policy development and exception oversight is centrally managed through corporate level risk management 
corporate risk management is authorized to take action to either prevent or mitigate exceptions to policies and is responsible for monitoring compliance with risk management policies 
the corporate audit function performs an independent analysis of the internal control environment 
corporate audit plays a critical role in risk management  testing the operation of the internal control system and reporting findings to management and to the audit committee 
the corporation uses a review process for significant new initiatives which requires the preparation of a business case  including a risk analysis  for review by an appropriate risk management committee 
risk monitoring corporate risk management reports on a regular basis to the board regarding the enterprise risk profile of the corporation 
these reports aggregate and present the level of risk by type of risk and communicate significant risk issues  including performance relative to risk tolerance limits 
both the board and the ermc provide guidance on actions to address key risk issues as identified in these reports 
credit risk management credit risk represents the possibility that a customer  counterparty or issuer may not perform in accordance with contractual terms 
credit risk is inherent in the financial services business and results from extending credit to customers  purchasing securities and entering into financial derivative transactions 
credit risk is one of the most common risks in banking and one of the most significant risks to pnc 
approved risk tolerances  in addition to credit policies and procedures  set portfolio objectives for the level of credit risk 
guidelines have been established for acceptable levels of aggregate borrower exposure  problem loans and other credit measures 
the corporation seeks to achieve credit portfolio objectives by maintaining a customer base that is diverse in borrower exposure and industry 
reductions in risk concentrations are achieved through loan participations with third parties  loan sales and the purchase of credit derivatives 
governance structure the credit granting businesses maintain direct responsibility for credit risk within the corporation 
the corporate credit policy area provides independent oversight to the measurement  monitoring and reporting of the corporation s credit risk and reports to the chief risk officer 
corporate

corporate credit policy oversees the role of portfolio management 
the portfolio management function supports the development of portfolio risk limits to achieve associated objectives and is responsible for initiating secondary market activities to help optimize portfolio composition 
the special asset committee sac is the management committee charged with the responsibility of reviewing all criticized credits throughout the corporation in excess of a set dollar threshold 
additionally  sac sets the standards for business level committees for reviewing all criticized credits below the corporate exposure threshold 
sac meets regularly and sets specific reserve levels for nonperforming loans and evaluates the risk rating and disclosure status for reviewed credits 
the reserve adequacy committee rac reviews the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses for business units and major bank subsidiaries 
rac provides oversight for the allowance evaluation process  including quarterly evaluations as well as methodology and estimation changes 
the results of the evaluations are reported to the credit committee of the board 
risk measurement the corporation actively measures sources of credit risk based on the calculated expected and unexpected losses in the portfolio 
expected loss is a component in calculating the appropriate level of the allowance for credit losses 
see the allowances for credit losses and unfunded commitments and letters of credit portion of this credit risk management discussion 
unexpected loss seeks to capture the loss volatility in the portfolio and is the foundation for economic capital measurement at the business level 
stress testing and scenario analyses are performed regularly  providing guidance to management on the potential impact of macroeconomic events on the level of credit risk 
loan evaluation tools are used to assess credit quality at origination and to identify deteriorating borrower credit quality 
they are employed to actively manage and reduce exposures as warranted 
these loan evaluation tools have been developed internally as well as purchased from external vendors 
loan evaluation tool policies are established and usage monitored by corporate credit policy 
risk control strategies corporate credit policy monitors policy compliance and communicates exceptions to management on a monthly basis and to the credit committee of the board quarterly 
pnc has established credit portfolio risk tolerance and concentration limits  both at the corporate level and by individual lending business 
corporate credit policy evaluates compliance with risk tolerance and concentration limits quarterly and oversees appropriate adjustment of portfolio strategies to remain or move within an acceptable range of risk  balanced by the strategic objectives of the corporation 
critical to the measurement of commercial credit risk is the accuracy of internal risk ratings in the commercial loan portfolio 
corporate credit policy reviews and if necessary adjusts risk ratings at the time of approval 
if a credit relationship deteriorates and becomes a criticized credit  it is reviewed through the sac process 
additionally  an independent credit risk review function  reporting directly to the credit committee of the board and indirectly to the chief risk officer  performs regular analyses of the quality of credit risk management and level of credit risk 
risk monitoring on a quarterly basis  corporate credit policy reports on credit risk to the credit committee of the board 
policy exceptions and compliance with portfolio limits are included within the report 
additionally  credit risk review provides an independent assessment of the credit risk profile and the findings from targeted reviews 
each primary credit granting business presents a report on the current trends  key risk factors and credit strategy of the business to the credit committee of the board 
senior credit management receives management level portfolio reports that include current trends within the business 
the reports contain detailed information on exposure concentrations across portfolio segments

these amounts include million and million of troubled debt restructured assets at december  and december   respectively 
of the total nonperforming loans at december   are related to pnc business credit 
pnc business credit loans  including those acquired in the nboc acquisition  are primarily secured loans to borrowers  many of whom are highly leveraged  experiencing rapid growth  or who have elected to utilize asset based financing 
as a result  the risk profile of these loans typically reflects a higher risk of default and a greater proportion are classified as nonperforming 
historically  the corporation has found that the collateralized nature of asset based financing has resulted in lower losses relative to comparable commercial loans within the loan portfolio 
during the fourth quarter of  the corporation accelerated the timeframe for recognizing delinquent  well secured residential mortgage loans as nonperforming 
this change resulted in the classification of an additional million of residential mortgages as nonaccrual loans at december  the decline in nonperforming loans held for sale at december  compared with december  reflected reductions in principal balances and sales of nonperforming loans during the foreclosed lease assets at december  primarily represented the corporation s repossession of collateral related to a single airline industry credit during the second quarter of that was previously classified as a nonaccrual loan

allowances for credit losses and unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit the corporation maintains an allowance for credit losses to absorb losses from the loan portfolio 
the allowance is determined based on quarterly assessments of the probable estimated losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the methodology for measuring the appropriate level of the allowance consists of several elements  including specific allocations to impaired loans  allocations to pools of non impaired loans and unallocated reserves 
while allocations are made to specific loans and pools of loans  the total reserve is available for all loan losses 
in addition to the allowance for credit losses  the corporation maintains an allowance for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit 
this amount  reported as a liability on the consolidated balance sheet  is determined using estimates of the probability of the ultimate funding and losses related to those credit exposures 
the methodology used is similar to the methodology used for determining the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses 
specific allowances are established for loans considered impaired by a method prescribed by sfas  accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan 
all nonperforming loans are considered impaired under sfas specific allowances are determined for individual loans over a set dollar threshold by sac based on an analysis of the present value of its expected future cash flows discounted at its effective interest rate  its observable market price or the fair value of the underlying collateral 
a minimum specific allowance is established on all impaired loans at the applicable pool reserve allocation for similar loans 
allocations to non impaired commercial and commercial real estate loans pool reserve allocations are assigned to pools of loans as defined by pnc s business structure and internal risk rating categories 
key elements of the pool reserve methodology include expected default probabilities edp  loss given default lgd and exposure at default ead 
edps are derived from historical default analyses and are a function of the borrower s risk rating grade and expected loan term 
lgds are derived from historical loss data and are a function of the loan s collateral value and other structural factors that may affect the ultimate ability to collect on the loan 
eads are derived from banking industry and pnc s own exposure at default data 
this methodology is sensitive to changes in key risk parameters such as edps  lgds and eads 
in general  a given change in any of the major risk parameters will have a commensurate change in the pool reserve allocations to non impaired commercial loans 
additionally  other factors such as the rate of migration in the severity of problem loans or changes in the maturity distribution of the loans will contribute to the final pool reserve allocations 
consumer including residential mortgage loan allocations are made at a total portfolio level by consumer product line based on historical loss experience 
a four quarter average loss rate is computed from net charge offs for the prior four quarters as a percentage of the average loans outstanding in those quarters 
this loss rate is applied to loans outstanding at the end of the current period to set the consumer loan allocation 
the final loan reserve allocations are based on this methodology and management s judgment of other qualitative factors which may include  among others  regional and national economic conditions  business segment and portfolio concentrations  historical versus estimated losses  model risk and changes to the level of credit risk in the portfolio 
unallocated reserves are established to provide coverage for probable losses not considered in the specific  pool and consumer reserve methodologies  such as  but not limited to  potential judgment and data errors 
furthermore  events may have occurred as of the reserve evaluation date that are not yet reflected in the risk measures or characteristics of the portfolio due to inherent lags in information 
management s evaluation of these and other relevant factors determines the level of unallocated reserves established at the evaluation date

liquidity risk management liquidity risk is the risk of potential for loss from an inability of the corporation to meet its funding requirements at a reasonable cost 
the objective of liquidity risk management is to help ensure that the corporation can obtain cost effective funding to meet current and future obligations under both normal business as usual and stressful circumstances 
the corporation typically maintains its liquidity positions through a large and stable deposit base derived from the corporation s retail and wholesale banking activities  a portfolio of liquid investment securities  diversified sources of short term and long term wholesale funding  and significant unused borrowing capacity at both the federal home loan bank and the federal reserve discount window

market risk management overview market risk is the risk of potential losses due to adverse movements in market factors such as interest rates  credit spreads  foreign exchange rates and equity prices 
market risk is inherent in the operations of the corporation  arising from both trading and non trading activities 
trading activities involve transactions in capital markets products such as bonds  stocks and their related derivative instruments 
the primary market risk in non trading activities is the interest rate risk inherent in the traditional banking activities of gathering deposits and extending loans 
equity investment risk is another significant type of non trading market risk arising from private equity and other types of equity investment activities 
market risk management has responsibility for market risks in both trading and non trading activities 
the four key aspects of market risk management functions are enterprise wide market risk policy  measurement  monitoring and reporting 
the board finance committee reviews and approves the corporation s market risk policies and limits 
market risk management interest rate risk interest rate risk results primarily from the corporation s traditional banking activities of gathering deposits and extending loans 
many factors  including economic and financial conditions  movements in interest rates and consumer preferences  affect the spread between interest earned on assets and interest paid on liabilities 
in managing interest rate risk  the corporation seeks to limit its reliance on a particular interest rate scenario as a source of earnings while positioning itself to optimize net interest income and net interest margin 
the corporation uses securities purchases and sales  short term and long term funding  financial derivatives and other capital markets instruments to achieve these objectives 
governance structure the board finance committee approves market risk policies  including the interest rate risk management policy  the investment policy and the financial derivatives policy  that govern interest rate risk management 
the policies define the corporation s overall interest rate risk management philosophy and risk tolerance level 
alco is the management committee that oversees all market risk taking activities  including interest rate risk management activities conducted by alm 
alco delegates the execution and implementation of interest rate risk management strategies to alm 
in this capacity  alm is responsible for making investment and trading decisions within the authorized limits and guidelines 
market risk management is responsible for monitoring compliance with the approved policy and market risk limits 
risk measurement the corporation measures and seeks to manage both the short term and long term effects of changing interest rates through its interest rate risk simulation model 
the simulation model measures the sensitivity of net interest income nii to changing interest rates over the next month period 
the model also measures the sensitivity of the economic value of equity eve to instantaneous changes in interest rates 
eve is a measurement of the inherent economic value of the corporation at a given point in time 
the nii simulation model is the tool used to measure the direction and magnitude of changes in net interest income resulting from changes in interest rates 
forecasting net interest income and its sensitivity to changes in interest rates requires that the corporation make assumptions about the volume and characteristics of new business and the behavior of existing positions 
these business assumptions are based on 
table of contents the corporation s experience  business plans and published industry experience 
key assumptions employed in the model include prepayment speeds on mortgage related assets and consumer loans  loan volumes and pricing  deposit volumes and pricing  the expected life and repricing characteristics of nonmaturity loans and deposits  and management s financial and capital plans 
eve is also based on a series of assumptions  primarily about the expected maturity and repricing behavior of existing on and off balance sheet positions 
actual results may differ from those determined under these assumptions 
to the extent possible  these assumptions are consistent with those used in the nii simulation process 
using these assumptions  the corporation calculates eve given parallel instantaneous changes in interest rates 
as part of that calculation  the corporation also calculates changes in fair value given a change in interest rates  referred to as effective duration  of key on and off balance sheet positions 
at december   the effective duration of key on and off balance sheet positions was as follows  given a basis point change in interest rates loans  securities  total assets  deposits  borrowed funds  total liabilities  and receive fixed interest rate swaps 
the corporation s interest rate risk simulation model is designed to capture key components of interest rate risk such as repricing risk  yield curve or nonparallel rate shift risk  basis risk and options risk 
because the assumptions employed in the model are inherently uncertain  actual results may differ from simulated results 
management uses such analyses to help it identify risks and develop appropriate risk management strategies 
risk control strategies pnc has established policy limits and processes for market risk management to actively monitor its interest rate risk profile 
policy limits are established both for nii and eve sensitivities 
risk monitoring the corporation has established a process for reporting its interest rate risk profile and any significant risk issues 
nii and eve sensitivity reports are reviewed regularly by alco and the board finance committee 
the following table sets forth the sensitivity results and market interest rate benchmarks for the last two years

the following table reflects the percentage change in net interest income over the next two month periods assuming the pnc economist s most likely rate forecast  implied market forward rates  a lower steeper rate scenario and a lower flatter rate scenario 
the corporation is inherently sensitive to a low and flat yield curve 
when forecasting net interest income  the corporation makes assumptions about interest rates and the shape of the yield curve  the volume and characteristics of new business  and the behavior of existing positions 
these assumptions determine the future level of simulated net interest income in the base interest rate scenario and the other interest rate scenarios presented in the following table 
these simulations assume that as assets and liabilities mature and are replaced or repriced  this occurs at market rates 
as a result  given the current low level of interest rates and shape of the yield curve  forecasted net interest income and the resulting net interest margin in the base rate scenario decline from current levels as higher yielding assets are replaced or repriced at lower yields 
all changes in forecasted net interest income are relative to results in a base rate scenario where current market rates are assumed to remain unchanged over the forecast horizon

the corporation makes and manages direct investments in a variety of transactions  including management buyouts  recapitalizations and later stage growth financings  and in a variety of industries 
the corporation also invests in non affiliated and affiliated funds that make similar private equity investments 
the private equity portfolio is comprised of investments that vary by industry  stage and type of investment 
the corporation continues to make private equity investments at a more moderate pace than in prior years  consistent with current market conditions 
from a risk management standpoint  the strategy is to invest in companies with proven business models  structure investment transactions to protect value in downside scenarios and invest in less volatile industries 
currently  emphasis is being placed on the management of capital for other investors 
pnc also makes investments in affiliated and non affiliated funds with both traditional and alternative investment strategies 
such investments include investments in blackrock s mutual funds and hedge funds 
the market risk management group also measures and monitors the sensitivities of the economic values of other types of assets or investments on or off the corporation s balance sheet 
the economic values could be driven by either the fixed income market  or the equity markets or both 
as of december   major investments of this type include modified coinsurance contracts with various insurance carriers  low income housing tax credits  and capitalized servicing rights for commercial mortgage loans 
governance structure pnc equity management corp pnc emc and other pnc business units manage the equity and other investment activities of pnc 
the board finance committee approves policies and capital limits related to investment activities across pnc 
pnc businesses are responsible for making investment decisions within the approved policy limits and guidelines 
market risk management provides independent oversight by monitoring compliance with these limits and guidelines  and reporting significant risks in the business to the board finance committee and ermc 
risk measurement the primary risk measurement for equity and other investments is the concept of economic capital 
the economic capital is a common measure of risk for credit  market and operational risk 
it is the worst case value depreciation over one year within confidence level 
given the illiquid nature of many of these types of investments  it is a challenge to determine their fair economic values 
market risk management provides independent oversight of the valuation process 
private equity investments are reported at fair value 
changes in the values of private equity investments are reflected in the corporation s results of operations 
due to the nature of the direct investments  management must make assumptions as to future performance  financial condition  liquidity  availability of capital  and market conditions  among other factors  to determine the estimated fair value of the investments 
market conditions and actual performance of the investments could differ from these assumptions 
accordingly  lower valuations may occur that could adversely impact earnings in future periods 
also  the valuations may not represent amounts that will ultimately be realized from these investments 
see equity management asset valuation in the critical accounting policies and judgments section under item of this report for additional information 
risk control strategies equity and other investments across the corporation are made within capital limits approved by the board finance committee 
given the illiquid nature of most of the investments  assessing their fair values is a challenge 
the fair market value of the investments is updated and reviewed at 
table of contents both corporate and business unit levels 
in addition  market risk management monitors the equity investment portfolio 
risk monitoring at december   private equity investments carried at estimated fair value totaled approximately million compared with million at december  as of december   approximately of the amount is invested directly in a variety of companies and approximately is invested in various limited partnerships 
private equity unfunded commitments totaled million at december  compared with million at december  market risk management trading risk most of the corporation s trading activities are designed to provide capital markets services to customers and not to position the corporation s portfolio for gains from market movements 
trading activities are confined to financial instruments and financial derivatives 
pnc participates in derivatives and foreign exchange trading as well as underwriting and market making in equity securities primarily for its customers 
pnc also engages in trading activities as part of its risk management strategies 
net trading income was million for compared with million for see note trading activities in the notes to consolidated financial statements under item of this report for additional information 
governance structure the board finance committee reviews and approves the corporate trading risk policy 
this policy governs risk management philosophy  processes and limits for all trading activities across the corporation 
alco oversees all trading activities across the corporation 
for each trading group eg  fixed income derivatives  foreign exchange  there is a specific market risk policy and a set of risk limits that govern that particular group 
the overall corporate trading risk policy governs these policies and limits 
risk measurement the corporation uses a variety of statistical and non statistical measurements to assess the level of market risk arising from trading activities 
the key market risk measure for trading activities is value at risk var 
for a trading portfolio  var seeks to measure the maximum potential loss within a specified confidence level over a given holding period 
the corporation measures its var using a confidence level over a one day period 
var offers a common currency to compare market risk across multiple instruments and portfolios 
it accounts for risk at the individual position level as well as the position s effect on the overall portfolio 
in addition to the levels of volatility of market risk factors  the corporation s var methodology incorporates market liquidity risk by lengthening the holding period for illiquid positions 
currently  the corporation does not perform a var calculation for its portfolio of credit default swaps that are used to economically hedge its on balance sheet corporate loans 
the notional amount of credit default swaps is million as of december  see credit default swaps in the credit related instruments section under item of this report for further information 
the trading activities of the corporation are governed by both a daily var limit and a month to date stop loss limit 
as of december   the total var usage for the corporation was 
million 
total var usage ranged from 
million to million during currently  interest rate risk  equity risk and foreign exchange risk contribute fairly evenly to the overall var level 
in addition to measuring var  market risk management performs stress testing to assess the potential impacts of extreme market scenarios beyond the confidence level on all of pnc s trading portfolios 
the appropriateness of these scenarios is reviewed regularly by management to reflect the changing market conditions and portfolio compositions 
risk control strategies under current policy  the board finance committee and alco review the corporation s trading activities at least twice a year to consider and approve any significant changes to risk management policies  limits and business strategies 
on a daily basis  market risk management monitors the market conditions and their impact on the corporation s trading positions 
in addition  market risk management also monitors exposure levels relative to relevant risk limits 
risk monitoring market risk reports for the trading activities are generated daily and reviewed by market risk management staff 
monthly var  stop loss and stress testing reports  together with market risk trend and summary reports  are presented to senior management in risk management committee meetings at both the business unit and corporate levels 
market risk management also generates a backtesting report on a daily basis 
the purpose of the backtesting report is to validate the accuracy of the var measurement by comparing the current day s actual trading profit loss against the prior day s var 
a backtesting exception occurs when the actual loss exceeds the relevant var and can be an indication that the var measurement is underestimating risk 
for the year ended december   the corporation experienced no backtesting exceptions at the enterprise wide level 
impact of inflation the assets and liabilities of the corporation are primarily monetary in nature 
accordingly  future changes in prices do not affect the obligations to pay or receive fixed and determinable amounts of money 
during periods of inflation  monetary assets lose value in terms of purchasing power and monetary liabilities have corresponding purchasing power gains 
the concept of purchasing power  however  is not an adequate indicator of the effect of inflation on banks because it does not take into account changes in interest rates  which are an important determinant of the corporation s earnings 

table of contents financial and other derivatives effective january   the corporation implemented sfas  as amended 
the statement requires the corporation to recognize all derivative instruments at fair value as either assets or liabilities 
financial derivatives are reported at fair value in other assets or other liabilities 
the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle resulting from the adoption of sfas was an after tax charge of million reported in the consolidated statement of income in the first quarter of  and an after tax accumulated other comprehensive loss of million in the consolidated balance sheet 
see note financial derivatives under item of this report for additional information 
the corporation uses a variety of financial derivatives as part of the overall asset and liability risk management process to help manage interest rate  market and credit risk inherent in the corporation s business activities 
substantially all such instruments are used to manage risk related to changes in interest rates 
interest rate and total return swaps  purchased interest rate caps and floors and futures contracts are the primary instruments used by the corporation for interest rate risk management 
interest rate swaps are agreements with a counterparty to exchange periodic fixed and floating interest payments calculated on a notional amount 
the floating rate is based on a money market index  primarily short term libor 
total return swaps are agreements with a counterparty to exchange an interest rate payment for the total return on a specified reference index calculated on a notional amount 
purchased interest rate caps and floors are agreements where  for a fee  the counterparty agrees to pay the corporation the amount  if any  by which a specified market interest rate exceeds or is less than a defined rate applied to a notional amount  respectively 
interest rate futures contracts are exchange traded agreements to make or take delivery of a financial instrument at an agreed upon price and are settled in cash daily 
financial derivatives involve  to varying degrees  interest rate  market and credit risk 
for interest rate swaps and total return swaps  caps and floors and futures contracts  only periodic cash payments and  with respect to caps and floors  premiums  are exchanged 
therefore  cash requirements and exposure to credit risk are significantly less than the notional amount 
not all elements of interest rate  market and credit risk are addressed through the use of financial or other derivatives  and such instruments may be ineffective for their intended purposes due to unanticipated market characteristics  among other reasons
