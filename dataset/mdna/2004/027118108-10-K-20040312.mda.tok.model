item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
executive overview american land lease is in the business of owning and leasing residential land 
our current business focuses on the ownership of land and generation of these leases within adult or retirement communities  we focus on these communities for the following reasons current demographic projections predict that the customer base for this asset class will grow for the next years 
the residents have established credit histories and therefore are able to obtain favorable financing or pay cash for their home making significant equity investments to the leasehold estate that secures our lease 
the residents  as a result of their retired or semi retired status  are less affected by current economic changes thereby making their continued rental payments more stable and the continued sales of homes in our communities more consistent year to year 
the company has developed and therefore is able to leverage its current marketing  brand  and management expertise 

table of contents the company seeks growth through home sales to fill unoccupied home sites in current subdivisions  development of its land portfolio to increase the inventory of available home sites  and the selective acquisition of communities and development opportunities 
this business model presents a number of challenges and risks for the company s management 
several of these risks are the continued development of additional home sites is a capital intensive activity that requires substantial investments to be made in advance of returns 
older homes may depreciate or become obsolete 
changes in the interest rate environment may have an adverse impact our new home sales customers ability to realize sufficient proceeds from the sale of their present home or finance a new purchase  therefore limiting their financial ability to acquire new homes in our communities 
the cost of developing additional home sites and communities may increase at a rate or to a level that may exceed the costs projected at the point of the initial investment by the company 
based upon the above and other factors  the rate of sale of new homes may be substantially slower than projected at the point of the initial investment by the company  resulting in returns on investment materially different from original projections 
the following discussion and analysis of the results of our operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with the financial statements incorporated by reference in item of this annual report 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states which require us to make estimates and assumptions 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies see note b to the consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report  the following may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
impairment of long lived assets effective january   the company adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this standard superceded sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  but also retained its basic provision requiring i recognition of an impairment loss of the carrying amount of a long lived asset if it is not recoverable from its undiscounted cash flows and ii measurement of an impairment loss as the difference between the carrying amount and fair value of the asset unless an asset is held for sale  in which case it would be stated at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to dispose 
however  sfas no 
also describes a probability weighted cash flow estimation approach to deal with situations where alternative courses of action to recover the carrying amount of a long lived asset are under consideration or a range is estimated 
the determination of undiscounted cash flows requires significant estimates made by management such as estimating future net operating income and estimating fair value upon sale of each property owned and considers the expected course of action at the balance sheet date 
subsequent changes in estimated undiscounted cash flows arising from changes in anticipated actions could impact the determination of whether an impairment exists 
the company reviews its long lived assets used in operations for impairment when there is an event or change in circumstances that indicates an impairment in value 
an asset is considered impaired when the undiscounted future cash flows are not sufficient to recover the asset s carrying amount of the asset over its fair value 
the company records impairment losses and reduces the carrying amount of assets held for sale when the carrying amount exceeds the estimated selling proceeds less the costs to sell 

table of contents in  the company recorded an impairment charge of  for a land lease community located in arizona 
if the company s estimate of the fair value of this community was reduced by  the amount of the impairment charge would have increased  to a total of  the company has classified this asset as held for sale and has reported the activities of this community in discontinued operations 
capitalized costs we capitalize direct and indirect costs including interest  real estate taxes  and other costs in connection with initial capital expenditures  capital enhancements  and capital replacements  as well as similar spending for development and redevelopment of our properties 
indirect costs that are not capitalized  including general and administrative expenses  are charged to expense as incurred 
the amounts capitalized vary with the volume  cost and timing of these activities and  especially  with the pace of development and redevelopment activities 
as a result  changes in the volume  cost and timing of these activities may have a significant impact on our financial results 
the most significant capitalized cost is interest 
we capitalize interest when the following three conditions are present i expenditures for the asset have been made  ii activities necessary to get the asset ready for its intended use are in progress and iii interest cost is being incurred 
our determination of the activities in progress for a development property is subject to professional judgment 
the most significant judgment is the determination to capitalize interest relating to the ownership of land being developed as new home sites 
in many cases  the development activity is expected to take place over several years and in multiple phases 
it is our conclusion that the entirety of each parcel is under development and is a qualifying asset 
accordingly  interest is capitalized with respect to the entire parcel until such time as development activities cease or the individual home site is ready for its intended use 
during   and  capitalized interest was approximately   and  respectively 
we regularly review the amount of capitalized costs in conjunction with our review of impairment of long lived assets 
based on the level of development activity in  if our development activities decrease such that of our assets qualifying for capitalization of interest are no longer qualified  the amount of capitalized interest would have been reduced by  rental property depreciation depreciation is computed using the straight line method over an estimated useful life of to years for land improvements  to years for buildings and years for furniture and other equipment  all of which are judgmental determinations 
these determinations may prove to be different than the actual life of any individual asset 
inventory carrying amounts for inventory are determined on a specific identification basis and are stated at the lower of cost or market 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  if customer preferences change  or if material improvements are made by suppliers that are preferred by our customers compared to inventory we own  inventory write downs may be required 
any such write downs may have a significant impact on our financial results 
on a quarterly basis  we review each home in inventory that is older than one year and evaluate our carrying amount versus recent offers  comparable sales  and our asking price in order to derive an estimate of its market value 
in the event that the carrying amount exceeds our estimate of market value  less a normalized margin  we record a write down of the carrying amount as a charge to the cost of home sales in the current period 
as of december   
table of contents  of our total inventory of  was older than one year 
for the years ended december  and we recorded a charge of  and  respectively to write carrying amounts down to market value 
if the company s estimate of fair value was overstated by  the company would record a write down to fair value  less a normalized margin  of  based upon the carrying value of inventory as of december  legal contingencies the company is currently involved in certain legal proceedings 
the company does not believe these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position 
it is possible  however  that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in assumptions and the effectiveness of strategies  related to these proceedings 
the amount of loss contingencies involving litigation  for which a loss is probable and which can be reasonably estimated  is determined through consultation with legal counsel representing the company 
our evaluation of loss contingencies arising from litigation  claims and assessments  considers unasserted claims and associated estimates of loss  if any  are provided to the extent probable and reasonably estimable 
see item legal proceedings 
results of operations for the years ended december   and the following discussion and analysis of consolidated results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements including their notes in item of this annual report 
inflation we do not believe that changes in inflation rates would have a material adverse effect on our business 
we believe that since our lease rates are determined annually for a majority of our leased sites  we would be able to recover increases in product and service costs caused by inflation through changes in lease rates

the tax treatment to shareholders of the dividends paid  if any  is generally determined based upon the character and amount of our taxable income for the relevant year 
for income tax purposes  dividends to common stockholders consist of ordinary income  capital gains including unrecaptured gain under section of the code  which is taxable to shareholders who are individuals at a maximum federal rate of  return of capital or a combination thereof 
for the years ended december   and  dividends paid per share were taxable as follows amount percentage amount percentage amount percentage return of capital ordinary income capital gains unrecaptured section gain total our dividend is set quarterly by our board of directors and is subject to change or elimination at any time 
our primary financial objective is to maximize long term  risk adjusted returns on investment for shareholders 
while dividend policy is considered within the context of this objective  maintenance of past dividend levels is not our primary investment objective and is subject to numerous factors including our profitability  capital expenditure plans  obligations related to principal payments and capitalized interest  and the availability of debt and equity capital at terms deemed attractive by us to finance these expenditures 
our nol may be used to offset all or a portion of our reit taxable income  which may allow us to reduce or eliminate our dividends paid and still maintain our reit status 
historically  the combination of dividend payments  capital expenditures  capitalized interest and debt repayment has exceeded funds provided from operating activities and we have funded a portion of these expenditures from debt financings 
however  there is no assurance that we will be able to continue to do so on terms deemed acceptable in the future 
in the event that we are unable to do so or decide not to pursue such financing source  we will be required to reduce or eliminate the dividend  reduce or eliminate capital expenditures  or both 
we initiated the plan on may  that allows shareholders to acquire additional shares of common stock by reinvesting some or all of the cash dividends paid on our outstanding common stock 
in addition  under the plan  monthly optional cash investments  which are subject to a minimum purchase amount of and a maximum quarterly purchase limit of  per shareholder  are permitted without approval from the board of directors

returns from home sales business we engage in the home sales business for four reasons to lease expansion home sites within our portfolio  thereby increasing the profitability and value of our communities  to upgrade existing leased home sites with new and more valuable homes  thereby increasing the long term value of the lease income stream  to broker the resale of homes in order to support investment values in the homes and to attract good neighbors all so as to promote the long term values of the communities  both for the residents who are our customers and for the long term growth and security of our own investment  and to resell any homes we acquire as a result of defaults in lease obligations owed to us 
we seek to measure the profitability of developing and leasing expansion home sites within our portfolio through identifying the following an estimate of the first year annualized profit on the leases originated on expansion home sites  an estimate of the total development costs of the expansion sites leased  including all current and projected development costs  and an estimate of the home sales profit or loss attributable to new homes sold on expansion sites  without consideration for the other aspects of the home sales business 
we believe that our projection of the first year returns from the leases originated on expansion home sites provides the reader of our financial statements with a comparison of the profitability of the new leased sites to our current portfolio and to alternative investments in stabilized communities 
our calculation of estimated first year annualized profit on leases originated on expansion home sites is based upon a non gaap financial measure 
we project the amount of variable property operating expenses we will incur as a result of the newly leased home sites 
in order to project our variable operating expenses  we begin with operating expenses determined under gaap and deduct those expenses we believe will not increase with the addition of newly leased sites 
the most directly comparable financial measure that can be reconciled to gaap is our historical return on investment in operational home sites  which is reconciled on page in footnote our presentation of the estimated first year return on the expansion home sites cannot be directly reconciled to a comparable gaap measure  principally because there will be leases that begin in the middle of the period and we estimate the incremental operating expenses associated with these leases 
the estimated first year annualized return on investment in expansion home sites should not be considered in isolation from nor is it intended to represent an alternative measure of operating income or cash flow or any other measure of performance as determined in accordance with gaap 
by comparing the estimated first year annualized profit on the expansion home site leases originated to the sum of total development costs  as increased in the event of a home sales loss or decreased in the event of a home sales profit by the estimated home sales profit or loss  we are able to measure the estimated first year annualized return on our investment in expansion home sites 
we believe that this measure provides a useful comparison to the returns available from investing in stabilized communities 

table of contents our calculation of an estimated first year annualized return on investment of new home sales includes the following components a we derive our estimated first year annualized profit on leases originated on expansion home sites by deducting estimated operating expenses from the contractual annual revenues from leases originated during the period 
we estimate operating expenses using one half of the actual ratio of property operating expenses incurred to property revenue generated in the prior year 
for example  if we originate a lease at a property where the ratio of operating expense to property revenues was for the prior year  we apply a expense ratio to project the additional expense associated with the newly leased home site for the first year 
we believe that one half of the actual expenses is an appropriate estimate of the relationship between fixed and variable expenses of operating our communities 
b the total development costs of the expansion sites leased are based upon the sum of land  construction costs  and other capitalized costs  including interest expense  as allocated to the individual home sites based upon the leased value of each home site 
c we determine the home sales profit or loss that is attributable to sale of homes situated on expansion home sites by deducting from the reported home sales operating income the gross margin and commissions attributable to the i sale of new homes on existing leased sites  ii the sale of used homes  and iii brokerage of home sale transactions between third parties 
we make no allocation of sales overhead to the transactions identified above 
we believe that our home sales operations drive our estimated first year annualized return on investment in expansion home sites because most of our expansion home site leases originate with our sale of a home 
comparison of the years ended december   and the leases facilitated by the home sales business during the years ended december   and are estimated to provide a first year return on investment of  and  respectively 
these returns are shown on the following page and are based upon unaudited pro forma information 
this compares to our realized returns from earning sites of for the years ended december  and and for the year ended december  the decrease in return on expansion home sites over the years ended  to is driven primarily by i increases in the per site cost of development as a result of larger lots to accommodate larger homes  ii increased lease incentives given in over  and iii increases in the per site cost of development as a result of additional amenities  offset partially by increased profitability of our home sales business resulting from more home sales over which the fixed home sales costs are allocated 
our future returns are dependent upon a number of factors including changes in the per site cost of development  changes in lease incentives utilized in support of the rate of new home sales  changes in the profitability of our home sales business  changes in the quantity of new homes sold and other factors

table of contents funds from operations we measure our economic profitability based on ffo  less annual capital replacement and enhancement spending for developed home sites 
for the year ended december   our capital replacement and enhancement spending averaged per developed home site 
we believe that the presentation of ffo  when considered with the financial data determined in accordance with gaap  provides a useful measure of our performance 
ffo should not be considered an alternative to net income or net cash flows from operating activities  as calculated in accordance with gaap  as an indication of our performance or as a measure of liquidity 
ffo is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund future cash needs 
the board of governors of the national association of real estate investment trusts also known as nareit defines ffo as net income loss  computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains and losses from debt restructuring and sales of depreciable real estate property  net of related income taxes  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization excluding amortization of financing costs  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
we calculate ffo beginning with the nareit definition as further adjusted for the minority interest in the operating partnership owned by persons other than us 
ffo is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund our cash needs  including our ability to make distributions  since ffo does not consider recurring capital expenditures  principal maturities or other capital expenditure commitments of the company 
we use ffo in measuring our operating performance because we believe that the items that result in a difference between ffo and net income have a different impact to the ongoing operating performance of a real estate company than to other businesses 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income or net cash flows from operating activities  as calculated under gaap  as an indication of our performance or as a measure of liquidity 
ffo is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund future cash needs 
our basis of computing ffo is not necessarily comparable with that of other reits
