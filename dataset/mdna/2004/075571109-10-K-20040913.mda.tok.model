item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this form k 
the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements  which involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including those set forth under risks that may affect results in this section 
fiscal year ended on june  and we reported this fiscal year on a calendar month basis 
effective july   we will report on a week period end 
each period will end on a saturday 
fiscal year started on july  and will end on july  the quarter beginning with july  will end october  and will include additional days in the reporting period 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the appropriate application of certain accounting policies  many of which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events and their impact on amounts reported in our financial statements and related notes 
since future events and their impact cannot be determined with certainty  the actual results will inevitably differ from our estimates 
such differences could be material to the financial statements 
we believe our application of accounting policies  and the estimates inherently required therein  are reasonable 
these accounting policies and estimates are constantly reevaluated  and adjustments are made when facts and circumstances dictate a change 
our accounting policies are more fully described in note to the financial statements 
we have identified certain critical accounting policies  which are described below 
inventories 
our inventories are stated at the lower of weighted average cost or market 
market is determined based on the estimated net realizable value  which is generally the merchandise selling price 
to ensure that our raw material is properly valued we age the fabric inventory and write down the inventory to reduce the cost in accordance with our established policy  which is based on historical experience 
to ensure our finished goods inventory is properly valued we review the age and turnover of our inventory and reduce the cost if the selling price is marked down below cost 
these assumptions can have an impact on current and future operating results and financial position 
we estimate shortage for the period between the last physical count and balance sheet date based on historic shortage trends 
if shortage trends increase it could negatively impact our profitability 
long lived assets 
we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances  such as store closures or poor performing stores  indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
if the undiscounted cash flows from the long lived assets are less than the carrying value we record an impairment charge equal to the difference between the carrying value and the asset s fair value 
in addition  at the time a decision is made to close a store  we record an impairment charge  if appropriate  or accelerate depreciation over the revised useful life 
historically  our impairment charges have been immaterial 
during fiscal and  we recorded charges for the impairment of store assets of  and  respectively 
we believe at this time that the long lived assets carrying values and useful lives continue to be appropriate 
sales return reserve 
we record a reserve for estimated product returns based on historical return trends 
for fiscal  the reserve was  compared to  in fiscal if actual returns are greater than those projected  additional sales returns may be recorded in the future 
accrued litigation 
we accrue liabilities for estimates of probable settlements of lawsuits 
during fiscal  two lawsuits were filed against us alleging misclassification of employment position 
the lawsuits seek class action status in addition to compensatory  statutory and injunctive relief 
we recorded a liability in the fourth quarter of for the estimated payment of claims 
the liability recorded as of june  is an estimate and should a greater amount of claims occur  the recorded liability may not be sufficient 
income taxes 
we accrue liabilities for estimates of probable settlements of domestic and foreign tax audits 
at any one time  several tax years may be subject to audit by various taxing jurisdictions 
the results of these audits and negotiations with taxing authorities may affect the ultimate settlement of these issues 
our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be materially impacted by changes in the mix and level of earnings 
we also record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets arising from foreign tax credit carryforwards as the utilization of these credits is not assured 
recent accounting pronouncements in march  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairments and its application to certain investments eitf 
eitf provides a three step impairment model for determining whether an investment is other than temporarily impaired and requires the company to recognize such impairments as an impairment loss equal to the difference between the investment s cost and fair value at the reporting date 
the guidance is effective for the company during the first quarter of fiscal the company does not believe that the adoption of eitf will have a significant effect on its financial statements 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain financial data as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated fiscal year ended june  statement of operating data net sales cost of sales  including production and occupancy gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses income from operations interest and other income  net earnings before income taxes provision for income taxes net earnings cost of sales includes the cost of merchandise  occupancy costs and production costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses primarily consist of non occupancy store costs  corporate overhead and advertising costs 
years ended june  and net sales 
net sales increased to million during the year ended june  from million in fiscal  an increase of million  or 
of this increase  new  expanded or remodeled stores not included in the comparable store sales base added million to sales  and an increase in comparable store sales of increased sales by million 
the increase in comparable store sales performance was largely due to customer acceptance of the product offering and a more balanced assortment of merchandise that contributed to an increase in transactions per store 
based on the company s current product offering  we expect positive comparable store sales in fiscal year gross profit 
gross profit increased to million for the year ended june  from million in fiscal  an increase of million  or 
as a percentage of net sales  gross profit increased to for fiscal from during fiscal the increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales resulted from improved merchandise margins of percentage points and favorable occupancy leverage of percentage points 
these improvements are a result of customer acceptance of our merchandise and higher comparable store sales 
we expect to continue to experience margin improvement as a result of favorable occupancy leverage 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses  which primarily consist of non occupancy store costs  corporate overhead and advertising costs  increased to million during fiscal from million in fiscal  an increase of million  or 
as a percentage of net sales  these expenses decreased to during fiscal from in fiscal this decrease as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to lower compensation associated with higher store productivity  lower depreciation due to fully depreciated assets  offset by increased incentive compensation and costs associated with the potential settlements of outstanding lawsuits 
we expect to continue to benefit from increased leverage on fixed expenses during fiscal interest and other income  net 
we generated million of interest and other income net of other expenses during fiscal as compared to million in fiscal average cash balances continued to increase due to positive operating results  offset by lower interest rates 
provision for income taxes 
the effective tax rate was for fiscal as compared to for fiscal the higher effective tax rate for is primarily attributable to an increase in the valuation allowance against foreign tax credit carry forwards as the utilization of these carry forwards is not assured 
years ended june  and net sales 
net sales increased to million during fiscal from million in fiscal  an increase of million  or 
of this increase  new  expanded or remodeled stores not included in the comparable store sales base added million to sales  while a decrease in comparable store sales of reduced sales by million 
the decrease in comparable store sales performance was attributed to the following marketplace conditions which impacted customer traffic to our stores  missed opportunities in key product categories and production delays which resulted in missed sales opportunities and increased promotional activities 
gross profit 
gross profit increased to million for fiscal from million in fiscal  an increase of million  or 
as a percentage of net sales  gross profit decreased to for the year from during fiscal the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales resulted from negative occupancy leverage offset by slightly higher net merchandise margins 
negative occupancy expense leverage was the result of lower sales productivity 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses  which primarily consist of non occupancy store costs  corporate overhead and advertising costs  increased to million during fiscal from million in fiscal  an increase of million  or 
as a percentage of net sales  these expenses increased to during fiscal from in fiscal this increase as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to higher compensation associated with the store commission structure  higher depreciation due to negative leverage and investments in the company s infrastructure  and store closure expenses and reserves which amounted to  related to store closures and an impairment reserve for stores 
expenses were also impacted by charges related to abandoned information technology projects which were offset by a favorable legal settlement 
interest and other expense income  net 
we generated million of interest and other income net of other expenses during fiscal as compared to million in fiscal average cash balances continued to increase arising from operating results offset by lower interest rates 
provision for income taxes 
the effective tax rate for fiscal was as compared to in fiscal the lower effective tax rate for fiscal was primarily attributable to a lower effective state tax rate due to the benefits of the corporate legal entity restructuring 
seasonality of business and quarterly results our business varies with general seasonal trends that are characteristic of the retail and apparel industries 
as a result  our typical store generates a majority of our annual net sales and profitability in the second quarter of our fiscal year which includes the fall and holiday selling seasons compared to other quarters of our fiscal year 
if for any reason our sales were below seasonal norms during the second quarter of our fiscal year  our annual operating results would be negatively impacted 
because of the seasonality of our business  results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year 
liquidity and capital resources our working capital requirements vary widely throughout the year and generally peak in the first and second fiscal quarters 
at june   we had approximately million of cash and equivalents  short term marketable securities and long term marketable securities on hand 
in addition  we had a revolving line of credit  under which we could borrow or issue letters of credit up to a combined total of million 
as of june   there were no borrowings under the line of credit and letters of credit outstanding totaled million 
net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal  and was million  million and million  respectively 
the increase in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal compared to was primarily the result of an increase in net income  increase in accrued liabilities primarily related to incentive compensation  and other changes in working capital 
net cash used by investing activities was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the primary use of these funds was for capital expenditures 
the decrease in cash used by investing activities in was a result of net proceeds from marketable securities  as compared to net purchases of marketable securities in  offset by higher capital expenditures 
capital expenditures in relate to the purchase of our new design studio and production facility in los angeles for approximately million  the opening of new stores for approximately million  the expansion relocation of stores for approximately million  and investments in management information systems of approximately million 
we opened new stores in each of fiscal  and and we expect to open stores in fiscal in fiscal year  we expect capital expenditures of approximately million for new stores  approximately million for store expansion relocation conversion  approximately million for investments in information systems and approximately of other capital expenditures 
during fiscal  the average of bebe and bebe sport new store construction costs before tenant allowances was  per store 
the average gross inventory investment per store was  net cash provided by financing activities was million  million and million in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively  and was derived from proceeds from the issuance of common stock arising from stock option exercises 
on august  our board of directors approved an annual cash dividend of per common share on our common stock 
the first quarterly dividend of per share is payable september  to stockholders of record on september  we believe that our cash on hand  together with our cash flow from operations  will be sufficient to meet our capital and operating requirements through fiscal our future capital requirements  however  will depend on numerous factors  including without limitation  the size and number of new and expanded stores  investment costs for management information systems  potential acquisitions and or joint ventures  repurchase of stock and future results of operations 
summary disclosures about contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following tables summarize our significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of june  in thousands amount of commitment expiration period total less than year years years after years dollars in thousands operating leases unconditional purchase obligations trade letters of credit standby letters of credit total contractual obligations and commercial commitments unconditional purchase obligations are defined as agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on the company and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
included in the purchase obligations category above are commitments for inventory purchases  capital expenditures  information technology and professional services 
most arrangements are cancelable without a significant penalty and with short notice usually to days 
amounts reflected on the consolidated balance sheet as accounts payable and accrued liabilities are excluded from the table above 
as of june   there were no borrowings outstanding under the line of credit 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on the results of operations in the recent past 
however  we cannot assure that our business will not be affected by inflation in the future 
risks that may affect results factors that might cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward looking statements discussed elsewhere in this report  as well as affect our ability to achieve our financial and other goals  include  but are not limited to  the following risks relating to our business the success of our business depends in large part on our ability to identify fashion trends as well as to react to changing customer demand in a timely manner 
consequently  we depend in part upon customer response to the creative efforts of our merchandising  design and marketing teams and their ability to anticipate trends and fashions that will appeal to our consumer base 
if we miscalculate our customers product preferences or the demand for our products  we may be faced with excess inventory 
historically  this type of occurrence has resulted in excess fabric for some products and markdowns and or write offs  which has impaired our profitability  and may do so in the future 
similarly  any failure on our part to anticipate  identify and respond effectively to changing consumer demands and fashion trends will adversely affect our sales 
if we are unable to obtain raw materials  unable to find manufacturing facilities or our manufacturers perform unacceptably  our sales may be negatively affected and our financial condition may be harmed 
we do not own any manufacturing facilities and therefore depend upon third parties to manufacture our products 
we place all of our orders for production of merchandise and raw materials by purchase order and do not have any long term contracts with any manufacturer or supplier 
if we fail to maintain favorable relationships with our manufacturers and suppliers or are unable to obtain sufficient quantities of quality raw materials on commercially reasonable terms  it could harm our business and results of operations 
we cannot assure you that third party manufacturers will not supply similar products to our competitors  will not stop supplying products to us completely or will supply products in a timely manner 
untimely receipt of products may result in markdowns which would have a negative impact on earnings 
furthermore  we have received in the past  and may receive in the future  shipments of products from manufacturers that fail to conform to our quality control standards 
in such event  unless we are able to obtain replacement products in a timely manner  we may lose sales 
certain of our third party manufacturers store our raw materials 
in the event our inventory was damaged or destroyed and we were unable to obtain replacement raw materials  our earnings may be negatively impacted 
our success depends on our ability to attract and retain key employees in order to support our existing business and future expansion 
from time to time we actively recruit qualified candidates to fill key positions from within the company 
there is substantial competition for experienced personnel  which we expect to continue 
we compete for experienced personnel with companies who have greater financial resources than we do 
in the past  we have experienced significant turnover of our executive management team and retail store personnel 
we are also exposed to employment practice litigation due to the large number of employees and high turnover of our sales associates 
if we fail to attract  motivate and retain qualified personnel  it could harm our business and limit our ability to expand 
in addition  we depend upon the expertise and execution of our key employees  particularly manny mashouf  the founder  chairman of the board and majority shareholder 
we do not carry key person life insurance policies on any of our employees 
if we lose the services of mr 
mashouf or any key officers or employees  it could harm our business and results of operations 
if we are not able to successfully expand our bebe and bebe sport stores our revenue base and earnings may be impaired 
as part of our growth strategy  we may open larger bebe stores 
if these stores are not successful  our financial condition may be harmed 
in addition  we launched a new store concept  bebe sport during fiscal for which we have committed significant financial and human resources to develop and expand 
the failure of the bebe sport concept may result in a negative impact to earnings 
there can be no assurance that future store openings will be successful 
we expect to open approximately stores in fiscal  of which approximately eight will be bebe sport stores approximately eleven will be bebe stores and approximately one will be an outlet store 
there can be no assurance that these stores  or any other stores that we might open in the future  will be successful or that our overall gross profit will increase as a result of opening these stores 
in addition  most of our new store openings in fiscal will be in existing markets 
these openings may affect the existing stores net sales volumes and profitability 
our failure to predict accurately the demographic or retail environment at any future store location could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
any serious disruption at our major facilities could have a harmful effect on our business 
we currently operate our corporate office in brisbane  california  a distribution facility in benicia  california  and a design studio and production facility in los angeles  california 
we have also recently purchased a design studio and production facility in los angeles  california 
any serious disruption at these facilities whether due to construction  relocation  fire  earthquake  terrorist acts or otherwise would harm our operations and could have a harmful effect on our business and results of operations 
furthermore  we have little experience operating essential functions away from our main corporate offices and are uncertain what effect operating such satellite facilities might have on business  personnel and results of operations 
we are in process of implementing a business continuity plan that will address recovery in the event of a serious disruption at one of our major facilities 
we face significant competition in the retail and apparel industry  which could harm our sales and profitability 
the retail and apparel industries are highly competitive and are characterized by low barriers to entry 
key competitors include  but are not limited to arden b  bcbg  express  guess  and the tbd and savvy departments within nordstrom 
we expect competition in our markets to increase 
the primary competitive factors in our markets are brand name recognition  sourcing strategies  product styling  quality  presentation and pricing  timeliness of product development and delivery  store ambiance  customer service and convenience 
we compete with traditional department stores  specialty store retailers  business to consumer websites  off price retailers and direct marketers for  among other things  raw materials  market share  retail space  finished goods  sourcing and personnel 
because many of these competitors are larger and have substantially greater financial  distribution and marketing resources than we do  we may lack the resources to adequately compete with them 
if we fail to compete in any way  it could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
purchases of the merchandise we sell are generally discretionary and are therefore particularly susceptible to economic slowdowns 
if economic conditions change  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
consumers are generally more willing to make discretionary purchases  including purchases of fashion products  during periods in which favorable economic conditions prevail 
the outlook for the united states economy is uncertain and is directly affected by global political factors that are beyond our control 
any escalation of military action involving the united states could cause increased volatility in financial markets  further adversely affecting consumer confidence and spending habits 
if we are not able to successfully protect our intellectual property our ability to capitalize on the value of our brand name may be impaired 
even though we take actions to establish  register and protect our trademarks and other proprietary rights  we cannot assure you that we will be successful or that others will not imitate our products or infringe upon our intellectual property rights 
in addition  we cannot assure you that others will not resist or seek to block the sale of our products as infringements of their trademark and proprietary rights 
we are seeking to register our trademarks domestically and internationally 
obstacles exist that may prevent us from obtaining a trademark for the bebe name or related names 
we may not be able to register certain trademarks  purchase the right or obtain a license to use the bebe name on commercially reasonable terms 
if we fail to obtain trademark registrations  ownership or license the requisite rights  it would limit our ability to expand 
in some jurisdictions  despite successful registration of our trademarks  third parties may allege infringement and bring actions against us 
in addition  if our licensees fail to use our intellectual property correctly  the goodwill associated with our trademarks may be diluted 
furthermore  if we do not demonstrate use of our trademarks  our trademark rights may lapse over time 
if an independent manufacturer violates labor or other laws  or is accused of violating any such laws  or if their labor practices diverge from those generally accepted as ethical  it could harm our business and brand image 
while we maintain a policy to monitor the operations of our independent manufacturers by having an independent firm inspect these manufacturing sites  and all manufacturers are contractually required to comply with such labor practices  we cannot control the actions or the public s perceptions of such manufacturers  nor can we assure that these manufacturers will conduct their businesses using ethical or legal labor practices 
apparel companies can be held jointly liable for the wrongdoings of the manufacturers of their products 
while we do not control their employees employment conditions or the manufacturer s business practices  and the manufacturers act in their own interest  they may act in a manner that results in negative public perceptions of us and or employee allegations or court determinations that we are jointly liable 
risks relating to our common stock our stock price may fluctuate because of the small number of shares that can be publicly traded and the low average daily trading volumes 
the vast majority of our outstanding shares of our common stock are not registered and are subject to trading restrictions 
as of june   only  shares of our common stock were available to be publicly traded  and as a result  our average daily trading volumes are relatively low  and our stock price is vulnerable to market swings due to large purchases  sales and short sales of our common stock 
because a principal shareholder controls the company  other shareholders may not be able to influence the direction the company takes 
as of june   manny mashouf  the chairman of the board  beneficially owned approximately of the outstanding shares of our common stock 
as a result  he alone can control the election of directors and the outcome of all issues submitted to the shareholders 
this may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire shares  may discourage acquisition bids  and could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay for shares of common stock 
this concentration of stock ownership may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control of our company 
if we account for employee stock options using the fair value method  it could significantly reduce our net income 
there has been ongoing public debate whether stock options granted to employees should be treated as compensation expense and  if so  how to properly value such charges 
on march   the financial accounting standard board fasb issued an exposure draft  share based payment an amendment of fasb statements no 
and  which would require a company to recognize  as an expense  the fair value of stock options and other stock based compensation to employees beginning in and subsequent reporting periods 
if we elect or are required to record an expense for our stock based compensation plans using the fair value method as described in the exposure draft  we could have significant and ongoing accounting charges  which could significantly reduce our net income 
investor confidence and share value may be adversely impacted if we are unable to favorably assess  or our independent registered public accountants are unable to provide an unqualified attestation report on our assessment of  the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year as required by section of the sarbanes oxley act of an effective system of internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports 
rules adopted by the securities and exchange commission pursuant to section of the sarbanes oxley act of require annual assessment of our internal control over financial reporting  and attestation of our assessment by our independent registered public accountants 
this requirement will first apply to our annual report on form k for the fiscal year ending july  the rules governing the standards that must be met for management to assess the internal control over financial reporting as effective are new and complex  and require significant documentation  testing and possible remediation to meet the detailed standards under the new rules 
although we are diligently reviewing  documenting and testing our internal control over financial reporting  we may encounter problems or delays in completing the implementation of any changes necessary to make a favorable assessment of our internal control over financial reporting under the new standards 
in addition  the evaluation and attestation process by our independent registered public accountants is new and we may encounter problems or delays in completing the implementation of any requested improvements and receiving a favorable review and attestation by our independent registered public accountants 
if we cannot favorably assess  or our independent registered public accountants are unable to provide an unqualified attestation report on our assessment of  the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting  investor confidence and share value may be negatively impacted 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks  which include changes in us interest rates and  to a lesser extent  foreign exchange rates 
we do not engage in financial transactions for trading or speculative purposes 
interest rate risk 
we currently maintain a portfolio of variable interest rate investments consisting of cash equivalents  short term marketable securities and long term marketable securities 
marketable securities are comprised of closed end variable interest rate funds that invest primarily in tax exempt municipal bonds 
due to the variable nature of these investments  their value is typically not subject to market rate changes 
according to our investment policy  we may invest in taxable and tax exempt instruments 
in addition  the policy establishes limits on credit quality  maturity  issuer and type of instrument 
marketable securities are classified as available for sale 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents 
the remaining investments are considered short term marketable securities if maturities range between four and twelve months or long term marketable securities if maturities are over twelve months 
the following table lists our cash equivalents  short term marketable securities and long term marketable securities at june  fair value dollars in thousands cash equivalents weighted average interest rate short term marketable securities weighted average interest rate long term marketable securities weighted average interest rate total the interest payable on our bank line of credit is based on variable interest rates and therefore affected by changes in market interest rates 
if interest rates rose 
from the bank s reference rate as of june   our results from operations and cash flows would not be significantly affected since we have no outstanding borrowings 
foreign currency risks 
we enter into a significant amount of purchase obligations outside of the us substantially all of which are negotiated and settled in us dollars and  therefore  we have only minimal exposure to foreign currency exchange risks 
we also operate a subsidiary with a functional currency other than the us dollar 
this subsidiary represented less than two percent of total revenues for fiscal year and  therefore  presents only minimal exposure to foreign currency exchange risks 
we do not hedge against foreign currency risks and believe that foreign currency exchange risk is immaterial
