upon the termination of the leases with prime  beginning in january  all of our hotels were leased to the trs lessees and operated under independent management contracts 
consequently  beginning january   our consolidated results of operations reflect hotel level revenues and operating expenses for all of our hotels 
in order to show comparability of our results of operations  we have presented below a pro forma presentation of and because of the significant changes to our corporate structure as a result of the termination of the prime leases effective january   we believe that a discussion of our pro forma results for the hotels that were subject to third party leases in is meaningful and relevant to an investor s understanding of our present and future operations 
the pro forma adjustments required to reflect the termination of the prime leases are to record hotel level revenues and expenses and reduce historical rental income with respect to these properties

the pro forma financial information does not purport to represent what our results of operations or financial condition would actually have been if the transactions had in fact occurred at the beginning of or to project our results of operations or financial condition for any future period 
the pro forma financial information is based upon available information and upon assumptions and estimates that management believes are reasonable under the circumstances 
revenues hotel revenues of approximately million for decreased approximately million  or  as compared to approximately million in on a pro forma basis 
the decrease in revenue is primarily due to a revpar decline of as compared to our occupancy increased points to as compared to  and our adr decreased to as compared to other revenue of approximately  for decreased approximately million  or  as compared to approximately million in this decrease was primarily due to a decrease of  in the income received from the provision of certain management services to our joint venture  ghii  llc and a decrease in miscellaneous income of approximately  related to linen inventory in conjunction with the creation of our trs lessees 
operating expenses hotel expenses of approximately million for million increased approximately million  or  as compared to approximately million in on a pro forma basis 
the increase in hotel expenses is primarily due to increased insurance premiums and increased payroll and employee benefits 
hotel expenses as a percentage of hotel revenues were in and in on a pro forma basis 
depreciation expense of approximately million for was relatively flat as compared to property taxes  rental expense and insurance expenses of approximately million for increased approximately million  or  as compared to approximately million in the increase was primarily due to an increase of approximately  in our land lease expense  an increase of approximately  in real estate taxes and an increase in insurance expense of approximately million due to the aftermath of the september  national tragedy 
general and administrative expenses of approximately million for remained relatively flat as compared to for  we recorded  in charges related to provisions for doubtful accounts as compared to approximately million in related to an impairment of long lived assets combined with provisions for doubtful accounts 
operating income for  we recorded operating income of approximately million as compared to operating income of approximately million for on a pro forma basis 
the principal factors relating to the change in operating income for as compared to was a decrease of approximately million related to our hotel revenues on a pro forma basis  an increase in hotel expenses of approximately million on a pro forma basis  an increase in property taxes  rental expense and insurance of approximately million  partially offset by an impairment charge of  and provisions for doubtful accounts of approximately million recorded in liquidity and capital resources equity inns principal source of cash to meet its operating requirements  including distributions to our shareholders and repayments of indebtedness  is from our hotels results of operations 
for  net cash flows provided by our operating activities was approximately million 
we currently expect that our operating cash flows will be sufficient to fund our continuing operations  including our required debt service obligations and distributions to shareholders required to maintain our reit status 
we expect to fund any short term liquidity requirements above our operating cash flows through short term borrowings under our line of credit 
in june  we entered into our collateralized line of credit for million  subject to certain restrictions 
borrowings under the line of credit bear interest at libor plus to per annum as determined by the quarterly leverage of equity inns  and this facility matures in june the line of credit maintains certain restrictions regarding capital expenditures and other quarterly financial covenants  including a test for free cash flow for dividend payouts  a fixed charge test and a leverage test  among other covenants 
at december   we had the ability to borrow over million under our line of credit 
during  we raised million in net equity through a combination of common and preferred offerings 
the net proceeds from the issuances were used to pay down our line of credit 
during  we sold four hotels hampton inn in ft 
worth  texas  hampton inn suites in bartlett  tennessee  holiday inn express in wilkesboro  north carolina and amerisuites in jacksonville  florida for an aggregate price of million  resulting in a gain on these sales of approximately million  net of impairment charges previously recorded 
approximately  of this gain has been deferred by the company 
the sales prices were paid in cash  except for the jacksonville hotel  million of which was in the form of a month note bearing interest at per annum 
the proceeds were utilized to pay down our long term debt 
we may make additional investments in hotel properties and may incur indebtedness to make such investments or to meet distribution requirements imposed on a reit under the internal revenue code of to the extent that working capital and cash flows from our investments are insufficient to make such distributions 
our board of directors has adopted a policy limiting aggregate indebtedness to of our investment in hotel properties  at cost  after giving effect to our use of proceeds from any indebtedness 
this policy may be amended at any time by the board of directors without shareholder vote

on march   we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a financial institution on a notional amount of million 
the agreement became effective in november and expires in november the agreement effectively fixes the interest rate on the first million of floating rate debt outstanding under our line of credit at a rate of per annum plus the interest rate spread on our line of credit  thus reducing exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
the notional amount does not represent amounts exchanged by the parties  and thus is not a measure of exposure to us 
the differences to be paid or received by us under the interest rate swap agreement are recognized as an adjustment to interest expense 
the agreement is with a major financial institution  which is expected to fully perform under the terms of the agreement

during  we invested million to fund capital improvements in our hotels  including replacement of carpets  drapes  renovation of common areas and improvements of hotel exteriors 
in addition  we expect to fund approximately million in for capital improvements with million representing one time upgrades to certain of our hotel properties 
we intend to fund such improvements out of future cash flows from operations  current cash balances and borrowings under our line of credit 
under certain of our loan covenants  we are obligated to fund of room revenues per quarter on a cumulative basis  to a separate room renovation account for the ongoing replacement or refurbishment of furniture  fixtures and equipment at our hotels 
for and  the amounts expended exceeded  in aggregate  the amounts required under the loan covenants 
reits are subject to a number of organizational and operational requirements 
for example  for federal income tax purposes  a reit  and therefore the company  is required to pay distributions of at least of its taxable income to our shareholders 
we intend to pay these distributions from operating cash flows 
during  our partnership distributed an aggregate of million to our partners  or 
per unit including million of distributions to the company to fund distributions to our shareholders of 
per share in 
during  our partnership distributed an aggregate of million to our partners  or 
per share 
we expect to make future quarterly distributions to our shareholders 
the amount of our future distributions will be based upon quarterly operating results  economic conditions  capital requirements  the internal revenue code s annual distribution requirements  leverage restrictions imposed by our line of credit and other factors which our board of directors deems relevant 
we expect to meet our long term liquidity requirements  such as scheduled debt maturities and property acquisitions  through long term secured and unsecured borrowings  the issuance of additional equity securities of the company or  in connection with acquisitions of hotel properties  the issuance of partnership units 
under our partnership s limited partnership agreement  subject to certain holding period requirements  holders of units in our partnership have the right to require the partnership to redeem their units 
during   units were tendered for redemption 
under the partnership agreement  we have the option to redeem units tendered for redemption on a one for one basis for shares of common stock or for an equivalent amount of cash 
we anticipate that we will acquire any units tendered for redemption in the foreseeable future in exchange for shares of common stock and  to date  have registered such shares so as to be freely tradeable by the recipient 
we have obligations and commitments to make future payments under debt and operating lease contracts 
the following schedule details these obligations at december  in thousands less than after total year years years years long term debt      operating leases     total contractual obligations      funds from operations the national association of real estate investment trusts  or nareit  defines funds from operations  or ffo  as net income computed in accordance with gaap excluding gains or losses from sales of real estate  the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles  real estate related depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
ffo is presented on a per share basis after making adjustments for the effects of dilutive securities 
we use ffo per share as a measure of performance to adjust for certain non cash expenses such as depreciation and amortization because historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
nareit adopted the definition of ffo in order to promote an industry wide standard measure of reit operating performance 
accordingly  as a member of nareit  we adopted ffo as a measure to evaluate performance and facilitate comparisons between us and other reits  although ffo and ffo per share may not be comparable to those measures reported by other companies 
adjusted ffo we have further adjusted ffo for a provision for doubtful accounts related to a note receivable  losses on impairment of hotels held for sale  original issuance cost of redeemed series a preferred stock  our non cash deferred income tax valuation allowance and deferred income tax benefits 
we refer to this as adjusted funds from operations  or affo 
our computation of affo and affo per share is not comparable to the nareit definition of ffo or to similar measures reported by other reits  but we believe it is an appropriate measure for our company 
we use affo because we believe that this measure provides investors a more useful indicator of the operating performance of our hotels by adjusting for the effects of certain non cash items arising from our investing and financing activities and our income tax reporting 
affo per share is also used by the compensation committee of our board of directors as one of the criteria for performance based compensation 
the following reconciliation of net income to ffo and affo illustrates the difference in these measures of operating performance for the years ended december  in thousands  except per share and unit data net income loss    less gain on sale of hotel properties  preferred stock dividends    loss on redemption of series a preferred stock  add minority interest depreciation of buildings  furniture and fixtures    funds from operations    add other items provision for doubtful accounts  impairment of long lived assets  loss on redemption of series a preferred stock  deferred tax asset valuation allowance  less income tax benefit    adjusted funds from operations    weighted average number of diluted common shares and units outstanding    inflation operators of hotels in general have the ability to adjust room rates quickly 
however  competitive pressures may limit our ability to raise room rates in the face of inflation 
seasonality hotel operations historically are seasonal in nature  generally reflecting higher occupancy rates and revpar during the second and third quarters 
this seasonality can be expected to cause fluctuations in our quarterly results of operations 
recent accounting pronouncements note of the notes to consolidated financial statements discusses the expected impact of accounting policies recently issued or proposed but not yet required to be adopted 
to the extent the adoption of new accounting standards affects our financial condition  results of operations or liquidity  the impacts are discussed in the applicable section s of the management s discussion and analysis and the notes to consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires our management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  all estimates are evaluated by our management  including those related to bad debts  carrying value of investments in hotel properties  income taxes  contingencies and litigation 
all estimates are based upon historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers and other borrowers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers or other borrowers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we record an impairment charge when we believe an investment in hotels has been impaired such that future undiscounted cash flows would not recover the book basis of the investment in the hotel property 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax asset to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
we have determined that a full valuation allowance is needed for the company s deferred tax asset at december  if our management determines that we will be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be charged to income in the periods such determination was made 
other developments acquisitions in late and early  we announced our intent to purchase nine hotels from the mckibbon hotel group 
all of these transactions are expected to close by the end of may the total purchase price for the nine hotels is approximately million  including the assumption of approximately million in secured debt  and we expect to fund these acquisitions primarily through borrowings under our line of credit and the additional issuance of equity securities 
the average age of these nine hotels is seven years 
on january   the company completed the acquisition of the above mentioned hotel  a room marriott courtyard hotel located in tallahassee  florida  for approximately million in cash 
long lived asset impairments and sales during the second and fourth quarters of  we recorded charges for impairments of approximately million and million  respectively  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  as a result of our strategic decision to market four properties for sale 
consequently  we have accounted for the operations of such properties as discontinued in each of the periods presented 
during january  we sold two of these hotels hampton inn  jacksonville  florida  and hampton inn  sarasota  florida for an aggregate sales price of approximately million 
we used a portion of the proceeds of these sales to repay borrowings under our secured long term debt and to pay related prepayment penalties of  as a condition to the sale of the jacksonville hampton inn  the company agreed to increase its note receivable from hm nm  inc by  and applied this amount toward the purchase price of the jacksonville hampton inn 
the increased amount of the note is due and payable in february  bears interest at per annum  and is secured by the land  building  furniture and fixtures of the amerisuites hotel sold to the same buyer in november located at western way circle  jacksonville  florida 
recording of income tax valuation allowance at year end  we determined that a valuation allowance was necessary for our entire deferred income tax asset due to the continued softness in the lodging industry and the uncertainty associated with its future recovery 
accordingly  we recorded an approximate million non cash valuation allowance million after minority interests consideration associated with our deferred income tax asset in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
additionally  we will discontinue recording a deferred income tax benefit for hotel development we intend to develop a room  full service marriott hotel in sandy  utah  a suburb of salt lake city  utah 
we estimate that the development cost of this hotel will be approximately million  including approximately million in land previously purchased by us  and will be completed by mid line of credit on january   we amended our line of credit to provide for more flexibility regarding our financial covenants through june we incurred an amendment fee of approximately  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s we are exposed to certain financial market risks  the most predominant of which is the fluctuation in interest rates 
at december   our exposure to market risk for a change in interest rates is related to our debt outstanding under the line of credit and certain hotel secured debt 
total debt outstanding under these two debentures totaled million at december  our line of credit bears interest at a variable rate of libor plus to per annum as determined by our quarterly leverage 
at december   our interest rate on our line of credit was libor at december  plus 
our interest rate risk objective is to limit the impact of interest rate fluctuations on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs 
to achieve this objective  we manage our exposure to fluctuations in market interest rates for our borrowings through the use of fixed rate debt instruments to the extent that reasonably favorable rates are obtainable through such arrangements and derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps  to effectively lock the interest rate on a portion of our variable rate debt 
we do not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes 
we also regularly review interest rate exposure on our outstanding borrowings in an effort to minimize the risk of interest rate fluctuation 
on march   we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a financial institution on a notional amount of million 
the agreement became effective in november and expires in november the agreement effectively fixes the interest rate on the first million of floating rate debt outstanding under our line of credit at a rate of per annum plus the interest rate spread on our line of credit  thus reducing exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
the notional amount does not represent amounts exchanged by the parties  and thus is not a measure of exposure to the company 
the differences to be paid or received by the company under the interest rate swap agreement are recognized as an adjustment to interest expense 
the agreement is with a major financial institution  which is expected to fully perform under the terms of the agreement

at december   we had no variable rate debt outstanding under our line of credit that was exposed to fluctuations in the market rate of interest due to the two interest rate swaps discussed above 
our line of credit matures in june as discussed above  our line of credit bears interest at variable rates  and therefore  cost approximates market value 
at december   the fair value liability of our interest rate swaps was approximately  our operating results are affected by changes in interest rates  primarily as a result of our borrowings under the line of credit 
if interest rates increased by basis points  our interest expense would have increased by approximately  based on balances outstanding during
