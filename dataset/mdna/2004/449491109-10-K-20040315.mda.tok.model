item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion together with the consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this item contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results may differ materially from those included in such forward looking statements 
factors which could cause actual results to differ materially include those set forth under forward looking information and the factors affecting future performance  included in item  as well as those otherwise discussed in this section and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
unless otherwise specified or the context requires otherwise  the terms we  our and us refer to idx systems corporation and its subsidiaries 
introduction overview founded in  idx systems corporation provides information technology software and service solutions to maximize value in the delivery of healthcare by improving the quality of patient service  enhancing medical outcomes and reducing the costs of care 
we offer business performance and clinical software solutions 
healthcare providers purchase idx systems  which are designed to be complementary and functionally rich  to improve their patients experience through simpler access  safer care delivery and more streamlined accounting 
we generate revenues from system sales and maintenance and service fees 
our system sales are comprised of a combination of idx software licensed under the flowcast  groupcast  carecast and imagecast brands to primarily end user customers  as well as bundled third party hardware and software 
in addition our idx ecommerce services business offers web based electronic data interchange edi claims  remittance and statement services using a single internet connection and is designed to improve data quality and streamline business processes by linking physician practices to sophisticated mailing services and other businesses 
our maintenance and service fees consist of software maintenance fees  installation fees  professional and technical service fees  consulting fees and other miscellaneous fees 
costs relating to system sales consist primarily of 
table of contents external costs for bundled third party hardware and software purchases 
costs relating to maintenance and service fees consist primarily of employee costs and related infrastructure costs incurred in providing installation services  post installation support and training and consulting services 
our revenue growth is driven by demand for new healthcare information technology systems and services as well as installation  maintenance and service to our existing customers  which total more than  installation sites and include more than  physicians as of december  our earnings growth is driven primarily by idx software sales  which yield significantly higher gross profit margins than our hardware and services revenue components 
our ability to maintain or increase our services revenue in the future depends primarily on our ability to increase our installed customer base  resubscribe existing customers to maintenance agreements and to maintain or increase current levels of our professional services business 
significant events in june  we completed the disposition of our wholly owned subsidiary  edix  to tem  a medical transcription company based in franklin  tennessee  for approximately million 
the sale resulted in a gain of million  including an income tax benefit of million  and generated approximately million in cash  net of our transactions costs and cash transferred as part of the sale 
with the sale of edix  we no longer provide medical transcription outsourcing services 
our financial statements have been reclassified to reflect edix as a discontinued operation for all periods presented in this annual report on form k 
as a result  we no longer discuss edix as a separate segment 
for purposes of this annual report on form k  the discussion will relate to our only segment  information systems and services  which is discussed under the results from continuing operations section below 
the results of edix through june  the date of sale are discussed under the results of discontinued operations section below 
financial results we measure financial performance by monitoring revenue and backlog from systems and services  days sales outstanding  recurring revenue  gross profit margin  operating margin and earnings per share 
marked a successful transition and turnaround in the profitability of idx 
in  we experienced revenue growth  improved margins and a reduction in the average time we collect payment on sales  measured by days sales outstanding dso 
in addition  during  we generated approximately million in cash flow from operating activities and invested approximately million in our enterprise resource planning erp system 
in  we began implementation of the erp system  which is designed to align and integrate our employees  processes and technology through software applications using best practices 
the erp system is designed to provide us with a strong infrastructure to support our planned growth 
our revenues from continuing operations increased to million in from million in and in from million in driven by our ability to generate new sales as well as sales to our existing customers 
flowcast and groupcast operating units  which encompass our ecommerce services clearinghouse business  exceeded their revenues from prior years 
we also experienced growth in the carecast business  which combines our business performance and clinical solutions  and in the imagecast business  which provides integrated information and imaging systems 
our overall cost of sales percentage decreased by approximately in as compared to contributing to an operating margin of million or in in  we reported income from continuing operations of million  or diluted earnings per share  and at december   cash and marketable securities totaled million 
the statements of operations for  and included the following income from continuing operations for the year ended december   included a million income tax benefit resulting from the reversal of our deferred tax asset valuation allowance 

table of contents income from continuing operations for the year ended december   included before income taxes i a gain of million  net of income taxes  resulting from the sale of our majority owned subsidiary  channelhealth  to allscripts  and ii a lease abandonment charge of million  net of income taxes 
loss from continuing operations for the year ended december   included the following items  before income taxes i a million restructuring charge  ii a million gain resulting from the sale of our majority owned subsidiary  channelhealth  to allscripts  iii a million realized gain from a distribution of marketable equity securities related to an investment in an unrelated investment partnership  and iv a million equity loss on our investment in allscripts 
a more detailed discussion of our results is presented in the results from continuing operations section below 
idx in the uk we currently anticipate that revenues from our subcontractor arrangements relating to the nhs will account for approximately to of our consolidated revenues in we currently anticipate that the first year of the uk project will involve significant start up costs resulting in initial lower operating margins for our uk operation  however  we currently expect the uk business to contribute positively to earnings in and in the long term 
revenues generated under these subcontract arrangements represent software sales that will require significant customization  and as such  will be recognized under the percentage to completion method 
our subcontract agreements will be denominated in british pounds sterling and as such our operating results will be affected by changes in the relative strength of the united states dollar against the british pound  which will be recorded as foreign currency transaction gains or losses 
our revenues would be adversely affected when the united states dollar strengthens against the british pound and would be positively affected when the united states dollar weakens 
we are currently evaluating a foreign exchange hedging program principally designed to mitigate our foreign currency transaction gains and losses due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
we may utilize derivative financial instruments  such as forward exchange rate contracts  to reduce foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on financial results 
we will not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates and judgments on our historical experience  our current knowledge  including terms of existing contracts  and our beliefs of what could occur in the future  based on our observance of trends in the industry  information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  and could potentially create materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts and returns  capitalization of software development costs  income taxes  and accounting for contingencies 
this is not a comprehensive list of all of idx s accounting policies 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 

table of contents revenue recognition we enter into contracts to license software and sell hardware and related ancillary products to customers through our direct sales force 
the majority of our system sales attributable to software license revenue is earned from software that does not require significant customization or modification 
we recognize revenue for the licensing of software in accordance with american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop  and accordingly  we recognize revenue from software licenses  hardware  and related ancillary products when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  which is typically when a customer has signed a non cancelable sales and software license agreement  delivery  which is typically fob shipping point  is complete for the software either physically or electronically  hardware and related ancillary products  the customer s fee is deemed to be fixed or determinable and free of contingencies or significant uncertainties  and collectibility is probable 
we must exercise our judgment when we assess the probability of collection and the current creditworthiness of each customer 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  it may affect the timing and the amount of revenue we recognize on a contract to the extent of cash collected 
in addition  in certain instances judgment is required in assessing if there are uncertainties in determining the fee 
if there are significant uncertainties  the revenue is not recognized until the fee is determinable 
we use the residual method to recognize revenue when a contract includes one or more elements to be delivered at a future date and vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of the fair value of all undelivered elements typically maintenance and professional services exists 
under the residual method  we defer revenue recognition of the fair value of the undelivered elements and we allocate the remaining portion of the arrangement fee to the delivered elements and recognize it as revenue  assuming all other conditions for revenue recognition have been satisfied 
we recognize substantially all of our product revenue in this manner 
if we cannot determine the fair value of any undelivered element included in an arrangement  we will defer revenue recognition until all elements are delivered  services are performed or until fair value can be objectively determined 
as part of an arrangement  we typically sell maintenance contracts as well as professional services to customers 
maintenance services include telephone and web based support as well as rights to unspecified upgrades and enhancements  when and if we make them generally available 
professional services are deemed to be non essential and typically are for implementation planning  loading of software  installation of hardware  training  building simple interfaces  running test data  assisting in the development and documentation of process rules  and best practices consulting 
we recognize revenues from maintenance services ratably over the term of the maintenance contract period based on vsoe of fair value 
vsoe of fair value is based upon the amount charged for maintenance when purchased separately  which is typically the contract s renewal rate 
maintenance services are typically stated separately in an arrangement 
we classify the allocated fair value of revenues pertaining to contractual maintenance obligations as a current liability  since they are typically for the twelve month period subsequent to the balance sheet date 
we generally recognize revenues from professional services based on vsoe of fair value when a non cancelable agreement for the services has been signed or a customer s purchase order has been received  and the professional services have been delivered 
vsoe of fair value is based upon the price charged when professional services are sold separately and is typically based on an hourly rate for professional services 
the application of sop requires judgment  including whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements  and if so  whether vsoe of fair value exists for those elements 
typically our contracts 
table of contents contain multiple elements  and while the majority of our contracts contain standard terms and conditions  there are instances where our contracts contain non standard terms and conditions 
as a result  contract interpretation is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting  including whether the deliverables specified in a multiple element arrangement should be treated as separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes  and if so  how the price should be allocated among the deliverable elements and when to recognize revenue for each element 
while these judgments might impact the timing of revenue recognition  they would not change the total revenue recognized on the contract 
our arrangements with customers generally include acceptance provisions 
however  these acceptance provisions are typically based on our standard acceptance provision  which provides the customer with a right to a refund if the arrangement is terminated because the product did not meet our published specifications 
this right generally expires days after installation 
the product is deemed accepted unless the customer notifies the company otherwise 
generally  we determine that these acceptance provisions are not substantive and historically have not been exercised  and therefore should be accounted for as a warranty in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
in addition  for our carecast system  our specifications include a uptime guarantee and subsecond response time 
the length of the guarantee typically ranges from one to three years with an annual renewal option 
historically  we have not incurred substantive costs relating to this guarantee and we currently accrue for such costs as they are incurred 
we review these costs on a regular basis as actual experience and other information becomes available  and should they become more substantive  we would accrue an estimated exposure 
at the time we enter into an arrangement  we assess the probability of collection of the fee and the terms granted to the customer 
our typical payment terms include a deposit and subsequent payments based on specific milestone events and dates 
if we consider the payment terms for the arrangement to be extended or if the arrangement includes a substantive acceptance provision  we defer revenue not meeting the criterion for recognition under sop and classify this revenue as deferred revenue  including deferred product revenue 
our payment terms are generally less than days and payments from customers are typically due within days of invoice date 
if payment terms for an arrangement are considered extended or if the arrangement contains a substantive acceptance provision  we defer the recognition of revenue not meeting the criterion under sop  including product revenue 
we recognize this revenue  assuming all other conditions for revenue recognition have been satisfied  when the payment of the arrangement fee becomes due and or when the uncertainty regarding acceptance is resolved as generally evidenced by written acceptance or payment of the arrangement fee 
additionally  we periodically enter into certain arrangements for the sale of software that require significant customization 
in these instances  we account for the contract in accordance with accounting research bulletin arb no 
 long term construction type contracts and sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
in those situations  we generally recognize revenue on a percentage of completion basis using labor input measures  which involves the use of estimates 
labor input measures are used because they reasonably measure the stage of completion of the contract 
revisions to cost estimates are recorded to income in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
we recognize losses  if any  on fixed price contracts when the loss is determined 
we record revenue in excess of billings on long term service contracts as unbilled receivables 
we record billings in excess of revenue recognized on service contracts as deferred income until revenue recognition criteria are met 
allowance for doubtful accounts and credits idx maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts to reflect estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments 
we record an allowance for receivables based on a percentage of revenues 
additionally  individual overdue accounts are reviewed  and an additional allowance is recorded when determined necessary to state the specific receivable at realizable value 
we base our allowance on estimates after consideration of factors such as the composition of the accounts receivable aging  historical bad debt experience and our evaluation of the financial condition of the customers 
if the financial condition of customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make 
table of contents payments  additional allowances and bad debt expense may be required 
we typically do not require collateral 
historically  our estimates have been adequate to cover accounts receivable exposures 
we also record a provision for estimated credits on product and service related sales in the same period the related revenues are recorded 
these estimates are based on an analysis of historical credits issued and other known factors 
if the historical data we use to calculate these estimates does not properly reflect the future credits  then a change in the credit reserve would be made in the period in which such a determination is made and revenues in that period would be affected 
capitalization of software development costs we expense all costs incurred in the research  design and development of software for sale to others until technological feasibility is established 
technological feasibility is established when planning  designing  coding and testing activities have been completed so that the working model is consistent with the product design as confirmed by testing 
thereafter  we capitalize and amortize software development costs to software development expense on a straight line basis over the lesser of months or the estimated lives of the respective products  beginning when the products are offered for sale 
we capitalize software acquired if the related software under development has reached technological feasibility or if there are alternative future uses for the software 
we evaluate the recoverability of capitalized software based on estimated future gross revenues reduced by the estimated cost of completing the products and of performing maintenance and customer support 
if our gross revenues were to be significantly less than our estimates  the net realizable value of our capitalized software intended for sale would be impaired 
while we believe that our current estimates and the underlying assumptions regarding capitalized software development costs are appropriate  future events could necessitate adjustments to these estimates  resulting in additional software development expense in the period of adjustment 
we expense costs incurred in the development of software for internal use until we have completed the conceptual formulation  design  and testing of possible project alternatives  including the process of vendor selection for purchased software  if any 
we capitalize and amortize certain costs  principally external direct costs and payroll and payroll related costs directly associated with the internal use computer software project  incurred subsequent to the preliminary project stage  to operating expense on a straight line basis over the lesser of seven years or the estimated economic life of the software 
income taxes we account for income taxes under the liability method 
we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities  measured using the enacted tax rates that will be in effect when these differences are expected to reverse 
we have typically had net deferred tax assets at our reporting dates 
while we are not assured of realization of these assets  we have conducted an assessment of the likelihood of realization and have concluded that at december   a significant valuation allowance is no longer required 
in reaching our conclusion  we evaluated certain relevant criteria  including future taxable income  and tax planning strategies designed to generate future taxable income 
given our cumulative pre tax income from continuing operations for the three year period ended december   we believe that future earnings will be sufficient to recover substantially all of our previously unrecognized deferred tax assets 
as a result  we have reversed the valuation allowance related to substantially all of our deferred tax assets in our deferred tax assets related to capital loss carryforwards are recognized based on a tax planning strategy 
this strategy contemplates the sale of an investment in an equity method investee at a gain 
to the extent that facts and circumstances change for example  if there is a decline in the fair value of the equity method investment this tax planning strategy may no longer be sufficient to support these specific deferred tax assets and the company may be required to increase the valuation allowance 
to the extent that future taxable income against which these tax assets may be applied is not sufficient  some portion or all of our recorded deferred tax assets would not be realizable 
accounting for contingencies we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings  which  if unfavorably determined  could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
in 
table of contents connection with our assessment of these legal proceedings  we must determine if an unfavorable outcome is probable and evaluate the costs for resolution of these matters  if reasonably estimable 
we have developed these determinations and related estimates in consultation with outside counsel handling our defense in these matters  and through an analysis of potential results assuming a combination of litigation and defense strategies 
see item legal proceedings and note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
see our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained in this annual report on form k which contain accounting policies and other disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles 
new accounting standards in january  the fasb issued fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  to expand upon and strengthen existing accounting guidance that addresses when a company should include in its financial statements the assets  liabilities and activities of another entity 
prior to fin  a company generally included another entity in its consolidated financial statements only if it controlled the entity through voting interests 
fin changes that guidance by requiring a variable interest entity  as defined in fin  to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or is entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns or both 
fin also requires disclosure about variable interest entities that the company is not required to consolidate but in which it has a significant variable interest 
on october   the financial accounting standards board deferred the effective date of fin for variable interest entities created before february  to periods ending after december  a public entity need not apply the provisions of fin to an interest held in a variable interest entity vie until the end of the first interim or annual period ending after december   if both of the following apply the vie was created before february   and the public entity has not issued financial statements reporting interests in vie s in accordance with fin  other than certain required disclosures 
certain of the disclosure requirements apply in all financial statements issued after january   regardless of when the variable interest entity was established 
the adoption of fin had no impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in may  the eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
 applicability of aicpa statement of position  software revenue recognition  to non software deliverables in an arrangement containing more than incidental software 
the fasb ratified this consensus in august eitf issue no 
affirms that aicpa statement of position applies to non software deliverables  such as hardware  in an arrangement if the software is essential to the functionality of the non software deliverables 
the adoption of eitf issue no 
did not have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity sfas no 
 to establish standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
it requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument within its scope as a liability or an asset in some circumstances 
sfas no 
is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june   except for certain provisions that have been deferred 
adoption of sfas no 
had no impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in november  the emerging issues task force issued a final consensus on issue  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf  which addresses how to account for 
table of contents arrangements that may involve the delivery or performance of multiple products  services  and or rights to use assets 
eitf is effective prospectively for arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  companies may also elect to apply the provisions of eitf to existing arrangements and record the operating statement impact as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
we have adopted eitf prospectively for contracts beginning after june  the adoption of eitf did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in december  the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab no 
 which revises or rescinds portions of the interpretive guidance included in topic of the codification of staff accounting bulletins in order to make this interpretative guidance consistent with current authoritative accounting and auditing guidance and sec rules and regulations

our maintenance and service fees consist of software maintenance fees  installation fees  professional and technical service fees  training fees  consulting fees and other miscellaneous fees 

table of contents system sales compared to the increase in system sales in was primarily due to an increase in new sales and installations of certain idx systems 
software license revenues increased million and third party hardware and software sales increased million as compared to software license and subscription revenues increased million and ecommerce services revenues increased million as compared to the increase in software license revenues was primarily attributable to system sales from imagecast ris  imagecast pacs and imagecast imaging suite sales  which manages workflow and the way care is given as it relates to medical images 
imagecast pacs was developed in in a joint arrangement with stentor 
our products typically have a three to eighteen month sales cycle for new customer sales  and at the end of  we had several imagecast pacs contracts in backlog that were fulfilled in our ecommerce services business was launched in and is integrated into our business software solutions workflow to drive increased productivity services  enabling customer hipaa compliance with edi formats for eligibility  referrals  claims  remittances  and claims status 
the growth in ecommerce services was primarily from our medical and physician group practice customers as a result of hipaa regulation requirements 
third party hardware and software revenues increased to support our increased software license revenues primarily relating to our clinical software solutions  which typically require more bundled third party software than our business performance solutions

software license revenue increased million and hardware and third party software revenue increased million as compared to maintenance and service fees compared to maintenance revenues increased to million of total revenues from million of total revenues  an increase of million or  primarily attributable to the growth in our installed base of software applications 
annual maintenance price increases accounted for approximately million of the growth in our maintenance revenues

the increase in software installation revenues was consistent with our software license revenue growth 
consulting and other services increased to million of total revenues from million of total revenues  an increase of million or primarily attributable to the growth in our software licensing and installation services 
increases in our revenues from consulting and other services are typically a result of increased software license sales 
compared to the increase was due to a million increase in maintenance revenue primarily resulting from an increase in the company s installed base arising from sales to both new and existing customers  price increases  and an increase in installation and consulting services 
annual maintenance price increases accounted for approximately million of the growth in our maintenance revenues 
software installation revenues increased to million of total revenues from million of total revenues  an increase of million or  primarily attributable to installations relating to carecast version product sales  which was released in  and an increase in imagecast ris  pacs and imaging suite sales to primarily new customers and upgrades to existing customers

cost of sales the following table indicates the cost of system sales and the cost of maintenance and service fees as a percentage of their respective revenues years ended december  in thousands total revenues total cost of system and maintenance sales total cost of system and maintenance sales as a percentage of total revenues system sales system sales cost of system sales cost of system sales as a percentage of system sales maintenance and service fees maintenance and service fees cost of maintenance and services cost of maintenance and services as a percentage of maintenance and services our overall cost of sales as a percentage of sales decreased  as we have continued to achieve efficiencies in our labor and infrastructure costs 
the cost components of our revenues vary based on the types of service we provide  namely system sales and maintenance and service fees 
our cost of system sales consists primarily of external costs relating to third party hardware and software purchases  while costs relating to maintenance and service fees are employee driven and consist primarily of employee and related infrastructure costs incurred in providing maintenance and installation services  post installation support and training and consulting services 
in addition  fluctuations in our cost of system sales typically result from the revenue mix of our software license revenue  which has a lower cost percentage and higher margins  and third party hardware and software sales  which have a higher cost percentage and lower margins 
cost of system sales compared to our overall margin on third party software declined in as compared to due to the fact that the third party software component of certain of our clinical software solutions typically yields lower margins than on our business performance workflow solutions  due to the size and complexity of the contracts and the fact that the clinical market is not as mature as the business performance workflow market 
our product mix between our software license revenue and third party hardware and software sales remained relatively consistent in as compared to and therefore did not have a significant impact on our overall margin 
compared to the decrease in the cost of system sales as a percentage of system revenue was primarily due to the increase in software license revenue in the product mix 

table of contents cost of maintenance and service fees compared to the increase of million in cost of maintenance and service fees was primarily attributable to a million increase in outside services and a million increase in royalties 
fees paid for outside services increased to support the growth in our installed base  primarily for certain of our clinical software solutions  which require more configuration and specialized expertise 
the increase in royalties was a direct result of the increase in our imagecast pacs sales 
under an alliance agreement with stentor  we incur royalties on our imagecast pacs sales 
our employee and infrastructure costs related to our maintenance and service fees remained relatively level in as compared to due to operational efficiencies as reflected in our lower cost of maintenance and services as a percentage of sales 
overall headcount for our support and installation department was down by 
as the demand for services from new and existing customers for installation  consulting  maintenance  and training services increases in future periods  we anticipate that our cost of services will also increase 
furthermore  as we develop products that use more complex technologies as well as more comprehensive clinical systems  the use of specialized professional outside services may increase as well  further increasing cost of services  which may reduce our overall margin 
compared to the cost of maintenance and services increase of million or resulted primarily from increased costs related to implementation and consulting 
the decrease in the cost of maintenance and service fees as a percentage of maintenance and service revenue to in from in was due to increased maintenance revenue  which was only partially offset by growth in service and maintenance expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses compared to the increase of million in selling  general and administrative expenses was principally due to increases of million in occupancy related expenses  million in employee compensation and benefit costs  million in outside professional fees  million in travel related expenses  and million in equipment maintenance and depreciation charges 
our occupancy expense increase was primarily related to our seattle location 
in  we consolidated our seattle operations into new expanded facilities increasing our space by approximately  resulting in an increase in our occupancy costs 
selling  general and administrative headcount rose in headcount increased for sales and marketing personnel  principally relating to marketing efforts for imagecast and carecast  and related to administrative personnel 
the increase in travel related expenses were consistent with the increase in the sales and marketing headcount 
we expect our selling  general and administrative expenses to increase in future periods as we increase our sales and marketing efforts to improve our competitive positioning in the marketplace and promote brand awareness  and as we increase our administrative staff to support our sales growth 
compared to the decrease in was a result of a management focus on controlling selling  general and administrative costs as a percentage of revenue 
the decrease was primarily due to decreases in rent expenses of million  professional fees of million and bad debt expense of million  offset by an increase in insurance of approximately  
table of contents software development costs software development costs consist of costs primarily related to our software developers and the associated infrastructure costs required to fund product development initiatives 
as described in note to the notes to consolidated financial statements  software development costs incurred subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility until general release of the related products are capitalized 
technological feasibility is established upon the completion of a working model 
historically  costs incurred after establishment of technological feasibility have not been significant  however  as we develop products that use more complex technologies as well as more comprehensive clinical systems  the time and effort required to complete testing after technological feasibility has been established may become significantly more extensive 
consequently  capitalized software development costs may become more significant in future reporting periods 
approximately million  million and million of software development costs were capitalized in  and  respectively 
amortization of software development costs was approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the following table indicates software development costs as a percentage of system sales years ended december  in thousands software development costs system sales software development costs software development costs as a percentage of system sales compared to the million increase in over was due to increases in personnel costs of approximately million and associated infrastructure costs of approximately million  offset with an increase in capitalized software development costs  net of amortization  of million 
research and development headcount increased  which was consistent with the increase in our personnel related costs  and associated infrastructure costs increased primarily due to the increase in our occupancy expenses associated with our seattle lease 
we continue to focus our development efforts on enhancing functionality and developing new applications for our current product suites 
compared to the million increase in was primarily due to increased personnel costs of million combined with a net increase in capitalized software development cost amortization  net of amounts capitalized  of  in restructuring costs on september   we announced the implementation of a program to restructure and realign our group practice businesses in order to gain efficiencies and provide more focus on our premier customer base 
as a result  we implemented a workforce reduction affecting approximately four percent of our employees 
the restructuring program resulted in a charge to earnings of approximately million in the fourth quarter of  in connection with costs associated with severance arrangements of million  lease payments of million  non cash write offs of certain equipment and leasehold improvements of million  as well as other restructuring costs  primarily related to professional and consulting fees related to the restructuring 
workforce related accruals  consisting principally of employee severance costs  were established based on specific identification of employees to be terminated  along with their job classification or functions and their location 
approximately employees were terminated primarily in the flowcast operating unit and certain corporate 
table of contents services functions 
substantially all workforce related actions were completed during the fourth quarter of  with the exception of a minimal number of staff assigned to transition teams

lease abandonment charge the lease abandonment charge of million in the fourth quarter of was related to asset impairment and rent obligations through under the lease agreement associated with our former seattle office 
in  we consolidated our seattle operations into the new office space and abandoned the space subject to the lease  and we have been unable to secure a sub tenant to assume our prior lease 
the lease abandonment charge consisted of costs related to the net present value of future lease payments of approximately million and non cash write offs of certain leasehold improvements of approximately million 
during  leasehold improvements of million were written off and lease payments of approximately million were made 
of the million accrual remaining at december   approximately million will be paid in and approximately million thereafter 
in the event that we are able to secure a sub tenant to assume our prior lease in a future reporting period  the present value of the future sub lease income would be recorded as a reduction in expenses under the lease abandonment caption in the financial statements in the period in which the sub lease agreement is signed

table of contents interest income expense compared to interest income in included federal and state tax refunds received totaling  excluding the effect of interest income related to the tax refunds  interest income increased in over this increase was due to higher average invested balances due to the proceeds received from the sale of edix  offset by lower average investment interest rates in compared to the decrease in interest income in was primarily due to a lower average invested balance combined with lower interest rates in as compared to the increase in interest expense was primarily due to increased interest expense on short term borrowings 
gain on sale of investment in subsidiary in  we sold certain of the net assets and operations of our majority owned subsidiary  channelhealth  to allscripts  a public company providing point of care electronic prescribing and productivity solutions for physicians 
in addition to the sale  we entered into a ten year strategic alliance the alliance agreement whereby allscripts is the exclusive provider of point of care clinical applications sold by idx to physician practices 
pursuant to the alliance agreement  we guaranteed that allscripts gross revenues resulting from the alliance less any commissions paid to idx would amount to at least million for fiscal year due to this contingency  we deferred million of the gain as of the date of the transaction and recognized a gain of million in an additional gain of million was recognized in the first quarter of when the contingency was resolved 
gain on sale of investments other income in includes a million realized gain from a distribution of marketable equity securities related to an investment in an unrelated investment partnership 
income tax provision benefit our income tax provision represented a tax benefit of  in  a tax provision of million in  and a tax benefit of million in the effective rate was in  in and in we currently anticipate a consolidated effective tax rate of approximately for the year ending december  our effective rate of was significantly lower than our historical tax rate of due to the utilization of previously reserved net operating losses and research and experimentation credits to offset income taxes and the reversal of approximately million of deferred tax asset valuation allowances 
while the realization of our deferred tax assets cannot be assured  we have concluded that at december   a reduction in our valuation allowance was warranted 
this was based on indications that future earnings will be sufficient to recover substantially all of our previously unrecognized deferred tax assets and our expectations that we will more likely than not realize future tax benefits through tax planning strategies designed to generate future taxable income 
these strategies include estimates and involve judgment relating to unrealized gains on our investment in publicly traded common stock of an equity investee 
to the extent that future taxable income against which these tax assets may be applied is not sufficient  some or all of our recorded deferred tax assets would not be realizable 

table of contents our effective tax rate of was lower than our historical tax rate of primarily due to the utilization of previously reserved net operating losses and research and experimentation credits used to offset income taxes  offset by an increase in the valuation allowance as a result of a tax planning strategy that we believed was no longer sufficient to support certain deferred tax assets 
our effective tax rate of was lower than our historical tax rate of due to the non deductible nature of certain costs incurred as part of the restructuring charge recorded in the fourth quarter of and non deductible stock based compensation charges related to the sale of channelhealth 
equity in loss of unconsolidated affiliate we currently own  through a wholly owned subsidiary  approximately of the outstanding common stock of allscripts  and we record our investment in allscripts under the equity method of accounting 
we recorded our interest in the losses of allscripts as a reduction to our investment account in allscripts 
we recorded an equity loss in of million on a pre tax basis that reduced the balance of our investment carrying balance in allscripts to zero 
since then  we have not recorded our share of allscripts losses of approximately million through december  when allscripts begins recognizing net income in the future and once we have recouped our share of the unrecorded losses  we will record our interest in the net income 
results of discontinued operations the following is a summary of the results of discontinued operations for the years ended december  and and for the period beginning on january  through june   the date of closing of the sale of edix in thousands for the period january  through june  years ended december  revenues income loss from discontinued operations  net of income tax provision in  income tax benefit in  and  income tax provision in gain on disposal of discontinued operations  including a  income tax benefit income loss from discontinued operations  net of tax edix s medical transcription service fee revenue totaled million in  a decline of compared with revenue of million in due primarily to the sale of edix on june  revenue from discontinued operations increased in compared with revenue of million  due primarily to an increase in transcription service volume 
income from discontinued operations in was million as compared to a loss of  in and income of million in the income in was attributable to the million gain  including a tax benefit of million  on the disposal of the edix business and an operational loss of  net of tax 
the operational loss in declined from the operational loss in general due to tighter controls over discretionary spending 
the operational net loss was attributable to an increase in cost of services from 
table of contents of sales as compared to of sales in due primarily to higher labor and related costs 
also included in the operational net loss as compared to was a million increase  net of tax  in selling  general and administrative labor costs  a  increase  net of tax  in accounts receivable write offs  a  increase  net of tax  in outside professional fees and general costs to support sales growth  and a million increase in software development costs  net of tax  in an effort to improve and enhance the coding and transcription process 
the tax provision of  on the pre tax loss from discontinued operations of  was due primarily due to certain state tax payments 
the gain on the disposal of edix resulted in an income tax benefit of million due to the fact that our tax basis in the stock of edix exceeded the net proceeds from the sale  resulting in a capital loss on the sale for tax purposes 
a tax benefit arises from this deductible temporary difference  which more likely than not will reverse in the foreseeable future and be realized 
the effective tax rate for discontinued operations was for as compared to for the effective tax rate was lower than the historical tax rate of primarily due to the utilization of previously reserved net operating losses used to offset income taxes 
liquidity and capital resources we principally have funded our operations  working capital needs and capital expenditures from operations and short term borrowings under revolving secured bank lines of credit 
at december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and million in short term investments  consisting principally of investments in interest bearing demand deposit accounts  money market funds  and highly liquid debt securities of corporations and municipalities 
our working capital was million at december  net cash provided by or used in continuing operations is principally comprised of net income or loss and is primarily affected by the net change in accounts and unbilled receivables  accounts payable  accrued expenses and non cash items relating to depreciation and amortization  deferred taxes  the sale of channelhealth  and certain components of lease abandonment and restructuring charges 
due to the nature of our business  accounts and unbilled receivables  prepaid cost of sales  deferred revenue  and accounts payable can fluctuate considerably due to  among other things  the length of installation efforts  which is dependent upon the size of the transaction  the changing business plans of the customer  the effectiveness of customers management and general economic conditions 
deferred tax assets increased million in as a result of the reversal of a significant portion of our deferred tax valuation allowance 
accounts receivable  including unbilled receivables  increased million in as compared to and million in as compared to the increase was primarily due to the timing of revenue in the fourth quarter of as compared to accounts receivable  including unbilled receivables  as a percentage of revenues declined to in from in due to management s effort to reduce the average time to collect payment on sales 
this is evidenced by a reduction in our days sales outstanding dso 
in  accounts receivable from customers  including unbilled receivables  have been collected on average within days  which represents a decrease of days as compared to the year ended december  and days as compared to the year ended december  the sale of edix is not expected to have an adverse impact on our future cash flows from operating activities 
since the acquisition of edix in up until the disposition of edix in june  the company had contributed cash to support the ongoing operations of edix 
cash flows related to investing activities have historically been related to the purchase of computer and office equipment  leasehold improvements and the purchase and sale of investment grade marketable securities 
we invested approximately million during and million during on the acquisition and implementation of an enterprise resource planning system and plan to invest approximately million during related to this system implementation 
in april  we entered into a new operating lease for office space in seattle  washington  which commenced in  for a period of years 
we invested approximately million for improvements related to the seattle lease in and approximately million in in 
table of contents cash flows from investing activities also included the inflow of million from the sale of edix  net of transactions costs and net of million of cash transferred as part of edix s net assets 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
in addition  investing activities may also include purchases of  interests in  loans to and acquisitions of businesses for access to complementary products and technologies 
we expect these activities to continue 
in april  we acquired a minority interest in stentor  one of our strategic partners  by exercising a warrant to purchase  shares of preferred stock of stentor  for million 
each preferred share is convertible  at any time at the option of the holder  into one share of common stock of stentor  inc  subject to certain adjustments 
in addition  the preferred shares are not entitled to dividends but are entitled to a liquidation preference equal to the amount we paid to purchase such shares 
stentor is a privately held company and therefore it is difficult to determine a fair market value for these shares 
management will periodically review this investment for indications of impairment 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully complete any such purchases or acquisitions in the future 
cash flows from financing activities historically relate to the issuance of common stock through the exercise of employee stock options and in connection with the employee stock purchase plan and proceeds from line of credit 
we entered into a new revolving line of credit agreement during the second quarter of allowing us to borrow up to million based on certain restrictions 
this line of credit is secured by deposit accounts  accounts and unbilled receivables and other assets and bears interest at the bank s base rate plus  which was approximately as of december  this line of credit is subject to certain terms and conditions and will expire on june  at december   no amounts were outstanding under this arrangement 
in addition to existing financing arrangements  we own  through a wholly owned subsidiary  approximately million shares of stock of allscripts  a public company listed on the nasdaq national market under the symbol mdrx 
this investment had a quoted market value of approximately million as of december   and is subject to certain sale restrictions that may significantly impact the market value 
we expect that our requirements for office facilities and other office equipment will grow as staffing requirements dictate 
our operating lease commitments consist primarily of office leases for our operating facilities 
we plan to increase our professional staff during as needed to meet anticipated sales volume and to support research and development efforts for certain products 
to the extent necessary to support increases in staffing  we may obtain additional office space 
uk operations we currently expect our uk operations to generate negative net cash flows in due to the structure of the subcontract agreements and due to initial start up costs incurred 
we currently anticipate positive net cash flows in the fourth quarter of positive cash flows from our uk operations may be delayed depending on the start up costs we incur and the final terms of our subcontract agreements 
we intend to fund the first year negative cash flows from cash provided from our domestic operations  which we anticipate will be more than adequate 
this includes the planned increase in staff during to support the business generated from our uk operations 
we currently anticipate adding approximately to positions 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash in the future periods in thousands total non cancelable operating leases total 
table of contents of the million in non cancelable operating lease obligations  approximately million is accrued at december  as a lease abandonment charge and as a restructuring cost 
see notes and of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
on february   we entered into a commitment to sublease office facilities in the united kingdom commencing on april  the lease term is for ten years and provides for annual base rent of   using the exchange rate of on march   plus our share of taxes and maintenance costs 
the lease includes a provision for annual increases for maintenance  subject to a cap  in accordance with the uk retail price index 
in addition  in year five there is a provision for an increase in the annual base rent to market 
we believe that the level of our cash and investment balances  anticipated cash flow from operations and our million revolving line of credit will be sufficient to satisfy our cash requirements for the next eighteen months 
to date  inflation has not had a material impact on our revenues or income 
off balance sheet arrangements during the year ended december   we did not engage in material off balance sheet activities  including the use of structured finance or special purpose entities  trading activities in non exchange traded contracts  or transactions with persons or entities that benefit from their non independent relationship with idx  other than as described below

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not currently use derivative financial instruments 
we generally place our marketable securities in high credit quality instruments primarily us government and federal agency obligations  tax exempt municipal obligations and corporate obligations with contractual maturities of a year or less 
we do not expect any material loss from our marketable security investments 
internationally  we currently operate in canada and the united kingdom 
our international business is subject to risks  including  but not limited to unique economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions  and foreign exchange rate volatility 
accordingly  our future results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in these or other factors 
we invoice canadian customers in united states currency 
united kingdom sales are denominated in the great britain pound 
through december   we were exposed to minimal foreign exchange rate fluctuations and foreign currency fluctuations have not had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
we did not enter into any foreign currency hedge transactions 
we currently expect that revenues generated in the united kingdom will approximate to of our total revenues in in addition  a portion of our uk operations expenses will be denominated in the local foreign currency 
our exposures to foreign exchange rate fluctuations will arise from these transactions and from intercompany transactions in which certain costs incurred in the united states will be charged to our uk subsidiary 
intercompany transactions will typically be denominated in the functional currency of our uk subsidiary in order to centralize foreign exchange risk in the parent company in the united states 
we will also be exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of our uk subsidiary are translated into us dollars during consolidation 
as such our operating results will be affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
we are currently evaluating a foreign currency exchange rate hedging program principally designed to mitigate foreign currency transaction gains and losses due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
we may utilize derivative financial instruments  such as forward exchange rate contracts  to reduce foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on financial results 
we will not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that may experience a decline in market value due to changes in interest rates 
a hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates  however  would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 

table of contents interest rates on short term borrowings with floating rates carry a degree of interest rate risk 
our future interest expense may increase if interest rates fluctuate 
a hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates  however  would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
interest expense was immaterial in  and interest income on our investments is included in other income 
we account for cash equivalents and marketable securities in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
cash equivalents are short term highly liquid investments with original maturity dates of three months or less 
cash equivalents are carried at cost  which approximates fair market value 
our marketable securities are classified as available for sale and are recorded at fair value with any unrealized gain or loss recorded as an element of stockholders equity
