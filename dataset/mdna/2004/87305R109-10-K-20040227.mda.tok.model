ebitda is presented because we believe it is an indicator of our ability to incur and service debt and is used by our lenders in determining compliance with financial covenants 
however  ebitda should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity or as an alternative to net income as a measure of operating results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
our definition of ebitda may differ from definitions used by other companies

we serve high end commercial markets including networking communications infrastructure  high end computing and industrial medical which are characterized by high levels of complexity  short product life cycles and moderate production volumes 
our customers include oems and ems companies 
our time to market and high technology focused manufacturing services enable our customers to reduce the time required to develop new products and bring them to market 
the market for our products experienced a sustained downturn during and due to the economic slowdown in the electronics industry 
during this period  we reduced our work force and focused on cost reduction by improving the efficiency of our operations and negotiating lower prices on key supplies from our vendors 
throughout this period we added new customers and generated positive cash flow from operations 
we remained poised for future growth by acquiring advanced circuits in december and by continuing to invest in capital equipment 
during  we generated increased sales through our advanced circuits acquisition  market share gains and due to the improving economic conditions in our customers end markets 
our gross profit margin also increased from to due to our improved operating leverage as costs that are largely fixed in nature  such as labor  were absorbed over greater production volume 
if market conditions continue to improve in  we expect further growth in revenue and further increases in our gross margin 
we manufacture printed circuit boards at three specialized and integrated facilities in the united states 
our facility in santa ana  california  specializes in quick turn work  which has delivery times of ten days or less and is characterized by small volumes of printed circuit boards 
our chippewa falls  wisconsin  facility focuses on large volume production runs of technologically complex multilayer printed circuit boards with average lead times of two to ten weeks 
our redmond  washington  facility focuses on mid volume production of standard lead time printed circuit boards 
in response to increased customer demand and higher current capacity utilization rates  our board of directors has approved a plan to significantly expand production capacity at our chippewa falls  wisconsin facility 
chippewa falls is our largest facility and serves the high end  complex technology needs of some of our largest and most sophisticated commercial customers 
the expansion is planned to occur in two phases that will permit us to incrementally match our capital expenditures with demand and market conditions 
together  the two phases of the plan represent an increase in production capacity 
all capacity increases described in phases one and two below represent cumulative increases from current capacity levels 
in the first phase of our expansion plan  we expect to hire approximately additional employees by mid that will increase our chippewa falls production capacity by more than from current levels using our existing facility footprint 
in addition  we expect to immediately commence construction on a  square foot expansion and have approved the order of capital equipment necessary to support it 
we expect that construction of the first phase of the expansion  along with additional employee hires beyond those expected by mid  will increase our chippewa falls capacity by approximately from current levels 
the construction and equipment costs related to phase one are expected to be approximately million 
we expect to complete construction of this first phase and reach production by the end of the second phase of our expansion plan will allow us to increase production capacity at the chippewa falls facility by an additional  or a total of  over current capacity 
we expect to accomplish this second phase through additional staffing and the purchase of approximately million in capital equipment 
the implementation of the second phase will be made as demand and market conditions warrant and can be completed within three to six months of determining to proceed 
the decision to proceed with the second phase will be revisited on a regular basis throughout and in future periods 
we believe that our ability to expand at our existing facilities allows us to efficiently grow without having to qualify customers for  and develop a management infrastructure at  a new facility 
we reviewed numerous alternatives to meet our customers needs and believe that this expansion plan provides us with a significant opportunity for growth with relatively limited risk 
however  if our customers demand for our services does not increase to the levels we are anticipating  we may decide to scale back or delay our planned expansion 
we measure customers as those companies that have placed at least two orders in the preceding month period 
as of december   we had approximately customers 
sales to our largest customers accounted for of our net sales in and of our net sales in we sell to oems both directly and indirectly through ems companies 
sales attributable to our five largest oem customers accounted for approximately of our net sales in the following table shows the percentage of our net sales attributable to each of the principal end markets we served for the periods indicated year ended december  end markets networking communication high end computing industrial medical computer peripherals handheld cellular other total sales to ems companies are classified by the end markets of their oem customers 
we measure the time sensitivity of our products by tracking the quick turn percentage of our work 
we define quick turn orders as those with delivery times of days or less  which typically captures research and development  prototype and new product introduction work in addition to unexpected short term demand among our customers 
generally  we quote prices after we receive the design specifications and time and volume requirements from our customers 
our quick turn services command a premium price as compared to standard lead time prices 
quick turn orders represented of revenues in and of revenues in the quick turn percentage decreased due to the acquisition of advanced circuits  which produces mainly standard lead time products 
we also deliver a large percentage of compressed lead time work with lead times of to days 
we receive a premium price for this work as well 
purchase orders may be cancelled prior to shipment 
we charge customers a fee  based on percentage completed  if an order is cancelled once it has entered production 
we recognize revenues when persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists  the sales terms are fixed and determinable  title and risk of loss has transferred  and collectibility is reasonably assured generally when products are shipped to the customer 
net sales consist of gross sales less an allowance for returns  which typically has been less than of gross sales 
we provide our customers a limited right of return for defective printed circuit boards 
we record an allowance for estimated sales returns at the time of sale based on our historical results 
to the extent actual returns vary from our historical experience  revisions to the allowances may be required 
cost of goods sold consists of materials  labor  outside services and overhead expenses incurred in the manufacture and testing of our products 
many factors affect our gross margin  including capacity utilization  product mix  production volume and yield 
as of the end of  we were operating at approximately of our production capacity 
we plan to increase our production capacity in stages during and by adding new equipment and expanding our facilities 
we do not participate in any significant long term supply contracts  and we believe there are a number of potential suppliers for the raw materials we use 
we believe that our cost of goods sold will continue to fluctuate as a percentage of net sales 
selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and commissions paid to our internal sales force and commissions paid to independent sales representatives  salaries paid to our sales support staff as well as costs associated with marketing materials and trade shows 
as general economic conditions continue to improve  we expect to receive more quick turn orders due to increased prototype work and new product introduction among our customers 
as these quick turn sales become a higher percentage of total sales  our average commission rate is expected to increase 
we generally pay higher commissions to our independent sales representatives for quick turn work  which generally has a higher gross profit component than standard lead time work 
we expect our selling and marketing expenses to continue to fluctuate as a percentage of net sales 
general and administrative costs primarily include the salaries for executive  finance  accounting  information technologies  facilities and human resources personnel  as well as insurance expenses  expenses for accounting and legal assistance  incentive compensation expense and bad debt expense 
we expect these expenses to continue to fluctuate as a percentage of net sales as we add personnel and incur additional costs related to the growth of our business and the requirements of operating as a public company 
amortization of intangibles consists of intangible assets  which we recorded as a result of the power circuits acquisition in july effective january   we no longer record amortization on goodwill 
however  we continue to amortize our definite lived intangible assets  which are primarily comprised of strategic customer relationships 
goodwill amortization was million in see transition disclosures in note to our consolidated financial statements 
our restructuring charges in relate primarily to the costs of closing our burlington  washington plant 
the charges included primarily the costs of laying off employees and non cash impairment charges related to the burlington building  property and equipment 
restructuring charges in relate primarily to severance costs to consolidate overhead operations following the acquisition of advanced circuits in december as well as a further write down of assets held for sale 
our interest expense relates to our senior credit facility and our other long term obligations 
amortization of debt issuance costs consists of the amortization of loan origination fees and related expenses 
interest and other income consist primarily of interest received on our cash balances 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements included in this k have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
senior management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
accounting policies where significant judgments and estimates are made include asset valuation related to bad debts and inventory obsolescence  sales returns and allowances  impairment of long lived assets  including goodwill and intangible assets  self insured medical reserves  and realizability of deferred income tax assets 
a detailed description of these estimates and our policies to account for them is included in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in this report 
we provide customary credit terms to our customers and generally do not require collateral 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of the financial condition of our customers and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon historical collections experience and expected collectibility of accounts 
our actual bad debts may differ from our estimates 
in assessing the realization of inventories  we are required to make judgments as to future demand requirements and compare these with current and committed inventory levels 
our inventory requirements change based on our projected customer demand  which changes due to market conditions  technological and product life cycle changes and longer or shorter than expected usage periods 
we maintain certain finished goods inventories near certain key customer locations in accordance with agreements 
although this inventory is typically supported by valid purchase orders  should these customers ultimately not purchase these inventories  our results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected 
we derive revenues primarily from the sale of printed circuit boards using customer supplied engineering and design plans and recognize revenues when persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists  the sales terms are fixed and determinable  title and risk of loss has transferred  and collectibilty is reasonably assured generally when products are shipped to the customer 
we provide our customers a limited right of return for defective printed circuit boards 
we accrue an estimated amount for sales returns and allowances at the time of sale based on historical information 
to the extent actual returns vary from our historical experience  revisions to the allowances may be required 
we have significant long lived tangible and intangible assets consisting of property  plant and equipment  goodwill and definite lived intangibles 
we review these assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
in addition  we perform an impairment test related to goodwill at least annually 
our goodwill and intangibles are largely attributable to our quick turn business 
during the fourth fiscal quarter of  we performed an impairment assessment of our goodwill  which requires the use of a fair value based analysis and determined that no impairment existed 
at december   we determined that there were no events or changes in circumstances which indicated that the carrying amount of long lived tangible assets and definite lived intangible assets may not be recoverable 
we use an estimate of the future undiscounted net cash flows in measuring whether our long lived tangible assets and definite lived intangible assets are recoverable 
if forecasts and assumptions used to support the realizability of our long lived assets change in the future  significant impairment charges could result that would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
deferred income tax assets are reviewed for recoverability and valuation allowances are provided  when necessary  to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 
at december   we have a net deferred income tax asset of million  which is net of a valuation allowance of approximately million 
should our expectations of taxable income change in future periods  it may be necessary to adjust our valuation allowance  which could positively or negatively affect our results of operations in the period such a determination is made 
in addition  we record income tax provision or benefit during interim periods at a rate that is based on expected results for the full year 
if future changes in market conditions cause actual results for the year to be more or less favorable than those expected  adjustments to the effective income tax rate could be required 
we are self insured for group health insurance benefits provided to our employees  and purchase insurance to protect against claims at the individual and aggregate level 
the insurance carrier adjudicates and processes employee claims and is paid a fee for these services 
we reimburse our insurance carrier for paid claims subject to variable monthly limitations 
we estimate our exposure for claims incurred but not paid at the end of each reporting period and use historical information supplied by our insurance carrier and broker to estimate our liability for these claims 
this liability is subject to a total limitation that varies based on employee enrollment and factors that are established at each annual contract renewal 
our actual claims experience may differ from our estimates 
results of operations the following table sets forth statement of operations data expressed as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated year ended december  net sales cost of goods sold gross profit operating expenses selling and marketing general and administrative amortization of intangibles restructuring charges total operating expenses operating income loss other income expense interest expense amortization of debt issuance costs interest income and other  net income loss before income taxes and extraordinary item income tax provision benefit income loss before extraordinary item extraordinary gain net income year ended december  compared to year ended december  the full year includes the results of operations of advanced circuits  which was acquired in a stock purchase on december  advanced circuits results of operations are included for six days in net sales in  our net sales mix shifted significantly towards the high end computing end market and  to a lesser extent  towards the networking communications infrastructure end market due to our acquisition of advanced circuits 
advanced circuits accounted for over one half of our total net sales for  and a majority of its revenues are from the high end computing and networking communications infrastructure end markets 
these end markets typically consist of products with high average layer counts 
our average layer count increased from in to in due to the acquisition of advanced circuits 
we generally charge higher prices for printed circuit boards with higher layer counts  other high technology features and for shorter lead times 
net sales increased from million in to million in due to the acquisition of advanced circuits  partially offset by a small decline in the combined net sales of our remaining facilities 
this decline resulted from the net sales loss associated with the closure of our burlington facility in december on a company wide basis  improving market conditions led to sequential quarterly increases in revenue throughout our net sales grew largely due to increasing production but also due to strengthening prices and a shift to more complex printed circuit boards 
gross profit cost of goods sold increased million  or  from million in to million in higher cost of goods sold resulted from higher labor  materials and variable overhead costs associated with an increase in the number of printed circuit boards sold 
the volume of boards sold increased due to the acquisition of advanced circuits partially offset by lower aggregate volumes sold at our remaining facilities 
in addition  a reduction in fixed costs due to the closure of our burlington facility favorably impacted our cost structure 
as a percentage of net sales  cost of goods sold decreased from for to for primarily due to improved absorption of manufacturing overhead and greater labor efficiency 
in addition  we benefited from lower unit pricing for our direct materials  partially offset by higher direct materials costs associated with a sales mix shift towards higher layer count boards and certain expenses associated with our up front investments in in equipment  additional employees and expanded capacity at our redmond facility 
in connection with our acquisition of advanced circuits  no value was assigned to the acquired property and equipment and accordingly  we record no depreciation expense for these acquired assets 
we expect our depreciation expense to increase in the future as a result of our planned chippewa falls facility expansion 
expenditures for information technology salaries and expenses for have been reclassified to general and administrative expenses to conform to the presentation for this reclassification more appropriately reflects the overall corporate nature of our information technology expenses 
as a percentage of net sales  the reclassification reduced cost of goods sold and increased gross profit by in as a result of the foregoing  gross profit increased million  or  from million in to million in our gross margin improved to in from in operating expenses sales and marketing expenses increased million from million  or of net sales  in to million  or of net sales  in the decrease as a percentage of net sales resulted from improved absorption of fixed selling costs and a lower commission rate associated with a mix shift to more standard lead time products due primarily to our acquisition of advanced circuits 
general and administrative expenses increased million from million  or of net sales  in to million  or of net sales  in the increase in expenses as a percentage of net sales resulted primarily from higher personnel costs principally attributable to our acquisition of advanced circuits  higher corporate governance expenses  principally higher directors and officers liability insurance premiums and accounting and legal fees  increased incentive compensation expense  transition costs to integrate advanced circuits  an increase in the bad debt provision  and higher information technology costs 
information technology salaries and expenses for have been reclassified from cost of goods sold to general and administrative expenses to conform to the presentation for amortization of intangibles was for intangible assets with finite lives from the power circuits acquisition  which occurred in july amortization of intangibles was million in both and restructuring charges in were million for severance and other exit costs primarily related to eliminating positions at our redmond  washington  facility as well as a further writedown of assets held for sale 
restructuring charges were incurred in related to our burlington  washington  facility 
we closed the facility and recorded million of restructuring charges 
these charges consisted primarily of severance costs and a further write down of the facility s building and equipment 
income taxes the provision for income taxes increased by million from a benefit of million in to a provision of million in the income tax benefit in resulted from a pretax loss before extraordinary item  and the income tax provision in resulted from pretax income before extraordinary item 
our effective income tax rate in was  and it was in our effective income tax rate is primarily impacted by state income taxes  which vary due to the sales and profitability mix among our facilities as well as certain non deductible items 
extraordinary gain in  we recorded an extraordinary gain of million after resolving contingencies concerning the fair value of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed as part of our acquisition of advanced circuits  including the settlement of a claim for a working capital adjustment 
in  we recorded an extraordinary gain of million as part of our acquisition of advanced circuits 
the fair value of the net assets acquired exceeded the cost to purchase advanced circuits  resulting in negative goodwill 
in accordance with sfas no 
 the amount of negative goodwill was allocated proportionately to reduce the assigned values of acquired assets except current assets and deferred income taxes 
the remaining unallocated negative goodwill was recorded as an extraordinary gain 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for a description of the extraordinary gains 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales net sales decreased million  or  from million in to million in this decrease resulted from a decline in the volume of printed circuit boards sold and from lower pricing levels 
net sales declined due to a significant downturn that began in in the electronics industry and in the end markets served by our customers 
approximately million of revenue resulted from our acquisition of advanced circuits in late december cost of goods sold cost of goods sold decreased million  or  from million in to million in the decrease in cost of goods sold resulted from lower labor  materials and variable overhead costs that were associated with a decline in the number of printed circuit boards sold 
as a percentage of net sales  cost of goods sold increased from in to in higher medical expense  higher depreciation expense and an increase in unabsorbed manufacturing overhead due to excess capacity partially offset by a reclassification of information technology expenses in resulted in a higher cost of goods sold percentage 
expenditures for information technology salaries and expenses for have been reclassified to general and administrative expenses to conform to the presentation for this reclassification more appropriately reflects the overall corporate nature of our information technology expenses 
as a percentage of net sales  the reclassification reduced cost of goods sold and increased gross profit by in gross profit gross profit decreased million  or  from million in to million in this decrease in gross profit resulted primarily from a lower volume of printed circuit boards sold and to a lesser extent from lower pricing levels 
our gross margin was in compared to in gross margin decreased due to increased medical expense  increased depreciation expense and lower absorption of fixed manufacturing expenses partially offset by a reclassification of information technology expenses in operating expenses sales and marketing expenses decreased million from million in to million in the decrease resulted from lower commissions to sales representatives due to lower net sales in as a percentage of net sales  selling expenses increased from in to in the increase as a percentage of net sales was due to lower absorption of fixed sales and marketing expenses and higher average per unit commissions related to a higher proportion of quick turn sales in general and administrative expenses increased million from million in to million in this increase resulted from the reclassification of information technology expenses from cost of goods sold to general and administrative expense in as well as higher costs for directors and officers insurance and a higher bad debt provision 
as a percentage of sales  general and administrative expenses increased to of sales in from of sales in amortization of intangibles consists of amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets from the power circuits acquisition  which occurred in july amortization of intangibles decreased million from million in to million in this decrease resulted from our adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  effective january  under the new rules  goodwill is not amortized  rather it is subject to impairment testing 
the amortization expense recorded in was for definite lived intangible assets 
we consolidated manufacturing capabilities by closing our burlington  washington  facility in december as a result of this consolidation  we recorded restructuring charges of million in of which million was a non cash impairment charge to write down building  property and equipment held for sale to its estimated net realizable value and approximately million was related to severance and other exit costs 
we laid off approximately employees in connection with the restructuring 
interest expense interest expense decreased million from million in to million in this decrease resulted from a lower interest rate on our term loan as well as a lower balance due to repayment of principal 
the expiration of an interest rate swap agreement on december   also contributed to the decline in interest expense through a reduction in our effective interest rate 
amortization of debt issuance costs amortization of debt issuance costs increased  from  in to  in in december  we prepaid approximately million of our borrowings under our senior credit facility in connection with the closing of our acquisition of advanced circuits 
as a result of our prepayment of indebtedness  we wrote off additional debt issuance costs 
interest income and other  net interest income and other  net  increased million from income of million in to income of million in this increase resulted from higher cash balances  partially offset by lower interest rates earned 
income taxes the provision for income taxes decreased from a provision of million in to a benefit of million in this income tax benefit resulted from a pretax net loss 
our effective income tax rate in was  and it was in our effective income tax rate is primarily impacted by certain non deductible items 
extraordinary gain in  we recorded an extraordinary gain of million as part of our acquisition of advanced circuits 
the fair value of the net assets acquired exceeded the cost to purchase advanced circuits  resulting in negative goodwill 
in accordance with sfas no 
 the amount of negative goodwill was allocated proportionately to reduce the assigned values of acquired assets except current assets and deferred income taxes 
the remaining unallocated negative goodwill was recorded as an extraordinary gain 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for the description of the extraordinary gain 
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity have been cash provided by operations  proceeds from our public offerings and proceeds from employee exercises of stock options 
our principal uses of cash have been to meet debt service requirements  finance capital expenditures  fund working capital and finance mergers and acquisitions 
we anticipate that these uses will continue to be the principal demands on our cash in the future 
as of december   we had net working capital of approximately million  compared to million as of december  the increase in working capital is primarily attributable to increases in cash  short term investments and accounts receivable 
our capital plan is expected to total approximately million and reflects capacity expansion at all three of our facilities 
the capital plan includes million for the first phase of our planned chippewa falls facility expansion 
the balance will be allocated to general maintenance and growth capital expenditures across all three facilities 
the second phase of our chippewa falls capacity expansion  not currently included in the capital plan  would cost approximately million and would be made as demand and market conditions warrant 
this second phase could be completed within three to six months of determining to proceed and will be revisited on a regular basis throughout and in future periods 
the following table provides information on future payments under the company s credit facility  future minimum lease payments under non cancelable operating leases and other long term liabilities reflected on our balance sheet under generally accepted accounting principles as of december  in thousands contractual obligations total less than year years years after years long term debt operating leases other long term liabilities total contractual cash obligations our balance sheet reflects these other long term liabilities at their net present value 
based on our current level of operations  we believe that cash generated from operations  available cash and amounts available under our senior credit facility will be adequate to meet the debt service requirements  capital expenditures and working capital needs of our current operations for the next months 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in  compared to million in our operating cash flow of million primarily reflects net income of million  million of depreciation  amortization and imputed interest expense  and a million decrease in deferred income taxes  partially offset by a net increase in working capital of million  excluding cash and short term investments 
net cash used in investing activities was million in  compared to million in in  we purchased million of property  plant and equipment and million in net short term investments 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in  compared to million used in financing activities in our financing net cash flow reflects net proceeds of million from a secondary stock offering and employee stock option exercises  partially offset by million in principal repayments on our long term debt 
we amended our senior credit agreement as of april  we have a term loan with a remaining balance of million that is payable in equal quarterly installments through september  we have a committed revolving loan facility of million with a final maturity date of september  we may prepay the term loan and borrow  repay and reborrow under the revolving loan facility at any time 
the term loan and the revolving loan bear interest at rates ranging from libor plus to or the alternate base rate as defined in the credit agreement plus to 
the amount added to the libor rate or the alternate base rate varies depending upon the company s leverage ratio as defined in the agreement 
as of december   the term loan had a weighted average interest rate of 
since the amendment effective date of april   our borrowings under the revolving facility are subject to a borrowing base or formula that is based on our accounts receivable and inventory 
as of december   we had no outstanding revolving loan balances 
we pay quarterly a commitment fee ranging from to on the unused revolving commitment amount 
the credit facility is secured by substantially all of our assets and contains financial covenants customary for this type of financing 
as of december   we were in compliance with the covenants and had million of available borrowing capacity under our revolving loan facility 
foreign currency exchange risk all of our sales are denominated in us dollars  and as a result we have relatively little exposure to foreign currency exchange risk with respect to sales made 
impact of inflation we believe that our results of operations are not dependent upon moderate changes in the inflation rate as we expect that we will be able to pass along component price increases to our customers 
seasonality we have historically experienced lower sales in our second and third fiscal quarters due to patterns in the capital budgeting and purchasing cycles of our customers and the end markets they serve 
in particular  this effect is caused by the seasonality of our high end computing segment and customer quick turn ordering patterns 
we expect to mitigate the impact of seasonality through diversification of our customer base 
recently issued accounting standards in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
in general  sfas no 
is effective for contracts entered into or modified after june  and for hedging relationships designated after june  the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
the new statement establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both debt and equity 
the provisions of sfas no 
apply to the classification and disclosure requirements for the following three types of financial instruments mandatorily redeemable instruments  instruments with repurchase obligations  and instruments with obligations to issue a variable number of securities 
we adopted sfas no 
in the third quarter and it did not have an impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in november  the fasb emerging issues task force issued its consensus concerning revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
eitf addresses how to determine whether a revenue arrangement involving multiple deliverables should be divided into separate units of accounting  and  if separation is appropriate  how the arrangement consideration should be measured and allocated to the identified accounting units 
the guidance in eitf is effective for revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  the adoption of eitf did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued financial interpretation no 
fin no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
 which addresses the consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities as defined therein and applies immediately to variable interests in variable interest entities created or obtained after january  with respect to variable interest entities created before january   in december the fasb issued fin no 
r which  among other things  revised the implementation date to first fiscal years or interim periods ending march   with the exception of special purpose entities spes 
the consolidation requirements apply to all spes in the first fiscal year or interim period ending after december  we have determined that we do not have any variable interest entities or spes and accordingly  the adoption of fin no 
did not impact us and the adoption of fin no 
r in the first quarter of will not impact us 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
our senior credit facility bears interest at floating rates 
the revolving loan bears interest ranging from to per annum plus the applicable libor or from to per annum plus the alternate base rate  as defined in the agreement governing the amended and restated credit facility 
as of december   the term loan had a weighted average interest rate of 
therefore  a change in interest rates is not expected to materially affect the interest expense to be incurred on this facility during such period
