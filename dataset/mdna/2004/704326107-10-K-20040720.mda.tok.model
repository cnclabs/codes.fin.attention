for further analysis of the company s results of operations for fiscal years   and  and financial position at may   refer to the discussion of critical accounting policies and the charts and analysis in the results of operations and liquidity and capital resources sections of this review 
critical accounting policies note a to the consolidated financial statements  included in item of this form k  discusses the significant accounting policies of paychex  inc the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting policies 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company s management to make estimates  judgments  and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements  including  but not limited to  those related to revenue recognition  peo workers compensation insurance  investments  goodwill and intangible assets  fixed assets  potential losses resulting from its clients inability to meet their payroll obligations  contingencies  allowance for doubtful accounts  and income taxes 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience  future expectations  and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances 
actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates 
certain accounting policies that are deemed critical to the company s results of operations or financial position are discussed below 
revenue recognition service revenues are recognized in the period services are rendered and earned under service arrangements with clients where service fees are fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
certain processing services are provided under annual service arrangements with revenue recognized ratably over the annual service period 
the company s service revenues are largely attributable to payroll related processing services where the fee is based on a fixed amount per processing period or a fixed amount per processing period plus a fee per employee or transaction processed

interest on funds held for clients is earned primarily on funds that are collected from clients before due dates  for payroll tax filing and payment services and employee payment services  and invested funds held for clients until remittance to the applicable tax agencies or client employees 
these collections from clients are typically remitted between one and thirty days after receipt  with some items extending to ninety days 
the interest earned on these funds is included in total revenues on the consolidated statements of income because the collection  holding  and remittance of these funds are critical components of providing these services 
interest on funds held for clients also includes net realized gains and losses from the sale of available for sale securities 
peo workers compensation insurance in fiscal  workers compensation insurance for peo worksite employees was provided under a pre funded  deductible workers compensation policy with a national insurance company

valuation of investments the company s investments in debt securities are reported at fair value 
unrealized gains related to increases in the fair value of investments and unrealized losses related to decreases in the fair value are included in comprehensive income as reported on the company s consolidated statements of stockholders equity

realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification of the security s cost basis 
on the consolidated statements of income  realized gains and losses from funds held for clients are included in interest on funds held for clients  whereas realized gains and losses from corporate investments are included in investment income  net 
the company is exposed to credit risk in connection with these investments through the possible inability of the borrowers to meet the terms of the bonds 
the company attempts to mitigate this risk by investing primarily in high credit quality securities 
the company periodically reviews its investment portfolio to determine if any investment is other than temporarily impaired due to changes in credit risk or other potential valuation concerns  which would require the company to record an impairment charge in the period any such determination is made 
in making this judgment  the company evaluates  among other things  the duration and extent to which the fair value of an investment is less than its cost  the credit rating and any changes in credit rating for the investment  and its ability and intent to hold the investment until the earlier of market price recovery or maturity 
the company s assessment that an investment is not other than temporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in the company s strategies or assumptions related to any particular investment 
goodwill and intangible assets for business combinations  paychex assigns estimated fair values to all assets and liabilities acquired  including intangible assets such as customer lists  certain license agreements  trade names  and non compete agreements 
the assignment of fair values to acquired assets and liabilities and the determination of useful lives for depreciable and amortizable assets requires significant estimates  judgments  and assumptions 
for certain fixed assets  including software  and intangible assets  the company utilizes the assistance of independent valuation consultants 
the remaining purchase price of the acquired business not assigned to identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill 
the company has million of goodwill recorded on its consolidated balance sheet at may   resulting from acquisitions in fiscal and fiscal statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  requires that goodwill not be amortized  but instead tested for impairment on an annual basis and at interim periods if an event occurs or circumstances change in a way to indicate that there has been a potential decline in the fair value of the reporting unit 
impairment is determined by comparing the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount  including goodwill 
the company performs its annual review at the beginning of the fourth fiscal quarter 
the company s business is largely homogeneous and  as a result  substantially all of the goodwill is associated with one reporting unit 
based on the results of the company s goodwill impairment review  no impairment charge was recognized 
subsequent to this review  there have been no events or circumstances that indicate any potential impairment of the goodwill balance 
the company also tests intangible assets for potential impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
fixed assets the carrying value of fixed assets  including costs for acquired software and software developed for internal use  reflects estimates  assumptions  and judgments relative to capitalized costs  useful lives  utilization  and salvage value 
for software developed for internal use  all external direct costs for materials and services and certain payroll and related fringe costs are capitalized in accordance with statement of position sop  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
the company reviews the carrying value of fixed assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable

as part of providing payroll  tax filing and payment services  and employee payment services  paychex is authorized by the client to initiate money transfers from the client s account for the amount of tax obligations and employees direct deposits

contingent liabilities the company is subject to various claims and legal matters

at may   the company has recorded approximately million in the reserve for pending legal matters based on the application of sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  which requires the company to record a reserve if it believes an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the probable loss can be reasonably estimated 
the determination of whether any particular matter involves a probable loss or if the amount of a probable loss can be reasonably estimated requires considerable judgment 
this reserve may change in the future due to new developments or changes in the company s strategies or assumptions related to any particular matter 
in light of the legal reserve recorded  the company s management currently believes that resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
however  these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and there exists the possibility that the ultimate resolution of these matters could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial position and the results of operations in the period in which any such effect is recorded

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk factors changes in interest rates and interest rate risk funds held for clients are primarily comprised of short term funds and available for sale debt securities  and corporate investments are primarily comprised of available for sale debt securities 
changes in interest rates will impact the earnings potential of future investments and will cause fluctuations in the market value of the company s longer term available for sale investments 
the company generally directs investments towards high credit quality  fixed rate municipal and government securities and manages the available for sale portfolio to a benchmark duration of two and one half to three years 
the company does not utilize derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk 
the company s investment portfolios and the earnings from these portfolios have been impacted by the decreasing interest rate environment  as the federal funds rate decreased from at the end of fiscal to at may  the decreasing interest rate environment has negatively affected net income growth in fiscal years   and  and generated significant unrealized gains for the company s longer term available for sale portfolio during most of the same periods 
the company has mitigated some of the impact of lower interest rates on earnings by realizing gains from the sale of investments 
when interest rates begin to rise  the full benefit of higher interest rates will not immediately be reflected in net income due to the interaction of long and short term interest rate changes  as discussed below 
increases in interest rates increase earnings from the company s short term investments  which totaled approximately billion at may   and over time will increase earnings from the company s longer term available for sale investments  which totaled approximately billion at may  earnings from the available for sale investments  which currently have an average duration of years  will not reflect increases in interest rates until the investments are sold or mature and the proceeds are reinvested at higher rates 
an increasing rate environment will generally result in a decrease in the fair value of the company s investment portfolio 
the following table summarizes the changes in the federal funds rate over the past three fiscal years federal funds rate beginning of fiscal year rate decrease first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter federal funds rate end of fiscal year three year aaa municipal securities yields end of fiscal year on june   the federal funds rate was increased to 
calculating the future effects of changing interest rates involves many factors 
these factors include  but are not limited to  daily interest rate changes  seasonal variations in investment balances  actual duration of short term and available for sale investments  the proportional mix of taxable and tax exempt investments  and changes in tax exempt municipal rates versus taxable investment rates  which are not synchronized or simultaneous 
subject to these factors  a basis point change generally affects the company s tax exempt interest rates by approximately basis points 
the total investment portfolio is expected to average approximately billion in fiscal the company s normal and anticipated allocation is approximately invested in short term securities with an average duration of thirty days and invested in available for sale municipal securities with an average duration of two and one half to three years 
the company estimates that the earnings effect of a basis point change in interest rates basis points for tax exempt investments at the beginning of fiscal would be in the range of million to million for fiscal the combined funds held for clients and corporate available for sale investment portfolios reflected a net unrealized loss of million at may   compared with net unrealized gains of million at may   and million at may  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  interest rates on longer term securities began to increase while short term rates remained fairly consistent 
the three year aaa municipal securities yield increased to at may   from at february  this trend in longer term interest rates resulted in a decrease in the fair value of the company s investment portfolios  as the company s million net unrealized gain position at february   changed to a million net unrealized loss position at may  during fiscal  the net unrealized gain or loss position ranged from approximately million net unrealized loss to million net unrealized gain 
the range of unrealized gains in fiscal was million to million 
the net unrealized loss position of the company s investment portfolios was approximately 
million at july  see note d of the notes to consolidated financial statements  included in item of this form k  for additional disclosures about the company s investment portfolios 
as of may   and may   the company had billion invested in available for sale securities at fair value  with weighted average yields to maturity of and  respectively 
assuming a hypothetical increase in both short term and longer term interest rates of basis points  the resulting potential decrease in fair value for the portfolio of securities at may   would be in the range of million to million 
conversely  a corresponding decrease in interest rates would result in a comparable increase in fair value 
this hypothetical decrease or increase in the fair value of the portfolio would be recorded as an adjustment to the portfolio s recorded value  with an offsetting amount recorded in stockholders equity and with no related or immediate impact on the results of operations 
credit risk the company is exposed to credit risk in connection with these investments through the possible inability of the borrowers to meet the terms of the bonds 
the company attempts to limit credit risk by investing primarily in aaa and aa rated securities and a rated short term securities  and by limiting amounts that can be invested in any single instrument 
at may   all available for sale and short term securities classified as cash equivalents held an a or equivalent rating  with over of available for sale securities holding an aa rating or better
