item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business overview we design  manufacture  and market network distribution and transmission products and provide services and operational support systems to operators of advanced hybrid fiber coax broadband networks 
we operate in three industry segments broadband communications products  broadband network services  and broadband management solutions 
our broadband communications products segment is responsible for research  development  management  production  support  and sales of digital video transport  fiber optic  radio frequency  and fiber to the premises equipment for hybrid fiber coax networks as well as the company s new optical packet ring technology solution for the all digital networks of the future 
our broadband network services segment provides outsourced technical services  including network engineering and design  construction  activation  optimization  certification  maintenance  and operations 
our broadband management solutions segment is responsible for the development  integration  management  implementation  support  and sale of operations support systems oss solutions to operate and manage reliable  high quality multi service networks 
c cor returned to profitability in fiscal year based upon a growth in sales combined with the effect of cost reduction actions implemented in the previous fiscal year 
our sales to adelphia increased substantially in fiscal year as they resumed spending on the upgrade of their networks 
gross margins improved from in fiscal year to in fiscal year  reflecting the higher level of sales in each of our operating segments  consolidation of manufacturing operations  and lower charges associated with excess and obsolete inventory 
as a result  gross profit increased from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year we also substantially improved our liquidity in fiscal year by generating million in cash from operations  which included million in proceeds from the sale of our adelphia bankruptcy trade claims  and by completing a follow on offering of our common stock which raised million in net proceeds 
in fiscal year  we invested million in the acquisitions of alopa networks  inc and lantern communications  inc  and subsequent to june   we committed another million  plus an earnout of up to million  to the acquisitions of stargus inc and optinel systems  inc 
we believe that these acquisitions enhance our product and software offerings in key areas and expect them to contribute to our financial results in fiscal year we are subject to various risks associated with our business operations 
for additional information concerning risks  refer to risks related to our business  in part  item of this form k 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates  assumptions  and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the applicable period 
management bases its estimates  assumptions  and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates  assumptions  and judgments 
the critical accounting policies requiring estimates  assumptions  and judgments that we believe have the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements are revenue recognition allowances for doubtful accounts valuation of inventories valuation of goodwill  other intangible assets  and long lived assets restructuring costs warranty liabilities accounting for foreign currency translation and transactions accounting for income taxes different assumptions and judgments would change estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  which  in turn  could change the results from those reported 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the sale price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenue from equipment sales and sales type leases is generally recognized when the equipment has been shipped 
in instances in which the agreement with the customer contains a customer acceptance clause  revenue is deferred until customer acceptance is obtained 
service revenues  consisting of system design  field services  and other consulting engagements  are generally recognized as services are rendered in accordance with the terms of contracts 
we also enter into contracts that entail delivery of both products and services 
revenue from these contracts is accounted for under the percentage of completion method 
under the percentage of completion method  we record revenue by reference to the costs incurred to date and the estimated costs remaining to fulfill the contracts 
provisions for losses on service contracts are recognized during the period in which the loss first becomes apparent 
for contracts accounted for under the percentage of completion method  we typically perform the services prior to billing the customer which gives rise to unbilled receivables 
in these circumstances  billings usually occur shortly after the company performs a specified amount of the work  as outlined in the contract 
unbilled receivables are expected to be billed and collected generally within three to six months 
for our software licensing arrangements involving multiple elements  revenue is allocated to each element based on vendor specific objective evidence of fair values of the elements 
license revenue allocated to software products  in certain circumstances  is recognized upon the delivery of the software products 
for certain of our software license arrangements where professional services are being provided that are deemed to be essential to the functionality or are for significant production  modification  or customization of the software product  both the software product revenue and the professional service revenue are recognized on the completed contract method  as the company previously did not have the ability to reasonably estimate contract costs at the inception of the contracts 
under the completed contract method  revenue is recognized when the contract is complete  and all direct costs and related revenues are deferred until that time 
software maintenance fees are generally billed and collected in advance of the associated maintenance contract term 
maintenance fees collected are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized ratably under the straight line method over the term of the contract 
the entire amount of an estimated loss on a contract is accrued at the time a loss on a contract is projected 
for new mobile workforce software contracts entered into in fiscal year  the company anticipates switching to the percentage of completion method of accounting as we believe that we now have the ability to reasonably estimate contract costs 
revenue recognition in each period is dependent on the application of these accounting policies 
allowances for doubtful accounts 
we establish a general allowance for doubtful accounts based on percentages applied to certain aged receivable categories 
these percentages are determined by a variety of factors  including current economic trends  contractual terms and conditions  and historical payment experience 
in addition  we establish allowances for specifically identified doubtful accounts when a loss is deemed to be both probable and estimable 
in the event that we are not able to predict changes in the financial condition of our customers  resulting in an unexpected problem with collectibility of receivables and our actual bad debts differ from estimates  or we adjust estimates in future periods  our established allowances may be insufficient and we may be required to record additional allowances 
alternatively  if we provided more allowances than are ultimately required  we may reverse a portion of such provisions in future periods based on our actual collection experience 
in the event we adjust our allowance estimates  it could materially affect our operating results and financial position 
valuation of inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined on the first in  first out method 
we establish provisions for excess and obsolete inventories after evaluation of historical sales and usage  current economic trends  market conditions  product rationalization  forecasted sales  product lifecycles  and current inventory levels 
this evaluation requires us to make estimates regarding future events in an industry where rapid technological changes are prevalent 
we experienced significant changes in required reserves during fiscal year due primarily to a decline in market conditions and product rationalization resulting from acquisitions 
it is possible that increases in inventory reserves may be required in the future if there is a decline in market conditions or if changes in expected product lifecycles occur 
alternatively  if market conditions improve or product lifecycles extend  we may have greater success in selling inventory that had previously been written down 
in either event  the actual value of our inventory may be higher or lower and recognition of such difference will affect our cost of sales in a future period  which could materially affect our operating results and financial position 
valuation of goodwill  other intangible assets  and other long lived assets 
we assess goodwill at least annually for impairment and more frequently if circumstances warrant 
we have chosen the end of the third quarter of each fiscal year as the period for performing our annual assessment 
the impairment assessment is performed in two steps i we determine whether impairment is indicated by comparing the fair value of each of our reporting units with its carrying value and ii if there is an indication of impairment  we measure the amount of impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
we normally calculate the fair value of our reporting units by using the projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate we determine to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business 
if impairment is indicated  we allocate the fair value of the reporting unit to the reporting unit s individual assets and liabilities 
the residual value is the implied fair value of goodwill 
the difference between the carrying amount of the goodwill and the implied fair value of the goodwill is recorded as an impairment loss 
we also assess other intangible assets and other long lived assets for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable through the estimated undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the assets 
when an impairment of goodwill  intangible assets  or long lived assets is determined  it is recorded as a charge against earnings in the period when recognized 
for additional information regarding goodwill and other intangible assets  refer to note of our consolidated financial statements 
restructuring costs 
for restructuring activities initiated prior to december   we recorded restructuring costs in accordance with the provisions of emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring and staff accounting bulletin no 
 restructuring and impairment charges 
restructuring costs were recorded when the company committed to an exit plan and significant changes to the exit plan were not likely 
we estimated the future amounts to be incurred as a result of exit plans and recorded the amounts as a charge against earnings 
for restructuring activities initiated after december   restructuring costs are recorded in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities statement 
the principal difference between statement and eitf issue no 
relates to when an entity can recognize a liability related to exit or disposal costs 
statement requires that a liability be recognized for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity when the liability is incurred  as opposed to eitf issue no 
 which allowed a liability related to an exit or disposal activity to be recognized on the date an entity committed to an exit plan 
for additional information regarding restructuring costs  refer to note of our consolidated financial statements 
revisions to our estimates could result in an additional charge to earnings or a reversal of previously recorded charges  which could materially affect our operating results and financial position in future periods if anticipated events and key assumptions change 
warranty liabilities 
we warranty our products against defects in materials and workmanship  generally for two to five years  depending upon product lines and geographic regions 
a provision for estimated future costs related to warranty activities is recorded when the product is shipped  based upon our historical experience of known product failure rates and historical costs incurred in correcting product failures 
in addition  from time to time  the recorded amount is adjusted for specifically identified warranty exposures if unforeseen technical problems arise 
in the event that our historical experience of product failure rates and costs of correcting product failures change  or our estimates relating to probable losses resulting from specifically identified warranty exposures change  we may be required to record additional warranty reserves 
alternatively  if we provided more reserves than we needed  we may reverse a portion of such provisions in future periods 
in the event we change our warranty reserve estimates  the resulting charge against future cost of sales or reversal of previously recorded charges may materially affect our operating results and financial position 
accounting for foreign currency translation and transactions 
we convert the assets and liabilities of foreign operations into their us dollar equivalents at rates in effect at the balance sheet dates  and record translation adjustments in shareholders equity 
the statements of operations of foreign operations are translated from the operation s functional currency to us dollar equivalents at average rates for the period 
foreign currency transaction gains and losses resulting from settlement of foreign receivables and payables  including certain cross currency intercompany activities where payment is expected to be satisfied in the normal course of business  are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations 
other cross currency intercompany activities  where management has no intent to require payment in the foreseeable future  are recorded in shareholders equity as a component of other comprehensive income loss 
in the event management s intent with respect to cross currency intercompany activities changes  such changes could result in a foreign currency gain or loss that may materially affect our operating results and financial position 
accounting for income taxes 
we estimate our income taxes for each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this involves estimating our actual current income tax payable and assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as reserves and accruals  for tax and accounting purposes 
deferred taxes arise due to temporary differences in the bases of assets and liabilities and from net operating losses and credit carryforwards 
in general  deferred tax assets represent future tax benefits to be received when certain expenses previously recognized in the company s consolidated statement of operations become deductible expenses under applicable income tax laws or loss or credit carryforwards are utilized 
accordingly  realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income against which these deductions  losses and credits can be utilized 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
management considers historical operating losses  scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
as a result of the cumulative losses in fiscal years   and  we concluded during fiscal year that a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets was necessary 
as of june   a full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets has been recorded  with the exception of certain net deferred tax assets in specific foreign jurisdictions where we believe it is more likely than not that such tax benefits will be realized 
in addition  we expect to provide a valuation allowance on any future tax benefits until we can sustain a level of profitability that demonstrates our ability to utilize these assets 
business combinations in fiscal year  we acquired certain assets and liabilities of alopa networks  inc alopa  a provider of infrastructure software solutions for end to end activation  management  and assurance of digital services over cable  and lantern communications  inc lantern  a provider of metropolitan area network packet based transport solutions  which incorporate advanced bandwidth management and switching capabilities for the delivery of services such as voice  video  and data over a packet based infrastructure 
alopa became part of our broadband management solutions segment and lantern became part of our broadband communications products segment 
the total consideration for the acquisitions was million  consisting of cash payments of million  direct transaction costs of  and the assumption of lantern stock options to purchase  shares of the company s common stock having a fair market value of  calculated using the black scholes option pricing model 
the stock options assumed included both vested and unvested stock options 
the unvested stock options require future employee service after the acquisition date to vest  and as such   has been allocated to unearned compensation based on their intrinsic value as of the acquisition date 
such costs will be recognized over the remaining vesting period 
the acquisitions resulted in additional goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets being recorded during fiscal year see notes and to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k for additional information regarding business combinations 
subsequent events we completed two acquisitions subsequent to june  on july   we acquired all the outstanding securities of stargus  inc stargus  a privately held company headquartered in andover  massachusetts 
stargus is a provider of comprehensive network and service management solutions for cable broadband networks 
stargus became part of the company s broadband management solutions segment 
the purchase price for the acquisition was approximately million  subject to certain adjustments 
on september   we acquired certain assets and liabilities of optinel systems  inc optinel  a privately held company located in elkridge  maryland 
optinel is a provider of optical ethernet transport solutions for residential and business services 
optinel became part of the company s broadband communications products segment 
the purchase price for the acquisition was approximately million  subject to certain adjustments 
additional cash payments of up to million are required to be made to optinel shareholders if certain sales objectives are achieved within thirteen months from the date of acquisition 
we anticipate using a third party appraisal firm to perform a valuation of identifiable intangible assets  including in process research and development that was commenced but not yet completed at the date of these acquisitions  and which if unsuccessful  would have no alternative use 
the fair value if any ascribed to in process research and development will be charged to expense in the first quarter of fiscal year the fair value ascribed to other identifiable intangibles will result in higher amortization expense in future periods  in amounts unknown at this time 
any excess of the purchase price and related costs over the fair value of the acquired net assets of the businesses will be recorded as goodwill

fiscal year ended change change june  from june  from june  prior prior operating segment net sales year net sales year net sales in millions of dollars broadband communications products broadband network services broadband management solutions consolidated the table below sets forth our net sales for fiscal years   and by geographic region 
fiscal year ended change change from from june  prior june  prior june  year year geographic region net sales net sales net sales in millions of dollars united states europe asia canada latin america consolidated fiscal compared to fiscal net sales 
the increase in consolidated net sales for fiscal year was the result of capital spending and system upgrades by certain customers  primarily adelphia  which positively affected both product and technical services revenues during the year  and increased spending on operational support software solutions 
our largest customers for fiscal year were adelphia communications and time warner cable  accounting for and  respectively  of net sales 
the increase in broadband communications products segment sales during fiscal year was primarily driven by increased capital spending by adelphia and growth in our international sales 
sales of radio frequency amplifiers increased  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year optical product sales declined  to million in fiscal year  compared to million in fiscal year shifts in product mix resulted from new build and upgrade requirements  which depend on the network architecture deployed by our customers 
the increase in broadband network services segment sales during fiscal year resulted from increased spending by domestic cable operators  primarily adelphia  on technical services  primarily related to our outside plant technical services operations  which include system sweep  reverse path activation  ingress mitigation  node certification  and system maintenance 
the increase in broadband management solutions segment sales during fiscal year was a result of customer acceptance of various network and workforce management software projects during the year 
our software revenues during fiscal year were primarily recognized using the completed contract method 
for new mobile workforce software contracts entered into in fiscal year  we anticipate switching to the percentage of completion method of accounting 
domestic sales increased in all three of our operating segments during fiscal year for our broadband communications products segment and our broadband network services segment  the increase was driven by spending for both capital equipment and technical services by certain cable operators  primarily adelphia 
the increase for our broadband management solutions segment was driven by increased deployments of network and workforce management software 
international sales increased in all geographic regions with the exception of canada during fiscal year our international sales derive primarily from broadband communications products segment sales 
we expect the demand for our products in international markets will continue to be highly variable 
the international markets represent distinct markets in which capital spending decisions for hybrid fiber coax network distribution equipment can be affected by a variety of factors  including access to financing and general economic conditions 
the table below sets forth our backlog by industry segment as of june   compared to june  fiscal year ended june  june  change operating segment backlog backlog in millions of dollars broadband communications products broadband network services broadband management solutions consolidated our backlog increased for broadband communications products primarily due to increased bookings from international customers during the period 
our backlog increased in broadband network services due to increased bookings of system upgrade work  primarily from adelphia  during the period 
the decline in backlog for broadband management solutions resulted from the completion of several contracts during the year and lower new software bookings during the period 
the company includes in backlog customer orders that are anticipated to result in revenue being recognized over the next twelve months 
the majority of orders in backlog for broadband communications products will result in revenue over the next six months while orders in backlog of the other two segments typically include a portion that will result in revenue over the latter part of the twelve month period 
we make management decisions based on our backlog  including hiring of personnel  purchasing of materials  and other matters that may increase our production capabilities and costs 
cancellations  delays or reductions of orders could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
gross margin 
the following table sets forth our gross margins by operating segment for fiscal year compared to fiscal year fiscal year ended june  change june  operating segment gross margin points gross margin broadband communications products broadband network services broadband management solutions consolidated our gross margin increased in fiscal year as a result of increased gross margins in all operating segments 
gross margin for our broadband communications products segment was positively affected in fiscal year by higher volume and reduced costs resulting from the closing of our manlius  new york manufacturing facility in fiscal year the gross margin for our broadband communications products segment for fiscal year was affected by a million charge for an excess and obsolete inventory provision resulting from significant reductions in demand levels  product line rationalization decisions for overlapping product lines resulting from acquisitions  transition to an outsourced manufacturer of product lines determined to be at the end of their product lifecycle  and a refinement of the company s reserve estimation process to quantify reserve requirements for inventory levels in excess of our forecasted demand 
the increase in broadband network services segment gross margin was due primarily to increased volume levels and labor and overhead efficiencies 
broadband management solutions segment gross margin increased as a result of the higher revenue recognized on network and workforce management software projects  due to the timing of customer acceptances 
we anticipate that our future gross margins in all of our business segments will continue to be affected by many factors  including revenue levels in general  sales mix  competitive pricing pressures  the timing of new product introductions and the timing of deployments for certain of our operational support software solutions 
selling and administrative 
selling and administrative expenses were million of net sales in fiscal year  compared to million of net sales in fiscal year the decrease resulted from reductions in our workforce implemented in fiscal year to achieve a more favorable cost structure  the collection of million in delinquent accounts receivable that were previously reserved for  and the settlement of a liability related to certain marketing costs for  less than its recorded value 
research and product development 
research and product development expenses were million of net sales in fiscal year  compared to million of net sales in fiscal year research and product development expenses in the broadband communications products segment were million for fiscal year  compared to million for fiscal year the decrease was primarily due to lower personnel costs resulting from workforce reductions and the closing of our louvier  france operation in fiscal year research and product development expenses in the broadband management solutions segment were million in fiscal year  compared to million in fiscal year the decrease was primarily due to lower personnel costs resulting from workforce reductions and lower expenses for the development of operational support solutions 
other research and product development expenses  not charged to segments  were  in fiscal year  compared to  in fiscal year we believe continued commitment to product development efforts will be required for us to remain competitive  and anticipate increased investments in research and product development in future periods related to ongoing initiatives in the development of network distribution and transmission products and operational support software solutions 
operating income loss by segment 
operating income excluding unallocated items for the broadband communications products segment in fiscal year was million  compared to an operating loss of million in fiscal year the increased operating income for fiscal year was primarily attributable to increased gross margins and lower operating expenses resulting from an improvement in our cost structure due to restructuring efforts completed during the prior fiscal year 
in addition  the loss in fiscal year included increased provisions for excess and obsolete inventory compared to the current year 
operating income excluding unallocated items for the broadband network services segment in fiscal year was million  compared to  in fiscal year the increase in operating income for fiscal year was due to a increase in sales volume  primarily related to upgrade work for adelphia  which resulted in improved labor efficiencies and higher gross margins 
operating loss excluding unallocated items for the broadband management solutions segment in fiscal year was  compared to an operating loss of million in fiscal year the decreased operating loss for this segment resulted from a increase in revenue recognized due to customer acceptance of various network and workforce management software projects  and lower research and development costs for operational support solutions 
interest expense and investment income 
interest expense was  in fiscal year  compared to  in fiscal year the difference in interest expense resulted primarily from a  imputed interest charge incurred in the prior year period related to our philips broadband networks pbn acquisition 
investment income was million in fiscal year  compared to  in fiscal year the increase in investment income resulted from higher average investment balances compared to fiscal year  offset by lower interest rates 
our increased investment balances are a result of our common stock offering in february  cash received in the sale of our trade claims against adelphia and affiliates  and cash provided by operating and other financing activities during the year 
foreign exchange gain loss 
foreign exchange gain was  in fiscal year  compared to a loss of  in fiscal year the foreign exchange gain has resulted primarily from a further weakening of the us dollar against the euro over the year 
in addition  the loss in the prior year included a million loss related to the settlement of a foreign exchange forward contract 
gain on sale of bankruptcy trade claims 
we filed unsecured claims in the bankruptcy cases of adelphia and affiliates related to accounts receivable which were previously written off in fiscal year in october  we entered into an agreement to sell substantially all of our pre petition bankruptcy trade claims against adelphia and affiliates 
under the terms of the agreement  we received million on november  in an initial cash payment 
additional amounts are being held in escrow pending the resolution of certain contingencies and we anticipate that we could receive an additional approximately million in the first half of fiscal year other income  net 
other income  net was  in fiscal year  compared to other income  net of  in fiscal year other income  net for fiscal year included  as a partial recovery on a note receivable from a third party that had been fully reserved for by the company in fiscal year income tax expense 
income tax expense was million for fiscal year  compared with income tax expense for fiscal year of million 
income taxes for fiscal year include current taxes payable for federal alternative minimum tax  state  and foreign income taxes in certain jurisdictions where the company is profitable  and generally reflect cash taxes payable 
the company has assessed the realizability of its deferred tax assets  giving consideration to historical operating losses  scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies 
management concluded during the third quarter of fiscal year  as a result of the cumulative losses over the previous three years  that a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets was appropriate and recorded an allowance as of that date 
as of june   realization of any future benefit from deductible temporary differences  net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards is uncertain 
therefore  the company has continued to maintain a valuation allowance for the amount of its net deferred tax assets 
we expect to maintain valuation allowances related to net tax benefits arising from temporary differences and operating loss carryforwards until a level of profitability is sustained that demonstrates it is more likely than not that the company will be able to realize all or part of the tax benefits represented by the deferred tax assets 
in the event that the company reverses the valuation allowance in the future  reported tax expense subsequent to such action will increase and will likely approximate the statutory rates in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
fiscal compared to fiscal net sales 
net sales decreased by to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year the decrease in broadband communications products segment sales during fiscal year was largely attributable to reduced or deferred capital spending by customers in the cable industry for network build outs and expansion of existing networks 
the company believes the reduced capital spending levels were the result of financial difficulties of certain cable customers  challenges in gaining access to capital markets  and a focus by cable operators on reducing debt and increasing cash flow 
the decline in sales affected our optical product lines and  to a lesser extent  our radio frequency product lines 
optical product sales declined  to million in fiscal year  compared to million in fiscal year sales of radio frequency amplifiers decreased  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year the decrease in broadband network services segment sales during fiscal year also resulted from reduced spending by domestic cable operators on technical services  primarily related to our outside plant technical services operations 
the increase in broadband management solutions segment sales during fiscal year resulted from increased deployments of both our network service manager nsm and mobile workforce manager mwm software products 
domestic sales decreased during fiscal year in both our broadband communications products segment and broadband network services segment due to reduced spending by certain domestic multiple system operators 
international sales increased during fiscal year due to higher broadband communications products segment sales  primarily in europe and asia 
our acquisition of the pbn assets and operations in fiscal year increased our customer base and installed equipment base in the markets of europe and asia 
gross margin 
the following table sets forth our gross margins by operating segment for fiscal year compared to fiscal year fiscal year ended june  change june  operating segment gross margin points gross margin broadband communications products broadband network services broadband management solutions consolidated our gross margin decreased in fiscal year due primarily to the decrease in gross margin in the broadband communications products segment 
the decrease in broadband communications products segment gross margin for fiscal year was due primarily to lower volumes and an increase in our provision for excess and obsolete inventory 
the increase in the excess and obsolete inventory provision was the result of significant reductions in demand levels  product line rationalization decisions for overlapping product lines resulting from acquisitions  transition to an outsourced manufacturer of product lines determined to be at the end of their product lifecycle  and a refinement of the company s reserve estimation process to quantify reserve requirements for inventory levels in excess of our forecasted demand 
in addition  lower volumes resulted in higher manufacturing costs per unit due to allocating higher fixed factory overhead costs which contributed to lower gross margins during the year 
the decrease in broadband network services segment gross margin was due primarily to reduced volume levels without a corresponding level of reduction in fixed overhead costs and services mix 
broadband management solutions segment gross margin increased as a result of increased deployments of nsm and mwm software solutions  whereby the operation began absorbing certain fixed personnel and other costs 
selling and administrative 
selling and administrative expenses were million of net sales in fiscal year  compared to million of net sales in fiscal year included in selling and administrative expense for fiscal year was bad debt expense of million  which included million for a specific charge off of accounts receivables from adelphia communications and affiliates  and million related to customers in latin america  where economic conditions affected the collection of certain outstanding accounts receivable 
in addition  costs of million associated with the implementation of a fully integrated erp system were incurred during fiscal year excluding the aforementioned costs relating to fiscal year  the company increased selling and administrative expenses during fiscal year for personnel costs and administrative expenses due to our acquisition of pbn assets and operations  which were partially offset by recovery of million on certain accounts previously deemed uncollectible 
research and product development 
research and product development expenses were million of net sales in fiscal year  compared to million of net sales in fiscal year research and product development expenses in the broadband communications products segment were million for fiscal year  compared to million for fiscal year the increase was primarily due to higher personnel costs resulting from our acquisition of pbn assets and operations 
research and product development expenses in the broadband management solutions segment were million in fiscal year  compared to million in fiscal year the decrease was primarily due to lower personnel costs resulting from reductions in the workforce and lower expenses for the development of mwm software solutions 
other research and product development expenses  not charged to segments  were  in fiscal year  compared to  in fiscal year the decrease was primarily due to lower personnel and other costs associated with technology investigation and oversight functions 
operating income loss by segment 
operating loss excluding unallocated items for the broadband communications products segment in fiscal year was million  compared to a loss of  in fiscal year included in the operating loss for fiscal year was a charge of million for a specific charge off of accounts receivable from adelphia communications and affiliates  and million related to customers in latin america 
excluding these charges from the prior year  the change in our operating results from year to year was a result of lower sales volumes  lower gross margins  and an increased provision for excess and obsolete inventory during fiscal year operating income excluding unallocated items for the broadband network services segment in fiscal year was  compared to an operating loss of million in fiscal year the operating loss in fiscal year was primarily a result of a charge to bad debt expense of million related to adelphia 
excluding this charge  operating income decreased as a result of lower sales volumes and lower gross margins during fiscal year operating loss excluding unallocated items for the broadband management solutions segment in fiscal year was million  compared to an operating loss of million in fiscal year included in the operating loss for fiscal year was million in amortization of intangibles related to our acquisition of mobileforce 
based upon the projected recoverability of these intangible assets  an impairment charge for the remaining carrying value of these assets was recorded as of june   but not allocated to the broadband management solutions segment 
excluding the aforementioned amortization  the reduction in operating loss for fiscal year derives primarily from increased volume during the fiscal year  as a result of increased deployments  and an improved cost structure 
goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges 
the company adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets statement effective june  under statement  we are required to evaluate whether goodwill is impaired on at least an annual basis 
as a result of completing each step in our evaluation of goodwill in fiscal year  we determined that goodwill associated with our broadband communications products reporting unit was impaired 
the decline in the fair value of the broadband communications products reporting unit was largely attributable to the weakness in capital spending by cable operators 
in fiscal year  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million 
this compared to an impairment charge of million in fiscal year for goodwill and intangible assets related to mobileforce  which is part of our broadband management solutions segment see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
restructuring charges 
we implemented various initiatives during fiscal year to improve our operating performance and align our cost structure with business levels 
as a result  we recorded restructuring charges of  during fiscal year these were partially offset by a reversal of  for previously recorded restructuring charges incurred in prior fiscal years 
the result was a net charge in fiscal year of  this compared to a net charge in fiscal year of million  associated with initiatives to consolidate our manufacturing operations  improve our operating performance  and align our cost structure with current business levels see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
interest expense and investment income 
interest expense was  in fiscal year  compared to  in fiscal year the increase in interest expense in fiscal year resulted primarily from an imputed interest charge of  related to the pbn acquisition 
investment income was  in fiscal year  compared to million in fiscal year the decrease in investment income resulted from reduced investment balances and lower interest rates 
operating cash and short term investments were used to fund the pbn acquisition and operating losses during fiscal year foreign exchange gain loss 
foreign exchange loss was  in fiscal year  compared to a gain of million in fiscal year the foreign exchange loss for fiscal year includes a million loss related to the settlement of a foreign exchange forward contract 
in fiscal year  we recorded a gain of million related to this foreign exchange forward contract 
other income expense  net 
other income  net was  in fiscal year  compared to other expense  net of million in fiscal year other income  net for fiscal year included  as a partial recovery on a note receivable from a third party that had been fully reserved for by the company in fiscal year income tax expense benefit 
income tax expense was million for fiscal year  compared with an income tax benefit for fiscal year of million 
during fiscal year  the company assessed the realizability of its deferred tax assets  giving consideration to historical operating losses  scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies 
as a result of the cumulative losses over the past three years  we determined that realization of any future benefit from deductible temporary differences  net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards was uncertain as of june  therefore  the company recorded a valuation allowance for the full amount of its net deferred tax assets  with the exception of certain net deferred tax assets in specific foreign jurisdictions 
liquidity and capital resources as of june   cash and cash equivalents totaled million  up from million at june  marketable securities increased to million as of june   up from  at june  working capital was million at june   compared to million at june  on february   we sold in a public offering  shares of our common stock at a price of per share 
this offering resulted in net proceeds after deducting issuance costs to us of million 
in addition  cash proceeds received on the sale of our bankruptcy trade claims against adelphia and its affiliates in november  as well as increased cash generated from operations and other financing activities  contributed to the increase in cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities during the fiscal year ended june  as of june   we had restricted cash of million 
our restricted cash represents an arrangement with a bank whereby a cash compensating balance is maintained to secure certain letters of credit issued on behalf of the company 
the total cash compensating balance has been classified as a current asset as of june  as the terms for the letters of credit expire in less than one year 
we are entitled to the interest earnings on our restricted cash balance 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal year  compared with cash used in operating activities of million in fiscal year the major elements of the change for fiscal year include net income for the period of million  which included million from the sale of our bankruptcy trade claims against adelphia and its affiliates  reductions in inventory  and increased accounts payable  which were partially offset by increases in accounts receivables and reductions in accrued liabilities 
the net loss for fiscal year included a number of non cash charges such as the million intangible asset impairment charge  a million change in deferred tax assets related to recording a valuation allowance  and a million increase in inventory reserves 
net cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal year  compared to million used in fiscal year net cash used in investing activities in fiscal year was due primarily to utilizing million for the purchase of marketable securities and million for the acquisitions of alopa and lantern

net cash provided by financing activities was million in fiscal year  compared with cash used in financing activities of  in fiscal year the major elements of cash provided by financing activities for fiscal year were net proceeds of million received from our follow on public offering of stock in february and million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options and warrants 
the prior year activity primarily represented payments on long term debt  which were partially offset by proceeds from the exercise of stock options and warrants 
the company has a two year secured revolving credit financing agreement with a commercial lender 
borrowings under the financing agreement may be used for working capital and general corporate purposes 
the financing agreement provides a commitment of up to an aggregate amount of million 
the financing agreement allows for the issuance of letters of credit and cash borrowings 
letters of credit outstanding are limited to no more than million 
cash borrowings are limited by certain availability reserves and a borrowing base  primarily a percentage of eligible domestic trade accounts receivable  up to the facility s maximum availability less letters of credit outstanding 
as security for the financing agreement  the company has pledged the following collateral trade accounts receivable  inventory  general intangibles  real estate  equipment  life insurance policies  and a portion of the stock of a wholly owned foreign subsidiary 
the financing agreement contains a number of restrictive covenants  including covenants limiting incurrence of subordinated debt  disposal of collateral  and the payment of dividends except stock dividends 
the financing agreement contains no financial covenants 
the financing agreement is committed through november  borrowings under the financing agreement bear interest at an applicable bank rate or libor plus two and three quarters percent per annum  payable monthly 
the financing agreement required the payment of a facility fee of  at execution and requires a fee on the unused commitment of per annum payable monthly  and an administrative fee of  per annum 
as of june   the company had no borrowings outstanding on the financing agreement and letters of credit for million have been issued related to requirements under our workers compensation policies and facility lease obligations 
based upon the eligible borrowing base at june   available borrowings under the financing agreement were million 
we are in the process of evaluating alternatives to the current financing agreement 
as a condition to closing on the financing agreement  the company terminated its prior credit agreement with a bank  except that the company continues to maintain letters of credit provided by the bank related to our workers compensation program  customer obligations  and equipment lease obligations 
as of june   the aggregate amount of the letters of credit was million 
we are required to maintain cash deposits of million as collateral for these letters of credit 
information regarding our contractual obligations is as follows payments due by period less than more than total year years years years in thousands contractual obligations long term debt operating leases purchase obligations total contractual cash obligations information regarding our commitments is as follows amount of commitments expiration per period less than more than total year years years years in thousands other commitments standby letters of credit total commitments working capital outlook our main source of liquidity is our unrestricted cash on hand and future cash generated by operations 
cash provided by or used in operations can vary substantially based on our level of business activity 
we believe that during fiscal year we benefited from restructuring efforts completed in the prior fiscal year  which resulted in an improved operating cost structure 
we intend to continue our initiatives to achieve more cost effective operations throughout fiscal year although no specific restructuring actions are planned at the present time  if a decline in spending occurs in the cable industry  we may undertake additional restructuring initiatives and incur expenses in amounts that have not yet been determined 
subsequent to the fiscal year ended june   we acquired stargus and optinel  resulting in initial cash payments of million 
additional earnout payments of up to million are required to be made if certain performance targets are met within months of the closing date 
in the short term  we expect to incur integration and start up costs during the first half of fiscal year in addition  we anticipate moderate growth in our operating expenses as a result of the acquisitions 
taking into account the funding of the acquisitions of stargus and optinel  including potential contingent earnout payments and start up costs  we believe remaining cash and cash equivalents balances  our marketable securities and our financing agreement or alternative arrangement will be adequate to cover our operating cash requirements over the next to months 
however  we may find it necessary or desirable to seek other sources of financing to support our capital needs and provide funds for financing additional strategic initiatives including acquiring or investing in complementary business  products  services  or technologies 
accordingly  this may require third party financing or equity based financing  such as issuance of common stock  preferred stock  or subordinated convertible debt securities and warrants  which would be dilutive to existing shareholders 
there are no assurances that third party financing will be available on acceptable terms
