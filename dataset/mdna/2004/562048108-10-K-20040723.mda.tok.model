item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following section provides a narrative discussion about manatron s financial condition  changes in financial condition and results of operations 
the comments that follow should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company enters into contracts with customers to license or sell application software  third party software  hardware  related professional services  such as installation  training  data conversions and post contract support and maintenance pcs services  and various appraisal services 
the company recognizes revenue for contracts with multiple element software arrangements in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended 
the company allocates the total arrangement fee among each deliverable based on the relative fair value of each of the deliverables  determined based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe 
when discounts are offered in a software arrangement  the company utilizes the residual method  as defined in sop  and allocates revenue to the undelivered elements based on vsoe 
the discount and remaining revenue are allocated to the delivered elements  which typically encompass the software  service and hardware components of the contract 
certain of the company s software arrangements involve off the shelf software and services that are not considered essential to the functionality of the software 
for these arrangements  software revenue is recognized when the installation has occurred  customer acceptance is reasonably assured  the sales price represents an enforceable claim and is probable of collection  and the remaining services such as training and installation are considered nominal 
fees allocable to services under these arrangements are recognized as revenue as the services are performed 
revenue related to sales of computer hardware and supplies is recognized when title passes  which is normally the shipping or installation date 
pcs includes telephone support  bug fixes  enhancements and rights to upgrades on a when and if available basis 
these support fees are typically billed in advance on a monthly  quarterly or annual basis and are recognized as revenue ratably over the related contract periods 
billings for future services  as reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets  includes pcs and other services that have been billed to the customer in advance of performance 
it also includes customer deposits on new contracts and other progress billings for software and hardware that have not been completely installed 
for arrangements that include customization or modification of the software  or where software services are otherwise considered essential  or for real estate appraisal projects  revenue is recognized using contract accounting 
revenue from these arrangements is recognized using the percentage of completion method with progress to completion measured based primarily upon labor hours incurred or units completed 
revenue earned is based on the progress to completion percentage after giving effect to the most recent estimates of total cost 
changes to total estimated contract costs  if any  are recognized in the period they are determined 
provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined 
as of april  and  the reserves for contract losses  as well as billed retainages outstanding associated with revenue that has been recognized  was not material 
the company reflects revenues earned in excess of billings and retainages as well as billings in excess of revenues for contracts in process at the end of the reporting period in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
reserves against accounts receivable and reserves against revenues in excess of billings and retainages are established based on the company s collection history and other known risks associated with the related contracts 
these reserves contain a general provision of  as well as a specific provision for accounts the company believes will be difficult to collect 
because of the nature of its customers  which are predominantly governmental entities  the company does not generally incur losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
alternatively  customers may become dissatisfied with the functionality of the software products and or the quality of the services provided and request a reduction to the aggregate contract price 
management reviews on a quarterly basis significant past due accounts receivable and the related adequacy of the company s reserves 
the company s contracts do not typically contain a right of return 
accordingly  as of april  and  the reserve for returns was not material 
notes receivable result from certain software contracts in which customers pay for the application software  hardware or related services over an extended period of time  generally three to five years 
interest on these notes range from to 
the company recognizes revenue for these contracts when the related elements are delivered  as the contract terms are fixed and determinable  and the company has a longstanding history of collecting on the notes under the original payment terms without providing concessions 
certain of the company s contracts with customers include lease terms which meet the criteria of sales type leases as defined by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for leases 
however  the company s leasing activities are not a material part of its business activities and  accordingly  are not broken out separately in the consolidated condensed financial statements 
the company has approximately million of goodwill recorded as of april  related to prior acquisitions 
a new accounting standard adopted in fiscal  requires that goodwill be reviewed for impairment at least annually and as indicators of impairment occur 
the annual evaluation of goodwill impairment requires the use of estimates about the future cash flows of each reporting unit to determine estimated fair values 
changes in forecasted operations and changes in discount rates can materially affect these estimates 
the company capitalizes software development costs incurred subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility on a specific software project 
this intangible asset is amortized over an estimated useful life of not greater than three years 
the unamortized balance of capitalized software is reviewed for impairment annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable by calculating the net realizable value for each respective product 
the net realizable value is the estimated future gross revenues from a product reduced by the estimated future costs of completing and disposing of that product 
changes in forecasted operations  driven primarily by market trends and customer demand  can materially affect the estimates of net realizable value 
results of operations fiscal year compared to fiscal year the company s business is focused on providing software and services to enable local governments to completely  fairly and efficiently apply the property tax burden to its citizens 
the company s software manages the entire property life cycle  which includes deed recording  mapping  appraisal  tax billing and collection  tax sales and e government 
the company s revenues are generated from software license fees  hardware sales  forms and supplies sales  and various related professional services  such as software support  data conversions  installation  training  project management  hardware maintenance  forms processing and printing 
the company s revenues are also generated from appraisal services  which include mass real estate appraisals  revaluations and other appraisal related consultative work 
for simplicity purposes  many of the numbers described below are rounded  however  the percentage variations are based upon the actual amounts  which can be found elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
total net revenues for the three months ended april   of million increased by compared to the million that was reported for the three months ended april  more importantly  fourth quarter revenues are more than higher than the quarterly revenues that were reported for each of the first three quarters of fiscal this anticipated improvement resulted from additional software license fees and related service revenues driven by the increased implementation activity in florida 
for the three months ended april   software license fees and professional services revenues increased to million from million for the prior year fourth quarter 
as noted in previous reports  the company had been extending significant resources and attention in fiscal toward the development and implementation of its florida tax product  which was being used in six beta counties 
this product became available for general release in march as a result  approximately million of the million of backlog reported as of january   was recognized in the fourth quarter 
total net revenues of million for the year ended april   decreased by  compared to million for the year ended april  a number of factors which have affected revenue during fiscal are as follows first  the sale of the financial product line on may  see note resulted in a  and million reduction in net revenues for the three months and year ended april   respectively 
the company only reported approximately  of revenues related to this product line for the fourth quarter and  for the entire fiscal year compared to approximately  and million from this product line for the prior year comparable periods 
second  hardware sales for the three months and year ended april   were approximately  and  lower than the respective prior year periods 
these decreases are primary due to a change in the company s strategic direction in the last five years 
the company historically sold more hardware as a value added reseller for large computer manufacturers  but is now focusing on providing innovative software and services 
while the company still offers hardware to those clients seeking a total solution from one provider  hardware sales should continue to decrease as customers view it as a commodity item  with low gross margins 
third  as noted in previous reports  software license fees and related service revenues can vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to the timing of sales and the related implementations 
these revenues for the year ended april   decreased by to million from million for the prior year 
this decrease was primarily because of the slower than anticipated execution of the backlog in florida during the company s first three quarters of fiscal in addition  the prior year included a significant amount of license fees and professional services revenue from cuyahoga county cleveland  ohio related to its tax implementation that went live in december of the company expected to build off of this momentum during fiscal  however  sales in ohio  as well as other regions throughout the country have been softer than anticipated 
hamilton county cincinnati  ohio did go live on the company s new tax and appraisal system in december of  which has resulted in positive momentum for ohio 
for example  five additional counties signed contracts since september for this software for approximately million and several others are in the sales pipeline 
the company did recognize approximately million of revenues during the second half of fiscal related to its recently announced new government revenue management contract with gwinnett county  georgia  which offset a portion of the decreases noted above 
lengthy sales cycles in local government caused in part by increased competition and budget constraints being felt nationwide have resulted in a lower volume of new contract signings than anticipated 
this has negatively impacted the company s revenues 
in addition  national election years have historically been soft  as far as sales are concerned  since many governmental officials are preoccupied with the election process and delay spending until the results are known 
until recently  the majority of the company s investments have primarily been focused on new product development 
the company is now aggressively investing in sales and marketing efforts to build off of its successful implementations and extend its software and services into new markets 
marty ulanski was hired as the company s executive vice president of sales and business development in july this is a new position for the company and his role is to build a sales team that will drive significant rev enue 
in addition  early stephens  the company s chief technology officer was recently appointed to the role of chief marketing officer in support of this effort 
this also is a new position for the company 
while building a more effective sales and marketing team is a long term effort  these investments are starting to pay off 
for example  the company did announce on november   the award of an additional million of new tax and appraisal business to three existing and two new clients 
in addition  total sales or signed contracts for fiscal were million versus million for fiscal  which is a improvement 
included in these amounts is a million increase or improvement in sales of software and related services 
this increase was offset by a million decrease in appraisal services contracts and a  decrease in hardware sales 
the million in new contracts has resulted in an increase in the company s backlog to million as of april  the backlog as of april  and was million and million  respectively 
these backlog amounts are exclusive of the company s recurring revenues which are approximately million annually 
while recurring revenue has declined in absolute terms year over year due to the sale of the company s financials product line  excluding the impact of this sale  recurring revenue actually increased by approximately million for the year  compared to the prior year period 
the improvements in recurring revenue are due to price increases and the addition of new clients 
of the million of total sales for fiscal noted above  have been to new clients 
new recurring support revenues are billed once the related implementations are complete 
these new clients are also resulting in an increase in market share for the company 
the final factor affecting revenues is appraisal service revenues  which decreased by to million for the three months ended april   versus million for the prior year and increased by to million for the year ended april   compared to million for the prior year 
appraisal service revenues for the year ended april   included  of revenue associated with the settlement of the allegheny lawsuit noted below 
the remaining increase in appraisal service revenues is due to the execution of additional appraisal business  which is primarily due to the cyclicality of this business in ohio 
on january   the company settled its lawsuit with allegheny county for approximately  in cash and a mutual release of all claims related to this project 
as noted in prior years  the company had not recognized the uncollected retainage revenue related to the allegheny county project  which was  in addition  the company had fully reserved within its allowance for uncollectible accounts the remaining amounts that were owed by allegheny county 
accordingly  this settlement resulted in the recognition of  of revenue and a reduction of operating expenses of  during the company s third quarter 
cost of revenues decreased by to million for the quarter ended april   versus million for the prior year 
for the year ended april   cost of revenues decreased by to million from million for fiscal both of these decreases are primarily related to a shift in the company s revenue mix 
gross margins increased by from to for the fourth quarter and by from to for the year versus the respective periods in the prior year 
the significant improvement in the fourth quarter was driven by the recognition of more application license fees associated primarily with the company s florida tax product 
in addition  the continued execution on some of the company s larger projects  including baltimore  maryland  jefferson county  alabama and gwinnett county  georgia contributed to this increase 
the company recognized million in application license fees for the quarter ended april   compared to million for the quarter ended april  application license fees were million for the year ended april   compared to million for fiscal since there is nominal variable cost associated with the company s application license fees  changes in this revenue stream have a significant impact on the company s gross margin s 
total cost of revenues for fiscal also includes the impact of the allegheny lawsuit  noted above  which resulted in  of revenue with no related cost during the company s third quarter 
selling  general and administrative expenses have increased by approximately to million for the three months ended april   versus million for the prior year fourth quarter 
however  these expenses decreased by to million for the year ended april   compared to million for the year ended april  the increase in the fourth quarter was primarily driven by three factors 
first  the company expensed approximately  associated with severance agreements 
second  sales commission expense for the fourth quarter of fiscal was approximately  higher than the prior year comparable quarter due to an increase in contract signings 
finally  non project related travel increased by approximately  primarily because of new sales opportunities and development activities 
as a result of the factors noted above  operating income for the three months ended april   increased by  to million from  in the prior year fourth quarter 
operating income for the entire year increased by  to million versus million for the prior year 
as more fully described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  the company recorded a gain of million on the sale of its financial product line during the quarter ended july  an additional gain of  was recognized during the quarter ended january   due to the collection of the final holdback on this transaction in december other income for the year ended april   increased by to  versus the comparable prior year period 
this increase is primarily due to additional interest income earned on the company s cash balances 
in addition  beginning in december of  the company began leasing a portion of the building it acquired in portage  michigan  adjacent to its corporate headquarters 
the company s provision for income taxes generally fluctuates with the level of pretax income 
the effective tax rate was for the quarter ended april   compared to for the prior year fourth quarter 
this increase is primarily due to the inclusion of state tax expense for the quarter within the income tax provision 
the effective tax rate for the year ended april   is compared to for the year ended april  while the effective rates appear comparable year over year  the current year rate did increase as a result of the inclusion of state taxes  but was offset by a decrease in tax reserves and recognition of deferred tax assets 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further details 
the company anticipates the effective tax rate for fiscal to be in the range of to 
net income increased by to  or per diluted share for the quarter ended april   versus net income of  or per diluted share for the quarter ended april  for the year ended april   net income was million or per diluted share  compared to million or per diluted share for the prior year 
approximately million or per diluted share of this increase related to the gain on the sale of the financial product line described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
diluted weighted average outstanding common shares increased from million shares to million shares for the year and from million shares to million shares for the fourth quarter versus the comparable periods in fiscal these increases are due primarily to two factors 
first  the company s average stock price increased to for fiscal from for fiscal this caused substantially all of the company s outstanding options to be included in the diluted eps base 
second  the company issued  shares of stock associated with the proval acquisition during the first quarter of fiscal this was the final payment under the contingent stock post merger agreement 
results of operations fiscal year compared to fiscal year under the provisions of sfas no 
 the company has historically disclosed financial information for two reportable segments software systems and services and appraisal services 
due to internal reorganizations during fiscal and the fact that appraisal services are tightly integrated with software systems and services  the company has concluded under the provisions of sfas no 
that its entire operations now meet the definition of a single segment 
since the company did report financial information for two segments during fiscal and  there are multiple references to these segments in the paragraphs that follow 
total net revenues of million and million for the three months and year ended april   were approximately and lower than the net revenues of million and million that were reported for the three months and year ended april   respectively 
software systems and services segment revenues were comparable at approximately million and million for the three months ended april  and  respectively 
software systems and services segment revenues increased by approximately to million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal these revenues included software license fees  hardware sales  forms and supply sales and various professional services  such as software support  data conversions  installation  training  project management  hardware maintenance  forms processing and printing 
the year over year increase was primarily due to growth in professional services revenues of million and recurring support revenues of million over the fiscal results 
the increase in professional services revenue was due to the execution of a number of new mvp tax and proval contracts in indiana and the southeast region during fiscal  as well as continued progress on the larger mvp tax projects in cuyahoga county  ohio  dauphin county  pennsylvania  baltimore  maryland and jefferson county  alabama 
mvp tax was being utilized by counties in four states and was in the process of being implemented in three additional states during fiscal the increase in recurring support revenues was due to a number of new software installations and annual price increases 
recurring support  maintenance and printing services represented approximately  or million  of this segment s annual revenue 
software license fees of million for fiscal  which represented approximately of this segment s annual revenue were approximately lower than the million recognized in fiscal this decline was due to the down economy and a few of the company s larger development projects taking longer to complete than initially anticipated 
appraisal services segment revenues  which included fees for mass real estate appraisals or revaluations  decreased by to million for the three months ended april  and by to million for fiscal these anticipated decreases were the result of the cyclical nature of this segment s business activities 
the company s largest market for these services  ohio  uses a six year cycle for revaluations 
revenues from this segment are expected to increase in fiscal  because of the growth in backlog 
the company s backlog for appraisal services at april   of million was significantly higher than the million reported at april  while the company continued to actively pursue new appraisal service contracts  efforts were being primarily focused on its traditional markets in ohio  indiana and pennsylvania where the company had historically been more successful in executing profitable contracts 
as noted in prior years  the company reserved of the retainage revenue related to the allegheny county appraisal project and a portion of the gross under billed position associated with appraisal contracts recognized based on percentage of completion accounting  which historically approximated of the gross under billed amount 
this reserve contained a general provision of of the gross under billed position as well as a specific provision for accounts the company believed would be difficult to collect 
this reserve methodology was consistent with the methodology utilized in calculating the company s allowance for doubtful accounts related to its accounts receivable 
as of april  and  the total reserve against retainage revenue remaining under all appraisal service projects including allegheny was approximately  and  respectively 
the total reserve against retainage revenue under the allegheny county project was approximately  at both april  and the company continued to believe it was appropriate to reserve of the remaining unpaid allegheny retention as well as certain other monies due for the performance of additional services in connection with that contract  because certain officials of allegheny county continued to contest the payment of such amounts 
the ultimate collection of these monies was pending an order from the judge who initially ordered the reassessment  which was expected to be issued by the end of calendar cost of revenues of million for the three months ended april   decreased by compared to million for the three months ended april  annual cost of revenues decreased by from million in fiscal to million for the year ended april  these decreases were primarily due to a shift in the mix of revenues and costs generated by the company s two reportable segments  as well as the decrease in net revenues for fiscal gross margins were and for the three and twelve months ended april   respectively  compared to and for the prior year comparable periods 
the software systems and services segment typically yielded a higher gross margin than the appraisal services segment  which is highly labor intensive 
gross margins for the software systems and services segment were approximately for the three months and year ended april  and since this segment accounted for a larger portion of the overall revenues and related costs  the combined margins were better than those that were reported for the fiscal comparable periods 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by approximately  or to million for the three months ended april   and increased by approximately  or to million for the fiscal year ended april  versus the comparable periods in fiscal the annual increase was primarily due to the company s continued investment in its software products  which was an integral component of the company s growth strategy 
research and development costs of approximately million and million were included in selling  general and administrative expense for the three months and year ended april   respectively as compared to  and million for the three months and year ended april  these increases were primarily due to increased development activities associated with the mvp tax and internet products and the increased utilization of outsourced third party developers in fiscal versus fiscal th e company also incurred approximately  of bad debt expense during fiscal primarily to reserve for the remaining east coast exposure associated with the appraisal services segment 
these increases were offset by the discontinuance of goodwill amortization expenses due to the implementation of sfas no 
this expense was included in selling  general and administrative expense for fiscal the effect of discontinuing the amortization of goodwill also benefited net income for the three months ended april   by approximately  or 
per diluted share and net income for fiscal by  or 
per diluted share 
as a result of the factors noted above  the company reported substantial improvements in its operating income for the three months and year ended april  operating income increased by approximately  to  for the three months and million to million for the fiscal year ended april  net other income for the three months and year ended april   increased by approximately  and  over the comparable fiscal amounts to approximately  and  respectively 
the improvement in net other income for both the three months and year ended april   was due to increased interest income associated with the company s growing cash balances as well as rental income generated from leasing back half of the building acquired during fiscal in portage  michigan to the prior owner 
the company s provision for federal income taxes generally fluctuates with the level of pretax income 
the effective tax rates for the three months and year ended april  were approximately equal to the statutory rate  which was 
the fiscal effective rate was substantially lower than the fiscal rate because of the implementation of sfas no 
sfas no 
eliminated goodwill amortization expense  which was primarily non deductible for tax purposes 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further details 
net income was approximately  or 
per diluted share for the three months ended april   versus net income of approximately  or 
per diluted share for the three months ended april  net income for fiscal was million or 
per diluted share compared to net income of approximately million or 
per diluted share for fiscal diluted weighted average outstanding common shares increased by  shares for the three months and  shares for the year ended april   versus the comparable fiscal periods 
these increases were due to the issuance of stock associated with the company s employee stock purchase plan  the issuance of stock associated with the proval merger and the inclusion of additional shares within the diluted weighted average base as fewer options were under water than in the comparable periods in fiscal these increases were partially offset by the repurchase of  shares of common stock by the company during fiscal in accordance with its previously announced repurchase program 
quarterly results the following table sets forth selected unaudited quarterly financial data for the last eight quarters fiscal fiscal for the quarter ended april  january  october  july  april  january  october  july  net revenues gross profit income from operations net income basic earnings per share diluted earnings per share at quarter end cash and short term investments total assets shareholders equity book value per share financial condition and liquidity working capital of million at april   has increased by compared to the million that was reported at april  these levels reflect current ratios of and  respectively 
the improvement in both working capital and the current ratio is primarily due to the proceeds resulting from the sale of the financial product line and the execution and related recognition of deferred revenue associated with the company s backlog  particularly in the florida market during fiscal shareholders equity at april   increased by million to million from the balance reported at april  this was due to million of net income   of employee stock purchases  as well as the associated tax benefit from option exercises  and  of deferred compensation expense 
these increases were offset by  of company stock repurchases 
as a result  book value per share increased to as of april   from at april  book value per share was calculated by dividing total shareholders equity by the sum of total shares outstanding and total shares pending issuance at the respective year ends 
the nature of the company s business is generally not property or equipment intensive 
net capital expenditures declined by approximately  to approximately  for the year ended april   in comparison to million of capital expenditures for the year ended april  the prior year amount included a non recurring expenditure associated with the acquisition of a  square foot building that adjoins the company s current corporate facility in portage  michigan 
the company paid  in cash for the building in addition to  for related improvements 
the company is leasing back approximately of this additional space to the prior owner for years and plans to use  square feet of the space for growth 
the remaining  square feet is available for rent until it is needed by the company 
prior year expenditures also included approximately  for renovations  furniture and fixtures associated with the relocation of th e company s canton  springfield and dayton  ohio offices  and the expansion of the tampa  florida office 
the company s dayton and springfield offices were consolidated into one new office in beavercreek  ohio 
the remaining fiscal expenditures  as well as the fiscal expenditures primarily relate to purchases or upgrades of computer hardware and software used by the company s development and support personnel 
the company continues to invest significantly in its products 
the company s research and development expenditures charged to expense were million and million for the fourth quarter and year ended april   compared to million and million for the respective prior year periods 
these amounts include the annual amortization expense associated with software capitalized in prior periods 
in addition  the company capitalized approximately  and million of development cost for the fourth quarter and year ended april   compared to  and million for the respective prior year comparable periods 
since the company s revenues are generated from contracts with local governmental entities  it is not uncommon for certain of its accounts receivable to remain outstanding for approximately three to four months  thereby having a negative impact upon cash flow 
the company currently has a secured line of credit agreement with comerica bank at the prime rate of interest less  up to a maximum of million 
borrowings under this agreement are contingent on meeting certain funded debt to ebitda levels 
as of april   the company was eligible for the full million  but had no borrowings outstanding under its line of credit 
the company anticipates that the line of credit  together with existing cash and short term investments of approximately million  and cash generated from future operations  will be sufficient for the company to meet its working capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
on october   the board of directors authorized the company to repurchase up to  of its common stock over the next months 
this was essentially a renewal of the expired one year repurchase program  which had been approved on october  the company has not repurchased any shares under the program as of the date of this report 
since october   the company repurchased a total of  shares of common stock for approximately  under the program 
the board of directors approved the manatron  inc supplemental executive retirement plan the plan effective january   for certain executive officers and employees of the company 
under this nonqualified plan  the company is obligated to contribute of a participants annual cash compensation to a rabbi trust on behalf of the participants for a period of ten years 
this is a fully funded play whereby each annual contribution vests evenly over a three year period 
participants may also elect to make pre tax contributions to the trust 
payments will begin on january st following the later of i a participant s termination of employment  or ii the participant s th birthday 
the total amount charged to expense in fiscal and was approximately  and  respectively 
as of april  and  the total value of vested participant contributions was approximately  and  respectively 
the following table lists the company s significant contractual obligations as of april  the company has the following payments under contractual obligations due by period total less than year years years more than years operating leases total the operating leases reported in this table are also reported in the immediately following section entitled off balance sheet arrangements 
off balance sheet arrangements the company has no significant off balance sheet transactions other than operating leases for real estate 
it also is not the company s policy to issue guarantees to third parties 
the company s future contractual obligations for operating leases with initial terms greater than one year are summarized as follows for the next five fiscal years ended april the company cannot precisely determine the effect of inflation on its business 
the company continues  however  to experience relatively stable costs for its inventory and equipment as the computer hardware market is very competitive 
the company anticipates that inflationary price increases related to labor and overhead will have a negative effect on cash flow and net income to the extent that the increases cannot be offset through improved productivity and price increases

potential negative side effects stemming from the company s expansion into new regional markets  including canada as a result of this expansion  the company may face unanticipated pitfalls 
pricing and availability of equipment  materials  inventories and programming 
changes in existing computer software and service industry laws or the introduction of new laws  regulations or policies that could affect the company s business practices  including  by way of example  intellectual property laws and laws affecting software providers liability these laws  regulations or policies could impact the computer software and service industry as a whole  or could impact only those portions of the computer software and service industry in which the company is currently active  for example  privacy laws regulating how governmental units store and provide access to information  in either case  the company s profitability could be injured due to an industry wide market decline or due to the company s inability to compete with other computer software and service industry companies that are unaffected by these laws  regulations or policies
