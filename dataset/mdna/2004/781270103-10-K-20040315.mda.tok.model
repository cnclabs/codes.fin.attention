item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a worldwide leader in the design  development  manufacture and support of process control metrology systems used in semiconductor device manufacturing 
our thin film measurement proprietary systems measure the thickness and other properties of thin films applied during various steps in the manufacture of integrated circuits  enabling semiconductor device manufacturers to improve yields and reduce overall production costs 
our macro defect inspection proprietary systems detect and classify defects in semiconductor wafers 
we provide our customers with a flexible full fab metrology solution by offering families of systems that meet their transparent and opaque thin film measurement and macro defect inspection needs in various applications across the fabrication process 
our three primary families of metrology solutions offer leading edge metrology technology  flexible systems cost effectively designed for specific manufacturing applications and a common production worthy automation platform  all backed by worldwide support 
our business is affected by the annual spending patterns of our customers on semiconductor capital equipment 
the amount that our customers devote to capital equipment spending depends on a number of factors including  general worldwide economic conditions as well as other economic drivers such as personal computer and cell phone sales 
after several years of reduced capital spending by semiconductor device manufacturers  current forecasts by industry analysts for the semiconductor device manufacturing industry project a year over year increase in capital spending of over for the company monitors capital equipment spending through announced capital spending plans by our customers and monthly published industry data such as the book to bill ratio 
the book to bill ratio is a month running statistic that compares bookings or orders placed with capital equipment suppliers to billings or shipments 
a book to bill above one shows that equipment manufacturers are ordering equipment at a pace that exceeds the equipment suppliers shipments for the period 
historically  a significant portion of our revenues in each quarter and year has been derived from sales to relatively few end user customers  and we expect this trend to continue 
in  and sales to end user customers that individually represented at least five percent of our revenues accounted for  and of our revenues 
in  and sales to intel accounted for  and of our revenues 
we do not have purchase contracts with any of our customers or distributors that obligate them to continue to purchase our products  and they could cease purchasing products from us at any time 
a delay in purchase or cancellation by any of our large customers could cause quarterly revenues to vary significantly 
in addition  during a given quarter  a significant portion of our revenues may be derived from the sale of a relatively small number of systems 
our transparent film measurement systems range in average selling price from approximately  to million per system  our opaque film measurement systems range in average selling price from approximately  to million per system and our macro defect inspection systems range in average selling price from approximately  to million per system 
accordingly  a small change in the 
table of contents number of systems we sell may also cause significant changes in our operating results 
because fluctuations in the timing of orders from our major customers or distributors or in the number of our individual systems we sell could cause our revenues to fluctuate significantly in any given quarter or year  we do not believe that period to period comparisons of our financial results are necessarily meaningful  and they should not be relied upon as an indication of our future performance 
a significant portion of our revenues has been derived from customers outside of the united states  and we expect this trend to continue 
in  approximately of our revenues were derived from customers outside of the united states  of which were derived from customers in asia and were derived from customers in europe 
in  approximately of our revenues were derived from customers outside of the united states  of which were derived from customers in asia and were derived from customers in europe 
in  approximately of our revenues were derived from customers outside of the united states  of which were derived from customers in asia and were derived from customers in europe 
substantially all of our revenues to date have been denominated in united states dollars 
the sales cycle for our systems typically ranges from six to months  and can be longer when our customers are evaluating new technology 
due to the length of these cycles  we invest significantly in research and development and sales and marketing in advance of generating revenues related to these investments 
additionally  the rate and timing of customer orders may vary significantly from month to month 
accordingly  if sales of our products do not occur when we expect  and we are unable to adjust our estimates on a timely basis  our expenses and inventory levels may increase relative to revenues and total assets 
on september   we acquired isoa  inc  which is doing business as the yield metrology group ymg 
ymg had licensed its technology for use in the semiconductor industry and began transitioning to a semiconductor capital equipment supplier 
ymg s core technologies are knowledge based algorithms used in wafer macro defect detection and classification 
the purchase consideration for ymg  including direct acquisition costs  was million in cash 
the transaction was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting for business combinations 
results of operations of ymg have been included since september  and will affect comparisons from year to year 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  our statements of income data as percentages of our revenues 
our results of operations are reported as one reportable business segment 
year ended december  revenues cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses research and development in process research and development selling  general and administrative amortization total operating expenses operating income loss interest income and other  net income loss before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net income loss 
table of contents results of operations  and revenues 
our revenues are derived from the sale of our systems  services  spare parts and licensing 
our revenues were million  million and million in the years  and these changes represent a decrease of from to and an increase of from to our revenue remained relatively weak throughout our revenue began to grow sequentially in the third quarter this year  but increased only slightly for the year compared to total revenue in the semiconductor device manufacturing sector continues to be impacted by a severe downturn that began in fiscal although there has been recent sequential improvements in the business environment  there is uncertainty as to the strength and length of the next cyclical growth phase in our industry 
until such time as we return to a period of sustainable growth and due to continued low visibility in our projected sales  we maintain a cautious outlook for future orders and sales levels 
the following table lists the different sources of our revenue revenue type of revenue of revenue of revenue systems parts services licensing total revenue systems revenue has declined as a percentage of revenue from through as a result of the prolonged semiconductor industry downturn 
conversely  parts and service revenue has increased over the same period as customers spend more on repair and maintenance of their existing equipment 
when the industry recovers  we expect systems revenues to increase and parts and service revenues to decrease as customers buy new equipment 
licensing revenue is derived from contracts obtained as a result of the acquisition of our yield metrology group in september licensing our technologies is not part of our core business strategy 
therefore  as these contracts expire  we expect licensing revenue to decline 
revenues from customers outside of the united states represented  and of our revenues in  and we expect that revenues generated from customers outside of the united states will continue to account for a significant percentage of our revenues 
gross profit 
our gross profit has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors  including manufacturing efficiencies  excess and obsolete inventory write offs  pricing by competitors or suppliers  new product introductions  product sales mix  production volume  customization and reconfiguration of systems  international and domestic sales mix  and field service margins 
our gross profit was million  million and million in  and our gross profit represented  and of our revenues in  and the decrease in gross profit from to was primarily due to a decrease in business volume resulting from the downturn in the industry 
this resulted in customer support and fixed manufacturing costs being a higher component of a lower revenue base 
the slight increase in gross profit from to was primarily due to a full year of licensing revenues  partially offset by an increase in parts and service revenue  which typically have lower margins than our systems 
research and development 
the thin film transparent  opaque process control and macro defect inspection metrology market is characterized by continuous technological development and product innovations 
we believe that the rapid and ongoing development of new products and enhancements to existing products  including the transition to copper and low k dielectrics  the progression to mm wafers  the continuous shrinkage in critical dimensions  and the evolution of ultra thin gate process control  is critical to our success 
accordingly  we devote a significant portion of our technical  management and financial resources to research and development programs 
research and development expenditures consist primarily of salaries and related expenses of employees engaged in research  design and development activities 
they also include consulting 
table of contents fees  prototype equipment expenses and the cost of related supplies 
our research and development expenditures were million  million and million in  and research and development expenditures represented  and of revenues in  and the increase in research and development expenses from to resulted from the engineering team acquired from ymg being included for the full year of partially offset by cost reduction initiatives 
we anticipate research and development expense will be a similar percentage of revenue for the near term and increase in absolute dollars due to increased salary expense  elimination of plant shut downs and additional project costs 
in process research and development 
the acquisition of ymg resulted in our recording of a one time expense of million in for the write off of in process research and development iprd 
the iprd we acquired related to automated defect inspection technology to be used in stand alone and integrated metrology equipment 
at the time of the acquisition  we determined that the iprd had not reached technological feasibility and that it did not have an alternative future use 
accordingly  this amount was immediately expensed in the consolidated statement of operations upon the acquisition date 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expense is primarily comprised of salaries and related costs for sales  marketing  and general administrative personnel  as well as commissions  and other non personnel related expenses 
our selling  general and administrative expense was million  million and million in  and selling  general and administrative expense represented  and of revenues in  and the decreases from through resulted from the completion of certain infrastructure projects in prior periods and cost reduction initiatives that were implemented as a result of the semiconductor industry slowdown 
interest income and other  net 
interest income and other  net was million  million and million in  and the decrease from through resulted from lower interest rates and the use of cash in the acquisition of ymg as described further in note to the consolidated financial statements 
provision benefit for income taxes 
we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes prescribed by the financial accounting standards board fasb in statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
our provision for income taxes was million  million and million in  and our effective tax rate was  and in  and  respectively 
we computed our effective tax rate for through on prevailing federal and state rates adjusted for research and development tax credits and income derived from tax exempt interest 
our effective tax rate for also reflects the non deductibility of the iprd charge for tax purposes 
liquidity and capital resources at december  our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaled million  while working capital amounted to million 
at december   we had million of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and million in working capital 
at december  we had million of cash and cash equivalents and million in working capital 
typically during periods of revenue growth  changes in accounts receivable and inventories represent a use of cash as we incur costs and expend cash in advance of receiving cash from our customers 
similarly  during periods of declining revenue  changes in accounts receivable and inventories represent a source of cash as inventory purchases decline and revenue from prior periods is collected 
because of the lack of visibility in projected sales for  we are uncertain as to the level of expected cash from operating activities in  if any 
cash provided by operating activities in  and was million  million and million  respectively 
net cash provided by operating activities in was primarily due to net income combined with a decrease in accounts receivable 
the net cash provided by operating activities during was primarily a result of increases in deferred revenue of million  accrued liabilities of million  profit before depreciation  amortization and the write off of iprd of million  partially offset by an increase in inventories of million and an increase in accounts receivable of million 
cash provided by operating activities was positive in primarily due to net income of million combined with a decrease in accounts receivable of 
table of contents approximately million  and a decrease in inventories of million 
cash provided from operating activities during was negatively affected by a decrease in accounts payable and other liabilities and a decrease in deferred revenue 
net cash used in investing activities was million  million and million in  and from time to time we evaluate whether to acquire new and complementary businesses  products and technologies  and we therefore could apply cash for investing activities in to consummate any such potential acquisition 
capital expenditures for were primarily used for renovations to our corporate facility and upgrades to existing computer systems 
net cash used in investing activities for included the acquisition of ymg  net of cash acquired  of million  net purchases of short term investments of million and capital expenditures of million 
in  net cash used in investing activities included net purchases of short term investments of million and capital expenditures of million 
capital expenditures over the next twelve months are expected to be approximately to million 
net cash provided by financing activities was million  million and million in  and in february  we completed the follow on public offering of  shares of our common stock at per share 
net proceeds to us after the underwriting discount and other fees amounted to million 
in addition  we received cash proceeds of million from stock option exercises and participation in our employee stock purchase plan 
net cash provided by financing activities in was a result of proceeds received from sales of shares  including sales of shares through employee stock plans and proceeds received from a director of the company in connection with his sale of the company s stock 
in  net cash provided by financing activities was a result of proceeds received from sales of shares through employee stock plans 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the timing and amount of our revenues and our investment decisions  which will affect our ability to generate additional cash 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for working capital  capital expenditures  and research and development activities for the foreseeable future 
thereafter  if cash generated from operations and financing activities is insufficient to satisfy our working capital requirements  we may seek additional funding through bank borrowings  sales of securities or other means 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise any such capital on terms acceptable to us or at all 
contractual obligations the following is a summary of our contractual obligations at december  payments due by period total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations open and committed purchase orders total off balance sheet arrangements the company does not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition  results from operations or liquidity and capital resources 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
we review the accounting policies we use in reporting our financial results on a regular basis 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent 
table of contents assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  accounts receivable  inventories  intangible assets  income taxes and warranty obligations 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
results may differ from these estimates due to actual outcomes being different from those on which we based our assumptions 
these estimates and judgments are reviewed by management on an ongoing basis  and by the audit committee at the end of each quarter prior to the public release of our financial results 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
revenue is recognized upon shipment provided that there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
certain sales of our products are sold and accounted for as multiple element arrangements  consisting primarily of the sale of the product  installation and training services 
we generally recognize product revenue upon delivery 
when customer acceptance is subjective and not obtained prior to shipment  we defer product revenue until such time as positive affirmation of acceptance has been obtained from the customer 
customer acceptance is generally based on our products meeting published performance specifications 
the amount of revenue allocated to the shipment of products is done on a residual method basis 
under this method  the total arrangement value is allocated first to undelivered contract elements  based on their fair values  with the remainder being allocated to product revenue 
the fair value of installation and training services is based upon billable hourly rates and the estimated time to complete the service 
revenue related to undelivered installation services is deferred until such time as installation is completed at the customer s site 
revenue related to training services is recognized ratably over the training period 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we specifically analyze accounts receivable and analyze historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
if the financial condition of our customers was to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments or our assumptions are otherwise incorrect  additional allowances may be required 
excess and obsolete inventory 
we write down our excess and obsolete inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future product life cycles  product demand and market conditions 
if actual product life cycles  product demand and market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
long lived assets and acquired intangible assets 
the company periodically reviews long lived assets  other than goodwill  for impairment whenever changes in events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
goodwill  in accordance with sfas no 
 is reviewed for possible impairment at least annually during the fourth quarter for each year 
a review of goodwill may be initiated prior to conducting the annual analysis if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired 
assumptions and estimates used in the determination of impairment losses  such as future cash flows and disposition costs  may affect the carrying value of long lived assets and the impairment of such long lived assets  if any  could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
warranties 
we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
while we engage in product quality programs and processes  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our actual current tax exposure together with our temporary differences resulting from 
table of contents differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets 
at december   we had no valuation allowance established against our deferred tax assets 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred taxes will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to establish a valuation allowance  which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
impact of recent accounting pronouncements in november  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
this issue addresses determination of whether an arrangement involving more than one deliverable contains more than one unit of accounting and how arrangement consideration should be measured and allocated to the separate units of accounting 
eitf issue no 
is effective for revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  the adoption of eitf issue no 
did not have a material impact on our consolidated operating results and financial position 
in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin arb no 
fin was revised in december and clarifies the application of arb no 
to certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support 
the application of fin may require that an entity be subject to consolidation even though the investor does not have a controlling financial interest that  under arb no 
 was usually deemed to exist through ownership of a majority voting interest 
fin  as revised  is generally effective for all entities subject to the interpretation no later than the end of the first reporting period that ends after march  we currently have no investments in entities within the scope of fin and as a result do not believe its application will have a material effect on our consolidated operating results and financial position 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement amends sfas no 
to provide clarification on the financial accounting and reporting of derivative instruments and hedging activities and requires contracts with similar characteristics to be accounted for on a comparable basis 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not have an impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity  effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  this statement establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
it requires that an issuer classify a freestanding financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability or an asset in some circumstances 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not have an impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in august  the eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
 applicability of aicpa statement of position  software revenue recognition  to non software deliverables 
this issue focuses solely on whether non software deliverables included in arrangements that contain more than incidental software should be accounted for in accordance with sop the task force confirmed that in an arrangement that contains software that is more than incidental to the products or services as a whole  only the software and software related elements are included within the scope of sop software related elements include software related products and services such as those listed in paragraph of sop  as well as other deliverables for which the 
table of contents software is essential to their functionality 
eitf issue no 
is effective for revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after august  the adoption of this standard had no impact on our consolidated operating results and financial position 
in december  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition  which codifies  revises and rescinds certain sections of sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
sab s primary purpose is to rescind accounting guidance contained in sab related to multiple element revenue arrangements  superseded as a result of the issuance of eitf the changes noted in sab no 
did not have an effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily from our investments in certain available for sale securities 
our available for sale securities consist primarily of fixed income investments us treasury and agency securities and corporate bonds 
we continually monitor our exposure to changes in interest rates and credit ratings of issuers from our available for sale securities 
it is possible that we are at risk if interest rates or credit ratings of issuers change in an unfavorable direction 
the magnitude of any gain or loss will be a function of the difference between the fixed rate of the financial instrument and the market rate and our financial condition and results of operations could be materially affected 
based on sensitivity analysis performed on our financial investments held as of december   an immediate adverse change of in interest rates eg to would result in a million decrease in the fair value of our available for sale securities 
foreign currency risk we do not use foreign currency forward exchange contracts or purchased currency options to hedge local currency cash flows or for trading purposes 
substantially all sales arrangements with international customers are denominated in us dollars 
we have branch operations in taiwan  singapore  china and korea and a wholly owned subsidiary in europe  which are subject to currency fluctuations 
these foreign branches are limited in their operations and level of investment so that the risk of currency fluctuations is not expected to be material
