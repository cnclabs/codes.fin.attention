whereas started out with a million improvement in net income in the first quarter compared to  the first quarter of began with a  loss as sales volume declined by percent 
despite this million decrease in profitability in the first quarter of compared to the same quarter in  the remainder of was nearly comparable to in net income and sales increased by percent

these decreases were partially offset by a reduction in interest expense and selling costs and by the realization of certain income tax benefits 

table of contents consolidated net sales for decreased by million percent to million compared with million in this decrease primarily reflects an overall decline of percent in unit sales 
sales of specialty trailers and transporters decreased by percent as unit sales declined percent with reductions in all product categories except car hauler and utility trailers 
this decline was partially offset by an increase of percent in average net revenue per unit due to a more favorable mix of products with a higher average price and the affect of percent price increases in both and on most trailer models  partially offset by an increase in sales program rebates and discounts in compared to motorcoach segment sales decreased percent as unit sales declined percent 
this reduction in unit sales was partially offset by a percent increase in the average revenue per unit as there were more higher priced units that were sold 
unit sales of new motorcoaches decreased by percent as the result of lower sales of less popular xl models and discontinued featherlite vogue models 
unit sales of used coaches also declined percent in part due to fewer trade ins and reduced new unit sales 
these decreases occurred primarily in the first quarter of compared to when sales were stronger 
consolidated gross profit margin decreased by million to million in from million in as a percentage of sales  consolidated gross profit margin was percent in compared to percent in this overall decline in consolidated gross profit margin reflects the decline in net sales as discussed above  but was also partially attributable to lower percentage margins on trailer sales and reduced percentage margins realized in the motorcoach segment 
trailer margins were percentage points lower in compared to the same period in this was primarily the result of increased material costs attributable to changes in product mix  including increased sales of used units  partially offset by reduced labor and overhead costs due to improved efficiencies resulting from changes in sales volume and product mix 
motorcoach gross profit margins decreased by percentage points as lower margins were realized on sales of new and used units as prices were reduced to sell less popular discontinued models and as the result of the following additional charges a provision of million in to reduce the inventory cost of used coaches to estimated market value compared to a similar provision of  in  a charge of  for the loss on a litigation settlement and additional warranty costs of  on vogue model motorcoaches sold compared to  in consolidated selling and administrative expenses increased by  in to million  a percent increase from million in as a percentage of sales  these expenses increased to percent in from percent in  primarily reflecting the reduced sales volume 
trailer segment expenses decreased by about  percent primarily as a result of reduced legal fees and other administrative expenses 
motorcoach segment expenses decreased by about  percent due mainly to reduced commissions as the result of lower sales and lower advertising and promotion costs 
corporate and other expenses increased by  percent as the result of  increased depreciation on the aircraft and the inclusion of  of fcc s selling and administration expenses in a net restructuring credit of  was realized in this resulted from a favorable lawsuit settlement that cancelled accounts payable in the amount of  included in restructuring charges recorded in and the elimination of the balance of the accrual related to the pryor  oklahoma facility  which was reopened in october as discussed further in note to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
consolidated interest expense decreased by  in compared to as the result of lower average interest rates and borrowing levels in other income  net  increased by  in due mainly to the non recurrence of financial advisory fees related to investigating strategic financing alternatives in partially offset by a reduction in gains on property and equipment sales and royalties received 
minority interest in subsidiary earnings represents the equity interest of the percent owner in fcc

table of contents fiscal year compared to fiscal year on a consolidated basis  the company s net income for the fiscal year ended december   was million or per diluted share  compared with a loss of million  or per diluted share  for the same period in this significant improvement in profitability for the year reflects i the non recurrence in of million in restructuring charges incurred in connection with closing the pryor  oklahoma facility in  ii higher gross profit despite lower sales resulting from improved efficiencies and reduced manufacturing costs  iii reduced selling and administrative costs and lower interest expense  and iv tax benefits received from the realization of deferred tax benefits  as discussed further below 
net consolidated sales decreased by million percent to million in compared with million in as overall unit sales increased by about percent while average revenue per unit sold declined by percent 
this included a percent increase in unit sales of specialty trailers and transporters as increases in horse and livestock sales were offset by declines in the other product categories 
the increase in unit sales was offset by a decline of percent in the average revenue per unit reflecting changes in product mix and an increase in sales program rebates and discounts in compared to there was a percent price increase on most trailer models effective for orders placed after june  there were no price increases in motorcoach segment sales were down percent with a million reduction in sales due to the closing of the pryor  oklahoma facility  in sales of new motorcoaches decreased percent as unit sales declined by percent and sales of used coaches were down percent as unit sales declined percent compared to the average revenue per unit sold also declined by percent as less popular and discontinued models were sold at discounted prices 
if the effect of sales at the pryor  oklahoma facility is excluded from  net consolidated sales for would have remained essentially unchanged and motorcoach segment sales would have increased by less than percent  which the company believes is reflective of a sluggish economy and general economic uncertainties 
consolidated gross profit increased by million to million in from million in as a percentage of sales  gross profit was percent in compared to percent in this improvement in gross profit reflects a million increase as a result of the non recurrence of the restructuring charge included in cost of sales in which reduced the gross margin by percentage points  a million increase as a result of lower charges to reduce the inventory carrying value of new and used motorcoaches in compared to  and improved margins of million realized on sales in the trailer segment 
trailer margins were percentage points higher in due to lower material costs and improved labor and overhead utilization compared to the nashua  iowa plant closure in reduced inefficiencies and resulted in other cost improvements 
motorcoach gross profit margins improved slightly as higher margins were realized on sales of used units  but were offset by lower margins realized on new motorcoach sales as non current models were sold at reduced prices and an additional accrual was made for estimated warranty costs on previously sold vogue motorcoaches 
consolidated selling and administrative expenses decreased in by million to million  a percent decrease  from million in as a percentage of sales  these expenses increased to percent in from percent in trailer segment expenses remained essentially unchanged while motorcoach segment expenses decreased by percent primarily due to reduced marketing and administrative costs resulting from closing the pryor  oklahoma facility in corporate expenses decreased by about percent 
there were no management bonuses paid or accrued in in  an additional charge of  was recorded for costs related to the pryor  oklahoma facility 
the company is in the process of developing an alternative plan to begin utilizing this facility in as discussed in liquidity and capital resources 
the restructuring charge of million in included the estimated payroll  severance and other costs paid in connection with closing the pryor  oklahoma facility in consolidated interest expense decreased by million to million in compared to million in the same period in this decrease was due to lower average levels of debt in as well as lower average interest rates in other income expense  net  increased by  primarily as the result of a  reduction in aircraft write downs in compared to income before taxes ibt in was million compared to a loss of million in this improvement reflects an increase in trailer segment ibt of million due mainly to improved margins on sales  an improvement of million in motorcoach segment ibt due to non recurrence of restructuring write downs  decreased write downs in the carrying value of motorcoaches and reduced selling and administrative costs and interest expense and a decrease in corporate net expense by  all for the reasons discussed above 

table of contents a benefit from income taxes of  was provided in this benefit resulted primarily from a  income tax refund as a result of the job creation and worker assistance act of and a  reduction in the valuation allowance resulting from a decrease in net deferred tax assets 
the provision rate reflects a reduction due to the anticipated benefit from the carry back of certain book losses to prior year s federal income tax returns for a refund and a million valuation provision for deferred tax assets 
no benefit was provided on state income tax losses due to the uncertainty of realization 
outlook we are optimistic about the rate of sales growth in as unfilled confirmed order backlog has increased significantly in both our specialty trailer and motorcoach segments 
at december  the new order backlog for trailers of million was percent below its level of million at december  however  at december  order backlog for trailers is million  which is percent greater than at december  the motorcoach backlog has also shown significant improvement growing from million at december  to million at december  these backlogs have continued to be strong in the early months of  with trailer backlog at million and motorcoach at million at march  we are optimistic that these trends will continue in as the economy strengthens and consumer uncertainty diminishes 
there is continuing focus by the company on sales and marketing related activities that have been effective in increasing sales in the past  but there is no assurance they will be successful in increasing order levels to maintain or exceed the sales volume 
the company believes its name recognition and close affiliation with the motorsports industry will continue to have a positive impact on its sales of specialty trailer  transporters and luxury motorcoaches 
with more than percent of its revenue from end users in motorsports and leisure and entertainment categories  which also includes horse trailers  and its strong position in the livestock trailer market  the company believes it is strategically well positioned to continue to benefit from these markets 
the company introduced new and enhanced models of trailers in and added motorcoach models with enhanced features 
liquidity and capital resources general the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis  which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business 
although the company was not in compliance with certain of the restrictive financial covenants in the financing agreements with us bank and ge  both lenders waived events of default with respect to these violations at december  and have amended various of the financial covenants to reduce or eliminate their requirements for compliance in based on the company s business plan for  management believes that the company will meet all the restrictive covenants of its lenders including those with us bank and ge as revised 
see note for a detailed discussion of the amended covenants 
management s belief in the achievability of the covenants is supported by the fact that it continues to experience favorable business conditions including a substantial backlog  continued cost controls and manufacturing efficiencies  and financial covenants that as amended  and agreed to by the company s lenders  management believes will be achieved 
the company s liquidity is primarily affected most directly by its cash flow from operations together with changes in amounts available to borrow on its approved lines of credit with us bank and with ge 
during the year ended december   the company s operating activities provided net cash of million 
with the waiver of covenant violations  at december   the company had approximately million available to borrow under its credit lines compared to million at december   an increase of million as availability under these lines increased due to changes in eligible receivables and inventories and the addition of a new million credit line by regions bank as discussed further below 
the company s liquidity can be measured by two key indicators  its current ratio and its ratio of debt to shareholders equity 
the company s ratio of current assets to current liabilities was to at december   compared with a ratio of to at december  this ratio has improved as a result of classifying only the portion of the u 
s bank debt payable in the next months in current liabilities the financial statements reflect all such debt in current liabilities as a result of the uncertainty about the company s ability to continue as a going concern at that time 
the ratio of total debt to shareholders investment decreased to to at december  from to at december  this ratio improved as stockholders investment increased during as a result of the million conversion of subordinated debt into common stock in accordance with its terms 
increased expenditures for working capital items may be required to support production levels in excess of sales from time to time 
a significant increase in trailer backlog in the fourth quarter of and in the early months of the first quarter of has resulted in the purchase of additional raw materials and a build up of work in process

as of december   approximately percent of the coaches in production and to be completed over the next four months have not been sold to specific customers as compared to percent at december  for the year ended december  total units sold exceeded units produced by units 
while it is the company s expectation that substantially all of these motorcoaches will be sold to specific customers before production is completed  or shortly thereafter  there is no assurance this will occur

critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make decisions based upon estimates  assumptions  and factors it considers as relevant to the circumstances 
such decisions include the selection of applicable accounting principles and the use of judgment in their application  the results of which impact reported amounts and disclosures 
changes in economic conditions or other business circumstances may affect the outcomes of management s estimates and assumptions 
accordingly  actual results could differ from those anticipated 
our critical accounting policies include the following inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost  as determined on a first in  first out fifo basis  or market and includes materials  labor and overhead costs 
raw materials consist of the cost of materials required to produce trailers and complete motorcoach conversions and to support parts sales and service 
work in process consists of costs related to materials  bus conversion shells  labor and overhead related to the production process 
the company writes down its inventory for obsolescence  and the difference between the cost of inventory and its estimated market value 
these write downs are based on assumptions about future sales demand and market conditions 
if actual sales demand or market conditions change from those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue from the sale of trailers and motorcoaches when title and risks of ownership are transferred to the customer  which generally is upon shipment or customer pick up 
a customer may be invoiced for and receive title prior to taking physical possession when the customer has made a fixed  written commitment to purchase  the trailer or motorcoach has been completed and is available for pick up or delivery  and the customer has requested the company to hold the trailer or motorcoach until the customer determines the most economical means of taking physical possession 
upon such a request  the company has no further obligation except to segregate the trailer or motorcoach  issue its manufacturer s statement of origin  invoice the customer under normal billing and credit terms and hold the trailer or motorcoach for a short period of time as is customary in the industry  until pick up or delivery 
products are built to customer specification and no rights of return or exchange privileges are granted except in unusually circumstances 
accordingly  no provision for sales allowances or returns is normally recorded 
long lived assets management periodically reviews the carrying value of long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that carrying value may not be recoverable 
in performing the review for recoverability  management estimates the non discounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
product warranty the company s products are covered by product warranties ranging from one to six years after the date of sale 
at the time of sale  the company recognizes estimated warranty costs based on prior history and expected future claims and records an accrued liability 
the accrued liability is reduced as actual warranty costs are paid and is evaluated periodically to validate previous estimates and known requirements and is adjusted as necessary 

table of contents other the company has reserves for other loss exposures  such as litigation  taxes  product liability  worker s compensation  employee medical claims  and accounts receivable 
establishing loss reserves for these matters requires use of estimates and judgment in regards to risk exposure and ultimate liability 
the company estimates losses under the programs using consistent and appropriate methods  however  as better information becomes available or as actual amounts are determinable  the recorded estimates are revised 
ultimate results could differ from these estimates

item a 
quantitative qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity risk the company is exposed to market risks related to changes in the cost of aluminum 
aluminum is a commodity that is traded daily on the commodity markets and fluctuates in price 
the average midwest delivered cash price per pound for ingot aluminum during the three years ended december   as reported to the company by its suppliers was in  in  and in the company s cost of aluminum varies from these market prices due to vendor processing charges  timing of purchases  and contractual commitments with suppliers for specific prices and other factors 
the company has obtained commitments from suppliers to provide  at an agreed upon fixed price  about percent of its anticipated requirements for  which reduces a portion of the risk of aluminum cost fluctuations for the year 
there is a potential risk of loss related to fixed price contracts if there is a substantial drop in the actual cost of aluminum in relation to the contract price  which would affect the competitive price of the company s product 
if the company is unable to obtain such commitments 
table of contents from suppliers or otherwise reduce the price risk related to the balance of the purchases to meet the balance of its requirements in and in the years beyond  this could have an adverse impact on the company s operating results if the cost of aluminum increases significantly above levels in interest rate risk the company is exposed to market risks related to changes in us and international interest rates 
substantially all of the company s debt bears interest at a variable rate 
an interest rate increase by one percentage point would reduce the company s future annual net income by approximately  at current debt levels
