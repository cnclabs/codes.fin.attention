executive summary about fannie mae fannie mae is the nation s largest source of financing for home mortgages 
we are a shareholder owned corporation  chartered by the us congress to provide liquidity in the secondary mortgage market to increase the availability and affordability of homeownership for low  moderate  and middle income americans 
our charter limits our operations to activities related to housing  mortgages and related financial products 
our business activities are aligned with national policies that support the expansion of homeownership in america  and serve to increase the total amount of funds available to finance housing 
though chartered by congress  our business is self sustaining and funded exclusively with private capital 
the us government does not guarantee  directly or indirectly  fannie mae s securities or other obligations 
our businesses we compete in the secondary market for residential mortgage debt outstanding mdo  and we invest in and manage one primary asset class residential mortgage assets in the form of mortgage loans and mortgage related securities 
fannie mae generates revenues primarily through two complementary business lines our portfolio investment business and our credit guaranty business 
we manage and evaluate the results of our business lines as though each were a stand alone business  and accordingly  we allocate certain income and expenses to each line of business for purposes of business segment reporting 
the chart below is a simplified representation of our line of business revenue model 
in our portfolio investment business  we purchase mortgage loans  mortgage related securities  and liquid investments for our portfolios and earn income primarily from the difference  or spread  between the yield on these assets and the cost of the debt  which is supplemented by our use of derivatives  and capital used to fund these assets net interest yield on a gaap basis and net interest margin on a non gaap or core basis 
we fund the assets in our portfolio by issuing debt securities in the global capital markets and by entering into derivative contracts 
in our credit guaranty business  primary mortgage lenders deliver pools of mortgages to us to package into fannie mae guaranteed mortgage backed securities mbs 
we receive guaranty fees to compensate us for guaranteeing the timely payment of principal and interest on mbs  which are included in guaranty fee income if the mbs is held by other investors and in interest income if the mbs is held in our portfolio 
logo this model does not reflect allocations made between our portfolio investment business and credit guaranty business for segment reporting purposes as described in md a core business earnings and business segment results 
net interest margin and core net interest income are supplemental non gaap measures that we use to evaluate the performance of our portfolio investment business 
see md a core business earnings and business segment results for more information about these and other non gaap measures 
as illustrated in the diagram above  earnings growth from core net interest income depends principally on two factors growth in the average balance of our mortgage investments and the interest margin we earn on those investments 
our objective is to maintain a disciplined approach to growing our portfolio  purchasing mortgages when the spread between our cost of funds and the yield on mortgage assets is attractive and when supply is available in the market 
the pace of growth in our mortgage portfolio has largely tracked these factors  and we anticipate that this dynamic will continue 
guaranty fee income growth depends upon the growth in average outstanding mbs and the guaranty fee rate we receive for our guaranty of timely payment of principal and interest on outstanding mbs mbs held by investors other than fannie mae 
growth in outstanding mbs depends largely on the volume of mortgages made available for securitization and the perceived quality and value of our mbs in the secondary market 
growth in our average effective guaranty fee rate will depend upon our ability to further implement risk based pricing fees on new business and the credit quality of the loans we securitize 
in addition  changes in mortgage prepayment speeds will affect the pace of recognition of deferred fee price adjustments  which also impacts our average effective guaranty fee rate 
how we manage risk our ability to achieve desired returns and to meet the objectives of our housing mission depend to a significant degree on our success in applying professional expertise  sophisticated financial tools  and experience to manage the risks inherent in the assets we own or guarantee 
during  we undertook a comprehensive review and assessment of our corporate financial disciplines 
in conjunction with this assessment  we adopted several internal financial discipline objectives to maintain or enhance fannie mae s financial strength 
we discuss these objectives further in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a 
because we guarantee the timely payment of principal and interest on the mbs we issue  we assume the risk that a homeowner will default on his or her mortgage obligation 
to manage this risk  our credit guaranty business employs technology driven underwriting tools  risk sharing strategies  and active asset management strategies focused on anticipating and minimizing potential losses 
for  our total credit related losses remained low  totaling only million or 
percent of our average mortgage credit book of business 
our portfolio investment business manages the interest rate risk associated with the mortgage assets we own the risk that changes in interest rates could impact cash flows on our mortgage assets and debt in a way that adversely affects our earnings or long term value 
to manage this risk  we seek to maintain a close match between the durations of the debt we issue and the mortgage assets we purchase 
to help us achieve this objective  we issue debt securities  including securities callable at our option 
we also use interest rate derivatives including interest rate swaps  swaptions and interest rate caps to supplement our issuance of debt  increase our funding flexibility and limit our exposure to interest rate volatility 
the principal interest rate risk measures used by management to evaluate our risk position are reported on a monthly basis 
in  a year defined by historic levels of interest rate volatility  we were able to maintain our risk measures at acceptable levels throughout the year and deliver record financial performance 
a more detailed discussion of our interest rate risk management practices and results is included in md a portfolio investment business operations interest rate risk management 
in some cases  accounting results may not reflect the purpose or economic impact of a specific transaction or type of transaction in the same way that management views the purpose or impact 
for example  we discuss the effect of our adoption of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities fas  on our reported net income and how we use core business earnings  a supplemental non gaap measure  to evaluate fannie mae s results in md a core business earnings and business segment results 
we also provide a reconciliation of core business earnings to fannie mae s reported net income 
we devote much of our md a discussion to our management of interest rate and credit risk and our use of derivatives and off balance sheet arrangements because we focus significant attention and resources on these areas 
we believe that understanding our approach to managing these risks helps in understanding our financial strategy and results 
our market fannie mae s growth is tied principally to the growth of our underlying market residential mdo 
residential mdo has grown every year since the federal reserve began tracking the measure in  and has typically outpaced the growth of nominal gdp 
in addition  our book of business  which includes our gross mortgage portfolio and outstanding mbs  has typically grown somewhat faster than mdo  and we expect this trend to continue 
for the current decade  our economic forecasts project that mdo will grow at an annualized rate of percent 
in the first three years of the current decade  mdo grew at an annualized rate of percent  substantially outpacing our projection for average annual growth for the decade as a whole 
this growth was largely attributable to a sustained period of low interest rates  which fueled record levels of refinancings  record home sales and strong home price appreciation 
the period comprised the first three consecutive years of double digit growth in residential mdo since growth dynamics for this period are represented in the following table amount change amount change amount change housing market home sale units in thousands ofheo house price index single family mortgage originations in billions purchase share refinance share mortgage debt outstanding in billions fannie mae in billions business volume book of business ofheo s house price index is a quarterly report issued by ofheo that analyzes housing appreciation trends 
in  low interest rates throughout the year  including year lows reached in mid june  coupled with a housing market that remained resilient despite uncertainties regarding the pace of economic recovery  resulted in record mortgage originations 
residential mdo rose by approximately percent in to a record trillion  the fastest pace of growth in years 
for the remainder of the decade  we expect that growth in residential mdo will slow from the extraordinary pace of the past three years 
we anticipate  however  that annualized growth for mdo during this period will average between and percent due to positive demographic and economic drivers such as population and immigration growth  increased homeownership rates among the minority population  and continued growth in home values 
our competitive dynamics because fannie mae s current share of interest rate risk is only about percent of total residential mdo and our share of credit risk is only percent of mdo  we believe that the market presents significant opportunities for continued growth in each of our primary businesses 
however  to achieve our objective of strong and consistent growth over time  each of our businesses must effectively address the challenges of an extremely competitive business environment 
in our portfolio investment business  we compete with commercial banks  thrifts  other government sponsored enterprises  credit unions  finance companies and other investors for mortgage assets made available in the secondary market 
competition for mortgage assets has been particularly intense during the past three years  and our market share has remained virtually unchanged at approximately percent 
this is largely a result of our adherence to a disciplined approach to growing our mortgage portfolio 
in our credit guaranty business  our success compared with competitors in the market that securitize originated mortgages is determined largely by the liquidity and perceived value of the mbs we issue 
during the past three years  our market share in the credit guaranty business has increased by approximately five percentage points 
our financial performance fannie mae achieved record financial performance in our portfolio investment business benefited greatly from the low interest rate environment and steep yield curve that existed during the first half of  which kept our cost of funds low and  correspondingly  elevated our net interest margin to higher than anticipated levels 
as a result  our net interest income and core net interest income reached record levels 
this facilitated the repurchase of a greater amount of higher cost debt securities  which generated significant losses in but will contribute to lower funding costs in the future 
the credit guaranty business also benefited from the low interest rate environment in the first half of  which contributed to record mbs issuance 
the effective guaranty rate also rose due to an increase in risk based pricing fees and faster recognition of deferred fees due to accelerated prepayments on mbs 
our strong growth in gaap net income in  together with preferred stock issuances  allowed us to increase our core capital base by over billion during the year and to return a record amount of capital to shareholders in the form of increased dividends and share repurchases 
we raised our common stock dividend by percent from in to in and also repurchased over million shares of common stock 
principal challenges we anticipate portfolio investment business our portfolio growth of percent in was slightly below our expectations 
while low interest rates during the first half of the year spurred record mortgage originations  aggressive purchasing by banks and other investors resulted in relatively narrow mortgage to debt spreads and lower than expected sales into the secondary market 
consistent with our disciplined growth strategy  the portfolio investment business purchased mortgage investments when spreads exceeded our hurdle rates and when supply was available in the market 
the level of growth in our mortgage portfolio in will likewise depend largely upon spread levels and availability of investments in the secondary market 
it is extremely difficult to predict when the catalysts that have driven aggressive purchasing of mortgage assets by depository institutions will change to a degree sufficient to slow purchasing  or to drive net selling  of mortgage assets by depositories 
however  we do anticipate that at some point during  the variables that have resulted in a highly competitive market for mortgage assets will begin to follow historical  cyclical trends  which should result in a more favorable environment for growth in our mortgage portfolio 
credit guaranty business our credit guaranty business in reported record guaranty fee income while maintaining all major measures of credit quality within historically low ranges 
delivering sustained above market growth within a stringent risk framework will continue to be the primary challenge faced by our credit guaranty business 
as our mortgage credit book of business becomes more seasoned  we anticipate an upward trend in serious delinquency rates and foreclosures  but we expect that any dollar increase in credit losses will be modest 
legislative proposals during  several bills were introduced in congress that propose to alter the regulatory regime under which fannie mae operates 
these bills seek to transfer regulatory responsibility for overseeing fannie mae s safety and soundness from our current regulator office of federal housing enterprise oversight ofheo to a bureau within the us department of the treasury or to a newly created independent entity 
some of the bills also would transfer various of hud s regulatory authorities over fannie mae to a treasury bureau or other entity 
several bills seek to provide additional or expanded powers to the proposed new regulator  including the power to set capital levels that are now fixed by the act 
congress will continue to consider possible regulatory reform in we support a strong  well funded  independent regulator  but object to any changes to our regulatory structure that will inhibit the success of our statutory mission 
we will continue to work with policymakers to reach a consensus that strengthens the safety and soundness oversight of fannie mae 
however  we cannot predict whether any legislation will be approved by congress and signed into law by the president and  if so  the final form or effective date of the legislation 
organization of md a we intend for our md a to provide information that will assist in better understanding our financial statements  the changes in certain key items in our financial statements from year to year  the primary factors driving those changes  any known trends or uncertainties that we are aware of that we believe may have a material effect on our future performance  as well as how certain accounting principles affect our financial statements 
we provide additional information about our two lines of business to explain how these business segments and their results affect fannie mae s financial condition and results of operations 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements as of december  and the notes accompanying those financial statements 
our md a is organized as follows reported results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates core business earnings and business segment results portfolio investment business operations credit guaranty business operations operations risk management liquidity and capital resources pending accounting pronouncements reported results of operations the following discussion is based on fannie mae s reported gaap results 
we have reclassified certain amounts in our prior years reported results to conform to our current presentation 
overview the record housing year generated record volumes  business growth  and revenues for fannie mae in we reported a substantial increase in our reported net income in  due to a combination of increased revenues and changes in the mark to market values of our option based derivatives under fas reported net income and diluted earnings per share eps totaled billion and  respectively  in  compared with billion and in  and billion and in our reported results  which are based on gaap  may fluctuate significantly from period to period because of the accounting for purchased options under fas fas requires that we record changes in the time value of purchased options that we use to manage interest rate risk in our income  however  we do not record in earnings changes in the intrinsic value of some of those options or similar changes in the fair value of options in all of our callable debt or mortgage assets 
we expect the mark to market adjustment on purchased options to create temporary unrealized gains and losses that will often vary substantially from period to period with changes in interest rates  expected interest rate volatility  and derivative activity 
during  we saw historic levels of interest rate volatility in the fixed income markets 
the year was characterized by mortgage interest rates that fell sharply in the first half of the year  with rates generally higher in the second half of the year 
most long term rates ended the year modestly higher than where they started in  although mortgage rates were little changed from the end of to the end of yields on year fixed rate mortgages dropped to about percent in june  the lowest level in years  before moving up briefly to percent in september and then slipping again to end the year slightly below percent 
the generally higher interest rate environment at the end of the year and normal seasoning of our options resulted in our recording billion of expense from changes in the time value of purchased options in  a decline of billion from the prior year 
purchased options expense for and totaled billion and million  respectively 
excluding the effect of purchased options expense  we experienced strong growth in that was partially offset by a significant increase in losses on the extinguishment of debt as we took advantage of market opportunities to repurchase significant amounts of higher cost debt 
reported net interest income increased percent in and percent in increases in net interest income were driven primarily by the combined growth in our reported net interest yield and expansion of our mortgage portfolio 
guaranty fee income was up percent in and percent in  due primarily to growth in outstanding mbs and our average effective guaranty fee rate 
our results also include an after tax gain of million related to the cumulative effect of adopting financial accounting standard no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities fas 
fas amends and clarifies certain aspects of fas and applies to mortgage loan purchase commitments entered into or modified after june   and purchase and sale commitments for when issued mortgage securities outstanding as of june  and entered into after that date 
management also tracks and analyzes fannie mae s financial results based on core business earnings 
we developed core business earnings as a supplemental non gaap measure in conjunction with our january  adoption of fas to adjust for accounting differences between alternative transactions we use to hedge interest rate risk that produce similar economic results but require different accounting treatment under fas for example  our core business earnings measure allows management and investors to evaluate the quality of earnings from fannie mae s principal business activities in a way that accounts for comparable hedging transactions in a similar manner 
while the core business earnings measure is not a substitute for gaap net income  we rely on core business earnings in operating our business because we believe core business earnings provides our management and investors with a better measure of our financial results and better reflects our risk management strategies than our gaap net income 
we discuss our core business earnings results in md a core business earnings and business segment results 
net interest income reported net interest income is the difference between interest income and interest expense 
net interest income represents a principal source of earnings for fannie mae and is affected by investment and debt growth  asset yields  and the cost of debt and certain derivatives 
reported net interest income subsequent to our adoption of fas only includes a portion of the cost associated with using purchased options to hedge the borrowers prepayment option in mortgages 
prior to the adoption of fas  we amortized purchased options premiums over the expected life of the option and reflected the cost in our net interest income as a component of our interest expense 
we now report the change in the fair value of the time value of purchased options in a separate income statement category entitled purchased options expense 
we also present net interest income and the related net interest yield on a taxable equivalent basis to consistently reflect income from taxable and tax exempt investments based on a percent marginal tax rate 
table presents fannie mae s net interest yield based on reported net interest income calculated on a taxable equivalent basis 
our net interest yield calculation subsequent to the adoption of fas does not fully reflect the cost of our purchased options see md a core business earnings and business segment results core net interest income for a discussion of our supplemental non gaap measures  core net interest income and net interest margin

in  we revised our method of classifying interest expense between short term and long term on certain derivative instruments 
this reclassification does not affect fannie mae s total interest expense 
we reclassified million and million between short term and long term interest expense in and  respectively  to conform to our current year presentation

averages have been calculated on a monthly basis based on amortized cost 
includes average balance of nonaccrual loans of billion in  billion in  and billion in interest free funds represent the portion of our investment portfolio funded by equity and non interest bearing liabilities 
reported net interest income of billion for was up percent over  driven by a percent increase in our average net investment balance and a basis point expansion in our reported net interest yield to percent 
our average net investment balance also referred to as total interest earning assets consists of our mortgage portfolio net of unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities and deferred balances and liquid investments  which include cash equivalents pledged as collateral 
the increased amount of purchased options used as a substitute for callable debt had a positive effect on our net interest yield in because the cost of purchased options is not reflected in our net interest yield or reported net interest income 
reported net interest income for increased percent over  driven by a percent increase in our average net investment balance and a basis point expansion in our reported net interest yield to percent 
our net interest yield continued to benefit and remained elevated during and because of the unusually steep yield curve  which afforded us the opportunity to significantly lower our debt costs by calling or retiring higher cost debt and temporarily replacing it with shorter term  lower cost debt in anticipation of faster mortgage prepayments

guaranty fee income guaranty fee income reported in our total corporate results and our average guaranty fee rate primarily include guaranty fees we receive on outstanding mbs 
we classify guaranty fees on mbs held in our portfolio as net interest income 
the guaranty fee income allocated for line of business reporting purposes to the credit guaranty business on mbs held in our portfolio is eliminated by an equal and offsetting allocation of guaranty expense to the portfolio investment business 
table presents our guaranty fee income and average effective guaranty fee rate for the past three years 
table guaranty fee data year ended december  change change dollars in millions guaranty fee income average balance of outstanding mbs average effective guaranty fee rate basis points outstanding mbs refers to mortgage related securities guaranteed by fannie mae and held by investors other than fannie mae 
if an mbs has been resecuritized into another mbs  we only include the principal amount once in the outstanding balance 
the percent increase in guaranty fee income in was driven by percent growth in average outstanding mbs and a percent increase in the average effective guaranty fee rate on outstanding mbs to basis points 
guaranty fee income in was up percent over  primarily due to percent growth in average outstanding mbs 
we expanded our issuances of mbs during and in response to increased volumes from lenders  fueled in part by the substantial level of refinance activity 
mbs issues acquired by other investors rose percent in to billion and percent in to billion 
our market share also increased in due to our ability to meet record customer demands  coupled with uncertainty related to our major competitors and more favorable price spreads on fannie mae securities 
the increase in our average effective guaranty fee rate during resulted primarily from accelerated recognition of deferred fee price adjustments due to faster prepayment speeds associated with the unprecedented level of refinancings  along with an increase in risk based pricing fees on new business 
as the rate of refinancings decrease  prepayment speeds and our recognition of deferred fee price adjustments will slow 
over the past three years  our combined book of business has grown at an exceptional pace with outstanding mbs growing much faster than our portfolio  averaging percent per year compared with about percent per year for our portfolio 
a key driver of this growth differential has been the increased demand among depository institutions for fixed rate mortgages  partially stemming from the unusually steep yield curve 
we anticipate that the unusually high demand for mortgages among depository institutions will begin to diminish during as this happens and mortgage originations slow from the record levels of the past years  we anticipate growth in outstanding mbs to slow from the recent extraordinary levels 
fee and other income  net fee and other income includes transaction fees  technology fees  multifamily fees  costs associated with the purchase of additional mortgage insurance to protect against credit losses credit enhancement expense  gains and losses on the sale of securities  other than temporary impairment  operating losses from certain tax advantaged investments in affordable housing projects  and other miscellaneous items 
tax advantaged investments represent equity interests in limited partnerships that own rental housing and generate tax credits  which reduce fannie mae s effective federal income tax rate 
we account for the majority of these investments using the equity method 
we do not guarantee any obligations of these partnerships  and our exposure is limited to the amount of our investments 
we record the tax benefit related to these investments as a reduction in the provision for federal income taxes and as an increase in taxable equivalent revenues 
fee and other income totaled million in  an increase of million over driven largely by an increase in volume related transaction and technology fees 
the following table shows the components of fee and other income 
table fee and other income  net year ended december  change change dollars in millions transaction fees technology fees multifamily fees tax advantaged investments credit enhancement expense other we experienced a significant increase in transaction  technology  and multifamily fees in due to a surge in business volumes associated with the robust refinancing market 
transaction  technology  and multifamily fees almost doubled from the prior year to million as our business volume  which includes portfolio purchases and mbs issues acquired by other investors  swelled to  billion from billion in we expect markedly lower total business volumes in  which is likely to result in a considerable reduction in transaction and technology fees 
we recognized other than temporary impairment totaling million in  compared with million in the increase in impairment amounts recorded during was primarily related to securities or investments that were downgraded during the year and suffered significant declines in fair value  and for which we concluded that it was uncertain whether we would recover all principal and interest due to us 
fee and other income totaled million in  up from million of income in the million increase was driven by a million increase in transaction and technology fees resulting primarily from increased real estate mortgage investment conduit remic transaction volumes and a million increase in net gains from the sale of investments 
these increases were offset partially by a million increase in credit enhancement expenses and a million increase in impairment write downs on a variety of investments 
the increase in credit enhancement expenses was attributable to an increase in the volume of business covered by credit enhancements purchased directly by fannie mae  stemming from our expansion into new products and markets 
credit related expenses credit related expenses include foreclosed property expenses income and the provision for losses 
credit related expenses increased million in to million  compared with million in and million in the increase in credit related expenses was due primarily to increasing acquisitions of single family foreclosed properties 
although foreclosed single family property acquisitions increased in to  from  in and  in  average severities on the sale of these properties have remained low by historical standards due to overall strong home prices and credit enhancement proceeds 
foreclosed property expense income was a net loss of million in  compared with a net gain of million in and million in  as home price growth has moderated somewhat and gains on sales of properties have declined 
we recorded a provision for losses of million in  compared with million in and million in this component of credit related expenses has grown more slowly than foreclosed property acquisitions due largely to the receipt of proceeds from credit enhancements 
forgone interest on non performing assets  which we report as a reduction to net interest income  totaled million in  million in  and million in credit related losses  which include charge offs plus foreclosed property expense income  totaled million in  million in  and million in despite the increase in credit related losses during and  they have remained at historically low levels 
the strong housing market combined with our aggressive management of problem loans and protection through credit enhancement have mitigated the impact of recent increases in foreclosure activity due to general economic weakness 
credit losses as a percentage of our average mortgage credit book of business have remained relatively steady at 
basis points in  
basis points in  and 
basis points in  despite the weak economic environment 
our mortgage credit book of business includes mortgages  mbs and mortgage related securities in our mortgage portfolio  outstanding mbs held by other investors  and other contractual arrangements or guarantees 
the strong growth in our mortgage credit book of business over the past two years is likely to result in a modest increase in our credit losses during  however  we do not anticipate a significant increase in credit losses as a percentage of our average mortgage credit book of business 
administrative expenses administrative expenses include costs incurred to run our daily operations  such as personnel costs and technology expenses 
administrative expenses totaled billion in  up percent from the above average rate of spending was primarily related to costs incurred in reengineering fannie mae s core technology infrastructure to enhance our ability to process and manage the risk on mortgage assets  the expensing of all new stock based compensation beginning in in conjunction with our adoption of the fair value recognition provisions of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for stock based compensation fas  and higher levels of charitable contributions including a million contribution to the fannie mae foundation 
compensation expense rose percent to million  due in part to the increase in stock based compensation expense recognized under fas combined with a percent increase in the number of employees and annual salary increases 
administrative expenses increased percent to billion in the above average growth in administrative expenses was due primarily to costs incurred on a multi year project initiated in to re engineer our core infrastructure systems and expenses associated with relocating our primary data center 
in addition  compensation expense increased percent to million in  resulting primarily from a percent increase in the number of employees and annual salary increases 
we evaluate growth in administrative expenses in relation to growth in core taxable equivalent revenues and our average book of business 
core taxable equivalent revenues is a supplemental non gaap measure discussed further in md a core business earnings and business segment results 
despite the growth in administrative expenses over the past two years  our efficiency ratio the ratio of administrative expenses to core taxable equivalent revenues improved to percent in  from percent in  and percent in because of the significant growth in revenues generated by the expansion of our book of business 
the ratio of administrative expenses as a percentage of our average book of business was 
percent in  unchanged from and slightly above the 
percent ratio in as we near completion of our multi year core infrastructure project  we expect the growth rate in administrative expenses to slow significantly in special contribution special contribution expense reflects a contribution we made to the fannie mae foundation in the form of common stock 
we made a special commitment in to contribute million of our common stock to the fannie mae foundation 
we acquired the shares through open market purchases and contributed them to the foundation in the fannie mae foundation creates affordable homeownership and housing opportunities through innovative partnerships and initiatives that build healthy  vibrant communities across the united states 
it is a separate  private  nonprofit organization that we do not consolidate  but is supported solely by fannie mae 
we may also periodically make smaller  discretionary cash contributions to the fannie mae foundation that are included in administrative expenses 
purchased options expense purchased options expense includes the change in the fair value of the time value of purchased options in accordance with fas intrinsic value and time value are the two primary components of an option s price 
the intrinsic value is the amount that can be immediately realized by exercising the option the amount by which the strike price of the option is in the money 
the intrinsic value of an option is not affected by the passage of time 
time value is the amount by which the price of an option exceeds its intrinsic value  and it is directly related to how much time an option has until expiration 
as the remaining life of an option shortens  the time value declines and becomes less sensitive to changes in interest rate volatility 
we include only the intrinsic value of options in our assessment of hedge effectiveness under fas we exclude the time value from our assessment of hedge effectiveness and mark to market changes in the time value through earnings 
the change in the fair value of the time value of purchased options will vary from period to period with changes in interest rates  expected interest rate volatility  and our derivative activity 
we recorded purchased options expense of billion in  which was related primarily to the normal seasoning of our options 
purchased options expense totaled billion in and million in the significant increase in purchased options expense in was due primarily to a sharp decline in interest rates at the end of that resulted in a decrease in time value  coupled with an increase in the average notional balance of caps and swaptions  two types of purchased options we commonly use to manage interest rate risk 
under fas  we do not recognize in earnings changes in the intrinsic value of some of these options  which  in combination with the fair value of options in our mortgage assets and callable debt  would have more than offset the decrease in time value of our options during prior to the adoption of fas  we amortized premiums on purchased options into interest expense over the expected life of the option 
during the fourth quarter of  we refined our methodology for estimating the initial time value of interest rate caps at the date of purchase and prospectively adopted a preferred method that resulted in a million pre tax reduction in purchased options expense and increased our diluted eps for by 
under our previous valuation method  we treated the entire premium paid on purchased at the money caps as time value with no allocation to intrinsic value 
we revised our valuation methodology to allocate the initial purchase price to reflect the value of individual caplets  some of which are above the strike rate of the cap  which results in a higher intrinsic value and corresponding lower time value at the date of purchase 
this approach is more consistent with our estimation of time value subsequent to the initial purchase date 
this change does not affect the total expense that will be recorded in our income statement over the life of our caps and has no effect on our non gaap core business earnings measure 
debt extinguishments  net fannie mae strategically repurchases or calls debt securities and related interest rate swaps on a regular basis as part of our interest rate risk management efforts and to reduce future debt costs 
gains and losses on debt extinguishments and related interest rate swaps are reflected in this category 
we recognized a pre tax loss of billion in from the call of billion and repurchase of billion of debt in in comparison  we recognized a pre tax loss of million in from the call of billion and repurchase of billion of debt in the weighted average cost of redeemed debt and interest rate swaps in and was percent and percent  respectively 
during  we repurchased or called billion in debt securities and notional principal of interest rate swaps carrying a weighted average cost of percent and recognized a pre tax loss of million 
the substantial increase in debt extinguishment activity during was driven by several factors 
the historically low interest rate environment that persisted through the first half of made it economical for us to call or redeem high cost debt 
in anticipation of increasing liquidations in our mortgage portfolio as a result of heavy refinancing activity  we replaced the higher cost debt with shorter term  lower cost debt 
this dynamic resulted in a temporarily elevated spread between the yield on our mortgage assets and our funding cost 
we chose to reinvest a portion of the income generated from these temporary circumstances in debt repurchases to reduce our future debt costs 
a loss realized on a debt repurchase in the current year results in correspondingly lower debt costs in the future 
the debt cost savings will be realized over the period remaining until the scheduled maturity of the debt repurchased 
we select individual securities to repurchase based on which securities we believe are trading at attractive prices in the market as well as asset liability risk management purposes 
we expect a significant reduction in the level of debt repurchases in income taxes our effective tax rate on reported income was percent in based on a tax provision of billion  percent in based on a tax provision of billion  and percent in based on a tax provision of billion 
the increase in the effective tax rate on reported income in is primarily due to the significant increase in our reported income  which diminishes the relative tax benefit we receive from tax exempt income and tax credits 
in  our pre tax income was significantly reduced by the billion we recorded in purchased options expense 
as a result  we received a greater relative benefit from our low income housing tax credits that contributed to a reduction in our effective tax rate on reported income 
our effective tax rate based on our core business earnings  a non gaap measure that adjusts for the effect of fas on our purchased options  was percent in  percent in  and percent in the decrease in the effective tax rate on core business earnings in was primarily due to the increased benefit from tax credits 
see md a core business earnings and business segment results 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle effective july   we adopted fas  which amends and clarifies certain aspects of fas  including the accounting for commitments to purchase loans and commitments to purchase and sell when issued securities 
fas applies to fannie mae s mortgage loan purchase commitments entered into or modified after june   and purchase and sale commitments for when issued mortgage securities entered into after and outstanding at june  as a result of the adoption of fas  we are required to account for the majority of our commitments to purchase mortgage loans and to purchase or sell mortgage related securities as derivatives and record these commitments on our balance sheet at fair value 
we recorded a cumulative after tax transition gain of million million pre tax from the adoption of fas the transition gain primarily relates to recording the fair value of open portfolio purchase commitments for when issued securities totaling billion at june  the offset to the transition gain related to these commitments resulted in recording a fair value purchase price adjustment on our balance sheet that will amortize into future earnings as a reduction of interest income over the estimated life of the underlying mortgage securities retained in our portfolio 
our adoption of fas on january   resulted in a cumulative after tax increase to income of million million pre tax in the cumulative effect on earnings from the change in accounting principle was primarily attributable to recording the fair value of the time value of purchased options  which are used as a substitute for callable debt securities 
critical accounting policies and estimates fannie mae s reported results and financial statements are based on gaap  which requires us in some cases to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported results and disclosures 
we describe our most significant accounting policies in the notes to financial statements under note  summary of significant accounting policies 
several of our accounting policies involve the use of accounting estimates we consider to be critical because they are likely to change from period to period because they require significant management judgment and assumptions about highly complex and uncertain matters  and the use of a different estimate or a change in estimate could have a material effect on our reported results of operations or financial condition 
our critical accounting estimates include determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and guaranty liability for mbs  projecting mortgage prepayments to calculate the amortization of the deferred price components of mortgages and mortgage related securities held in portfolio and outstanding mbs  estimating the time value of our purchased options  and assessing other than temporary impairment 
we evaluate our critical accounting estimates and judgments on an on going basis and update them as necessary based on changing conditions 
management has specifically discussed the development and selection of each critical accounting estimate with the audit committee of fannie mae s board of directors 
our audit committee has also reviewed our disclosures in this md a regarding fannie mae s critical accounting estimates 
allowance for loan losses and guaranty liability for mbs we establish an allowance for loan losses on single family and multifamily loans in our mortgage portfolio 
we maintain a guaranty liability for loan losses associated with the loans that back our mbs 
the guaranty liability covers our guaranty of both mbs held by us in our portfolio and outstanding mbs 
however  we use the same methodology to determine the amounts for our allowance and guaranty liability for mbs because the underlying credit risks are the same 
our allowance for loan losses and guaranty liability for mbs consist of the following key elements single family we evaluate various risk characteristics such as product type  original loan to value ratio  and loan age to determine the allowance for loan losses on single family mortgage loans and the guaranty liability for mbs backed by single family mortgage loans 
we estimate defaults for each risk characteristic based on historical experience and apply a historical severity to each risk category in accordance with financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for contingencies fas 
severity refers to the amount of loss suffered on a default relative to the unpaid principal balance of the loan 
we charge off single family loans when we foreclose on the loans 
multifamily we determine the allowance for loan losses on multifamily mortgage loans and guaranty liability for mbs backed by multifamily mortgage loans by separately evaluating loans that are impaired and all other loans 
impaired loans consist of loans that are not performing according to their original contractual terms 
for loans that we consider impaired  we apply financial accounting standard no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan fas to estimate the amount of impairment 
for all other loans  we apply fas to establish an allowance for loan losses and guaranty liability by rating each loan not individually evaluated for impairment and segmenting the loan into one of the main risk categories we use to monitor the multifamily portfolio 
we then apply historical default rates and a corresponding severity to the loans in each segment to estimate the probable loss amount at each balance sheet date 
we believe the accounting estimate related to our allowance for loan losses and guaranty liability for mbs is a critical accounting estimate because it requires us to make significant judgments about probable future losses in our mortgage credit book of business as of the balance sheet date based on assumptions that are uncertain 
we may have to increase or decrease the size of our overall allowance for loan losses and guaranty liability based on changes in delinquency levels  loss experience  economic conditions in areas of geographic concentration  and profile of mortgage characteristics 
different assumptions about default rates  severity  counterparty risk  and other factors that we could use in estimating our allowance for loan losses and guaranty liability could have a material effect on our results of operations 
we include the allowance for loan losses in the balance sheet under mortgage portfolio  net 
we include the guaranty liability for estimated losses on mbs held by us or other investors as a liability under guaranty liability for mbs

over the past five years  our combined allowance for loan losses and guaranty liability for mbs as a percentage of the mortgage credit book of business has steadily declined to 
percent in  from 
percent in  and 
percent in although our mortgage credit book of business has expanded 
this trend reflects our historically low level of severities on foreclosed properties and credit losses

basis points in  
basis points in  and 
basis points in we recorded a provision for losses of million  million  and million  respectively  in   and our provision represented between and percent of our pre tax reported income and core business earnings in each of the past three years 
management believes the combined balance of our allowance for loan losses and guaranty liability for mbs are adequate to absorb losses inherent in fannie mae s mortgage credit book of business 
deferred price adjustments when fannie mae buys mbs  loans  or mortgage related securities  we may not pay the seller the exact amount of the unpaid principal balance upb 
if we pay more than the upb and purchase the mortgage assets at a premium  the premium reduces the yield we recognize on the assets below the coupon amount 
if we pay less than the upb and purchase the mortgage assets at a discount  the discount increases the yield above the coupon amount 
in addition  we may charge an upfront payment in lieu of a higher guaranty fee for certain loan types that have higher credit risk 
to facilitate the pooling of mortgages into a fannie mae mbs  we also may adjust the monthly mbs guaranty fee rate that we receive by either negotiating an upfront cash disbursement to the lender a buy up or an upfront cash receipt from the lender a buy down when the mbs is formed 
we refer to the upfront payments or receipts as deferred guaranty fee price adjustments 
these amounts adjust our monthly guaranty fee so that the coupons on mbs are generally in increments of whole or half point interest rates  which tend to be more easily traded 
we recognize premiums  discounts  and other deferred purchase and guaranty fee price adjustments over the estimated life of purchased or guaranteed assets as an adjustment to income in accordance with financial accounting standard no

accordingly  we record buy ups paid on or after january  at fair value on our balance sheet with changes in fair value recorded in aoci 
we assess buy ups for other than temporary impairment in a manner similar to our assessment of impairment on other available for sale securities 
our change in accounting for buy ups does not change our fas income recognition model for the underlying asset  and it did not have a material effect on our financial statements for the year ended december  we amortize deferred premiums and discounts into interest income  which affects the results of our portfolio investment business 
the amortization of deferred guaranty fee price adjustments is included in guaranty fee income  which affects the results of our credit guaranty business 
we amortize premiums  discounts  and other deferred purchase price and guaranty fee price adjustments into income using the effective yield method  adjusted for prepayment activity 
we believe the accounting estimates related to deferred premium discount and deferred guaranty fee price adjustments are critical accounting estimates because they require us to make significant judgments and assumptions about borrower prepayment patterns in various interest rate environments that involve a significant degree of uncertainty 
we regularly evaluate whether it is necessary to change the estimated prepayment rates used in our amortization calculation based on changes in interest rates and expected mortgage prepayments 
we reassess our estimate of the sensitivity of prepayments to changes in interest rates and compare actual prepayments versus anticipated prepayments 
if changes are necessary  we recalculate the constant effective yield and adjust net interest income or guaranty fee income for the amount of premiums  discounts  and other deferred purchase price and guaranty fee price adjustments that would have been recorded if we had applied the new effective yield since acquisition of the mortgage assets or inception of a guaranty 
in general  decreases in mortgage interest rates tend to increase prepayment rates  which accelerates the amortization of deferred price adjustments

premium discount as shown in table  our mortgage portfolio had a net premium position of billion at december   compared with a net premium position of million at the end of and a net discount position of billion at year end we shifted to a net premium position from a net discount position at the end of as interest rates fell during and  the fair value of mortgages we purchased with higher weighted average coupons increased 
as a result  we paid premiums on a higher proportion of our mortgage purchases 
the billion net premium amount at december  excludes fair value purchase price adjustments related to mortgage commitments accounted for as derivatives under fas except for the million pre tax transition gain recorded from our july  adoption of fas  the amortization of our fair value purchase price adjustments is offset by an equal amount of amortization from accumulated other comprehensive income aoci and thus has no effect on our net income see md a portfolio investment business operations investments mortgage commitments 
amortization of deferred price adjustments related to our mortgage portfolio reduced reported net income by percent in and increased reported net income by percent in and percent in as mortgage rates rise  expected prepayment rates generally decrease  which slows the amortization of deferred price adjustments 
based on our prepayment sensitivity analysis  a basis point instantaneous increase in interest rates beyond the levels assumed in our base prepayment rate models would have slowed our amortization of net premium discount amounts  which would have increased reported net interest income by less than percent in and had virtually no impact on and reported net interest income 
in contrast  a decrease in mortgage rates tends to accelerate prepayments and our recognition of deferred price adjustments 
a basis point decrease in interest rates at december  would have had virtually no impact on the net premium expense recognized in or reported net interest income 
during and  amortization of deferred price adjustments related to our mortgage portfolio resulted in the recognition of net discount amounts  which increased reported net interest income 
the acceleration of amortization of net discount amounts during and from a basis point decrease in interest rates would have increased our reported net interest income in each year by approximately percent 
this sensitivity analysis is only one component of fannie mae s overall net interest income at risk assessment 
it does not include the effect of new business or the impact of changes in interest rates on our debt costs or net cash flows related to our derivatives contracts 
a comprehensive analysis of the impact of interest rate changes on projected net interest income is presented in md a portfolio investment business operations interest rate risk management 
deferred guaranty fees our net discount position on deferred guaranty fee price adjustments increased to billion at december   from a net discount position of billion and million at december  and  respectively 
a net discount position reflects that the combined up front payments we collect in lieu of higher guaranty fees on more risky loans and the up front payments we receive from lenders in exchange for a lower guaranty fee rate over time exceed the up front payments we make to lenders in exchange for a higher guaranty fee rate over time 
a net premium position would indicate that our upfront payments to lenders exceed the upfront fees collected from lenders 
the significant increase in our net discount position on deferred guaranty fees in and was largely attributable to an increase in up front payments collected on loans with higher credit risk 
amortization of deferred guaranty fee price adjustments increased guaranty fee income by million in percent of reported net income and million in percent of reported net income and reduced guaranty fee income by million in percent of reported net income 
we accelerated our amortization of deferred guaranty fee price adjustments in in response to the dramatic increase in mortgage prepayments resulting from the record level of refinancings 
similarly  the upward adjustment to guaranty fee income in versus was primarily related to a faster pace of recognition of deferred discount amounts due to lower mortgage rates and accelerated prepayments 
we also made enhancements to our amortization model in to better reflect the impact of interest rates on prepayment behavior that accelerated the recognition of net discount amounts and increased our guaranty income 
based on our prepayment sensitivity analysis for deferred guaranty fee price adjustments  a basis point instantaneous increase in interest rates at the end of each year beyond the levels assumed in our base prepayment rate models would have reduced guaranty fee income by approximately percent in and increased guaranty fee income by less than percent in a basis point instantaneous decrease in interest rates at the end of each year would have increased our guaranty fee income by approximately percent in and percent in and reduced our guaranty fee income by approximately percent in a basis point instantaneous decrease in interest rates would have a more significant impact on the amortization of our deferred guaranty fee price adjustments because mortgage prepayments generally tend to be more sensitive to declines in interest rates than increases 
time value of purchased options fannie mae issues various types of debt to finance the acquisition of mortgages 
we typically use derivative instruments to supplement our issuance of debt in the capital markets and hedge against the effect of fluctuations in interest rates on our debt costs to preserve our net interest margin 
with the adoption of fas  we began recording all derivatives on our balance sheet at estimated fair value 
we record changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges in aoci 
we recognize in our reported earnings changes in the fair value of the time value associated with purchased options and changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges 
fannie mae s purchased options portfolio currently includes swaptions and caps  which are discussed in more detail under md a portfolio investment business operations funding derivative instruments 
the total fair value for purchased options consists of the time value plus the intrinsic value 
under fas  the mark to market on the time value component of our purchased options flows through our reported earnings 
the time value of purchased options will vary from period to period with changes in interest rates  expected interest rate volatility  and derivative activity 
however  the total expense included in earnings over the original expected life of an option will generally equal the initial option premium paid 
since adopting fas  we have reported significant fluctuations in our reported net income because of unrealized fluctuations in the estimated time value of purchased options 
purchased options expense totaled billion in  billion in  and million in our methodology for valuing purchased options is based on commonly used market conventions and assumptions 
we obtain quoted mid market prices for a benchmark set of interest rate options  which include caps and swaptions 
based on these quoted market prices  we apply our valuation model  which effectively utilizes these prices to estimate the fair value of our purchased options 
we then allocate the fair value of our purchased options into the time value and intrinsic value components 
because the benchmark securities are only a subset of the purchased options that we hold  the estimation of time value is not exact and can vary depending on the market source and methodology used 
this variation could have a material effect on our reported net income 
hence  we believe our estimate of the time value component of purchased options is a critical accounting estimate 
to gauge the potential sensitivity of changes in the estimated time value of our purchased options  we recalculated our estimates based on plus and minus changes of percent and percent in the time value portion of our outstanding purchased options at december   and these changes are generally greater than changes we have observed historically in our valuation process 
table shows the potential effect on our reported results from these changes in time value 
an increase in the estimated fair value of the time value portion of our purchased options would reduce purchased options expense and increase our reported net income and stockholders equity  while a decrease in the estimated time value would increase purchased options expense and reduce our reported net income and stockholders equity 
table impact of changes in the time value of purchased options percentage effect of change in time value on time value of purchased options reported net income total stockholders equity dollars in millions time value of purchased options purchased options expense effect of change in time value change in time value reflects after tax effect of time value adjustment based on applicable federal income tax rate of percent

gaap purchased options expense reported in our income statement 
the estimated fair value of the time value portion of our outstanding purchased options  which is included on our balance sheet under derivatives in gain positions  totaled billion  billion  and billion at december    and  respectively 
table shows that a plus or minus change of percent at the end of each year in the reported time value portion of our purchased options would have changed our reported purchased options expense by million in  million in  and million in  which would have changed our reported net income by percent in  percent in  and percent in the effect on stockholders equity of a percent change in the time value portion of our purchased options would be approximately percent at december    and our core business earnings results would not be affected by these estimates because we amortize purchased options premiums over the original expected life of the option in measuring core business earnings and do not include mark to market changes in the fair value of purchased options 
other than temporary impairment we regularly monitor all of fannie mae s investments for changes in fair value and record impairment when we judge a decline in fair value to be other than temporary 
an investment is considered impaired if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value 
when an investment appears to be impaired  we evaluate whether the impairment is other than temporary 
an other than temporary decline in fair value is generally considered to have occurred if it is probable that an investor will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the investment security 
estimating the fair value of our investments is a critical part of our impairment evaluation process 
the estimated fair value of our mortgage related and nonmortgage securities  which represent the majority of fannie mae s investments  is based on quoted market prices for specific securities where available or quoted prices for similar securities 
the fair value of our mortgage related and nonmortgage securities will change from period to period with changes in interest rates and changes in credit performance 
we show gross unrealized gains and losses on our mortgage related and nonmortgage investment securities at december    and in the portfolio investment business operations section of md a 
when market quotations are not readily available because of the nature of the security or illiquid market conditions as occurred during the downturn in the manufactured housing sector we estimate the fair value based primarily on the present value of future cash flows  adjusted for the quality of the rating of the securities  prepayment assumptions  and other factors  such as credit enhancements fannie mae has to offset potential losses 
determining the fair value where there is little or no market liquidity is a subjective process involving significant management judgment because of inherent uncertainties related to the actual future performance of assets underlying our securities 
changes in various assumptions used in our cash flow analyses can result in significant changes in valuation 
we update our assumptions on an ongoing basis based on changes in market conditions and actual performance of the assets underlying the securities 
determining whether a decline in fair value is other than temporary often involves estimating the outcome of future events and accordingly requires significant management judgment 
we consider various factors  both subjective and objective  in determining whether we should recognize an other than temporary impairment charge 
as a primary indicator of other than temporary impairment  we consider the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than our book value coupled with our intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow us to recover our contractual principal and interest 
our assessment of other than temporary impairment focuses primarily on issuer or collateral specific factors  such as operational and financing cash flows  rating agency actions  and business and financial outlook 
we incorporate the impact of any credit enhancements in our assessment 
we also evaluate broader industry and sector performance indicators 
we determine other than temporary impairment based on information available as of each balance sheet date 
new information or economic developments in the future could lead to additional impairment 
we monitor our investments within capital risk limits approved by management and the board 
we actively perform market research  monitor market conditions  and segment our investments by credit risk to minimize any impairment risk 
if we believe that the impairment of a security or other investment is other than temporary  we recognize the amount as a realized loss in fee and other income  net and write down the carrying value of the investment to fair value 
once we have recognized an other than temporary impairment  we do not adjust the carrying value of the investment for any subsequent increases in fair value 
we recognized other than temporary impairment totaling million in  million in  and million in core business earnings and business segment results management relies primarily on core business earnings  a supplemental non gaap measure developed in conjunction with our adoption of fas  to evaluate fannie mae s financial performance and measure the results of our lines of business 
we discuss these measures further in this section  provide information on our business segments  and explain our results and risk management in terms of the underlying businesses 
core business earnings we delivered double digit growth in core business earnings for the th consecutive year in core business earnings increased percent over to billion due primarily to exceptional growth in our book of business and net interest margin 
our core business earnings in grew percent over to billion  also due to strong growth in our book of business and net interest margin growth 
the extreme financial market volatility during resulted in significant variability in the growth of our business throughout the year and caused the growth rates of our two books of business to diverge substantially 
while low interest rates during the first half of the year spurred record mortgage originations  aggressive purchasing of mortgages by banks and other investors resulted in relatively narrow mortgage to debt spreads and lower than expected sales in the secondary market 
our portfolio investment business grew our mortgage portfolio by percent by maintaining disciplined portfolio growth throughout the year  purchasing mortgage assets when spreads exceeded our hurdle rates and when supply was available in the market 
our opportunistic and disciplined purchasing approach resulted in a sporadic pattern of portfolio growth during the year  including two quarters of declines that were more than offset by annualized growth of over percent in the third quarter 
while we curbed our purchases at certain points during the year in response to narrow mortgage to debt spreads  outstanding mbs for our credit guaranty business grew percent during our credit guaranty business received a substantial benefit due to the record amount of refinancing during the year  which fueled our mbs issuance 
financial highlights include record business volume of  billion  up percent over percent growth in our combined book of business gross mortgage portfolio and outstanding mbs  compared with percent growth in core taxable equivalent revenues of billion  up percent over record core net interest income of billion  a percent increase basis point increase in the net interest margin to percent record guaranty fee income of billion  up percent record fee and other income of million  an percent increase credit related expenses of million  compared with million in losses of billion from the call and repurchase of billion of outstanding debt  compared with losses related to similar activities of million in core business earnings differs from reported net income by using a different method of recognizing the period cost of purchased options 
our core business earnings measure excludes the unpredictable volatility in the time value of purchased options that is included in our reported net income because we generally intend to hold these options to maturity  and we do not believe the period to period variability in our reported net income from changes in the time value of our purchased options accurately reflects the underlying risks or economics of our hedging strategy 
core business earnings includes amortization of purchased options premiums over the original expected life of the options and any accelerated expense resulting from options extinguished prior to exercise or expiration 
the net amount of purchased options amortization expense recorded under our core business earnings measure will equal the net amount of purchased options expense ultimately recorded under fas in our reported net income over the life of our options 
however  our amortization treatment is more consistent with the accounting for embedded options in our callable debt and more accurately reflects the underlying economics of our use of purchased options as a substitute for issuing callable debt two alternate hedging strategies that are economically very similar but require different accounting treatment 
while core business earnings is not a substitute for gaap net income  we rely on core business earnings in operating our business because we believe core business earnings provides our management and investors with a better measure of our financial results and better reflects our risk management strategies than our gaap net income 
management also relies on several other non gaap performance measures related to core business earnings to evaluate fannie mae s performance 
these key performance measures include core taxable equivalent revenues  core net interest income  and net interest margin 
our core business earnings measures are not defined terms within gaap and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
although we rely on core business earnings to measure and evaluate fannie mae s period to period results of operations  we do not use core business earnings in calculating our regulatory core capital and total capital measures 
we calculate these measures based on stockholders equity reported in our financial statements  which includes retained earnings based on our reported gaap net income 
we consider our core capital and total capital levels in establishing our dividend policies because they are critical in determining the amount of capital available for distribution to shareholders 
while our core business earnings measures should not be construed by investors as an alternative to net income and other measures determined in accordance with gaap  they are critical performance indicators for fannie mae s management 
core business earnings is the primary financial performance measure used by fannie mae s management not only in developing the financial plans of our lines of business and tracking results  but also in establishing corporate performance targets and determining incentive compensation 
in addition  the investment analyst community has traditionally relied on our core business earnings measures to evaluate fannie mae s earnings performance and to issue earnings guidance 
we believe these measures also can serve as valuable assessment tools for investors to judge the quality of our earnings because they provide more consistent accounting and reporting for economically similar interest rate risk hedging transactions  which allows investors to more readily identify sustainable trends and gauge potential future earnings trends 
table shows our line of business and consolidated core business earnings results for   and we evaluate the results of our business lines as though each were a stand alone business 
hence  we allocate certain income and expenses to each line of business for purposes of business segment reporting 
income is also allocated from the portfolio investment business to the credit guaranty business for the following activities managing the credit risk on mortgage related assets held by the portfolio investment business 
the portfolio investment business compensates the credit guaranty business through a fee comparable to an mbs guaranty fee 
these fees are recognized as guaranty fee income by the credit guaranty business 
similarly  all credit expenses related to credit losses on loans and on mbs and other mortgage related securities held in fannie mae s mortgage portfolio are allocated to the credit guaranty business for business segment reporting purposes 
net interest income for the credit guaranty business is net of charges paid to the portfolio investment business for forgone interest on delinquent loans 
providing capital to the portfolio investment business 
the portfolio investment business also compensates the credit guaranty business for the temporary use of capital generated by the credit guaranty business  which the portfolio investment business uses to fund investments 
this compensation is classified as net interest income 
temporarily investing principal and interest payments on loans underlying mbs and other mortgage related securities prior to remittance to investors 
interest income on the temporary investment of these funds is allocated to the credit guaranty business

represents changes in the fair value of the time value of purchased options recorded in accordance with fas we exclude this amount from our core business earnings measure because the period to period fluctuations in the time value portion of our options do not reflect the economics of our current risk management strategy  which generally is to hold our purchased options to maturity or exercise date 
consequently  we do not expect to realize the period to period fluctuations in time value

this non recurring amount represents the one time transition gain recorded upon the adoption of fas on july  this non recurring amount represents the one time transition gain recorded upon the adoption of fas on january  we exclude the transition gain from core business earnings because it relates to unrealized gains on purchased options that were recorded when we adopted fas the only difference in core business earnings and reported net income relates to the fas accounting treatment for purchased options  which affects our portfolio investment business 
the fas related reconciling items between our core business earnings and reported results have no effect on our credit guaranty business 
while the reconciling items to derive our core business earnings are significant components in understanding and assessing our reported results and financial performance  investors may not be able to directly discern the underlying economic impact of our interest rate risk management strategies without our core business results 
we believe our core business earnings measures help to improve transparency and enhance investors understanding of our operations  as well as facilitate trend analysis 
the specific fas related adjustments affecting our portfolio investment business are identified and explained in table core business earnings does not adjust for any other accounting effects related to the application of fas or other accounting standards under us gaap 
the guaranty fee income that we allocate to the credit guaranty business for managing most of the credit risk on mortgage assets held by the portfolio investment business is offset by a corresponding guaranty fee expense allocation to the portfolio investment business in our line of business results 
thus  there is no inter segment elimination adjustment between our total line of business guaranty fee income and our reported guaranty fee income 
we allocate transaction fees received for structuring and facilitating securities transactions for our customers primarily to our portfolio investment business 
we allocate technology related fees received for providing desktop underwriter and other on line services and fees received for providing credit enhancement alternatives to our customers primarily to our credit guaranty business 
as discussed in the funding section of md a under portfolio investment business operations  we use various funding alternatives  including option based derivative instruments  that produce similar economic results to manage interest rate risk and protect against the prepayment option in mortgages 
the adjustments made to our portfolio investment business to derive core business earnings provide more consistent accounting treatment for purchased options and the embedded option in callable debt securities economically equivalent funding transactions by allocating the cost of purchased options over the original expected life of the option in a manner similar to our accounting for options in callable debt 
we calculate the original expected life of european options based on the exercise date 
we calculate the original expected life of american options based on the expected life at the time the option is purchased 
there is a difference in the original expected lives of european and american options because european options are exercisable only on one specific date in the future  while american options are exercisable any time after a specific future date 
the actual life of an american option may differ from our original expected life because of movements in interest rates subsequent to the exercise date that may affect the value and benefit of exercising the option at a given time 
we can protect our net interest margin against changes in interest rates by either issuing callable debt to fund the purchase of mortgages or using a combination of callable debt  purchased options  and noncallable debt 
we generally use the method that helps us achieve our desired funding flexibility and lowest cost 
if interest rates fall and our mortgages prepay  we have the option of retiring callable debt and issuing debt at a lower rate to preserve our interest spread on new mortgage purchases 
if interest rates fall and we have instead used a combination of noncallable debt and purchased options such as a swaption that would allow us to enter into a pay variable interest rate swap we can exercise our option to allow us to pay a variable or lower interest rate and receive a fixed rate of interest 
the fixed rate of interest that we receive would offset the cost of our noncallable  fixed rate debt 
this hedging strategy would lower our funding costs and preserve our net interest margin as interest rates fall in a manner very similar to retiring callable debt and issuing new  lower cost debt 
however  because the accounting for this hedging strategy is different under fas  the cost of the purchased option would not be reflected in our reported net interest yield 
we record the change in the fair value of the time value of the purchased option as a separate amount in our income statement 
on the other hand  if interest rates increase  we would not exercise the option to call debt since the cost of issuing new debt would be higher 
similarly  we would not exercise the option provided by a purchased swaption to enter a pay variable swap because under a higher interest rate environment  we could enter into a similar transaction with more favorable terms 
see md a portfolio investment business operations funding derivative instruments for further discussion on how we use purchased options to simulate callable debt 
if we issue noncallable debt and purchased options to fund the purchase of mortgages and protect against the prepayment option in mortgages  we are required under fas to record the unrealized period to period fluctuations in the changes in time value of the purchased options in earnings 
if instead  we issue callable debt to fund the purchase of the same mortgages  the expense related to the option in our callable debt would be recognized ratably over the option period as part of interest expense 
although the two transactions produce similar economic results  gaap requires different accounting treatment 
under our core business earnings measure  the accounting treatment for purchased options is consistent and also comparable to the accounting treatment applied to these items in periods prior to the adoption of fas the table below compares our core business earnings to our reported net income for   and and shows the significant variability in our reported net income  which is due primarily to the gaap accounting for the time value of purchased options

core net interest income core net interest income and our related net interest margin are supplemental non gaap measures that management uses to evaluate fannie mae s performance 
core net interest income includes our reported net interest income adjusted for the non gaap amortization of purchased options premiums over the original expected life of the options to reflect the cost associated with using purchased options to hedge the borrowers prepayment option in mortgages 
we also calculate core net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis to determine our net interest margin 
we believe these measures are beneficial in understanding and analyzing fannie mae s performance because they reflect consistent accounting for purchased options and callable debt  two of the principal instruments we use interchangeably to hedge the prepayment option in our mortgage investments 
these measures also consistently reflect income from taxable and tax exempt investments 
table reconciles taxable equivalent core net interest income to our reported net interest income and presents an analysis of our net interest margin 
our taxable equivalent core net interest income and net interest margin are significantly different than our reported taxable equivalent net interest income and net interest yield because our core measures include the amortization of our purchased options premiums over the original estimated life of the option  which is not in accordance with gaap

business segment results portfolio investment business earnings our portfolio investment business generated core business earnings of billion in  compared with billion in  and billion in core business earnings for the portfolio investment business grew percent in  compared with percent in this growth was driven primarily by strong growth in core net interest income  partially offset by a significant increase in losses from debt extinguishments used to manage interest rate risk and lower debt costs in the future 
core net interest income rose from growth in our average investment balance and net interest margin 
although liquidations reached a record high during  we were able to grow our mortgage portfolio because of record portfolio purchases of billion during the year as we took advantage of opportunities provided by attractive mortgage to debt spreads at different points during the year 
however  the slowdown in refinance activity and increased demand for mortgage investments in the second half of resulted in tighter mortgage to debt spreads and sporadic portfolio growth during percent growth during the first quarter of  a contraction of percent during the second quarter  an increase of percent during the third quarter  followed by a decline of percent in the fourth quarter 
as a result of our disciplined growth approach  we ended with a marked decline in retained commitments  which is likely to result in negative portfolio growth during the first quarter of we expect that mortgage spreads will move back to more normal levels as the year progresses  which  combined with our expectations of a continued strong purchase market  should result in our being able to achieve double digit portfolio growth during the portfolio investment business was able to increase our net margin to an above trend level by capitalizing on opportunities presented by the decline in interest rates that began in to temporarily reduce our debt costs relative to yields on assets 
the portfolio investment business has replaced significant amounts of called or maturing debt over the past three years particularly during with lower cost  shorter term debt more quickly than our mortgage assets matured or prepaid 
these actions temporarily reduced our debt cost relative to asset yield and elevated our net interest margin beginning in our net interest margin remained elevated during  averaging percent  due to the continued benefits of historically low interest rates  the steep yield curve  and high levels of anticipated refinancing 
we had expected our net interest margin to begin to decline in early as interest rates leveled off or moved higher 
however  interest rates dropped further during the second quarter of  resulting in an increase in projected mortgage liquidations 
as a result  we maintained an unusually high percentage of short term financing at a lower cost for longer than we had anticipated  which reduced our interest expense and caused a further temporary increase in our net interest margin 
during the second half of  our net interest margin began to decline as expected as the record low mortgage interest rates during the earlier part of the year drove heavy liquidations of older  higher coupon mortgages  which have been replaced with new mortgages at lower coupon rates 
credit guaranty business earnings core business earnings for our credit guaranty business grew percent in to billion and percent in to billion 
the increases in and in core business earnings for the credit guaranty business were driven primarily by a percent and percent increase  respectively  in guaranty fee income 
guaranty fee income increased in largely due to percent growth in our average mortgage credit book of business and a basis point increase in the average fee rate to basis points 
the increase in the average fee rate was a result of faster revenue recognition of deferred price components due to accelerated prepayments from the unprecedented level of refinancings together with increased risk based pricing fees 
guaranty fee income increased in primarily due to percent growth in our average mortgage credit book of business and a basis point increase in the average fee rate to basis points 
the average fee rate for our credit guaranty business includes the effect of guaranty fee income allocated to the credit guaranty business for managing the credit risk on most of the mortgage assets held by the portfolio investment business 
it therefore differs from our consolidated average effective guaranty fee rate  which excludes guaranty fees on mbs held in our portfolio because these fees are reported as interest income 
record expansion of residential mortgage debt outstanding during and  combined with our ability to offer reliable  low cost mortgage funds  fueled growth in our mortgage credit book of business 
the demand for housing was strong throughout and  and borrowers also took advantage of the low interest rate environment to refinance their mortgages and extract equity from the appreciation in their homes 
residential mortgage debt outstanding increased percent in to trillion  percent in to trillion  and percent in to trillion 
refinancings represented percent of total market originations in  percent in  and percent in growth in fannie mae s mortgage credit book of business outpaced growth in residential mortgage debt outstanding during   and in  we announced increases in the upfront price adjustment fannie mae charges on cash out refinance mortgages with loan to value ltv ratios between and percent that were implemented during as a result of these increases  which better compensate us for the higher risk on these loans  the upfront price adjustments on cash out refinance mortgages we purchase or guarantee with ltv ratios greater than percent ranges from to basis points 
the increased price adjustments  which are allocated to our credit guaranty business  have resulted in a modest increase in our guaranty fees 
corporate financial disciplines we completed a comprehensive review and assessment of our corporate financial disciplines during in conjunction with this assessment  we announced the following internal financial discipline objectives  which identify more explicitly what our overall risk discipline is designed to accomplish 
to maintain a standalone risk to the government credit rating from standard and poor s s p of at least aa  and to maintain a standalone bank financial strength credit rating from moody s investors service moody s of at least a our senior debt securities carry aaa aaa ratings 
we also are given standalone credit ratings by both standard and poor s and moody s 
these standalone ratings are important external indicators of fannie mae s intrinsic financial strength 
to sufficiently capitalize and hedge our portfolio investment and credit guaranty businesses so that each is able to withstand internal and external stress tests set to at least a aa aa standard the most common way that regulators  rating agencies and financial analysts judge the adequacy of a company s capital and the quality of its risk management practices is by assessing how well that company would perform under conditions of extreme and prolonged economic and financial stress 
our regulator uses a quarterly risk based capital stress test to evaluate our capital adequacy  and it makes the results of these tests public 
this risk based capital test provides fannie mae with a direct regulatory incentive to maintain a low risk profile 
we traditionally have used stress tests internally as well 
to keep our mortgage interest rate and credit risks low enough that over time our core business earnings are less variable than the median of all aa aa and aaa aaa s p companies following a review of the net income pattern over the past ten years of all s p companies that were able to maintain ratings of aa aa or higher during the entire period  we set as an objective to manage our interest rate and credit risks so that fannie mae s long term earnings variability remains below the median of all aa aa and aaa aaa companies 
in conjunction with our stress test standards  we believe that meeting this income stability objective will allow us to maintain our standalone ratings with a comfortable margin of safety  and possibly to improve them 
these financial disciplines led us to adopt an internal objective for our portfolio investment business to maintain the mortgage portfolio s duration gap within a range of plus or minus six months substantially all of the time see md a portfolio investment business operations interest rate risk management for further discussion 
for our credit guaranty business  these objectives imply continued use of the risk mitigation activities designed to help fannie mae achieve stable earnings growth and a competitive return on equity over time see md a credit guaranty business operations credit risk management for further discussion 
the financial disciplines act as supplemental governors of management discretion in a portion of our businesses within the constraints imposed by our capital and safety and soundness regulations 
we are continuing to work toward implementing and maintaining these recently announced financial disciplines 
meeting all of these objectives is a major corporate initiative for we will continue to monitor rigorously our capital position relative to the risks we take in our businesses and adjust the hedges in those businesses to ensure that the capital we hold relative to the risks we take is consistent with achieving these objectives 
portfolio investment business operations our portfolio investment business has primary responsibility for fannie mae s investing and funding activities and managing our interest rate risk 
these activities are discussed further in this section

at december   approximately percent of these securities were serviced by green tree investment holdings llc during  green tree investment holdings llc succeeded conseco finance  corp

due to weakness in the manufactured housing sector and financial difficulties experienced by certain manufactured housing loan servicers  the major ratings agencies downgraded several of these securities in and on december   moody s investor service downgraded classes of manufactured housing securities serviced by green tree investment holdings  reflecting their views on deteriorating collateral performance 
as of december   billion of non investment grade securities held or guaranteed by fannie mae were affected by the december  downgrade action by moody s 
the percentage of securities rated investment grade or better fell to percent at december  as a result of credit downgrades during as a result of additional credit downgrades during the first quarter of  the percentage of securities rated investment grade or better fell to percent as of march  at the end of  substantially all of these securities had investment grade ratings 
in response to the rating downgrades over the past year and general condition of the manufactured housing sector  we have regularly assessed the recoverability of scheduled principal and interest amounts on certain of these securities to determine if any were other than temporarily impaired 
our assessment is based on either market prices or  if the securities are illiquid  internal cash flow analyses 
we model the projected cash flows of securities that have suffered a significant decline in fair value by calculating the potential underlying cash flows of the securities  incorporating issuer and pool specific loan performance data as well as information on the manufactured housing sector in general 
based on our analyses  we have recorded other than temporary impairment on certain securities included in our portfolio of million in  which is included in fee and other income 
to date  we have recognized other than temporary impairment of million on our investments in manufactured housing securities 
we continue to rigorously monitor these securities and assess appropriate risk factors to determine the need to record any additional impairment 
despite recent downgrades  the market liquidity and price performance of the manufactured housing bond sector showed signs of improvements during the last quarter of however  changes in events or circumstances  such as the performance of the underlying manufactured housing loan collateral and the financial strength of servicers  will influence future credit ratings and may affect market prices or our projected cash flow analyses 
while it may be necessary to record additional other than temporary impairment on these securities in the future  management believes that any potential future impairment related to these securities will not have a material adverse effect on fannie mae s operating results 
mortgage commitments as an integral part of our portfolio investment business  we routinely enter into forward purchase commitments that allow us to lock in the future delivery of mortgage loans or mortgage related securities for our mortgage portfolio at a fixed price or yield 
our purchase commitments are generally short term in nature with a fixed expiration date 
the commitment ends when the loans or securities are delivered to fannie mae or the commitment period expires 
retained commitments are a leading indicator of future acquisition volume and a key driver of earnings growth for our portfolio investment business 
although our primary goal is to purchase mortgage loans or mortgage related securities for fannie mae s portfolio  we may enter into forward commitments to purchase mortgage loans or mortgage related securities that we decide not to retain in our portfolio 
in these instances  the forward purchase commitment generally has an offsetting sell commitment with an investor other than fannie mae 
as a result of our july  adoption of fas  we are required to account for the majority of our commitments to purchase mortgage loans and to purchase or sell mortgage related securities  which we enter into in the normal course of business  as derivatives 
during the commitment period  we now record commitments to purchase or sell mortgage loans or mortgage related securities on our balance sheet at fair value and record changes in the fair value either in aoci or earnings  depending on whether we apply hedge accounting  the hedge designation if we elect hedge accounting  and the applicable accounting treatment under fas when the commitment ultimately settles  we record purchased loans and securities on our balance sheet at fair value 
fas applies prospectively to whole loan mortgage purchase commitments entered into or modified after june  and purchase and sale commitments for when issued mortgage securities entered into after or outstanding at june  we recorded an after tax transition gain of million as a result of the july  adoption of fas the transition gain primarily relates to recording the fair value of open portfolio purchase commitments for when issued securities totaling billion at june  the offset to the transition gain results in recording a fair value purchase price adjustment on our balance sheet that will amortize into future earnings as a reduction of interest income over the estimated life of the underlying mortgage securities retained in our portfolio 
subsequent to june   we designated and accounted for these commitments as cash flow hedges of forecasted transactions 
prior to the adoption of fas  we accounted for the majority of our mortgage related commitments as off balance sheet arrangements and recorded purchased loans and securities on our balance sheet at settlement based on the purchase price 
we disclosed the outstanding notional amount of purchase commitments retained in our portfolio 
consequently  our previous disclosure of off balance sheet commitments does not include commitments not retained in fannie mae s portfolio 
following is a more detailed discussion of our mortgage commitment activities and the related accounting under fas retained commitments fannie mae typically enters into forward commitments to purchase mortgage loans or mortgage related securities for our mortgage portfolio at a fixed price 
purchase commitments typically require mandatory delivery and are subject to the payment of pair off fees for non delivery 
we also may sell mbs from our portfolio in various financial transactions  including forward trades 
we now account for all mandatory forward purchase and sale commitments as derivatives 
forward purchase and sale commitments protect us from changes in interest rates between the time the commitment is entered into and the transaction occurs by allowing us to lock in the purchase or sale price of forecasted transactions 
commencing july   we have designated these commitments as cash flow hedges to hedge the variability due to changes in interest rates of cash flows related to our forecasted mortgage portfolio transactions 
accordingly  changes in the fair value of the commitment are recorded in aoci  to the extent effective 
when we settle a purchase commitment  we record the purchase at fair value 
the difference between the purchase price and fair value fair value purchase price adjustment is expected to equal the amount recorded in aoci at settlement 
we amortize the amount recorded in aoci and the offsetting fair value purchase price adjustment into earnings as a component of interest income over the estimated life of the loans or securities 
because the amortization amounts are equal and offsetting  we do not expect any effect on our income statement 
when we settle a sale commitment  we recognize the deferred aoci amount into income as a component of the gain or loss on sale 
the notional balance of outstanding retained commitments  which are net of portfolio sell commitments  was billion at december  non retained commitments fannie mae also buys loans or securities that we do not retain in our portfolio 
the interest rate risk associated with non retained purchase commitments is economically hedged with offsetting sale commitments 
we currently do not intend to apply hedge accounting when we expect these offsetting transactions to settle at the same time 
consequently  the mark to market gains and losses on these commitments are recorded in earnings during the commitment period 
because the settlement dates  underlying securities  and amounts are offsetting  we expect the gains and losses to substantially offset and have a minimal impact on fannie mae s earnings 
in some cases  a counterparty may fulfill an mbs purchase commitment by delivering mortgage loans to us prior to the securitization 
we may use the mbs created from the securitization of these loans to fulfill a forward commitment to sell mbs to a third party 
we include these loans on our balance sheet under loans held for securitization or sale 
when this occurs  we intend to designate the forward sale commitment as a fair value hedge of the corresponding loans held for securitization and sale 
accordingly  we will record changes in the fair value of the forward sale commitment in earnings to offset changes in the fair value of the related loans 
we also expect these gains and losses to largely offset with a minimal effect on our earnings 
table shows the fair value  outstanding notional amount  and average remaining contractual maturity of our outstanding mortgage commitments at december  table mortgage commitments december  average remaining fair notional contractual value amount maturity dollars in millions forward mortgage loan and mortgage related security purchase commitments  days forward mortgage related security sell commitments we discuss the derivative instruments we use to manage interest rate risk and supplement our issuance of debt in md a portfolio investment business operations funding derivative instruments and provide additional information on all transactions accounted for as derivatives in the notes to financial statements 
the primary credit risk associated with our mortgage commitment transactions is that counterparties either will not sell or purchase loans or securities to fulfill their forward commitments 
we believe the credit risk related to outstanding mortgage commitments is much less than for outstanding loans or securities because commitment transactions are very short term in nature 
our lender customers account for the majority of fannie mae s credit risk on commitment transactions 
we control fannie mae s risk of loss by subjecting our lender customers to credit reviews and assigning counterparty credit limits based on our risk assessment where appropriate 
we monitor our commitment counterparties by performing quarterly credit reviews and updating trading limits based on these reviews 
liquid investments our liquid investments include cash and cash equivalents  nonmortgage investments  and loans held for securitization or sale 
liquid investments serve as fannie mae s primary source of liquidity and an investment vehicle for our surplus capital 
we obtain liquidity as necessary from our liquid investments through maturity of short term investments or the sale of assets 
we can use these funds as necessary for liquidity purposes or to reinvest in readily marketable  high credit quality securities that can be sold to raise cash 
our liquid investments totaled billion at december   compared with billion and billion at december  and  respectively 
at the end of  our liquid investments were at the highest level of the past three years because of delayed settlement of portfolio purchase commitments  which resulted in additional temporary capital for short term investment

concurrent with the september  implementation of our new risk based capital rule  we reclassified securities in our nonmortgage investment portfolio that had an amortized cost of billion from held to maturity to available for sale in accordance with fas these nonmortgage securities had gross unrealized gains of million and unrealized losses of million at the time of this noncash transfer

funding as part of our disciplined interest rate risk management strategy  our portfolio investment business issues a variety of noncallable and callable debt securities in the domestic and global capital markets in a wide range of maturities to meet our large and consistent funding needs 
we use derivative instruments to supplement our issuance of debt in the capital markets and manage interest rate risk 
we strive to structure debt products that match the needs of our portfolio with the interests of debt investors 
a description of our principal debt securities and how our use of derivatives affects our funding follows 
debt securities benchmark securities program our benchmark securities program encompasses large  regularly scheduled issues of noncallable and callable debt securities designed to provide enhanced liquidity to investors while reducing the relative cost of debt 
by issuing benchmark securities  we have consolidated much of our debt issuances from a large number of smaller  unscheduled issues to a smaller number of larger  more liquid scheduled issues 
during and  we issued noncallable and callable benchmark securities in every month 
benchmark bills served as our weekly source for three month and six month discount debt issuances during the year 
we also issued one year benchmark bills on a biweekly schedule during and our issuances of benchmark bills totaled billion  billion  and billion in   and  respectively 
issuances of benchmark bonds and benchmark notes totaled billion  billion  and billion  respectively  during the same period 
benchmark notes have maturities of one to ten years  and benchmark bonds have maturities of more than ten years 
we reintroduced fannie mae s callable benchmark notes in june and issued billion of these securities in  billion in  and billion in discount notes and other debt securities we also issue other debt securities outside fannie mae s benchmark securities program 
these debt securities have various maturities  interest rates  and call provisions 
we issue short term debt securities called discount notes outside of our benchmark bills program 
we sell discount notes at a market discount from the principal amount payable at maturity 
they have maturities ranging from overnight to days from the date of issuance and are available in minimum amounts of  we issued trillion  trillion  and trillion of discount notes during  and  respectively 
outstanding discount notes increased to billion at december  from billion at year end we also issue callable medium term notes 
callable debt plays an important role in helping to manage prepayment risk inherent in our mortgage portfolio 
we issued billion  billion  billion of callable medium term notes during   and  respectively 
subordinated debt as part of our voluntary safety and soundness initiatives announced in october  we began issuing subordinated benchmark notes in the first quarter of on a periodic basis  which created a new class of fixed income investments for investors under the benchmark securities program 
we issued subordinated debt securities totaling billion  billion  and billion during  and  respectively 
outstanding subordinated benchmark notes totaled billion at december   versus billion at december  we met our voluntary initiative of issuing sufficient subordinated debt to bring the sum of total capital and outstanding subordinated debt to at least percent of on balance sheet assets  after providing adequate capital to support off balance sheet mbs  by the end of total debt outstanding increased percent to billion from billion at december  table shows a comparison of our debt issuances and repayments for   and  and the amount  cost  and term to repricing of total debt outstanding at the end of each year

in addition  we continued to call significant amounts of debt in as a result of the sharp decline in interest rates that began in we called billion in debt and interest rate swaps in  compared with billion in  and billion in we reissued much of this debt with short term maturities in anticipation of the expected increase in mortgage liquidations

derivative instruments why we use derivatives derivatives are important in helping us to manage interest rate risk and supplement our issuance of debt in the capital markets 
we are an end user of derivatives and do not take speculative positions with derivatives or any other financial instrument 
we only use derivatives that are highly liquid and relatively easy to value 
we have stringent derivative transaction policies and controls to minimize our derivative counterparty risk 
we use derivatives for three primary purposes as a substitute for notes and bonds we issue in the debt markets 
when we purchase mortgages  we fund the purchase with a combination of equity and debt 
the debt we issue is a mix that typically consists of short and long term  noncallable debt and callable debt 
the varied maturities and flexibility of these debt combinations help us in reducing the mismatch of cash flows between assets and liabilities 
we can use a mix of debt issuances and derivatives to achieve the same duration matching that would be achieved by issuing only debt securities 
the primary types of derivatives used for this purpose include pay fixed and receive fixed interest rate swaps used as substitutes for noncallable debt and pay fixed and receive fixed swaptions used as substitutes for callable debt 
table gives an example of equivalent funding alternatives for a mortgage purchase with funding derived solely from debt securities versus funding with a blend of debt securities and derivatives 
as illustrated by table  we can achieve similar economic results by funding our mortgage purchases with either debt securities or a combination of debt securities and derivatives  as follows rather than issuing a year noncallable fixed rate note  we could issue short term debt and enter into a year interest rate swap with a highly rated counterparty 
the derivative counterparty would pay a floating rate of interest to us on the swap that we would use to pay the interest expense on the short term debt  which we would continue to reissue 
we would pay the counterparty a fixed rate of interest on the swap  thus achieving the economics of a year fixed rate note issue 
the combination of the pay fixed interest rate swap and short term debt serves as a substitute for noncallable fixed rate debt 
similarly  instead of issuing a year fixed rate note callable after three years  we could issue a year fixed rate note and enter into a receive fixed swaption that would have the same economics as a year callable note 
if we want to call the debt after three years  the swaption would give us the option to enter into a swap agreement where we would receive a fixed rate of interest from the derivative counterparty over the remaining year period that would offset the fixed rate interest payments on the long term debt 
the combination of the receive fixed swaption and year noncallable note serves as a substitute for callable debt 
table equivalent debt and derivative funding fund with debt securities debt securities and derivatives type of debt percentage type of debt percentage short term debt short term debt year noncallable debt year noncallable debt year noncallable debt short term debt plus year swap year callable in years year noncallable debt plus receive fixed swaption this example indicates the possible funding mix and does not represent how an actual purchase would necessarily be funded 
to achieve risk management objectives not obtainable with debt market securities 
we sometimes have risk management objectives that cannot be fully accomplished by securities generally available in the debt markets 
for example  we may prefer a higher percentage of short term debt in our liability structure to hedge against declining interest rates 
this structure  however  exposes us to greater risk if interest rates rise 
a solution that helps minimize this risk is to issue short term discount notes and simultaneously purchase interest rate caps 
the issuance of the short term discount notes allows us to reduce our debt expense as rates decline  while the interest rate cap limits our exposure to an increase in rates beyond a certain point 
as another example  we can use the derivative markets to purchase swaptions to add features to our debt not obtainable in the debt markets 
the options embedded in our callable debt generally are considered at the money given that the debt is callable at par 
we can change the structure of our callable debt by purchasing swaptions with strike prices that are out of the money 
we can also use forward starting pay fixed interest rate swaps to simulate fixed rate debt beginning at a date later than what is available through cash issuance 
to quickly and efficiently rebalance our portfolio 
we seek to keep our assets and liabilities matched within a duration tolerance of plus or minus six months 
when interest rates are volatile  we often need to lengthen or shorten the average duration of our liabilities to keep them closely matched with our mortgage durations  which change as expected mortgage prepayments change 
while we have a number of rebalancing tools available to us  it is often most efficient for us to rebalance our portfolio by adding new derivatives or by terminating existing derivative positions 
for example  when interest rates fall and mortgage durations shorten  we can shorten the duration of our debt by entering into receive fixed interest rate swaps that convert longer duration  fixed term debt into shorter duration  floating rate debt or by terminating existing pay fixed interest rate swaps 
this use of derivatives helps increase our funding flexibility while maintaining our low risk tolerance 
the types of derivative instruments we use most often to rebalance our portfolio include receive fixed interest rate swaps and pay fixed interest rate swaps 
the increased volatility in interest rates combined with our adoption of a tighter tolerance range within which to manage our interest rate risk caused us to rebalance our portfolio more frequently and by larger amounts during as a result  we significantly increased our use of receive fixed and pay fixed interest rate swaps during as shown by the increase in the notional balance of these derivatives in table in addition to our three primary uses of derivatives  we may also use derivatives for the following purposes to hedge against fluctuations in interest rates on planned debt issuance 
the hedging of anticipated debt issuances enables us to maintain an orderly and cost effective debt issuance schedule so we can fund daily loan purchase commitments without significantly increasing our interest rate risk or changing the spread of our funding costs versus other market interest rates 
most of the mortgages that fannie mae commits to purchase are for a future settlement date  typically two weeks to three months into the future 
fannie mae would be exposed to additional interest rate risk from changes in market rates prior to settlement if we did not issue debt at the time of the commitment or did not lock in an interest rate by hedging the anticipated debt issuance 
by hedging anticipated debt issuance versus issuing debt at the time of commitment  we are able to issue debt in larger size and on a regular schedule so that liquidity is enhanced while our relative cost of funds is reduced 
to hedge foreign currency exposure 
we occasionally issue debt in a foreign currency 
because all of our assets are denominated in us dollars  we enter into currency swaps to effectively convert the foreign denominated debt into us dollar denominated debt 
by swapping out of foreign currencies completely at the time of the debt issue  we minimize our exposure to any currency risk 
our foreign denominated debt represents less than one percent of total debt outstanding 
types of derivatives we use table summarizes the specific derivative instruments we use  the typical hedging purpose  and how the derivative transforms our debt 
table primary types of derivatives used debt transformation effect purpose of the hedge hedging instrument transaction see above from to pay fixed  receive variable interest rate swap   variable rate fixed rate receive fixed  pay variable interest rate swap   fixed rate variable rate basis swap or spread lock and variable rate variable rate caps nonoption protected variable rate option protected variable rate pay fixed swaption   nonoption protected variable rate option protected variable rate receive fixed swaption   noncallable fixed rate callable fixed rate forward starting fixed rate swaps and variable rate fixed rate foreign currency swaps foreign denominated debt dollar denominated debt as shown in table  we use only the most straightforward types of derivatives  primarily to supplement our issuance of debt  add risk management features not obtainable in the debt market  and quickly and efficiently rebalance our portfolio 
the derivations we use are priced in deep and liquid markets and are therefore relatively easy to value and evaluate 
our derivatives fall into three broad categories 
interest rate swaps an interest rate swap is a transaction between two parties in which each agrees to exchange payments tied to different interest rates or indices for a specified period of time  generally based on a notional amount of principal 
the types of interest rate swaps we use include pay fixed  receive floating an agreement whereby we pay a predetermined fixed rate of interest based upon a set notional amount and receive a variable interest payment based upon a stated index  with the index resetting at regular intervals over a specified period of time 
receive fixed  pay floating an agreement whereby we make a variable interest payment based upon a stated index  with the index resetting at regular intervals  and receive a predetermined fixed rate of interest based upon a set notional amount and over a specified period of time 
basis swap an agreement that provides for the exchange of variable payments that have maturities similar to hedged debt but are based on different underlying interest rate index rates 
options on interest rate swaps or swaptions these contracts give us the option to enter into pay fixed  receive floating or receive fixed  pay floating interest rate swaps in the future 
we primarily use these instruments to simulate the economics of callable debt or minimize the risk from variable debt in a rising interest rate environment 
pay fixed swaptions an option that allows us to enter into a pay fixed  receive variable interest rate swap at some point in the future 
this protects us from the risk of higher interest rates on variable rate debt 
receive fixed swaptions an option that allows us to enter into a receive fixed  pay variable interest rate swap at some point into the future and protects us from the risk of declining interest rates on existing fixed rate debt 
other other derivative instruments we may use include interest rate caps and foreign currency swaps that are discussed above

assumes that variable interest rates remain constant at december  levels 
during we increased the outstanding notional balance of derivatives by billion to  billion at december   primarily as a result of significant rebalancing activity during the year in response to the effects of extreme interest rate volatility and our adoption of tighter risk tolerances 
with record low interest rates during the early part of triggering record prepayments  we reduced our duration gap by actively rebalancing our portfolio primarily by terminating existing interest rate swaps and entering into new receive fixed interest rate swaps 
as interest rates increased during the second half of the year and expected prepayments slowed  we began to extend the duration of our liabilities primarily through the use of pay fixed interest rate swaps 
in addition  as our portfolio expanded  we purchased more caps and swaptions to help offset the increased prepayment option risk resulting from our new mortgage purchases 
at june   the estimated total notional balance of the global derivatives market was trillion based on combined data from the bank for international settlements for over the counter derivatives and published figures for exchange traded derivatives

our goal is to maintain the ratio of debt options to prepayment options on new mortgage portfolio business within a range of to percent

credit exposure from derivatives the primary credit exposure that we have on a derivative transaction is that a counterparty might default on payments due  which could result in having to acquire a replacement derivative from a different counterparty at a higher cost 
although notional amount is a commonly used measure of volume in the derivatives market  it is not a meaningful measure of market or credit risk since derivative counterparties do not exchange the notional amount except in the case of foreign currency swaps 
counterparties use the notional amounts of derivative instruments to calculate contractual cash flows to be exchanged 
however  the notional amount is significantly greater than the potential market or credit loss that could result from such transactions 
the fair value of derivatives in a gain position is a more meaningful measure of our current market exposure on derivatives 
we estimate the fair value of derivatives by calculating our exposure to counterparty default after offsetting legally enforceable arrangements  such as master netting agreements 
the fair value of derivatives in a gain position net of the value of any collateral held represents the actual credit risk of our derivative contracts 
we believe the risk of loss on fannie mae s derivatives book is low for three primary reasons our stringent counterparty eligibility standards  our conservative collateral policy  which has provisions requiring collateral on our derivative contracts in gain positions  and our intensive exposure monitoring and management 
fannie mae has never experienced a loss on a derivative transaction due to credit default by a counterparty 
we manage derivative counterparty credit risk by contracting only with experienced counterparties that have high credit ratings 
we initiate derivative contracts only with counterparties rated a or better 
our counterparties consist of large banks  broker dealers  and other financial institutions that have a significant presence in the derivatives market  most of which are based in the united states 
because of the very high credit quality of our counterparties  the credit risk on our derivative transactions is low 
as an additional precaution  we have a conservative collateral management policy with provisions for requiring collateral on certain derivative contracts in gain positions 
we estimate exposure to credit loss on derivative instruments by calculating the replacement cost  on a present value basis  to settle at current market prices all outstanding derivative contracts in a gain position 
we enter into master agreements that provide for netting of amounts due to us and amounts due to counterparties under those agreements 
new york law governs all of our master derivatives agreements 
we monitor credit exposure on our derivatives daily by valuing them using internal pricing models and dealer quotes 
we make collateral calls daily based on the results of our internal models and dealer quotes

we held collateral of billion and billion on our derivative contracts at december  and  respectively 
we posted collateral of million related to our counterparties credit exposure to fannie mae at december  reflects notional amounts  which only indicates the amount on which payments are being calculated and does not represent the amount at risk of loss 
our derivative credit exposure  after consideration of the value of collateral held  was million at december   compared with million at december  we expect the credit exposure on derivative contracts to fluctuate with changes in interest rates  implied volatility  and the collateral thresholds of the counterparties 
assuming the highly unlikely event that all of our derivative counterparties to which fannie mae was exposed at december  were to default simultaneously  it would have cost an estimated million to replace the economic value of those contracts 
this replacement cost represents less than percent of our reported pre tax net income 
at december   the  billion outstanding notional amount of fannie mae s derivatives was with counterparties rated a or better both by s p and moody s 
to reduce our credit risk concentration  we diversified our derivative instruments among and counterparties at year end and  respectively 
of the counterparties at december   counterparties accounted for approximately percent of the total outstanding notional amount  and each of these counterparties ranged between percent and percent of the total outstanding notional amount 
each of the remaining counterparties accounted for less than five percent of the total outstanding notional amount at december  in comparison  eight counterparties with credit ratings of a or better accounted for approximately percent of the total notional outstanding amount of derivative transactions at december  at december  and  all of our exposure on derivatives  before consideration of collateral held  was with counterparties rated a or better by s p and moody s 
five counterparties with credit ratings of a or better accounted for approximately percent of our billion exposure on derivatives before consideration of collateral held at december   and five counterparties accounted for approximately percent of our billion exposure at december  at december  and  seventy one percent of our net exposure after consideration of collateral held of million and million  respectively  was with six counterparties rated aa or better by s p and aa or better by moody s 
the percentage of our net exposure at december  with the six counterparties ranged from to percent  or million to million 
we mitigate our net exposure on derivative transactions through a collateral management policy  which consists of four primary components minimum collateral thresholds  collateral valuation percentages  overcollateralization based on rating downgrades  and daily monitoring procedures 
minimum collateral thresholds fannie mae and our derivative counterparties are obligated to post collateral when exposure to credit losses exceeds agreed upon thresholds that are based on respective credit ratings 
our derivative contracts indicate the required collateral amount based on respective credit ratings and level of credit exposure 
the amount of collateral generally must equal the excess of exposure over the threshold amount 
table presents the general ratings based collateral thresholds 
table fannie mae ratings based collateral thresholds credit rating s p moody s exposure threshold dollars in millions aaa aaa mutually agreed on aa aa aa aa aa aa a a a a a or below a or below see table collateral valuation percentages we require counterparties to post specific types of collateral to meet their collateral requirements 
the collateral posted by our counterparties at december  and was principally in the form of cash or us treasury securities with a small amount of agency mbs 
we assign each type of collateral a specific valuation percentage based on its relative risk 
for example  cash receives a percent valuation  while certain us treasury instruments may receive only a percent valuation percentage 
in cases where the valuation percentage for a certain type of collateral is less than percent  we require counterparties to post an additional amount of collateral to meet their requirements 
overcollateralization based on low credit ratings we further reduce our net exposure on derivatives by generally requiring overcollateralization from counterparties whose credit ratings have dropped below predetermined levels 
counterparties falling below these levels must post collateral beyond the amounts previously noted to meet their overall requirements 
table presents fannie mae s standard valuation percentages for overcollateralization based on counterparty credit ratings 
the percentage of additional collateral is applied to the initial amount of collateral required to be posted 
table fannie mae standard collateral valuation percentages additional percentage of collateral credit rating to be posted a a or above a a to bbb baa bbb baa or below frequent monitoring procedures we mark our collateral positions daily for each counterparty against exposure using both internal and external pricing models and compare these calculations to the counterparties valuations 
for certain types of option transactions  there can be reasonable differences between the valuation generated from fannie mae s model and our counterparty s model 
we therefore calculate a reasonable range of values  or model bands  to determine an acceptable model variance limit 
we work closely with each counterparty to compare our derivative marks based on our respective models 
we evaluate any additional exposure to a counterparty beyond our model tolerance level based on our corporate credit policy framework for managing counterparty risk  which is discussed further in md a credit guaranty business operations credit risk management institutional counterparty credit risk 
both fannie mae and our derivative counterparties transfer collateral within two business days based on the agreed upon valuation 
we also monitor aggregate exposure across all counterparties on a daily basis 
pursuant to fannie mae s collateral agreements we reserve the right to value exposure and collateral adequacy at any time 
a new york based third party custodian holds all of the collateral posted to fannie mae and monitors the value on a daily basis 
accounting for derivatives under fas  we recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet at their fair value 
subject to certain qualifying conditions  we may designate a derivative as either a hedge of the cash flows of a variable rate instrument or anticipated transaction cash flow hedge or a hedge of the fair value of a fixed rate instrument fair value hedge 
for a derivative qualifying as a cash flow hedge  we report fair value gains or losses in a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income aoci  net of deferred taxes  in stockholders equity to the extent the hedge is effective 
we recognize these fair value gains or losses in earnings during the period s in which the hedged item affects earnings 
for a derivative qualifying as a fair value hedge  we report fair value gains or losses on the derivative in earnings along with fair value gains or losses on the hedged item attributable to the risk being hedged 
for a derivative not qualifying as a hedge  or components of a derivative that are excluded from any hedge effectiveness assessment  we report fair value gains and losses in earnings 
table shows the notional amounts and fair values of our derivatives by type as of december  and based on the hedge classification

the net value presented for caps and swaptions reflects only the intrinsic value 
the time value is presented separately because we exclude the time value of purchased options from our assessment of hedge effectiveness under fas and record changes in the fair value of the time value of purchased options in earnings 
includes foreign currency swaps  futures contracts  and other derivative instruments that provide a hedge against interest rate fluctuations 
the fair value of our derivatives is affected by changes in the level of interest rates and implied market volatility  together with activity in the derivatives book  which includes additions of new derivative contracts and the maturity or termination of existing contracts 
the fair value of our derivatives increased to billion at december   from negative billion at december  and negative billion at december  while we had a net positive value in our overall derivatives book at december   we had a net negative value on those derivatives designated as cash flow hedges 
cash flow hedges consist primarily of pay fixed swaps that are used to create effective fixed rate debt  and generally show market value losses when interest rates fall 
fair value hedges consist largely of receive fixed swaps and swaptions that typically increase in value as interest rates fall 
under fas we are required to record the fair value gains and losses on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges in the aoci component of stockholders equity 
gains and losses on derivatives designated as fair value hedges and purchased options time value are not included in aoci 
table shows amounts recorded in aoci from january  through december  related to derivative instruments accounted for as cash flow hedges  together with the balance in aoci attributable to open cash flow hedges and terminated or discontinued cash flow hedges

our interest rate risk management actions are driven by the economics of the transaction and the market environment that exists at that time and not by the hedge accounting designations 
many derivative transactions can have similar economics but different accounting effects on realized and unrealized aoci 
for example  entering into a new receive fixed swap is economically equivalent to terminating a pay fixed swap  but the accounting on these transactions can be quite different 
a receive fixed swap recorded as a fair value hedge of fixed rate debt has no effect at all on aoci 
on the other hand  a receive fixed swap recorded as a cash flow hedge of part of a pay fixed swap is recorded in aoci as an open hedge 
and when we terminate or close a cash flow hedge and discontinue hedge accounting prospectively  we transfer the corresponding market value of the derivative into the closed hedge category of aoci 
both realized and unrealized aoci are amortized into net interest income over the same period in which the original hedged item affects earnings 
in the case of a cash flow hedge  the original hedged item is generally the repricing of variable rate debt in the future 
the deferred hedge results therefore are recognized in net interest income together with the variable rate debt expense 
of the billion net after tax losses in aoci at december  related to derivative cash flow hedges  billion is attributable to unrealized losses on open hedges while billion is attributable to realized losses on cash flow hedges that have been either terminated or discontinued 
in comparison  we had net losses of billion in aoci at december  related to cash flow hedges  with billion attributable to open hedges and billion attributable to closed hedges 
at december   we had net losses of billion in aoci related to cash flow hedges  with billion attributable to open hedges and billion attributable to closed hedges 
gains and losses on open hedges can fluctuate significantly from period to period due to changes in interest rates and market volatility 
fluctuations in interest rates and market volatility  however  have no impact on the amounts recorded in aoci related to terminated or discontinued hedges 
the increases in aoci attributable to closed hedges during and were driven largely by mortgage portfolio rebalancing activities that included terminating pay fixed swaps in order to reduce the portfolio s interest rate risk exposure 
hedge results from both open and closed hedges are amortized out of aoci and into earnings as a component of interest expense 
assuming market expectations of interest rates and market volatility  we would amortize into earnings over the next months an estimated billion  net of tax  related to open hedges 
actual amortization results will be based on market rates and volatility during the year and likely will differ from this estimate 
during  we amortized billion billion pre tax related to open cash flow hedges from aoci into earnings as a component of our reported pre tax interest expense of billion 
the expense related to open cash flow hedges in combination with the expense from the associated variable rate debt equals the cost of our effective fixed rate debt 
over the next months  we also expect to amortize into earnings as a component of interest expense an estimated billion  net of tax  of the billion related to realized losses on closed cash flow hedges as of december  the amortization of these hedge results will be a component of interest expense  together with the ongoing expense from the hedged item 
during  we amortized into interest expense 
billion billion pre tax of the billion in losses related to closed cash flow hedges as of december  over time  all of our closed hedge results  and open hedge results not otherwise extinguished by changes in interest rates  will be reflected in earnings through interest expense 
we provide additional detail on our accounting for derivatives in the notes to financial statements note  derivative instruments and hedging activities 
interest rate risk management interest rate risk interest rate risk is the risk of loss to future earnings or long term value that may result from changes in interest rates 
our interest rate risk is concentrated primarily in our mortgage portfolio where nearly percent of our mortgages are intermediate term or long term fixed rate loans that borrowers have the option to prepay at any time without penalty 
we are exposed to interest rate risk because the cash flows of our mortgage assets and the liabilities that fund them are not perfectly matched through time and across all possible interest rate scenarios 
the cash flows from our mortgage assets are highly sensitive to changes in interest rates because of the borrower s prepayment option 
as interest rates decrease  borrowers are more likely to refinance fixed rate mortgages  resulting in increased prepayments and mortgage cash flows that are received earlier than expected 
replacing the higher rate loans that prepay with lower rate loans has the potential of reducing our interest spread unless we are able to also reduce our debt cost 
conversely  an increase in interest rates may result in slower than expected prepayments and mortgage cash flows that are received later than expected 
in this case  we have the risk that our debt may reprice faster than our mortgage assets and at a higher cost  which could also reduce our interest spread 
the objective of our interest rate risk management process is to maintain long term value through a low variability of future earnings due to changes in interest rates  while preserving stable earnings growth and a competitive return on equity over time 
the following discussion highlights the strategies our portfolio investment business uses to manage interest rate risk 
interest rate risk management process the board of directors oversees interest rate risk management through the adoption of corporate goals and objectives and the review of regular reports on performance against them 
senior management is responsible for ensuring that appropriate long term strategies are in place to achieve the goals and objectives 
management establishes reference points for the key performance measures that we use to signal material changes in risk and to assist in determining whether we should adjust portfolio strategy to achieve long term objectives 
management regularly reports these measures and reference points to the board of directors 
the portfolio investment committee  which includes our senior mortgage portfolio managers  meets weekly and reviews current financial market conditions  portfolio risk measures  and performance targets 
the committee develops and monitors near term strategies and the portfolio s standing relative to its long term objectives 
the results of portfolio investment committee meetings are reported to the weekly asset and liability management committee  which is comprised of senior management and includes our chief executive officer 
fannie mae s overall objective in managing interest rate risk is to deliver consistent core net interest income growth and target returns on capital over a wide range of interest rate environments 
central elements of our approach to managing interest rate risk include funding assets by issuing liabilities that have similar cash flow patterns through time and in different interest rate environments  regularly assessing the portfolio s exposure to changes in interest rates using a diverse set of analyses and measures  and setting parameters for rebalancing actions to help attain corporate objectives 
funding mortgage assets with liabilities that have similar cash flow patterns through time and in different interest rate environments 
when we purchase mortgages we attempt to match the initial estimated life  or duration  of our liabilities to our assets within a range to achieve a stable and competitive net interest margin 
we issue a mix of debt securities across a broad spectrum of final maturities to achieve the desired liability durations 
because the estimated lives of mortgage assets change as interest rates change  we frequently issue callable debt or use derivatives to alter the estimated life of our liabilities to partially match the expected change in duration of our mortgage assets 
the duration of callable debt  like that of a mortgage  shortens when interest rates decrease and lengthens when interest rates increase 
if interest rates decrease  we are likely to call debt that carries an interest rate higher than the current market 
we use interest rate swaps and other derivatives with embedded interest rate options to achieve our desired liability structure and to better match both the duration and prepayment risk of our mortgage assets 
these derivatives  coupled with appropriate debt securities  are close substitutes for callable and noncallable debt 
through the use of these derivatives  we can synthetically create debt with cash flows similar to our mortgage assets 
regularly assessing the portfolio s exposure to changes in interest rates using a diverse set of analyses and measures 
we utilize a wide range of risk measures and analyses to manage the interest rate risk inherent in the mortgage portfolio 
we categorize these risk measures and analyses into three types ongoing business risk measures and analyses  run off measures of the existing portfolio  and stress test scenarios 
the combination of ongoing business and run off risk measures and analyses present a comprehensive picture of fannie mae s current risk position that we use for day to day risk management decisions 
stress test scenarios provide information on our risk to more extreme but lower probability events 
interest rate risk measurement our ongoing business risk measures and analyses include net interest income at risk and repricing gap analyses 
we base net interest income at risk measures on the mortgage portfolio as of a certain date plus projections of future business activity 
future business activity includes projected mortgage purchases and funding actions 
management believes that ongoing business risk measures and analyses provide a better perspective on the interest rate risk we face as a continuing business and a more comprehensive depiction of our risk profile than run off measures 
however  they contain more assumption risk due to the inherent uncertainty in projecting future business activity 
run off measures of interest rate risk include duration  convexity  and repricing gaps 
we base run off measures on the mortgage portfolio as of a certain date without incorporating future business activity 
run off measures provide an assessment of the interest rate risk of the existing portfolio without the assumption risk inherent in projecting future business activity 
however  we believe it is important to manage interest rate risk in the context of ongoing business activity because future business is highly probable and has a pronounced effect on our interest rate risk profile 
stress test scenarios include extreme movements in risk factors on both ongoing business and run off measures of risk 
we periodically measure and analyze the effects that extreme movements in the level of interest rates and the slope of the yield curve would have on the company s risk position 
in addition  we evaluate stress scenarios that include severe changes in expected prepayment speeds and the level of interest rate volatility 
while stress testing is an integral part of our risk management process  the ongoing business and run off measures of risk are the primary inputs in daily risk management decisions 
many of our projections of mortgage cash flows in our interest rate risk measures depend on our proprietary prepayment models 
while we are highly confident in the quality of these models  we recognize the historical patterns that serve as input for our models may not continue in the future 
the models contain many assumptions  including those regarding borrower behavior in certain interest rate environments and borrower relocation rates 
other assumptions such as projections of interest rates  shape of the yield curve  and interest rate volatility are also critical components to our interest rate risk measures 
we maintain a research program to constantly evaluate  update  and enhance these assumptions  models  and analytical tools as appropriate to reflect management s best assessment of the environment 
net interest income at risk net interest income at risk is our primary ongoing business measure of interest rate risk 
net interest income at risk measures the projected impact of changes in the level of interest rates and the shape of the yield curve on the mortgage portfolio s expected or base core net interest income over the immediate future one and four year periods 
to determine our base core net interest income  we estimate core net interest income over a wide range of interest rate environments using stochastic interest rate simulations 
stochastic interest rate simulations are a widely used statistical method to estimate the path and pattern of interest rates 
our stochastic simulations produce probability distributions of future interest rates based on expected interest rate volatility and are based on proprietary interest rate models 
we generate several hundred interest rate paths distributed around the current fannie mae yield curve from these simulations 
the fannie mae yield curve represents market assumptions regarding our expected cost of funds over a variety of maturities and takes into account the risk premium on our debt relative to benchmark interest rates 
we project core net interest income for four years along each path based on the characteristics of the current mortgage portfolio and projected future business activity 
the expected or base core net interest income is calculated based on the average core net interest income across all simulation paths and serves as the basis for determining our interest rate risk profile 
our projections of future business activity used in these simulations are reported to senior management and our board of directors and provide the basis for fannie mae s current earnings forecasts 
we determine the amount of net interest income at risk by assuming a sudden change or shock to the current yield curve and repeating the simulation 
we regularly evaluate a wide range of instantaneous shocks to both the level and shape of the yield curve and create the net interest income at risk profile by comparing the percentage change in core net interest income between each shocked simulation and the base simulation 
our net interest income at risk disclosures  which we report to the public on a monthly basis  represent the extent to which our core net interest income over the next one year and four year periods is at risk due to a plus or minus basis point parallel change in the level of the current fannie mae yield curve and from a basis point steepening or flattening change in the slope of fannie mae s yield curve 
we selected these shocks for our monthly disclosure because they capture approximately percent of historical changes in interest rates over a one month reporting period 
duration gap the portfolio duration gap is a run off measure of interest rate risk 
the duration gap is the difference between the estimated durations of portfolio assets and liabilities 
duration gap summarizes the extent to which estimated cash flows for assets and liabilities are matched  on average  over time and across interest rate scenarios 
a positive duration gap signals a greater exposure to rising interest rates because it indicates that the duration of our assets exceeds the duration of our liabilities 
a negative duration gap signals a greater exposure to declining interest rates because the duration of our assets is less than the duration of our liabilities 
we apply the same interest rate process  prepayment models  and volatility assumptions used in our net interest income at risk measure to generate the portfolio duration gap 
the duration gap reflects the current mortgage portfolio  including priced asset and debt commitments 
we do not incorporate projected future business activity or nonmortgage investments into our duration gap measure 
we regularly evaluate the sensitivity of the duration gap over a wide range of instantaneous changes to both the level and shape of the yield curve 
the duration gap provides a relatively concise and simple measure of the interest rate risk inherent in the existing mortgage portfolio  but it is not directly linked to expected future earnings performance 
future business activity  which is not reflected in the duration gap  can have a significant effect even over a very short horizon 
we disclose on a monthly basis our duration gap along with our net interest income at risk  which together we believe provide a more informative profile of our overall interest rate risk position than either measure alone 
setting the parameters for rebalancing actions to help attain corporate objectives 
management develops rebalancing actions based on a number of factors that include the relative standing of both net interest income at risk and duration gap  as well as analyses based on additional risk measures and current market conditions 
in june  we announced our updated corporate financial disciplines  which included two adjustments to the risk tolerances of our mortgage portfolio 
first  we committed to managing the portfolio s duration gap within a target range of plus or minus months substantially all of the time  compared to our historical performance of remaining within the target range about two thirds of the time 
in addition  we increased the ratio of liability options to mortgage prepayment options on new business from a target range of percent to a range of to percent 
to maintain the duration gap within these tighter tolerances  we are taking rebalancing actions earlier and with greater frequency than previously 
however  the increased level of optionality generally reduces the magnitude of rebalancing actions needed for a given change in interest rates 
while we announced these new risk tolerances in june  we managed the portfolio to these targets for the entire year 
risk management results overview in a year defined by historic levels of volatility in the fixed income markets  we effectively managed our interest rate risk to tighter risk tolerances that were adopted during the year 
the year began with rates near historic lows  with a year swap rate of percent  further declines through the first half of the year bottomed out in mid june  with a year swap rate of percent 
after declining to these levels  the year swap rate increased basis points from june to september  the most severe two month increase in rates since with interest rates reaching year lows  asset durations shortened and rebalancing activities of our mortgage portfolio during the first half of the year resulted in very little long term funding 
this was followed by very heavy long term funding during the third quarter due to rebalancing associated with the dramatic rise in rates and record volumes of longer duration mortgage commitments 
much of the long term funding during the third quarter of the year was accomplished by using variable rate debt in combination with pay fixed interest rate swaps as the swap market maintained the best liquidity during this particularly volatile period 
while the pace of portfolio option purchases varied during the year  we ended the year comfortably meeting our option purchase objective 
the events of reinforced our belief that the use of option protected liabilities  in combination with disciplined rebalancing  are vital to the successful management of our mortgage portfolio 
the increased level of option protected liabilities held by the portfolio proved to be the foundation of our success in managing the interest rate risk associated with one of the most volatile years in history and allowed us to seize upon attractive investment opportunities 
because fannie mae tends to have a higher ratio of liability options to mortgage options than many other leveraged mortgage investors  we typically need to take smaller rebalancing actions relative to the mortgage optionality held than other investors 
net interest income at risk at december   our one year and four year net interest income at risk measures for a basis point change across the fannie mae yield curve were percent and percent  respectively  compared with 
percent and percent  respectively  at december  the one year and four year net interest income at risk measures for a basis point change in the slope of the fannie mae yield curve were percent and percent  respectively  at december   compared with percent and percent  respectively  at december  the following graphs show the results of our net interest income at risk measure for each of the last three years under both a basis point parallel change in the level of the fannie mae yield curve and a basis point change in the slope of the fannie mae yield curve 
logo logo during the first half of  our net interest income at risk for a level shock remained within our preferred range of about percent at risk for both the one year and four year horizons 
the year lows in interests rates in mid june followed by the rapid increase in rates through early september caused our net interest income at risk for a basis point level shock to rise above our typical levels in june for the four year horizon and in july for both the one year and four year horizons 
we took portfolio rebalancing actions during the third quarter of that brought both the one year and four year net interest income at risk back within our preferred range for the remainder of compared to and  our net interest income at risk for a level shock was at somewhat higher levels due to the extreme amounts of interest rate volatility and the sharp rise in rates 
our net interest income at risk in for a basis point slope shock was modestly higher than in either or the four year net interest income at risk for a basis point slope shock was slightly above our preferred range of about percent for most of the year 
this increased level of risk was primarily due to the extreme steepness of the yield curve that persisted throughout and the increased volume of effective short term debt financing our mortgage portfolio due to rebalancing actions we took in the first half of a significant portion of our effective short term debt is option protected through the use of interest rate caps and pay fixed swaptions 
table presents our net interest income at risk based on an instantaneous basis point increase and a basis point decrease in interest rates  which represents an extension of our voluntary monthly net interest income at risk disclosure 
we use the same data  assumptions  and methodology in calculating these results 
table net interest income at risk december  december  year portfolio year portfolio year portfolio year portfolio net interest net interest net interest net interest income at risk income at risk income at risk income at risk assuming a basis point increase in interest rates assuming a basis point decrease in interest rates we consider our net interest income at risk at december  to be relatively low as our exposure to a basis point instantaneous increase in interest rates was estimated not to exceed percent and percent over a year and year horizon  respectively  and our exposure to a basis point instantaneous decrease in rates was estimated to result in a percent decrease in net interest income over a year horizon and no change over a year horizon 
the level of net interest income at risk compared to december  is relatively unchanged 
actual changes in portfolio net interest income may differ from these estimates because of specific interest rate movements  changing business conditions  changing prepayments  and management actions 
duration gap fannie mae s duration gap calculated on a weighted average monthly basis was minus one month at december  in comparison  our duration gap calculated at month end was minus months at december  despite extreme levels of volatility in the fixed income markets during much of the year  we were able to maintain our duration gap within our tighter risk tolerances throughout the year 
we accomplished this financial discipline objective through strategic rebalancing actions and by holding increased levels of optionality in our liability structure 
the following graph presents our monthly average duration gap during along with the monthly average duration of the lehman mortgage index and the year fannie mae debt rate 
as indicated in the graph  our duration gap is much less variable than the lehman mortgage index 
for example  when the average year fannie mae debt rate increased by basis points from june to july  our duration gap increased by only months while the lehman mortgage index increased by months 
in august  when the average year fannie mae debt rate increased by basis points  our duration gap declined by only months while the lehman mortgage index increased by months 
logo convexity convexity measures are commonly used as a supplement to duration measures to reflect the degree to which durations are likely to change in response to movements in interest rates 
convexity provides us with information on how quickly and by how much the portfolio s duration gap may change in different interest rate environments 
our primary strategy for managing convexity risk is to either issue callable debt or purchase interest rate derivatives with embedded options 
we also may change the mix of assets we purchase to manage convexity risk 
for example  arms  shorter term fixed rate mortgages  and some seasoned loans have less prepayment risk relative to new year fixed rate mortgages  and as a result  reduce convexity risk 
our preferred alternative is to issue callable debt or purchase optionality rather than change the mix of our assets  because generally we find greater value in investing in longer term fixed rate loans 
during  we continued to take advantage of the opportunity to reduce our debt costs by redeeming significant amounts of callable debt in response to the continued decline in interest rates during the first half of the year 
at the same time  we continued to manage the portfolio s convexity by maintaining the high level of option protection with which we started the year 
at december   percent of the debt financing our mortgage portfolio had option embedded protection  compared with percent at december  in our md a discussion of derivatives  we explain how option based derivatives transform our debt structure 
interest rate sensitivity of net asset value fannie mae s interest rate sensitivity of net asset value is presented in table below 
these sensitivities are based on our fair value balance sheets presented in note  fair value of financial instruments and include supplemental non gaap disclosures that are provided by management to present a more complete hypothetical fair value of the company s assets and liabilities than that required by gaap 
we derived the net asset values for the hypothetical interest rate scenarios in a manner consistent with the estimation procedures described in note the sensitivities presented in table have significant limitations because they are based on hypothetical fair values of the existing assets and liabilities of the company and exclude the value from the company s future business activities 
in management s opinion  a significant value that is excluded from this presentation is the valuation of the company s revenues on guaranteed mbs which do not take into consideration the effect of long standing business relationships with our customers that provide for the recapture of a large proportion of mbs that generate guaranty fee revenues  thus adding significant value to this line of business and greatly reducing the sensitivity of our net asset value to changes in interest rates 
table presents our estimated net asset value as of december  and  and the impact on our estimated net asset value of a hypothetical plus and minus basis point instantaneous shock in interest rates 
our analysis is based on these interest rates changes because we believe they reflect reasonably possible near term outcomes 
table interest rate sensitivity of net asset value december  december  net asset percentage of net asset percentage of value net asset value value net asset value dollars in millions december assuming a basis point increase in interest rates assuming a basis point decrease in interest rates changes in net asset value incorporate various factors  including estimated changes in the values of all mortgage assets and the debt funding these assets  estimated changes in the value of net guaranty fee income from on and off balance sheet mbs obligations  estimated changes in the value of interest rate derivatives 
as indicated in table  the projected fair value of our net assets at december  increased by billion after tax adjustments  to billion from billion at december  both of our primary businesses contributed to the increase in estimated fair value 
the increase in our portfolio investment business was driven by changes in the composition of our portfolio  combined with a significant decline in option adjusted spreads on mortgages 
the increase in the estimated fair value of our credit guaranty business was driven by significant growth in mbs issued  a shift in the composition of loans underlying mbs issued to lower coupon mortgages  and a significant decline in option adjusted spreads on comparable interest only securities 
the net asset value at december  would decrease by approximately percent for a basis point instantaneous increase in interest rates  while a basis point instantaneous decline in interest rates would reduce the fair value by approximately percent 
at december  we had a larger exposure to falling rates than to rising rates which is generally consistent with our average duration gap  but slightly different than the results of our net interest income at risk measure due to the effects of the future business activity included in that measure 
the sensitivities at december  reflect our lower exposure to interest rate changes than at year end that is largely due to the change in interest rates and the change in the mix of the portfolio 
credit guaranty business operations our credit guaranty business has primary responsibility for managing fannie mae s credit risk 
we discuss our credit exposure in this section and our credit risk management of our mortgage credit book of business  which includes both on balance sheet and off balance sheet mortgage assets 
off balance sheet transactions in the ordinary course of business  we enter into arrangements to facilitate our statutory purpose of providing mortgage funds to the secondary market and reduce fannie mae s exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
we structure transactions to meet the financial needs of customers  manage fannie mae s credit  market or liquidity risks  diversify funding sources  or optimize our capital 
under gaap  some of these arrangements are not recorded on fannie mae s balance sheet or may be recorded in amounts different than the full contract or notional amount of the transaction 
table shows the contractual amount of our off balance sheet arrangements at december  and table off balance sheet arrangements december  dollars in billions contractual amounts outstanding mbs master delivery commitments mandatory optional portfolio purchase commitments mandatory optional credit enhancements other investments mbs held by investors other than fannie mae 
master delivery commitments either require or permit lenders to either deliver loans to us for securitization or enter into a mandatory commitment to deliver loans or mortgage related securities to us for purchase 
these arrangements are off balance sheet and not accounted for as derivatives unless we enter into a mandatory purchase commitment 
effective with our july  adoption of fas  mandatory mortgage purchase and sell commitments and optional purchase and sell commitments with a fixed price entered into subsequent to june  are accounted for as derivatives and recorded on fannie mae s balance sheet at fair value 
following is a discussion of fannie mae s primary off balance sheet transactions  which include mbs and commitments 
guaranteed mbs we issue mbs through the process of securitization 
in a typical mortgage loan securitization  a lender transfers loans to fannie mae with a direction to deposit those loans into a trust 
in exchange for the loans  we are required to return to the lender  or its designee  our guaranteed mbs 
we refer to this transaction as a lender swap transaction 
lenders may retain the mbs or sell them to other investors 
fannie mae does not receive any consideration in a lender swap transaction other than the associated guaranty fees provided to us for guaranteeing the timely payment of principal and interest to investors on the mbs 
another type of lender swap transaction is when a lender delivers loans that have been pooled to form an mbs along with a forward trade to a third party 
the time between delivery of these pooled loans and the ultimate delivery of the resulting mbs to the third party is  on average  less than days 
in neither instance is fannie mae the transferor of the loans into the mbs in these transactions 
in some instances  a seller may request that we resecuritize mbs that it owns into a new mbs  such as a remic 
in this case  the seller transfers its mbs to fannie mae with direction to place these mbs in a trust that acquires legal ownership of the mbs 
in exchange for the seller s mbs  we issue and deliver to the seller or its designee  our new mbs certificates that are backed by the seller s mbs 
fannie mae does not receive any consideration in this transaction  other than a transaction fee for structuring the new mbs and the guaranty fee on the underlying mbs 
in other instances  a seller may request that we resecuritize its mortgage related securities into a new mbs 
in this case  the seller transfers its mortgage related securities to fannie mae with direction to place these mortgage related securities in a trust that acquires legal ownership of the mortgage related securities 
in exchange for the mortgage related securities  we issue and deliver to the seller or its designee  our new mbs certificates that are backed by the mortgage related securities 
these mbs carry fannie mae s corporate guaranty of timely payment of principal and interest 
fannie mae does not receive any consideration in a mortgage related securities swap transaction  other than the associated guaranty fees for our guaranty of timely payment of principal and interest on the mbs and a transaction fee 
our mbs trusts meet the definition of a qualifying special purpose entity qspe under financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities fas 
in accordance with fas  we do not consolidate these trusts because they are considered qspes 
fannie mae acts as trustee of the mbs trust 
the loans or securities underlying mbs are not our assets  and we do not record them on our balance sheet unless we acquire the mbs as an investment for our mortgage portfolio 
our credit guaranty business receives a guaranty fee and float for assuming the credit risk and guaranteeing timely payment of principal and interest to mbs investors 
the guaranty fee varies  depending on factors such as the risk profile of the loans securitized as well as the level of credit risk we assume 
we are ultimately responsible for guaranteeing timely payment of principal and interest to investors whether or not we share primary default risk on loans underlying outstanding mbs 
we accrue a liability on our balance sheet for our guaranty obligation based on the probability that mortgages underlying our outstanding mbs will not perform according to contractual terms 
at december   we have accrued a liability of million for estimated losses on our guaranty of outstanding mbs  compared with million at december  these amounts are shown on our balance sheets as guaranty liability for mbs 
in addition  under fin  which we adopted on january   guarantors must recognize at inception of a guarantee a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
fin applies prospectively to guarantees on mbs issued by fannie mae on or after january  in accordance with fin  we have recorded a guaranty fee obligation of billion at december  that is included on our balance sheet under other liabilities 
we also recorded a corresponding amount on our balance sheet as a guaranty receivable under other assets because we are compensated for assuming the guaranty fee obligation 
for additional information on fin  see note to our financial statements 
table summarizes issuance and outstanding amounts for mbs guaranteed by fannie mae  including remics  for the years ended december    and table guaranteed mbs outstanding balance at december  mbs issuance activity mbs held by total acquired total other investors mbs by others issued dollars in millions mbs may be resecuritized to back fannie mae megas  smbs  or remics

mbs held by investors other than fannie mae  which we refer to as outstanding mbs  grew percent to trillion at december   from trillion at december  remics that could subject fannie mae to additional credit exposure totaled billion at december   compared with billion at december  total mbs  which includes mbs held in our mortgage portfolio  grew percent to trillion at year end from trillion at year end mbs issuances acquired by investors other than fannie mae increased billion to billion in  while liquidations of outstanding mbs increased to billion from billion in the increase in mbs issuances and liquidations in was attributable to the persistent low level of mortgage interest rates during the year that resulted in record mortgage originations and refinancings 
total mbs issuances  excluding mbs issued from fannie mae s portfolio  increased percent to trillion in from billion in  while total mbs liquidations grew percent to billion from billion in remic issuances totaled billion in  compared with billion in our remic issuances rebounded in with the rest of the remic market and steadily increased in lower interest rates continued to fuel the volume of mbs issuances  making them more attractive to investors 
the remic market remained attractive for investors during because of the steep yield curve 
the outstanding balance of remics including remics held in fannie mae s portfolio was billion at december   compared with billion at december  commitments we enter into master delivery commitments on either a mandatory or an optional basis 
under a mandatory master commitment  a lender must either deliver loans to fannie mae under an mbs contract at a specified guaranty fee rate or enter into a mandatory portfolio commitment with the yield established upon executing the portfolio commitment 
we also accept mandatory or lender option delivery commitments not issued pursuant to a master commitment 
these commitments may be for our portfolio or for issuances of mbs 
effective with our july  adoption of fas  mandatory portfolio purchase commitments are accounted for as derivatives and recorded on our balance sheet at fair value 
we had billion in outstanding mandatory commitments to purchase loans or mortgage related securities for our portfolio at december   compared with billion at december  the decline in outstanding mandatory commitments was due to a decline in the volume of refinancing as interest rates rose in the second half of optional purchase commitments and commitments to issue mbs are not recorded on our balance sheet 
at december   we had billion in outstanding optional commitments for the purchase and delivery of mortgages in  compared with billion in optional purchase and delivery commitments at the end of credit risk management credit risk credit risk is the risk of loss to future earnings or future cash flows that may result from the failure of a borrower or institution to fulfill its contractual obligation to make payments to fannie mae or an institution s failure to perform a service for us 
we assume and manage mortgage credit risk and institutional credit risk that arise through a variety of transactions 
we actively manage credit risk to maintain credit losses within levels that generate attractive profitability and returns on capital and meet our expectations for consistent financial performance 
credit risk management process the executive vice president finance and credit has primary responsibility for setting strategies to achieve the credit risk goals and objectives set by our board of directors 
the executive vice president finance and credit reports to the vice chairman chief financial officer and chairs the credit risk subcommittee of fannie mae s risk policy committee 
the credit risk subcommittee works in concert with the analytics and capital subcommittee and the corporate reporting standards subcommittee to provide corporate governance over fannie mae s credit risk 
fannie mae s business units have primary responsibility for managing our business activities in conformity with the credit strategies and requirements set by our committees 
within each business unit  we have a credit officer who has responsibility for certain credit risk decisions outlined in an approved delegation of credit authority 
our business unit credit officers report directly to the business unit leaders and indirectly to the executive vice president finance and credit 
in addition  we have corporate credit risk management teams that report to the executive vice president finance and credit and work with the business units to identify  measure  and manage credit risks 
our policy and standards team establishes and monitors credit policies  standards  and delegations of credit authority throughout the organization 
our credit research and portfolio management team is responsible for understanding and managing the aggregate risk exposure  risk sensitivity  and usage of risk capital 
our counterparty risk management team is responsible for setting company wide policies governing fannie mae s contractual exposures to institutional counterparties and identifying and measuring these exposures 
our credit management information systems team prepares analysis that monitors and identifies key credit risk trends in the mortgage credit book of business 
our business units monitor and enforce compliance with credit risk standards and identify changes in market conditions that may warrant changes to credit policies and standards 
for example  business units provide quality control oversight by requiring lenders to maintain a rigorous quality control process and by maintaining our own quality assurance process 
our regional offices  which are responsible for managing customer relationships  also play an important risk management role 
working with the business unit leaders  regional customer management teams ensure that pricing and transaction terms are structured appropriately to meet the unique needs and risks of fannie mae and our various lender partners 
regional officers have credit authority to make credit decisions or develop customized mortgage solutions up to certain thresholds as outlined in the credit risk subcommittee s written delegation of authority 
delegating certain credit authority and responsibility to our regional offices has allowed us to work closely with our lender partners  which has been integral to achieving a track record of effective credit risk management 
mortgage credit risk our mortgage credit risk stems from our mortgage credit book of business  where we bear the risk that borrowers fail to make payments required on their mortgages 
our mortgage credit book of business consists of mortgages  mbs and mortgage related securities in our mortgage portfolio  outstanding mbs held by other investors  and other contractual arrangements or guarantees 
we are exposed to credit risk on our mortgage credit book of business because we either own the assets or have guaranteed the timely payment of principal and interest to third parties 
for example  in the event of the default of a borrower on a mortgage underlying an mbs  we absorb any losses  net of the proceeds of any credit enhancements  that result and pay to the mbs investor all accrued interest and the full outstanding principal balance of the defaulted loan 
a certain level of credit losses is an inherent consequence of engaging in the credit guaranty business 
our risk management focus is on controlling the level and volatility of credit losses that result from changes in economic conditions

fannie mae s overall objective in managing mortgage credit risk is to deliver consistent earnings growth and target returns on capital in a wide range of economic environments 
central elements of our approach include managing the profile and quality of mortgages in the mortgage credit book  using credit enhancements to reduce credit losses  assessing the sensitivity of the profitability of the mortgage credit book of business to changes in composition and the economic environment  and managing problem assets to mitigate credit losses 
given the important differences in the nature and management of mortgage credit risk between single family and multifamily loans  we manage and discuss these two types of loans separately 
single family the single family mortgage credit book primarily consists of mortgage loans  loans underlying mbs in our mortgage portfolio and outstanding mbs held by other investors  and loans on properties that have four or fewer residential units underlying other mortgage related securities that we own 
this section details our single family risk management practices  risk characteristics  and performance 
in most instances  we have data on and manage single family mortgage credit risk at the loan level 
these loans represent percent of our single family mortgage credit book at the end of unless otherwise noted  the credit statistics on fannie mae s conventional single family mortgage credit book presented in this section will generally include only mortgage loans in portfolio  mbs in portfolio  and outstanding mbs where we have more comprehensive  detailed loan level information 
most of the remaining percent of our conventional single family mortgage credit book consists of mortgage related securities rated aaa at acquisition 
these mortgage exposures consist of mortgage related assets where we may not have access to detailed loan level data and may not manage the credit performance of individual loans 
for instance  when we acquire a mortgage related security not issued by fannie mae  we assume mortgage credit risk but do not oversee directly risk management on the loans underlying those pools because this function is generally performed by the mortgage servicer on our behalf 
the vast majority of such exposures benefit from substantial credit enhancement such as a guarantee from an entity such as ginnie mae or freddie mac  an insurance policy  structured subordination  and similar sources of credit protection 
such exposures include a freddie mac securities  b ginnie mae securities  c non agency mortgage related securities owned in our portfolio  d mbs backed by non agency mortgage related securities and sold to other investors  and e single family housing related municipal revenue bonds 
while we manage the credit risk on these exposures  we may not have certain loan level information to report risk characteristics and performance disclosures 
these exposures are all performing in an acceptable manner  and  if originally rated  have not experienced downgrades  except for our investments in mortgage related securities backed by manufactured housing loans  details on which are disclosed in the portfolio investment business operations investments mortgage portfolio section of md a 
managing the profile and quality of mortgages in the single family mortgage credit book 
mortgage credit risk on a particular single family loan is affected by numerous characteristics  including the type of loan  the down payment amount  and the strength of the borrower s credit history 
these and other factors  such as home price appreciation  affect both the level of expected credit loss on a given loan and the sensitivity of that loss to changes in the economic environment 
we attempt to understand the overall credit risk in our loans  earn an attractive risk adjusted return from appropriate guaranty fee pricing  and mitigate our risks through the use of credit enhancements and effective asset management 
our risk mitigating activities reduce the incidence and severity of loss and minimize the volatility of credit losses  which helps fannie mae achieve stable earnings growth and a competitive return on equity over time 
mortgage loans that we buy or guarantee generally comply with certain underwriting and eligibility characteristics to ensure that the overall risk of the particular loan is within acceptable limits 
we establish detailed policies and employ various processes to validate that the characteristics of the loans purchased or guaranteed comply with key underwriting and eligibility criteria 
we also assess the characteristics and quality of a lender s loans and processes through a post purchase audit program and our customer relationship management teams 
lenders represent and warrant compliance with our asset acquisition requirements when they sell mortgage loans or securities to us or seek a guarantee from us 
we may require the lender to repurchase a loan or enforce some other remedy if we identify any deficiencies 
since  we have developed and refined du to assist lenders in underwriting and complying with our other loan eligibility criteria 
du consistently and objectively applies risk analytics  underwriting  and eligibility standards to prospective mortgage loans 
approximately percent of the single family conventional loans we purchased or guaranteed in were processed through du  compared to percent in and percent in we also buy or guarantee loans underwritten manually or through other automated underwriting systems  subject to appropriate lender representations and warranties 
in certain circumstances involving use of automated underwriting  we may relieve lenders of a limited number of the standard representations and warranties 
we continuously review the credit quality of the mortgages that we purchase or guarantee 
as a result of these reviews  we periodically adjust our underwriting standards for both du and for mortgages that are manually underwritten 
for example  in june of we announced changes for mortgages secured by manufactured homes that are titled as real property 
the changes which involved eligibility criteria  borrower underwriting standards  pricing adjustments  appraisal requirements and servicing were designed to improve the credit quality of these loans 
the announcement also provided clarifications to lenders to ensure that these types of mortgages are properly identified 
as of december   mortgages secured by manufactured homes titled as real property constituted approximately 
percent of the outstanding unpaid principal balance of our conventional single family mortgage credit book of business and had an average loan size of  using credit enhancements to reduce credit losses 
credit enhancements are contracts in which a third party agrees to pay fannie mae if there is a credit event  such as a loan default 
credit enhancements enable us to transform the risk and return profile of the mortgage credit book of business to be consistent with our objectives 
single family credit enhancements include primary loan level mortgage insurance  pool mortgage insurance  recourse arrangements with lenders  and other customized risk sharing contracts 
the majority of our single family credit enhancement is primary loan level mortgage insurance 
when we require primary loan level mortgage insurance on loans with loan to value ratios above percent  we typically require greater coverage than the minimum level of credit enhancement required by our charter act if primary mortgage insurance is the only source used to meet our credit enhancement requirement 
subject to our policies and to the homeowners protection act of  primary loan level mortgage insurance can be cancelled either automatically or at the borrower s option in certain circumstances where the loan to value ratio has decreased below percent 
we also may require or acquire supplemental credit enhancement on loans based on risk and pricing 
while credit enhancements reduce our mortgage related credit losses  they also generate institutional counterparty risk that we discuss in the institutional counterparty credit risk section 
we focus credit enhancement coverage on loans in our mortgage credit book of business with a higher risk profile 
the percentage of our conventional single family credit book of business with credit enhancements was percent at december   down from percent at december  and percent at december  the decrease in credit enhancement coverage during and was primarily due to the high level of refinance loan acquisitions with lower loan to value ratios that did not require credit enhancement  and on which we did not opt to purchase credit enhancement 
because of the lower risk profile of these loans  we elected not to purchase credit enhancement on these loans 
assessing the sensitivity of the profitability of the single family mortgage credit book of business to changes in composition and the economic environment 
we use analytical tools to measure credit risk exposures  assess performance of our single family mortgage credit book of business  and evaluate risk management alternatives 
we continually refine our methods of measuring credit risk  setting risk and return targets  and transferring risk to third parties 
we use our analytical models to establish forecasts and expectations for the credit performance of loans in the mortgage credit book of business and compare actual performance to those expectations 
comparison of actual versus projected performance and changes in other key trends are monitored to identify changes in risk or return profiles and provide the basis for changing policies  standards  guidelines  credit enhancements  or guaranty fees 
for example  we use models to project guaranty fee income and credit losses  including forgone interest on nonperforming assets  for the single family mortgage credit book across a wide range of potential interest rate and home price environments 
we use current data on home values  borrower payment patterns  non mortgage consumer credit history  and management s economic outlook to assess our sensitivity to credit losses 
we closely examine a range of potential economic scenarios to monitor the sensitivity of credit losses 
as part of our voluntary safety and soundness initiatives  we elected to disclose on a quarterly basis the sensitivity of the present value of future single family credit losses to an immediate percent decline in home prices 
table shows the results as of september  and december  and our models indicate that home price movements are an important predictor of credit performance 
we selected a percent immediate decline in home prices because it is a stressful scenario 
based on housing data from ofheo  the national average rate of home price appreciation over the last twenty years has been about percent  while the lowest national average annual appreciation rate in any single year has been percent 
historical statistics from ofheo s housing index report indicate that there has never been a nationwide decline in home prices within a one year period since the federal government began tracking this data in table single family credit loss sensitivity december  september  dollars in millions gross credit loss sensitivity projected credit risk sharing proceeds net credit loss sensitivity conventional single family mortgage credit book of business as of december net single family credit loss sensitivity as a percentage of conventional single family mortgage credit book of business represents total economic credit losses  which include net charge offs recoveries  foreclosed property expenses  forgone interest  and the cost of carrying foreclosed properties 
measures the gross sensitivity of our expected future credit losses to an immediate percent decline in home values for all single family mortgages in our single family mortgage credit book 
after the initial shock  home price growth rates return to the rate projected by fannie mae s credit pricing models 
results are reported on a lagged quarterly basis 
credit loss sensitivity results for reflect the implementation of enhanced loan performance models  which increased our credit loss sensitivity 
managing problem assets to mitigate credit losses 
we closely manage single family loans in partnership with the servicers of our loans to minimize both the frequency of foreclosure and the severity of loss in the event of foreclosure 
we have developed detailed servicing guidelines and work closely with the loan servicers to ensure that they take appropriate loss mitigation steps on our behalf 
our loan management strategy begins with payment collection guidelines and work rules designed to minimize the number of borrowers who fall behind on their obligations and help borrowers who are delinquent from falling further behind on their payments 
we seek alternative resolutions of problem loans to reduce the legal and management expenses associated with foreclosing on a home 
early intervention is critical to controlling credit expenses 
most of our servicers use risk profiler sm  a default prediction model created by fannie mae  to monitor the performance and risk of each loan and identify loans requiring problem loan management 
risk profiler uses credit risk indicators such as mortgage payment record  updated borrower credit data  current property values  and mortgage product characteristics to evaluate the risk of the loan 
in  percent of our conventional single family loans were evaluated using risk profiler  up from percent in and percent in we require our servicers to pursue various resolutions of problem loans as an alternative to foreclosure  including repayment plans in which borrowers repay past due principal and interest over a reasonable period of time through a temporarily higher monthly payment  loan modifications in which past due principal and interest  net of any borrower contribution  are added to the loan amount and recovered over the remaining life of the loan and other terms of the loan may be adjusted  deeds in lieu of foreclosure in which the borrower signs over title to the property without the added expense of a foreclosure proceeding  and preforeclosure sales in which the borrower  working with the servicer  sells the home and pays off all or part of the outstanding loan  accrued interest  and other expenses with the sale proceeds 
the objective of the repayment plan and loan modification strategies is to keep borrowers who have experienced temporary financial distress in their homes and to avoid the losses associated with foreclosure 
the objective of the deed in lieu and preforeclosure sale strategies is to minimize the extra costs associated with a traditional foreclosure by obtaining the borrower s cooperation in resolving the default 
we use analytical models and work rules to determine which alternative resolution  if any  may be appropriate for each problem loan 
table presents statistics on our problem loans for   and table statistics on conventional single family problem loans number of loans repayment plans modifications pre foreclosure sales properties acquired through foreclosure total conventional single family problem loans conventional single family loans at december includes properties acquired via deeds in lieu of foreclosure  which totaled in  in  and in represents approximately percent of our conventional single family mortgage credit book where we have more comprehensive  detailed loan level transaction information 
we track the ultimate performance of alternative resolutions both in absolute terms and relative to estimated losses in the event of a traditional foreclosure 
we adjust our models and rules as appropriate consistent with our risk management objectives 
in the case of repayment plans and loan modifications  we focus in particular on the performance of the loans subsequent to our intervention 
of the loans that recover through modification and repayment plans  our performance experience after at least three years following the inception of such plans has been that approximately two thirds of these loans remain current or pay off in full and less than percent have terminated through some form of default 
the remaining loans continue to have a delinquent status 
if we acquire the property in the event of default  we seek to maximize the sales proceeds and ensure we receive all credit enhancement payments 
we maintain a centralized property disposition unit to manage the foreclosure process to minimize foreclosure costs and maximize sales proceeds 
single family mortgage credit book characteristics and performance economic conditions and home values strongly affect the credit risk profile of our single family mortgage credit book and our credit losses and impact the likelihood of default and the severity of any losses 
nearly two years after the recession of ended  economic growth finally took off in the third quarter of last year with a surge in real gdp growth of percent 
while there were many signs of economic activity  the labor market continued to lag 
unemployment fell from its peak of percent to percent in december  but much of the decline reflected a decrease in the labor force as opposed to a rise in employment 
despite the continued weak labor market  low mortgage rates and stronger economic activity in the second half of the year propelled housing sales to a record high in  and housing starts were the highest since robust housing demand  coupled with relatively tight supply  continued to support healthy home price appreciation  although not quite as robust as the very strong pace of the past several years 
based on ofheo s fourth quarter house price index report  average home prices at the national level increased percent from the fourth quarter of  accelerating from a more moderate increase of percent during the third quarter of no census region or state experienced negative home price growth during any quarter in over the last five years  us home price appreciation has averaged percent annually 
single family loan risk characteristics we monitor an array of risk characteristics to assess the sensitivity of our credit losses to economic changes 
some of these risk characteristics are described below and quantified in tables and we typically obtain the data for these statistics from the sellers or servicers of the mortgage loans 
we receive representations and warranties as to the accuracy of the information from those providing it 
except for quality assurance efforts  we do not independently verify the reported information 
we generally collect loan level statistics only on conventional single family mortgage loans held in our portfolio and loans backing mbs 
loan to value ltv ratio ltv ratio is the ratio of upb of the loan to the value of the property that serves as collateral 
original ltv is based on the value reported to fannie mae at acquisition of the loan 
current ltv is based on current upb of the loan and original value updated for subsequent changes in home values using fannie mae s internal home valuation models 
ltv ratio is a strong predictor of credit performance 
the likelihood of default and the gross severity of a loss in the event of default are typically lower as the ltv ratio decreases  all other factors held equal 
the estimated average current ltv ratio on the mortgage credit book of business which is a weighted average based on current upb of the loan decreased to percent at december   from percent at the end of  largely due to the substantial volume of new business purchased or guaranteed in and that has not yet had the opportunity to experience home price appreciation 
product type product type is defined by the nature of the interest rate applicable to the mortgage fixed for the duration of the loan or adjustable subject to contractual terms and by the maturity of the loan 
we divide our business into three categories long term  fixed rate mortgages with original terms of greater than years  intermediate term  fixed rate mortgages with original terms of years or less  and adjustable rate mortgages arms of any term 
performance of arm loans is more variable than fixed rate loans  and a variety of arm features may affect performance 
our single family mortgage credit book of business continues to be heavily concentrated in long and intermediate term  fixed rate products that are generally regarded as lower risk investments 
at december  and  percent and percent  respectively  of our single family mortgage credit book of business consisted of long term  fixed rate or intermediate term  fixed rate mortgages 
property type we classify mortgages secured by housing with up to four living units as single family 
mortgages on one unit properties tend to have lower credit risk than mortgages on multiple unit properties  such as duplexes  all other factors held equal 
the majority of fannie mae s book of business consists of loans secured by one unit properties 
the proportion of loans secured by multiple unit properties has remained relatively stable over the past three years 
occupancy type borrowers may purchase a home as a primary residence  second or vacation home  or investment rental property 
mortgages on properties occupied by the borrower as a primary or second residence tend to have lower credit risk than mortgages on investment properties  all other factors held equal 
the vast majority of fannie mae s mortgage credit book of business consists of mortgages on properties occupied by the borrower as the primary residence 
the proportion of loans secured by investment properties has remained relatively stable over the past three years 
credit score borrower credit history is a record of the use and repayment of varying forms of credit by the borrower 
since this information is typically complex and voluminous  statistical models are employed to summarize the information typically into a single numeric indicator of borrower credit quality 
we use several internal proprietary models to assess borrower credit quality at acquisition 
credit score is one measure often used by the financial services industry  and by fannie mae in some cases  to assess borrower credit quality 
credit scores are generated by credit repositories and calculated based on proprietary statistical models that evaluate many types of information on a borrower s credit report and compare this information to the patterns in other credit reports 
one statistical model used widely in the financial services industry was developed by fair  isaac company  inc fair isaac 
this model is used to create a credit score called the fico score 
fico scores can vary depending on which credit repository is using the fair isaac model to supply the score 
fico scores  as reported by the credit repositories  may range from a low of to a high of according to fair isaac  a high fico score indicates a lesser degree of risk 
a higher credit score is an indicator of lower default risk  while a lower credit score indicates higher risk  all other factors held equal 
on approximately two thirds of the mortgages on which we acquire credit risk through purchase or guarantee  lenders provide credit scores that typically reflect the borrower s credit history just prior to our acquisition of the loan 
for most of the remaining loans  we obtain credit scores soon after acquisition 
for a small proportion of loans  credit scores are not available 
the credit score of an individual borrower can vary depending upon several factors  including the timing of when the score is calculated and the credit repository from which the score is obtained 
management believes  however  that the average credit score across our mortgage credit book of business is a strong indicator of default risk within the single family mortgage credit book of business 
the credit quality of borrowers in our book remained high at december   as evidenced by an average credit score of at the time of loan purchase or guarantee  compared with an average score of at december  loan purpose loan purpose indicates how the borrower intends to use the funds 
we designate the loan purpose as either purchase  cash out refinance  or other refinance 
the funds in a purchase transaction are used to acquire a property 
in addition to paying off an existing first mortgage lien  the funds in a cash out refinance transaction are used for other purposes  including paying off subordinate mortgage liens and providing unrestricted cash proceeds to the borrower 
all other refinance transactions are defined as other refinancings 
during the first half of  we implemented an increase in our credit guaranty pricing for cash out refinance mortgages delivered to fannie mae 
this change was implemented in order to more appropriately align pricing with the higher risk profile of these loans 
the significant refinance activity over the past three years resulted in a substantial shift in the proportion of refinance loans in our conventional single family mortgage credit book to percent at december   from percent at december   and percent at the end of thirty percent of the loans in our conventional single family mortgage credit book of business at december  were cash out refinancings  versus percent at december  and percent at the end of geographic concentration local economic conditions affect borrowers ability to repay loans and the value of the collateral underlying a loan  all other factors held equal 
we analyze geographic exposure at a variety of levels of geographic aggregation  including at the regional level 
geographic diversification reduces mortgage credit risk  and our geographic distributions have been consistently well diversified 
we have significant business volumes in the west  with percent at the end of and percent at the end of both and however  this exposure is low relative to the distribution of the overall mortgage market because of our conforming loan limit  which restricts us in serving the financing needs of borrowers in higher cost areas such as california 
loan age we closely track year of origination and loan age  defined as the number of years since origination 
the peak ages for default are from three to seven years after origination 
the average age of our portfolio has decreased in the past year largely due to the high level of refinancings 
as of december   approximately percent of our portfolio was three years old or less and only percent of the loans were in the peak default years 
as of december   approximately percent of our portfolio was three years old or less and percent of the loans were in the peak default years

serious delinquency a key measure of credit performance and future defaults for the single family mortgage credit book is the serious delinquency rate  although not all loans that become seriously delinquent result in a default 
a serious delinquency occurs when a borrower has missed three or more consecutive monthly payments  and the loan has not yet been brought current or been extinguished through foreclosure  payoff  or other resolution 
a loan referred to foreclosure but not yet foreclosed is also considered seriously delinquent 
we classify loans subject to modification as seriously delinquent until the servicer notifies fannie mae that the modification agreement has been executed 
seriously delinquent loans that are subject to a repayment plan are classified as seriously delinquent until the borrower has missed fewer than three consecutive monthly payments 
the serious delinquency rate is the number of mortgages that are seriously delinquent divided by the total number of loans outstanding 
the rate at which new loans become seriously delinquent and the rate at which existing seriously delinquent loans are resolved significantly affects the level of future credit losses 
we include all of our single family conventional loans in our single family delinquency rate  including those with substantial credit enhancement  and distinguish between loans on which we benefit from credit enhancement and loans on which we do not benefit from credit enhancement 
table compares the serious delinquency rates for conventional single family loans with credit enhancements and without credit enhancements 
table conventional single family serious delinquency rates serious serious serious book delinquency book delinquency book delinquency outstanding rate outstanding rate outstanding rate credit enhanced non credit enhanced total conventional loans reported based on unpaid principal balance 
reported based on number of loans 
the serious delinquency rate for all conventional loans in our single family mortgage credit book increased to 
percent at december  from 
percent at december  this increase was primarily due to an increase in the serious delinquency rate of our credit enhanced book 
the serious delinquency rate for conventional loans in our single family mortgage credit book with credit enhancement increased to percent from percent at the end of these loans have a higher risk profile and tend to be more sensitive to changes in the economy than loans without credit enhancement 
the serious delinquency rate for conventional loans without credit enhancement declined slightly to 
percent at december   from 
percent at december   a level reflective of the relatively low risk profile and age of these loans 
most of the conventional loans in our single family mortgage credit book at december  were originated within the last years 
nonperforming single family loans we classify conventional single family loans that we own  including delinquent loans purchased from an mbs trust pursuant to the terms of the trust indenture  as nonperforming and stop accruing interest when a principal and interest on these loans is at least days past due and b collection of principal and interest is doubtful 
table provides a summary for each of the past five years of the following information on our single family nonperforming loans the amount of nonaccrual loans that we owned within our single family mortgage portfolio at the end of each year  the amount of forgone interest income that we would have recorded each year if these loans had performed according to contractual terms during the year  the amount of interest income recognized during the year on the loans when they were performing  and the principal balance of accruing loans past days due at december table nonperforming single family loans dollars in millions nonaccrual loans at december interest income forgone interest income recognized during year accruing loans past due days and greater at december forgone interest income represents the amount of interest income that would have been recorded during the year on nonperforming loans at december had the loans performed according to contractual terms 
represents estimated interest income recognized during the year on loans classified as nonperforming at december principal balance of loans at december that are days or greater past due and continuing to accrue interest 
forgone interest income on non accrual loans increased significantly in and because the number of delinquent loans increased  and because we purchased a higher level of seriously delinquent loans out of mbs pools and added them to our portfolio 
we take this action pursuant to the terms of the relevant securities when the cost of advancing interest to mbs investors at the security coupon rate exceeds the cost of holding the nonperforming loan in our mortgage portfolio 
any net interest remitted to mbs investors but not received from the servicer is included as part of the credit losses in the charge off line item should the loan be foreclosed 
subsequent to a decision to purchase the seriously delinquent loan out of the mbs  the cost of holding the loan in our portfolio is reflected as a reduction to net interest income 
we may recover a portion of forgone interest income when we liquidate foreclosed properties and collect credit enhancement proceeds 
single family credit losses the application of various credit risk management strategies throughout a loan s life helped minimize single family credit losses in despite mixed economic conditions 
single family credit losses include charge offs plus foreclosed property expense income 
interest forgone on nonperforming loans in our mortgage portfolio  which is presented in table  results from credit performance and reduces our net interest income but is not reflected in our credit loss total

multifamily we also purchase or guarantee loans on multifamily properties properties with more than four residential units 
we typically provide financing either in the form of single asset loan purchases  principally through the delegated underwriting and servicing dus product line  or through a negotiated transaction involving a pool of multifamily properties 
the principal credit risks of multifamily property financings involve the following physical condition and financial performance of the property market conditions in the geographic location of the property ability and intent of the borrower to repay the loan structure of the financing managing the profile and quality of mortgages in the multifamily mortgage credit book 
numerous characteristics impact the mortgage credit risk on a particular multifamily loan 
these characteristics include the type of mortgage loan  the type and location of the property  the condition and value of the property  the financial strength of the borrower and lender  and the current and anticipated cash flows on the property 
these and other factors affect both the amount of expected credit loss on a given loan and the sensitivity of that loss to changes in the economic environment 
we employ various strategies to understand and control the overall risk in each loan we purchase or guarantee 
while we may purchase or securitize mortgages from approved risk sharing lenders under the dus product line without prior review of mortgages that are less than a specified dollar amount million in  lenders represent and warrant that dus loans they originate are consistent with our underwriting requirements 
approximately percent of our multifamily mortgage credit book consisted of dus products or business at december   compared with percent at the end of we manage multifamily mortgage credit risk throughout the investment life cycle 
the cycle begins with the formulation of sound underwriting and servicing policies and procedures 
when application of these policies and procedures is delegated to our lending partners  we actively monitor results through post purchase underwriting reviews of loans delivered to us 
we closely track property condition and financial performance throughout the life of the assets we finance 
we also evaluate borrower  geographic  and other types of risk concentrations at the loan and portfolio level 
using credit enhancements to reduce credit losses 
we use credit enhancements to transform the risk and return profile of multifamily loans that we purchase or guarantee consistent with our corporate credit risk management objectives 
in most of our business arrangements  lenders in the dus product line bear losses on the first five percent of upb and share in remaining losses up to a prescribed limit 
on negotiated pool transactions or structured credit facilities  we generally have full or partial recourse to lenders or third parties for loan losses 
the credit enhancement provider may back up its obligation with letters of credit  investment agreements  or pledged collateral 
third party recourse providers for structured and other transactions include government and private mortgage insurers 
while credit enhancements reduce our mortgage related credit losses  they also generate institutional counterparty risk  which we discuss further in the institutional counterparty credit risk section

shared risk represents percent  percent  and percent of the total multifamily mortgage credit book of business at december    and  respectively 
assessing the sensitivity of the profitability of the multifamily mortgage credit book of business to changes in composition and the economic environment 
we use analytical tools to measure credit risk exposures  assess performance of our book  and evaluate risk management alternatives 
we combine these analyses with assessments of any problem loan situations to develop forecasts of future guaranty fee revenue and credit losses 
we carefully monitor the relevant local market economic indicators that may signal changing risk or return profiles in the book and cause a change in risk management policies  credit enhancements  or guaranty fees 
for example  we closely monitor rental payment trends and vacancy levels in local markets to identify loans meriting closer attention or loss mitigation actions 
managing problem assets to mitigate credit losses 
as part of our risk management activities  we perform detailed loss reviews  address borrower and geographic concentrations  assess lender qualifications  evaluate counterparty risk  and track property performance and contract compliance 
the special asset management team manages troubled assets from default through foreclosure and property disposition  if necessary 
given the size of multifamily loans  we generally require servicers to submit periodic operating information and property condition reviews to monitor the performance of individual loans 
we use this information to evaluate the credit quality of our book  identify potential problem loans  and initiate appropriate loss mitigation activities 
multifamily mortgage credit book performance the slow economic recovery  particularly the lack of new job creation  has had an adverse effect on our multifamily property performance resulting in increased vacancies and decreased property operating income 
multifamily credit related losses totaled million in  compared with million in and million in the higher level of credit losses in and reflect an increase in foreclosures

we base the multifamily serious delinquency rate on the upb of delinquent loans divided by the upb of multifamily loans we own or guarantee 
our multifamily serious delinquency rate increased to 
percent at year end from 
percent at the end of this increase is mainly attributed to the addition of million in seriously delinquent loans from two borrowers 
at the end of  our multifamily serious delinquency rate was 
percent primarily due to two seriously delinquent loans totaling million on properties in new york city affected by the world trade center disaster that were restructured or became current in over the last three years  multifamily credit losses and serious delinquencies have been at historically low levels 
due to declining real estate fundamentals in the multifamily market over the last several years  we have experienced significant growth in our watch list and  as a result  anticipate higher losses in we generally stop accruing interest on multifamily loans that we own when principal and interest on these loans is days past due and collection of principal and interest is doubtful 
table summarizes the amount of nonaccrual multifamily loans at december  through december  in addition  it identifies the amount of interest income that we would have recorded during those periods if nonperforming loans had performed according to contractual terms during the year  the amount of interest income accrued on those loans during the portion of the year when they were performing  and the principal balance of accruing loans past days due at december table nonperforming multifamily loans dollars in millions nonaccrual loans at december interest income forgone interest income recognized during year accruing loans past due days and greater at december forgone interest income represents the amount of interest income that would have been recorded during the year on nonperforming loans at december had the loans performed according to contractual terms 
represents estimated interest income recognized during the year on loans classified as nonperforming at december principal balance of loans at december that are days or greater past due and continuing to accrue interest 
equity financing for multifamily properties we also provide equity financing for multifamily properties 
equity financing typically takes the form of limited partnership investments in affordable housing projects that produce low income housing tax credits 
the tax benefits we receive from these properties represent our primary economic return on our equity investments 
because our equity financings have the same property related credit risks as other multifamily financings  we track property condition and financial performance throughout the life of these investments 
we also evaluate the strength of our investment sponsors and third party asset managers through periodic financial and operational assessments 
at december  and  approximately percent and percent  respectively  of our equity investments in low income housing tax credit properties had an economic return guaranteed by an investment grade counterparty 
internal revenue service requirements govern the recognition of tax credits 
these requirements include maintaining the properties with a specified level of affordable housing units over a year period 
failure to meet irs requirements can trigger a recapture of tax credits from the irs 
for the years ended december    and  the amounts of tax credit recapture were not significant 
institutional counterparty credit risk a secondary credit risk is the possibility that institutional counterparties may be unable to fulfill their contractual obligations to us 
for example  our credit losses would increase if a credit enhancement counterparty were unable to reimburse us in the event of loss on a covered mortgage loan 
accepting a certain level of counterparty risk is integral to our interest rate and credit risk management and liquidity objectives 
we have a dedicated counterparty risk management team that quantifies aggregate counterparty risk exposures across business activities  maintains a corporate credit policy framework for managing counterparty risk  and manages the counterparty risk associated with mortgage insurance companies 
our overall objective in managing institutional counterparty credit risk is to maintain individual counterparty exposures within a range that allows us to achieve our overall financial performance objective of stable and predictable earnings 
central elements of our approach to managing institutional counterparty credit risk include stringent counterparty eligibility standards appropriate to each exposure type and level  collateralization of exposures where appropriate  policies to ensure our counterparty exposures are diversified to avoid excessive concentration of risk  and intensive exposure monitoring and management 
maintaining stringent counterparty eligibility standards appropriate to each exposure type 
we generally require that our counterparties have an investment grade credit rating 
a rating of bbb baa bbb or higher by standard poor s  moody s investor service  and fitch  respectively  is considered an investment grade rating 
for mortgage insurance counterparties  we have generally required a minimum rating of aa aa aa 
for our risk sharing  recourse  and mortgage servicing counterparties  we do not always require an investment grade credit rating because we believe the risk of loss is lower 
we have ongoing  extensive mortgage purchase and mortgage servicing relationships with these counterparties  and in most instances  we also have contractual rights  collateral  letters of credit  or investment agreements to secure the obligation 
individual business units maintain policies and procedures governing the eligibility of counterparties and approval requirements for accepting exposure to them 
for example  we maintain requirements governing eligibility of insurers to provide primary loan level mortgage insurance on single family loans we buy or guarantee 
we conduct a comprehensive counterparty analysis before approving a mortgage insurance company 
we review a mortgage insurer s business plan  financial statements  insurance portfolio characteristics  master insurance policies  reinsurance treaties  and ratings on ability to pay claims 
we monitor approved insurers through a quarterly reporting and analysis process combined with onsite business reviews 
requiring collateralization of exposures  where appropriate 
we may require collateral  letters of credit  or investment agreements as a condition to accepting exposure to a particular counterparty 
we may also require that a counterparty post collateral in the event of an adverse event such as a ratings downgrade 
we also have contractual rights that can offset exposure in the event of a counterparty default 
for example  if an insurer cannot provide mortgage insurance in accordance with our requirements  most of our mortgage insurance policies have provisions that allow us to use borrower paid mortgage insurance premiums to obtain substantially equivalent protection 
if this insurance is unavailable at an acceptable cost  we can retain the premium and use it to obtain other credit enhancement or as a loss reserve 
similarly  we have the contractual right to terminate a single family or multifamily lender s status as a servicer in the event the lender fails to fulfill its servicing obligations or fails to reimburse fannie mae for losses that the lender assumed 
in that event  we would either sell the servicing rights or use the servicing fees to offset any losses related to the lender s failure 
establishing policies to ensure diversification of our exposure 
we monitor counterparty exposure in total by industry and by individual counterparty 
in addition  we have established exposure tolerance levels by counterparty based on our assessment of each counterparty s credit strength 
these tolerance thresholds allow us to prioritize our monitoring activities and avoid excessive concentrations of credit risk 
monitoring and managing exposures intensively within business lines and across fannie mae 
individual business units are responsible for managing the counterparty exposures routinely associated with their activities 
the counterparty risk management team reviews business unit policies  procedures  and approval authorities  and the credit risk subcommittee approves these internal controls 
non derivative institutional counterparty risk primarily includes exposure created by mortgage insurance policies  other credit enhancement arrangements with lenders and others  mortgage servicing contracts with lenders  and liquidity investments in corporate obligations or nonmortgage asset backed securities 
we discuss derivative counterparty risk under md a portfolio investment business operations funding derivative instruments 
mortgage insurers the primary risk associated with mortgage insurers is that they will fail to fulfill their obligations to reimburse us for claims under insurance policies 
we were the beneficiary of primary mortgage insurance coverage on billion of single family loans in portfolio or underlying mbs at december   which represented percent of our single family book of business  compared with billion or percent of our single family book of business at december  seven mortgage insurance companies  all rated aa or higher by s p  provided approximately and percent of the total coverage at the end of and  respectively 
we recently issued revised mortgage insurer approval requirements 
our revisions were intended to modernize our requirements in light of ofheo s risk based capital rule and changes in the mortgage insurance industry 
the revisions focus on safety and soundness of these vital partners and create a transparent and consistent set of standards 
we expect that all currently approved mortgage insurers will be compliant with the revised requirements when they take effect on january  lenders with risk sharing the primary risk associated with lenders providing risk sharing agreements is that they will fail to reimburse us for losses as required under these agreements 
we had recourse to lenders for losses on single family loans totaling an estimated billion at december  and billion at december  the quality of these counterparties is high  with investment grade counterparties accounting for percent and percent of lender recourse obligations at the end of and  respectively 
we also require some lenders to pledge collateral to secure their recourse obligations 
at december  and  we held million and million in collateral  respectively  to secure single family lender recourse transactions 
in addition  single family lenders with recourse obligations received servicing fees on trillion and trillion of mortgages at year end and  respectively 
a portion of these servicing fees effectively serves as collateral 
we had full or partial recourse to lenders on multifamily loans totaling billion and billion at december  and  respectively 
our multifamily recourse obligations generally were partially or fully secured by reserves held in custodial accounts  insurance policies  letters of credit from investment grade counterparties rated a or better  or investment agreements 
in addition  all multifamily lenders with recourse obligations received servicing fees  a portion of which effectively serves as collateral 
mortgage servicers the primary risk associated with mortgage servicers is that they will fail to fulfill their servicing obligations 
mortgage servicers collect mortgage and escrow payments from borrowers  pay taxes and insurance costs from escrow accounts  monitor and report delinquencies  and perform other required activities on our behalf 
a servicing contract breach could result in credit losses for us  or we could incur the cost of finding a replacement servicer 
for most servicers  we mitigate this risk in several ways 
first  we require mortgage servicers to maintain a minimum reserve servicing fee rate to compensate a replacement servicer in the event of a servicing contract breach 
we also manage this risk by requiring servicers to follow specific servicing guidelines and by monitoring each servicer s performance using loan level data 
we conduct on site reviews of compliance with servicing guidelines and mortgage servicing performance 
we also work on site with nearly all of our major servicers to facilitate loan loss mitigation efforts and improve the default management process 
in addition  we review quarterly financial information on servicers 
our ten largest single family mortgage servicers serviced percent of our single family book of business  and the largest single family mortgage servicer serviced percent of our single family book of business at the end of and our largest multifamily mortgage servicers serviced percent of our multifamily book of business at year end  compared with percent at year end the largest multifamily servicer serviced percent of our multifamily book of business at the end of and liquid investments the primary credit risk associated with our liquid investments is that issuers will not repay us in accordance with contractual terms 
the level of credit risk in our liquid investments is low because these investments are primarily high quality  short and medium term investments  such as federal funds and time deposits  commercial paper  asset backed securities  and corporate floating rate notes 
our nonmortgage investments  which account for the majority of our liquid investments  totaled billion and billion at the end of and  respectively 
the majority of our asset backed nonmortgage related securities are rated aaa by s p 
our unsecured investments are generally rated a or higher by s p 
approximately percent of our nonmortgage investments had a credit rating of a or higher at december   compared with percent at december  operations risk management although our primary market risks are interest rate risk and credit risk  we also are subject to operations risk 
operations risk is the risk of potential loss resulting from a breakdown in  or failure to establish  effective procedures and controls 
examples of control breakdowns include the absence or circumvention of internal controls  human error  systems failure and fraud 
fannie mae looks to its senior leadership team and its office of auditing to understand and mitigate operations risk 
our operations  transactions  and investment committee oti chaired by our chief operating officer is responsible for corporate wide oversight  organization  and management of operations risk 
senior management has implemented comprehensive procedures and internal controls to decrease the likelihood of control breakdowns 
the office of auditing independently tests the adequacy of  and adherence to  these internal controls and related policies and procedures 
fannie mae actively manages its operations risk through a number of oversight functions including exception reporting and managerial oversight of financial and forecasting information through verification  reconciliation and independent testing management control self assessment questionnaires that identify key risks  controls in place to mitigate those risks  known control weaknesses and plans to address those weaknesses key performance indicators kpis that measure and track key operational metrics and potential exposure quarterly senior and executive management internal control reporting and certifications audit test work that validates the adequacy of the internal control environment and the reporting of this work directly to the audit committee of the board of directors comprehensive disaster recovery planning  provisioning and testing management regularly reconciles financial  accounting and model results to source documentation to ensure completeness and accuracy of financial reporting 
financial forecast model results are also reconciled to actual results and the models are recalibrated as necessary to both improve them and mitigate modeling risk 
the office of auditing also periodically benchmarks critical models  evaluates the reasonableness of the underlying assumptions  and validates key algorithms within them 
management self assesses their operational risk and internal control environment within parameters established by audit and then attests to the accuracy of this assessment quarterly 
audit reviews and validates these assessments to ensure reasonableness  accuracy and full disclosure 
kpis monitor primary operational metrics and facilitate quick and effective senior management attention should adverse trends develop 
kpis and related audit work focus on the following operational risks market volatility and modeling potential losses due to ineffective portfolio management  rising delinquencies or erroneous interest rate or credit risk modeling underwriting effectiveness losses due to the failure of management or our lender counterparties to apply appropriate underwriting techniques counterparty risk losses due to inadequate monitoring and risk mitigation resulting in exposure to counterparties who fail to meet their obligations to fannie mae 
counterparties include lenders and loan servicers  credit enhancers  document custodians  derivative partners and other service providers transaction processing losses due to inadequate transaction processing controls  such as ineffective management oversight and reconciliation processes  erroneous wire transfers or loan deliveries  fraud  trade failures  release of inaccurate securities information  etc 
systems availability failure to meet internal or external production or functionality requirements due to inoperable application systems  inconsistent performance  insufficient capacity or disaster recoverability information security financial losses and potential liability due to unauthorized systems access and corruption or destruction of critical  proprietary or confidential data mission alignment absence of appropriate leadership or business model resulting in regulatory sanction  reputation damage or litigation due to noncompliance with laws  regulations  or charter requirements financial reporting economic or reputation loss due to erroneous or delayed release of financial reports the office of auditing reports kpis monthly and each kpi is based upon clearly defined and quantifiable performance thresholds 
senior management evaluates kpi activity and implements prompt corrective action as necessary 
audit tests the integrity of this process by periodically validating the underlying data and control environment 
quarterly  senior and executive management certify that internal controls are adequate  self assessment questionnaires and kpis are accurate  and that all significant issues or control weaknesses that could have a material impact on the financial statements have been disclosed 
the office of auditing reviews this information for reasonableness and reports its results to the disclosure committee 
these certifications provide a primary component supporting the chief executive officer s and chief financial officer s written certifications that the financial statements fairly present fannie mae s financial condition and results of operations in all material respects 
in addition to the oversight functions indicated above  the office of auditing annually assesses potential risk and the underlying control environment by major business process across the company and then implements a comprehensive  risk based audit plan to validate that risk and the key controls necessary to mitigate it 
audit also performs third party audits to assess counterparty risk and to substantiate related internal controls 
many of these audits are of entities that either sell or service loans for fannie mae where their financial and operational controls are evaluated by reviewing the financial statements and assessing compliance with our net worth and insurance coverage requirements to assess financial strength  eligibility and capability of doing business with fannie mae  testing cash and custodial accounting controls to ensure both fannie mae and borrower funds are held in qualified institutions and that the funds are properly accounted for  safeguarded and remitted  and determining that key controls associated with loan underwriting  accounting  reporting and servicing are operating effectively  loan activity is accurately reported and that our mortgage assets are protected 
fannie mae has also developed and provided the necessary infrastructure for comprehensive disaster recovery plans covering both application systems and business operations that are designed to restore critical operations with minimal interruption 
major components of this plan are tested annually at established contingency sites 
liquidity and capital resources fannie mae s statutory mission requires that we provide ongoing assistance to the secondary market for mortgages 
our ability to continually raise low cost capital is critical to fulfilling our housing mission of providing liquidity to the secondary mortgage market and promoting homeownership to low and moderate income families 
we primarily rely on debt to purchase mortgage assets and to supply liquidity to the secondary market 
our mortgage asset purchases totaled billion and billion in and  respectively  based on unpaid principal balance 
we issued trillion of debt in and trillion in to fund those purchases and to replace maturing  called or repurchased debt 
we take a long term approach to our funding and capital management strategy because of our continuous requirements for large amounts of funding 
fannie mae s liquidity and capital position is actively managed to preserve stable  reliable  and cost effective sources of cash to meet all current and future normal operating financial commitments  meet our regulatory capital requirements  and handle any unforeseen liquidity crisis 
liquidity fannie mae s primary sources of liquidity include proceeds from the issuance of debt  principal and interest received on our mortgage portfolio  guaranty fees earned on our mbs  and principal and interest received on our liquid investments 
primary uses of liquidity include the purchase of mortgage assets  repayment of debt  interest payments  administrative expenses  taxes  and fulfillment of fannie mae s mbs guaranty obligations 
our liquid assets  which include our liquid investments net of any cash and cash equivalents pledged as collateral  totaled billion at december   compared with billion at december  as part of our voluntary safety and soundness discipline  we adhere to principles for sound liquidity management established by the basel committee on banking supervision 
these principles outline the appropriate structure for managing liquidity and market access  a process for measuring and monitoring net funding requirements  the need for contingency plans  the necessary controls for liquidity risk management  and the role of public disclosure and regulatory oversight 
we monitor our liquidity position through a combination of daily  weekly and monthly reports to help set strategies and make funding decisions 
our analyses include projected cash flows and funding needs  targeted funding terms and various funding alternatives for achieving those terms  cost of debt and the most efficient ways to achieve desired funding  and market conditions and upcoming economic indicators and other factors that could impact the capital markets and our funding capabilities 
table summarizes the effect that our minimum debt payments and other material noncancelable contractual obligations as of december  are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods

arrangements that may be cancelled without penalty are excluded 
we have historically had ready access to funding for the following reasons our credit quality in february  standard poor s assigned fannie mae a aa risk to the government rating 
in february  moody s investors service assigned us an a bank financial strength rating 
the highest possible levels for these ratings are aaa from standard poor s and a from moody s 
these ratings are continuously monitored by each rating agency 
additionally  our senior unsecured debt has been rated aaa  aaa  and aaa by fitch  inc  moody s investors service  and standard poor s  respectively 
fitch  moody s  and standard poor s rated our short term debt f  prime or p  and a  respectively 
our standing in the capital market we are an active participant in the global financial markets and one of the world s largest private issuers of debt securities 
our debt obligations are traded in the agency securities market 
the agency securities market includes securities issued by government sponsored enterprises gses 
while the us government does not guarantee our debt  directly or indirectly  securities issued by gses are typically perceived to be of high credit quality 
our efficiency we have demonstrated a long term commitment to investors in the organized way we bring debt issues to market and monitor performance in the secondary market 
we have successfully developed new funding products and markets with a variety of terms and features to appeal to a wide spectrum of investors 
in addition  we may transform the debt into terms and other features that better match our funding needs through our efficient use of derivatives 
given the importance of debt to our funding strategy  we have a contingency plan to protect us in the event of a major market disruption that would prevent us from issuing debt 
as part of our voluntary safety and soundness initiatives  we maintain contingency plans for handling a liquidity crisis under an assumption that we cannot access the new issue debt markets for a period of at least three months 
each day we update and analyze cash commitments and anticipated cash flows for the next days 
our analysis indicates how we expect to obtain funds during that period in the event we cannot access the capital markets 
in the event of a market disruption in which we could not issue debt  we could liquidate our liquid investments or borrow against our mortgage portfolio to meet our operational needs fannie mae s liquid investments primarily consist of high quality securities that are readily marketable or have short term maturities and serves as the primary means for ensuring that we maintain sufficient liquidity 
we can use our liquid investments as necessary for liquidity purposes or to reinvest in readily marketable  high credit quality securities that can be sold to raise cash 
if our access to the debt capital markets is ever impaired  we first will utilize our liquid investments to generate the cash necessary to meet our liquidity needs 
our initial source of funds would come from the ongoing maturity of short term investments 
if additional funds were needed  we would sell assets to generate these funds 
as part of our voluntary commitments  we have publicly pledged to maintain a portfolio of high quality  liquid assets equal to at least percent of total on balance sheet assets 
the ratio of liquid assets to total assets was percent and percent at december  and  respectively 
fannie mae s mortgage portfolio consists of assets that could be pledged as collateral for financing in the repurchase agreement market 
we are able to borrow against fannie mae s mortgage assets in the market for mortgage repurchase agreements 
we test this capability through periodic issuance 
at december  and  we had approximately billion and billion  respectively  in eligible mortgage related securities of which  billion and billion  respectively  had been pledged as collateral under repurchase agreements 
capital resources regulatory environment fannie mae is subject to capital adequacy standards established by the federal housing enterprises financial safety and soundness act of act and continuous examination by ofheo  which was established by the act 
the regulatory capital framework incorporates two different quantitative assessments of capital a minimum and a risk based capital standard 
while the minimum capital standard is ratio based  the risk based capital standard is based on simulated stress test performance 
fannie mae is required to maintain sufficient capital to meet both of these requirements in order to be deemed adequately capitalized 
ofheo s examination program provides an assessment of capital adequacy in support of the overall classification process 
for purposes of the minimum capital standard  fannie mae is considered adequately capitalized if core capital equals or exceeds the minimum capital and a lower critical capital requirement 
core capital is defined by ofheo as the stated value of common stock  the stated value of outstanding noncumulative perpetual preferred stock  paid in capital  and retained earnings  less treasury stock 
core capital excludes accumulated other comprehensive income because aoci incorporates unrealized gains losses on derivatives and certain securities  but not the unrealized losses gains on the remaining mortgages and securities or liabilities used to fund the purchase of these items 
the ratio based minimum capital standard is the sum of percent of on balance sheet assets  
percent of outstanding mbs  and 
percent of adjusted off balance sheet obligations 
equivalent critical capital levels are set at percent  
percent  and 
percent respectively 
fannie mae s total capital base is used to meet risk based capital requirements 
total capital is defined by ofheo as the sum of core capital and the total allowance for loan losses and guaranty liability for mbs  less the specific loss allowance 
table shows our core capital and total capital at december  and core capital grew to billion at december  from billion at december  total capital grew to billion at the end of from billion at year end table capital requirements december  core capital required minimum capital excess of core capital over minimum capital total capital required risk based capital not available  excess of total capital over required risk based capital not available  required critical capital excess of core capital over required critical capital amounts at december  represent estimates  pending ofheo s certification  which is generally provided no later than months following the end of each quarter

the december  amounts do not reflect the effect of the balance sheet reclassification of amounts associated with the guaranty liability for mbs that we own from our allowance for loan losses to guaranty liability for mbs 
amount at december  will not be available until the end of march ofheo reports fannie mae s risk based capital at the end of each quarter on a lagged quarterly basis 
pursuant to requirements of the act  ofheo published regulations in september  as amended on march   establishing a risk based capital stress test to determine the amount of total capital we must hold under the risk based capital standard on a quarterly basis 
ofheo formally implemented the risk based capital standard on september  our total capital exceeded our risk based capital requirement of billion by billion at september   the most recent quarter for which ofheo has published the risk based standard 
at the end of  our total capital base exceeded the risk based capital requirement of billion by billion 
our risk policy committee  chaired by the chief financial officer  ensures compliance with economic and regulatory risk based capital requirements as well as our voluntary initiative to supplement our equity capital with the issuance of subordinated debt 
ofheo employs a rigorous stress test to formally compute the company s binding risk based capital requirement 
the regulatory stress test simulates the company s performance over a year period of severe economic conditions characterized by both extreme interest rate movements and mortgage default rates 
stress test results indicate the amount of capital required to survive such prolonged economically stressful conditions absent new business or active risk management action 
the regulatory risk based capital requirement includes an additional percent surcharge to cover unspecified management and operations risk 
the first full year of application of the regulatory stress test was each quarter  ofheo runs a detailed profile of our corporate book of business through a computer simulation model that utilizes cash flows and the economics of individual transactions to evaluate our risk and measure our capital adequacy 
ofheo makes the results of its stress tests publicly available 
in each of the quarters for which ofheo has used risk based capital in its determination of capital adequacy  we have shown a significant capital surplus relative to our risk based capital requirements 
table details the results of our official requirements published to date 
note that results may not be directly correlated with our other risk measures  such as the duration gap  given that stress tests focus on extreme scenarios 
table regulatory stress test results risk based reported quarter capital capital ended requirement total capital surplus dollars in millions not available  not available amount at december  will not be available until the end of march ofheo reports fannie mae s risk based capital at the end of each quarter on a lagged quarterly basis 
because our risk management strategies are designed to address multiple objectives concurrently  we expect variability in our risk based reported capital surplus from period to period 
for example  our reported risk based capital surplus declined between the end of june and september due to aggressive actions we took during the third quarter to rebalance our portfolio 
in response to a rapid increase in long term market rates  we significantly lengthened the maturity of our liabilities to provide additional protection against the risk of a rising interest rate environment and to maintain our various risk metrics within our targeted reference points 
while the shift to longer term liabilities enhanced our up rate environment stress test results  our actions as expected created additional exposure and increased our risk based capital requirements in the down rate stress test 
we view the reported decline in the risk based capital surplus during the third quarter of as entirely consistent with our overall risk management objectives as they pertain to optimal capital deployment and capital adequacy needs 
during  several bills were introduced in congress that propose to alter the regulatory regime under which fannie mae operates 
these bills seek to transfer regulatory responsibility for overseeing fannie mae s financial safety and soundness from ofheo to a bureau under the us department of the treasury 
some of the bills would also move various of the hud s regulatory authorities over fannie mae to the treasury bureau 
several bills seek to provide additional or expanded powers to fannie mae s regulators 
we cannot predict whether any legislation will be approved by congress and signed into law by the president and  if so  the final form  effective date of the legislation  or impact on fannie mae s capital requirements 
capital activity common shares outstanding  net of shares held in treasury  totaled approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
during  fannie mae issued million common shares from treasury for employee and other stock compensation plans 
we issued million common shares from treasury during to fund our commitment of million to the fannie mae foundation and for employee and other stock compensation plans 
in january  fannie mae s board of directors approved a share repurchase program under which up to percent of common shares outstanding as of december  could be purchased by the company 
at the same time  the board approved the repurchase of additional shares to offset stock issued or expected to be issued under the company s employee benefit plans 
this share repurchase program replaces the repurchase program in effect since and has no specified expiration date 
as part of the continuation of our capital restructuring program  we repurchased million common shares at a weighted average cost per share of in and million common shares at a weighted average cost per share of in we repurchased the stock pursuant to our share repurchase program and to offset the dilutive effect of common shares issued in conjunction with various stock compensation programs 
we raised additional equity of billion in and billion in by issuing non cumulative preferred stock 
we had no preferred stock redemptions during preferred stock redemptions totaled million in preferred stock accounted for percent of our core capital at december   versus percent at december  in january  our board of directors approved a quarterly common stock dividend for of 
per common share  an increase of percent over the 
dividend paid during the third and fourth quarters of and a percent increase over the 
dividend paid during the first two quarters of the increased dividend rate reflects management s confidence in the strength and sustainability of fannie mae s business performance 
it also responds to increased investor focus on dividend payouts following the reduction in the tax rate on dividends

we issued billion of subordinated debt securities in  billion in  and billion in all of our subordinated debt issuances received ratings of aa from standard poor s  aa from moody s investors service  and aa by fitch ratings 
subordinated debt serves as a supplement to our equity capital although it is not a component of core capital 
it provides a risk absorbing layer to supplement core capital for the benefit of senior debt holders and is intended to serve as a consistent and early market signal of credit risk for investors 
with outstanding subordinated benchmark notes of billion at december   we met our voluntary initiative of issuing sufficient subordinated debt to bring the sum of total capital and outstanding subordinated debt to at least percent of on balance sheet assets  after providing adequate capital to support off balance sheet mbs  by the end of total capital and outstanding subordinated debt represented percent of on balance sheet assets at december   compared with percent of at december  accumulated other comprehensive income aoci  which is not included in our regulatory core capital  totaled negative billion at december   compared with a negative balance of billion at december  fas requires that we record changes in the fair value of derivatives that qualify as cash flow hedges in aoci  net of taxes  which accounts for a significant portion of the negative amounts reflected in aoci 
in addition  commencing with our july  adoption of fas  we have designated forward commitments to purchase mortgage loans or mortgage related securities that we intend to retain in our mortgage portfolio as cash flow hedges 
accordingly  changes in the fair value of these commitments are recorded in aoci  to the extent effective 
on september   concurrent with the implementation of a new risk based capital rule issued by ofheo  we reclassified billion of securities in our mortgage and nonmortgage investment portfolios from held to maturity to available for sale in accordance with fas at the time of this noncash transfer  the securities had gross unrealized gains of billion and losses of million 
prior to ofheo s risk based capital rule  fannie mae was not subject to a risk based capital standard 
ofheo s new risk based capital rule establishes a risk weight for fannie mae s assets 
fas specifically identifies a significant increase in the risk weights of debt securities used for regulatory risk based capital purposes as a change in circumstance under which a company may reclassify securities from held to maturity to available for sale without calling into question the intent to hold other securities to maturity in the future 
see government regulation and charter act capital requirements for additional information on our risk based capital rule 
pending accounting pronouncements fin r  consolidation of variable interest entities in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin 
fin provides guidance on when a company should consolidate the assets  liabilities  and activities of a variable interest entity vie and identifies when an entity should disclose information about its relationship with a vie 
a vie is a legal structure used to conduct activities or hold assets  which must be consolidated by a company if it is considered the primary beneficiary because it either absorbs a majority of the entity s expected losses  a majority of the expected returns  or both 
qspes  which we use to issue mbs  are exempt from fin unless a company has the unilateral ability to liquidate or change the qspe 
the original provisions of fin were effective february  for all arrangements entered into after january  in december  the fasb issued a revision of fin fin r to clarify some of its provisions 
the revision results in multiple effective dates based on the nature as well as the creation date of the vie 
vies created after january   but prior to january   may be accounted for either based on the original interpretations or the revised interpretations 
however  all vies must be accounted for under the revised interpretations beginning in the first quarter of  when fin r is effective for fannie mae 
we are continuing to evaluate whether we have relationships with vies and  if so  whether we should consolidate them and disclose information about them as either the primary beneficiary or as an interest holder under fin r 
based on the original fin guidance  several entities that fannie mae is involved with primarily low income housing tax credit partnerships meet the definition of a vie 
however  we do not believe that we will be required to consolidate our interests in these vies under fin r based on our preliminary assessment 
we primarily serve as a limited partner in these arrangements and currently record the amount of our investment in these partnerships as an asset on our balance sheet and recognize our share of partnership income or losses in our income statement 
we provide additional detail on our accounting for investments in low income housing tax credit partnerships and provide a summary of our primary partnership investment types in note to our financial statements 
our investment balance of billion at december  plus the risk of recapture of tax credits previously recognized on these investments represents our maximum exposure to loss 
we believe the risk of recapture of previously recognized tax credits is low 
our exposure to loss on these partnerships is mitigated by the strength of our investment sponsors and third party asset managers as well as the condition and financial performance of the underlying properties 
in certain of these partnerships  our exposure to loss is further mitigated by a guaranteed economic return from investment grade counterparties 
sop  accounting for certain loans or debt securities acquired in a transfer in december  the accounting standards executive committee acsec of the aicpa issued statement of position  accounting for certain loans or debt securities acquired in a transfer sop 
sop applies to acquired loans where there has been evidence of deterioration in credit quality at the date of purchase and for which it is probable that the investor will not be able collect contractually required payments 
it addresses the accounting for differences between the contractual cash flows of acquired loans and the cash flows expected to be collected from an investor s initial investment in loans acquired in a transfer if those differences are attributable  at least in part  to credit quality 
sop limits the yield that may be accreted as interest income on such loans to the excess of an investor s estimate of undiscounted expected principal  interest  and other cash flows from the loan over the investor s initial investment in the loan 
subsequent increases in estimated future cash flows to be collected would be recognized prospectively in interest income through a yield adjustment over the remaining life of the loan 
decreases in estimated future cash flows to be collected would be recognized as an impairment expense 
sop primarily applies prospectively to loans acquired in fiscal years beginning after december  we are in the process of evaluating the effect of sop while we have not completed our evaluation  we currently do not believe that the adoption of sop will have a material effect on fannie mae s results of operations
