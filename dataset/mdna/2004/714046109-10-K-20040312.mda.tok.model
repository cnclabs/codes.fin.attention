table of contents formation of our life and analytical sciences business unit we combined our life sciences and analytical instruments businesses to form our life and analytical sciences business in the fourth quarter of to improve our operational scale  which we believe will enable us to better serve our customers and more fully capitalize on the strengths of the combined businesses sales  service and research and development organizations 
in the second quarter of  we completed many of the changes involved in combining the two businesses  including the integration of facilities and management reporting and other systems 
we have now aggregated the two segments into one reporting segment for financial statement purposes  as discrete financial information is now only available on a combined basis 
for comparative purposes we have disclosed our life and analytical sciences business as one reporting segment for all periods presented 
in connection with the combination of our life sciences and analytical instruments business units  we recorded a million restructuring charge in the fourth quarter of as a result of workforce reductions  facility closures and contract terminations 
these actions occurred during with the exception of lease commitment payouts and other spending  which we expect to complete in we achieved in excess of the original range of to million in pre tax cost savings in fiscal from the combination of our life sciences and analytical instruments businesses relative to our fiscal cost levels 
we are targeting additional pre tax cost savings  from the combination  of between million and million in fiscal for combined pre tax cost savings of between million and million relative to our fiscal cost levels 
unforeseen factors may offset some or all of the estimated cost savings or other benefits from the integration 
as a result  our actual cost savings  if any  could differ or be delayed  compared to our estimates 
consolidated results of continuing operations sales compared to sales for were  million  versus  million during  an increase of million  or 
changes in foreign exchange rates  primarily the euro  increased sales by approximately million in  as compared to this increase in sales reflects a million  or  increase in our life and analytical sciences segment sales  which grew from million in to  in  and includes approximately million in sales attributable to favorable changes in foreign exchange rates compared to our optoelectronics segment sales grew million  or  from million in to million in  including approximately million in sales attributable to favorable changes in foreign exchange rates compared to the increased sales in our life and analytical sciences and optoelectronics segments were offset by a decrease in sales of million  or  in our fluid sciences segment  which declined from million in to million in compared to sales for were  million  versus  million during  a decrease of million  or 
changes in foreign exchange rates  primarily the euro  increased sales by approximately million in  as compared to this decrease in sales reflects a million  or  decrease in our optoelectronics segment sales  which declined from million in to million in the decrease in optoelectronics sales in was primarily due to the absence of sales from our specialty lighting businesses and other discontinued product lines which we divested in that had accounted for million in sales for our fluid sciences segment sales declined by million  or  from million in to million in the decrease in sales in our optoelectronics and fluid sciences segments were offset in part by an increase in sales of million  or  in our life and analytical sciences segment  which grew from million in to million in this increase includes approximately million in sales attributable to favorable changes in foreign exchange rates compared to also contributing to the increased sales in our life and analytical sciences segment were sales from a full year of packard  which we acquired in november in  we included only two months  or million  of sales from packard in our results of operations 
the increase in sales for in our life and analytical sciences segment  was offset in part by our divestiture in the fourth quarter of of our instruments for research and applied science business  which contributed million in sales in 
table of contents cost of sales compared to cost of sales for was million  versus million for  an increase of million  or 
as a percentage of sales  cost of sales decreased to in from in  resulting in an increase in gross margin of basis points from in to in the basis point increase in gross margin was primarily attributable to a million inventory adjustment charge recorded within our optoelectronics segment 
we did not record a similar charge in apart from this adjustment  the gross margin percentages for the life and analytical sciences  optoelectronics and fluid sciences reporting segments were substantially unchanged in  as compared to compared to cost of sales for was million  versus million for  an increase of million  or

research and development expenses compared to research and development expenses for were million versus million in  a decrease of million  or 
as a percentage of sales  research and development expenses decreased to in from in  primarily due to the consolidation of research and development activities to take advantage of increased synergies and corresponding cost savings as a result of fewer sites 
we directed research and development efforts during and primarily toward genetic screening and biopharmaceutical end markets within our life and analytical sciences reporting segment and medical digital imaging and industrial sensors within our optoelectronics reporting segment 
we expect our research and development efforts to continue to emphasize the health sciences end markets 
we expect our research and development spending for fiscal to remain substantially similar to our historical levels in fiscal and compared to research and development expenses for were million versus million in  an increase of million or 
as a percentage of sales  research and development expenses increased to in from in  principally as a result of the inclusion of spending associated with the packard operations 
we directed research and development efforts during and primarily toward drug discovery tools and genetic screening applications as well as biopharmaceutical end markets within our life and analytical sciences reporting segment and biomedical end markets within our optoelectronics reporting segment 
selling  general and administrative expenses compared to selling  general and administrative expenses for were million  versus million for  a decrease of million  or

restructuring reversals charges  net compared to restructuring reversals charges  net for was a reversal of million  the combination of our changes in estimate of million and our charges of million  versus a charge of million during the following table summarizes our restructuring accrual balances and related activity by restructuring plan during  and amounts amounts amounts balance at paid and changes in balance at paid and changes in balance at paid and changes in balance at incurred estimates charges incurred estimates charges incurred estimates charges in thousands pre plans q plan q plan q plan q plan total q plan during  we incurred a million restructuring charge in our life and analytical sciences and optoelectronics segments  which we refer to as our q plan 
the purpose of the restructuring was to further improve performance and take advantage of synergies between our former life sciences and analytical instruments businesses which we began integrating in the fourth quarter of the principal actions in this restructuring plan included lower headcount due to the continued integration of life and analytical sciences business in a european manufacturing and customer care center as well as headcount reduction at one of the optoelectronics manufacturing facilities to reflect recent declining demand for several product lines 
we planned to reduce headcount by we recorded restructuring charges by segment for as follows life and in millions analytical sciences optoelectronics total q plan this restructuring charge was primarily recorded in the second quarter of however  we recorded additional charges of million and million in the third and fourth quarters of  as required by sfas  as some employees who were notified of their employment termination in the second quarter were required to work for a period of time prior to receiving their severance 
in addition  in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a pre tax restructuring reversal of million due to fewer employee terminations as a result of higher attrition rates in several countries prior to ultimate termination and  accordingly  lower severance costs 
we completed all actions under the q plan by december   with the exception of nine headcount reductions that we expect to complete by the second quarter of q plan in connection with our decision to combine our life sciences and analytical instruments businesses in order to reduce costs and achieve operational efficiencies  we recorded a pre tax restructuring charge of million during the fourth quarter of  which we refer to as our q plan 
the q plan allowed us to combine many business functions worldwide  with the intention to better serve our customers and more fully capitalize on the strengths of the businesses sales  service and research and development organizations 
the principal actions in the q plan included planned workforce reductions of people  closure of approximately facilities and disposal of underutilized assets 

table of contents the q plan resulted in the integration of our united states life and analytical sciences sales  service and customer care centers  the integration of european customer care and finance centers  the merging of a former life sciences european manufacturing facility with a former analytical instruments european manufacturing facility  and the merging of a portion of a former life sciences research and development facility in europe with a former analytical instruments facility in europe 
during  we expended million to execute these actions 
in addition  we recorded a reversal of million in the q plan due to both higher than expected employee attrition rates in several countries prior to ultimate termination and lower severance costs for actual terminations 
the remaining liability associated with the q plan represents severance related to employees and lease commitments 
we expect to settle the remaining severance liability by the second quarter of the lease commitments on unoccupied buildings extend until q plan during the first quarter of  our management developed a plan to restructure several businesses 
we refer to these activities as our q plan 
the plan resulted in pre tax restructuring charges totaling million 
the principal actions in the q plan included planned workforce and overhead reductions resulting from reorganization activities  including the closure of a manufacturing facility  disposal of underutilized assets and general cost reductions 
q plan charges in our life and analytical sciences segment totaled million 
these charges comprised million in severance costs  million in asset impairments and 
million in lease commitments 
the charges were a result of actions we took as a response to decreased sales of components in our life and analytical sciences business 
these actions under the charges primarily included the downsizing of an additional manufacturing location and streamlining of the global sales and research and development organizations  primarily in europe  japan and the pacific rim 
we took these actions to reduce the number of employees in components of our business that had experienced declining demand 
q plan charges in our optoelectronics segment totaled million  comprising million in severance costs and million in asset write offs 
this charge was primarily due to the removal of a layer of management structure within our optoelectronics reporting segment which led to a flatter and less expensive organization structure 
total headcount was reduced by during  we recorded a restructuring reversal of million in the q plan primarily due to lower than expected employee separation costs associated with our optoelectronics segment 
the remaining million represented lease commitments on a closed facility and will be paid in the first quarter of q plan during the fourth quarter of  in connection with the integration of packard and a restructuring of our sales offices in europe  we recorded a restructuring charge of million in our life and analytical sciences segment 
we refer to these activities as our q plan 
the principal actions in the q plan included the closing or consolidation of several leased sales and services offices in europe  as well as costs associated with the closure of a manufacturing facility in europe  the closure of leased manufacturing facilities in the united states and the disposal of related assets 
these actions were designed to streamline the organization and take advantage of the synergies offered by the packard acquisition as they relate to the legacy life and analytical science segment 
we terminated a total of employees 
in  we recorded an additional pre tax restructuring charge associated with the q plan of million 
this charge was primarily due to additional severance and severance related benefits of the previously identified employees associated with the closure of our european manufacturing facility in the life and analytical sciences segment  and will be paid in 
table of contents in process research and development expenses in process research and development expenses for were million and consisted primarily of in process research and development expenses related specifically to projects we acquired in our acquisition of packard within our life and analytical sciences reporting segment 
we determined the value of these projects based on discounted probable future cash flows on a project by project basis 
we prepared revenue and expense projections as well as technology assumptions through we discounted the projected cash flows using discount rates specific to each project derived from a cost of capital adjusted upward for the stage of completion 
these adjusted discount rates ranged between based upon the remaining effort and risk of completion 
the efforts required to develop the in process technologies into commercially viable products principally relate to the completion of all planning  designing  prototyping  verification and testing activities that were necessary to establish that the products could be designed to meet their design specifications  including function  features and technical performance requirements 
failure to complete any of these projects has not had a material adverse impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
we classified packard acquisition projects for which the charge is associated as follows liquid handling and sample preparation packard s liquid handling and sample preparation products enable users to automatically manage liquid handling processes for drug discovery and research applications using robotic devices for sample preparation and dispensing of liquids 
approximately million of the in process research and development charge related to liquid handling and sample preparation projects  with individual projects ranging from million to million in value and to complete 
the majority of the liquid handling and sample preparation research and development projects included in this charge were completed at december  biochip systems packard s biochip systems included instruments and software used in the production  detection and analysis of simultaneous gene and protein assays in microarray or biochip formats  both of which are chips containing dense grids of genes or proteins 
approximately million of the in process research and development charge related to biochip system projects  with individual projects ranging from million to million in value and to complete 
all of the biochip systems research and development projects included in this charge were completed at december  microplate readers and plate imaging systems packard s microplate readers and plate imaging systems are used in life science laboratories for the high throughput analysis of samples in an effort to measure biological interactions

approximately million of the in process research and development charge related to drug discovery reagent projects  with individual projects ranging from million to million in value and to complete 
all of the drug discovery reagents research and development projects included in this charge were completed at december  gains on dispositions compared to dispositions resulted in a net gain of million in versus a net gain of million in gains on dispositions in included million from sales of facilities and million from post closing adjustments relating to the resolution of contingencies related to the sale of our instruments for research and applied sciences business  which we refer to as iras 
gains on dispositions in included million from the sale of facilities and million from post closing entries relating to our sale of our iras business  which was formerly part of our life and analytical sciences segment 

table of contents compared to dispositions resulted in a net gain of million in versus a net gain of million in gains on dispositions in included million from sales of facilities and million from post closing adjustments relating to the sale of our iras business 
gains on dispositions in included million from the sale of our iras business and million from dispositions within our optoelectronics and life and analytical sciences reporting segments  offset in part by a million loss on the sale of our voltarc technologies business  formerly part of our optoelectronics reporting segment 
amortization of intangible assets compared to amortization of intangible assets was million for both and slight increases in the life and analytical sciences segment amortization due to the effect of foreign exchange offset by slight decreases in amortization in the optoelectronics and fluid sciences segments in compared to compared to amortization of intangible assets for was million versus million for  a decrease of million or 
the amortization expense included million related to the amortization of goodwill 
we discontinued the amortization of goodwill upon adoption of sfas no 
at the beginning of the year over year increase in intangible asset amortization was the result of the amortization on intangible assets other than goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets that arose from the acquisition of packard 
interest and other expense  net interest and other expense  net consisted of the following in thousands interest income interest expense losses gains on sale of investments  net extinguishment of debt other compared to interest and other expense  net for was million versus million for  an increase of million or 
the increase in interest and other expense  net in as compared to  was due primarily to higher average borrowing rates resulting from our december financing 
a more complete discussion of our liquidity and our prospective costs to borrow can be seen under the heading liquidity and capital resources 
the remaining increase in interest and other expense  net of million was due primarily to our increased acceleration of the amortization of debt issuance costs of million resulting from partial prepayments of our term debt during versus million in and million of transaction costs we incurred in the fourth quarter of in connection with amending our credit facility to reduce the interest rate margin applicable to our term loan 
in january  million of our outstanding fixed rate debt was swapped to a floating rate with swap instruments that reset semi annually in arrears based on six month usd libor 
we expect interest expense in to decrease due to lower outstanding debt balances  lower interest rate margin on our term loan due to the amendment of our credit facility in the fourth quarter of and the expected benefit derived from our january swap instruments identified above 
compared to interest and other expense  net for was million versus million for  an increase of million or 
the increase in interest and other expense  net in  as compared to  was due primarily to losses on sales of investments in  as compared to gains in of million 
this increase was offset in part by a decline in interest expense to million in from million in resulting from decreased levels of indebtedness and lower associated interest rates 
the 
table of contents million in debt extinguishment in is comprised of million in fees and previously capitalized issuance costs written off in connection with our december debt refinancing transactions  a million call premium paid in the first quarter of upon our extinguishment of the debt we assumed in our acquisition of packard  and an offsetting million gain realized on our repurchase of a portion of our zero coupon convertible debentures 
provision benefit for income taxes compared to the provision for income taxes was million  versus a benefit of million in our effective tax rate is primarily attributable to geographic income patterns 
our effective tax rate was as compared to our effective tax rate of 
the change in our effective tax rate was primarily due to a relatively high ratio of permanent tax differences to income loss from continuing operations before income taxes 
compared to the benefit for income taxes for was million  versus a provision of million during as mentioned above  our effective tax rate is primarily attributable to geographic income patterns 
our effective tax rate was as compared to our effective tax rate of 
the change in our effective tax rate was primarily due to reduced profitability in and in process research and development charges associated with our packard acquisition  which were not deductible for tax purposes 
discontinued operations we recorded the following gains and losses  which we report as the loss on dispositions of discontinued operations  during the years ended december  and december  in thousands loss gain on the sale of the security and detection systems business gain on the resolution of contingencies associated with the technical services business loss on entertainment lighting business loss on telecommunications components business net loss on disposition of discontinued operations before income taxes provision for income taxes loss on disposition of discontinued operations  net of income taxes during  we settled various claims under certain long term contracts and transition services with our technical services business  which we sold in august the net settlement and the reversal of certain previously established contingencies resulted in a pre tax gain of million that we recognized in and included in gain loss on dispositions of discontinued operations 
in june  we completed the sale of our security and detection systems business for cash consideration of approximately million and a net working capital adjustment  the amount of which has yet to be finalized 
we recorded a net pre tax gain of approximately million pursuant to this transaction in as a gain on the disposition of a discontinued operation 
we accounted for our security and detection systems business as a discontinued operation in accordance with apb no 
 and accordingly  the results of operations and related cash flows of this business through the disposal date have been segregated from continuing operations and reported as a separate line on our consolidated income statements 
we present the resulting gain from the sale as a component of net income within dispositions of discontinued operations  net of income tax on our consolidated income statement 
adjustments relating to this sale resulted in a pre tax loss from discontinued operations of million in  primarily due to revised estimates of the working capital adjustment 

table of contents also in june  our board of directors approved a plan to shut down our telecommunications components business and a plan to sell our entertainment lighting business as part of our continued efforts to focus on higher growth opportunities 
we have reflected both businesses as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements 
as of june   we had exited our entertainment lighting business completing the sale of a substantial portion of that business for cash consideration of million and abandoned the remaining assets 
sales and losses from discontinued operations for until that time were million and million respectively 
as of june   we had shut down our telecommunications components business 
effect of accounting change as required by sfas  we completed the transitional impairment analysis of our recorded goodwill as of january  in connection with the adoption of this standard  we reviewed our forecasts and projections of all of our reporting units and determined that  based on decreased demand for certain specialty lamps resulting from a downturn in the printed circuit board production worldwide and other smaller markets  the fair value of the lighting reporting unit was less than its carrying value 
with the assistance of valuation specialists and using a discounted cash flow model  we determined that the carrying value of the recorded goodwill was in excess of the fair value of that goodwill 
as a result  we recorded an impairment charge totaling million as a cumulative effect of an accounting change 
the entire transition adjustment related to our lighting reporting unit within our optoelectronics reporting segment 
in addition  as part of our ongoing compliance with sfas no 
 we completed our annual assessment of goodwill using a measurement date of january  this annual assessment did not result in an impairment charge 
acquisitions and divestitures significant acquisitions in november  we completed our acquisition of packard for a purchase price of approximately million  in exchange for approximately million shares of our common stock and our assumption of approximately million in debt that we subsequently redeemed in march the acquisition extended our capabilities in automated liquid handling and sample preparation and strengthened our position as a global provider of comprehensive drug discovery tools and solutions 
in connection with the packard acquisition  we initially recorded approximately million for integration charges 
the packard integration plans included initiatives to integrate the operations of packard  and principally comprise amounts related to employee separation costs for approximately individuals  the termination of leases and other contractual obligations and asset write offs in connection with these actions 
in the fourth quarter of  we finalized our estimates of severance costs and determined that our initial estimates were too high  principally due to actual severance costs per employee being lower than planned 
as a result  we reversed million of severance costs in the integration accrual in the fourth quarter of with the offsetting amount recorded to goodwill 
we also reversed million related to the termination of leases and other contractual obligations in the fourth quarter of with the offsetting amount recorded to goodwill due to changes in our estimate of our lease obligations 
the total reversal in the fourth quarter of was million 
therefore  the net integration charge related to our purchase of packard totaled million 
the integration activities were completed in early with the exception of million in remaining payments due on leased facilities exited in that will be paid through these integration activities are linked to the q plan and are disclosed in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k

we accrue for environmental issues in the accounting period that our responsibility is established and when the cost can be reasonably estimated 
we have accrued million as of december   representing our management s estimate of the total cost of ultimate disposition of known environmental matters 
this amount is not discounted and does not reflect any recovery of any amounts through insurance or indemnification arrangements 
these cost estimates are subject to a number of variables  including the stage of the environmental investigations  the magnitude of the possible contamination  the nature of the potential remedies  possible joint and several liability  the timeframe over which remediation may occur and the possible effects of changing laws and regulations 
for sites where we have been named a potentially responsible party  our management does not currently anticipate any additional liability to result from the inability of other significant named parties to contribute 
we expect that such accrued amounts could be paid out over a period of up to ten years 
as assessment and remediation activities progress at each individual site  these liabilities are reviewed and adjusted to reflect additional information as it becomes available 
there have been no environmental problems to date that have had or are expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 
while it is possible that a material loss exceeding the amounts recorded may be incurred  we do not expect the potential exposure to be materially different from the amounts we recorded 
we and certain of our officers have been named as defendants in a class action lawsuit in which the plaintiffs have alleged various statements made by us were misleading with respect to our prospects and future operating results 
we believe we have meritorious defenses to the lawsuits and we intend to contest the actions vigorously 
we are currently unable  however  to reasonably estimate the amount of the loss  if any  that may result from the resolution of these matters 
we have received a notice from the internal revenue service asserting federal income tax deficiencies for and we are challenging many of the proposed adjustments 
we believe that the ultimate outcome of the notices will not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position 
reporting segment results of continuing operations life and analytical sciences compared to sales for were  million  versus million in  an increase of million  or 
changes in foreign exchange rates  primarily the euro  increased sales by approximately million in  as compared to the favorable effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations was offset in part by reduced unit sales volume 
the following analysis compares selected sales by 
table of contents market and product type for  as compared to  and includes the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
sales to environmental and chemical analysis customers increased million  sales to genetic screening customers increased million and our onesource tm laboratory service sales increased by million 
these increases were offset by a million decrease in sales to biopharmaceutical customers  primarily in sales of liquid handling instruments and radiochemical reagents  as general biopharmaceutical market demand remained weak throughout sales by type of product included increases in sales of consumables of million  and service of million  partially offset by decreases in sales of instruments of million 
operating profit for was million  versus million in  an increase of million 
the increase in as compared to  was primarily the result of approximately million of overall cost savings in associated with restructuring and integration activities  mainly due to a reduction in the number of employees and the elimination of excess facilities 
the increase in operating profit in  as compared to  was also due to approximately million of net restructuring charges included in our results for  compared to a net restructuring credit of million in amortization of intangibles was million for the year ended december   versus million for the year ended december  compared to sales for were million  versus million in  an increase of million  or 
the increase in sales in  as compared to  was primarily because our results for included a full year of results from packard  which we acquired in november  and our results for included only two months  or million  of results from packard 
sales by packard for the first ten months of prior to acquisition were approximately million 
partially offsetting the effects in of including the results of packard was the absence of results in from our iras business  which we divested in the fourth quarter of sales from that business were million in changes in foreign exchange rates  primarily the euro  increased sales by approximately million in compared to the following analysis compares selected sales by market and product type for  as compared to  and includes the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
sales to biopharmaceutical customers increased million  due to the full year impact of the packard acquisition  service sales increased by million  and sales to genetic screening customers increased million 
these increases were offset in part by a million decrease in sales to environmental and chemical analysis customers and our iras divestiture 
sales by type of product included increases in sales of consumables of million  service of million and instruments of million  all partially offset by the absence of sales from our divested iras business 
sales of our iras business in were million 
operating profit for was million  versus million in  a decrease of million  or 
items contributing to this decrease in operating profit included restructuring charges in which were million  versus million in and gains from dispositions of businesses which were only million in  versus million in increases in operating profit year over year included charges primarily related to the integration and reorganization of packard  which decreased from million in to million in operating profit for also included a million charge associated with acquired in process research and development associated with our acquisition of packard 
the favorable impact on operating profit in from additional sales volume was more than offset by the inclusion of additional costs related to packard for the full year 
goodwill and intangible asset amortization expenses were million for and million for optoelectronics compared to sales for were million  versus million for  an increase of million  or 
changes in foreign exchange rates increased sales by approximately million  or 
the following analysis compares selected sales by product line for  as compared to  and includes the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates 
sales of specialty lighting products increased by million due to growth in sales of flash products and sales of digital imaging products increased by million due to increased sales of diagnostic and radiotherapy digital x ray detector products 
these 
table of contents increases were offset in part by sales decreases totaling million in our sensors  lithography  and fiber optic test product lines due to limited demand in these end markets 
operating profit for was million  versus an operating loss of million for  an increase of million 
the operating loss for includes a charge of million for an inventory write down which was not repeated in included a net restructuring reversal of million compared to a net restructuring charge of million in increased sales and productivity improvements  including improved manufacturing performance and reduced operating expenses  and a headcount reduction of more than  contributed a total of approximately million in additional operating profit in compared to amortization of intangible assets was million for and million for compared to sales for were million  versus million for  a decrease of million  or 
the decrease in sales in was primarily due to the absence of sales from divested specialty lighting businesses and product lines which accounted for million in sales for changes in foreign exchange rates increased sales by approximately million  or 
the following analysis compares selected sales by product line for  as compared to  and includes the effects of changes in foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
sales of digital imaging products increased by million due primarily to increased sales of digital x ray detector products 
sales of sensor products decreased by million and sales within our fiber optic test and lithography businesses decreased million as a result of weak market demand 
sales decreased by million in our specialty lighting products business  mainly due to the previously referenced divested businesses and product lines 
operating loss for was million  versus an operating profit of million for  a decrease of million 
the decrease in operating profit was primarily the result of lower sales  the inclusion in of an inventory write down of million and a restructuring charge of million 
goodwill and intangible asset amortization was million for and million for fluid sciences compared to sales for were million  versus million for  a decrease of million  or 
changes in foreign exchange rates increased sales by approximately million  or 
the following analysis compares selected sales by product line for  as compared to  and includes the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates 
sales declines of million in our semiconductor products due to declining demand  and million in our energy technology products  were the most significant contributors to the reduction in sales in compared to in addition  sales to our aerospace and fluid testing customers declined modestly by million and million  respectively  in two difficult markets 
operating profit for was million  versus million for  an increase of million  or 
the increase in operating profit resulted primarily from shifting production to lower cost locations in asia  cost controls  cost reduction actions and other productivity improvements resulting from six sigma and lean manufacturing initiatives that more than offset an operating profit decrease due to reduced sales 
amortization of intangible assets was million for and million for compared to sales for were million  versus million for  a decrease of million  or 
the decrease in sales in  as compared to  was primarily attributable to a reduction in sales of million in aerospace products where market conditions deteriorated in the wake of the events of september sales decreases of million in the fluid testing business and million in the semiconductor business also contributed to the sales decline in compared to these decreases were offset by a million increase in our energy technology business in  as compared to operating profit for was million  versus million for  a decrease of million  or 
the decrease in operating profit in  as compared to  was due primarily to the sales decline discussed above and associated underutilization of capacity  as well as the cost of relocating manufacturing facilities to lower cost locations 
the operating profit included million in gains from the sale of two businesses during the first half of goodwill and intangible asset amortization expenses were million for and million for 
table of contents liquidity and capital resources we require cash to pay our operating expenses  make capital expenditures  service our debt and other long term liabilities and pay dividends on our common stock 
our principal sources of funds are from our operations and the capital markets  particularly the debt markets 
in the next twelve months  we anticipate that our operations will generate sufficient cash to fund our operating expenses  capital expenditures  interest payments on our debt and dividends on our common stock 
beyond the next twelve months  we expect to use internally generated funds and external sources to satisfy our debt and other long term liabilities 
principal factors that could affect the availability of our internally generated funds include deterioration of sales due to weakness in markets in which we sell our products and services  changes in our working capital requirements  and our ability to successfully repatriate cash balances from our foreign subsidiaries for use in settling domestic obligations 
principal factors that could affect our ability to obtain cash from external sources include financial covenants contained in our borrowings that limit our total borrowing capacity  increases in interest rates applicable to our outstanding variable rate debt  a ratings downgrade that would limit our ability to borrow under our accounts receivable facility and our overall access to the corporate debt market  volatility in the markets for corporate debt  a decrease in the market price for our common stock  and volatility in the public equity markets 
cash flows fiscal year operating activities 
net cash generated by continuing operations was million in contributing to the generation of cash from operating activities during was net income from continuing operations of million and a decrease in working capital accounts of million 
contributing to the decrease in working capital in were reductions in accounts receivable of million and inventory of million 
in general  accounts receivable and inventory levels declined due to our focus on customer payment terms as well as enhanced inventory management 
accounts receivable also decreased as a result of increased use of our accounts receivable securitization facility  which increased million  from million at december  to million at december  cash outlays for accrued expenses  restructuring and other assets and liabilities totaled million during  primarily as a result of payments toward restructuring plans and other obligations 
we expect our restructuring expenditures to be reduced in investing activities 
in  we withdrew million of cash held in escrow to retire substantially all of our remaining outstanding indebtedness under our zero coupon convertible debentures 
in  we made capital expenditures of million mainly in the areas of tooling and productivity improvements along with system and facility costs related to integration activities 
net proceeds from the dispositions of businesses and fixed assets during were million 
we derived million of these proceeds from the sale of a building made redundant due to integration activities 
in  we expect to incur approximately million in capital expenditures 
financing activities 
in  we used million of net cash for financing activities 
we expended million of cash withdrawn from our designated escrow account along with approximately million of available cash to redeem our outstanding zero coupon convertible debentures 
debt reductions during also included million of cash used to repay a portion of our term loan 
in december  we amended our credit facility to  among other things  reduce the interest rate applicable to our term loan 
we paid 
table of contents million in transaction fees during in connection with that amendment 
we also paid million in dividends and received net cash proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options of million in fiscal year operating activities 
net cash generated by continuing operations was million in contributing to the generation of cash from operating activities during was a decrease in working capital of million 
the working capital decrease during reflects improved working capital management as well as a million inventory adjustment within our optoelectronics reporting segment  offset in part by a net decrease of million in proceeds from our receivable securitization program 
we decreased inventory levels by million during  including a million optoelectronics inventory adjustment  on lower sales volume 
cash outlays for accrued expenses  restructuring and other assets and liabilities totaled million during  primarily as a result of payments toward restructuring plans and the settlement of payroll  professional fees  hedging and other obligations 
investing activities 
in  our investing activities used million of cash  including placing million of cash in escrow  for the purpose of retiring some of our outstanding indebtedness under our zero coupon convertible debentures 
we made capital expenditures of million mainly in the areas of tooling and process improvement for our drug discovery tools business and other products for biopharmaceutical applications 
we also expended million in the settlement of a lease obligation on our fremont  california facility resulting in our purchase of this facility 
net proceeds from the dispositions of businesses and fixed assets during of million were primarily from approximately million in net proceeds received from the sale of our security and detection systems business during the second quarter of and approximately million associated with the sale of facilities 
cash outflows of million associated with acquisitions related primarily to the settlement of liabilities incurred in connection with the packard acquisition 
financing activities 
in  we generated million of net cash from financing activities 
our gross debt levels increased by million to million at december  included in this amount was million of our outstanding indebtedness under the zero coupon convertible debentures which were not tendered by holders as part of our refinancing transactions for which we had million of cash held in escrow at december  for the purpose of retiring the untendered indebtedness 
reductions in debt included million of notes due in and million of zero coupon convertible debentures  both of which we repurchased as part of our debt refinancing transactions 
debt reductions in also included million of senior subordinated ten year notes issued by packard in march  which we repurchased at a rate of  and million in other credit facilities we paid down during offsetting these reductions was our december issuance of senior subordinated notes which generated proceeds of million and our establishment of a term loan which generated proceeds of million 
in connection with these debt issuances and terminations  we paid million in fees during we also paid million in dividends and received net cash proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options of million in borrowing arrangements senior secured credit facility 
in december  we entered into a senior credit facility 
this facility is comprised of a six year term loan in the amount of million and a million five year revolving credit facility 
in  we made million of principal payments on the term loan 
accordingly  at december  we had million outstanding under our term loan with no outstanding principal balance under our revolving credit facility at december  or at any other time during the year 
this credit facility is secured primarily by a portion of our subsidiaries domestic assets 
in april  we amended our senior credit facility to allow for the sale of our entertainment lighting business under the final negotiated terms of that sale and to ensure conformity between the credit agreement governing the facility and the financial covenants negotiated with the lead arranger  merrill lynch 
the amendment corrected a drafting error in the definition of consolidated interest expense 
under the initial 
table of contents agreement  consolidated interest expense was erroneously defined as being calculated using pro forma  annualized interest expense beginning in the first quarter of compared to the intended calculation using a rolling quarter methodology as originally agreed 
the definition of consolidated interest expense under the amended agreement was changed to properly state the calculation as a rolling four quarter methodology 
in december  we amended our senior credit facility to reduce the margin paid on the term loan as well as to amend several restrictive covenants 
interest rates under the senior credit facility applicable to the term loan and to the revolving credit facility are determined as a margin over either the eurodollar rate or the base rate 
the base rate is the higher of the corporate base rate announced from time to time by bank of america  na and the federal funds rate plus basis points 
the applicable margin for the term loan was amended to basis points for the eurodollar rate  from the original basis points  and to basis points for the base rate  from the original basis points 
the applicable margins for the term loan and the revolving credit facility vary based upon our leverage ratio at the end of the prior quarter 
we may allocate all or a portion of our indebtedness under the senior credit facility to interest based upon the margin over the eurodollar rate or the base rate 
at december   the eurodollar rate was approximately basis points and the base rate was basis points resulting in an eurodollar interest rate on the senior credit facility of basis points 
the term loan is repayable in mandatory nominal quarterly installments of million of the outstanding balance until december  and thereafter in four equal quarterly installments of of the then outstanding balance until december additionally  annual payments of of excess cash flow as defined in the credit agreement are payable six months following the end of each fiscal year 
in  we made million in principal payments on the term loan 
the revolving credit facility is available to us through december for our working capital needs 
at no point in fiscal  did we have any outstanding principal balance under the revolving credit facility 
our senior credit facility contains covenants that require us to maintain specific financial ratios  including a minimum interest coverage ratio  a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio  a maximum senior leverage ratio  and a maximum total leverage ratio 
as of december   and at all other times during fiscal  we were in compliance with all applicable covenants 
notes 
in december  we issued and sold ten year senior subordinated notes at a rate of with a face value of million 
we received million in gross proceeds from the issuance 
we recorded deferred issuance costs of million as a non current asset 
the debt  which matures in january  is unsecured but is guaranteed by substantially all of our domestic subsidiaries 
interest on our notes is payable semi annually on january and july interest payments began on july  in january  we swapped the fixed rate on million of these notes to a floating rate using swap instruments which reset semi annually in arrears based upon six month usd libor 
if a change of control occurs  each holder of notes may require us to repurchase some or all of its notes at a purchase price equal to of the principal amount of the notes  plus accrued interest 
before january   we may redeem up to of the aggregate principal amount of our notes with the net proceeds of specified public equity offerings at of the principal amount of the notes  plus accrued interest  if at least of the aggregate principal amount of the notes remains outstanding after the redemption 
we may redeem some or all of our notes at any time on or after january   at a redemption price of 
the redemption price decreases to on january   to on january  and to on january  the debt is subordinated to our senior credit facility 
our notes contain financial and other covenants 
most of these covenants terminate if the notes obtain an investment grade rating by 
table of contents standard poor s rating services and moody s investors service 
at december   and at all times during fiscal  we were in compliance with all applicable covenants 
zero coupon convertible debentures 
through the first quarter of  we repurchased million in accreted amount of our zero coupon convertible debentures due in open market purchases and through a december tender offer 
we redeemed the remaining million of accreted value of zero coupon debentures on august  in accordance with their terms 
we used approximately million held in escrow pursuant to the terms of our senior secured credit facility along with available cash of approximately million  to redeem the zero coupon convertible debentures 
as of december  the zero coupon convertible debentures have been fully retired 
notes 
in december  we initiated a tender offer for all of our outstanding notes 
we completed the tender offer and repurchased all but million of these notes as of december  we paid consent payments pursuant to a consent solicitation we made concurrently with the tender offer 
the consent solicitation eliminated substantially all of the restrictive covenants contained in the indenture governing our notes as of december  we may from time to time repurchase outstanding notes through open market purchases  privately negotiated transactions or otherwise 
these notes are due to be paid in off balance sheet arrangements receivables securitization facility in december  we established a wholly owned consolidated subsidiary to purchase  on a revolving basis  certain of our accounts receivable balances and simultaneously sell an undivided interest in this pool of receivables to a financial institution 
in september  we amended the facility to increase total funding capacity from million to million to expand our sources of liquidity 
amounts funded under this facility were million at december  and million at december  as of december   we had approximately million of undrawn capacity available under the facility 
the facility had an effective interest rate of approximately libor plus basis points as of december  the facility includes conditions that require us to maintain a senior unsecured credit rating of bb or above  as defined by standard poor s rating services  and ba or above  as defined by moody s investors service 
at december   we had a senior unsecured credit rating of bb with a stable outlook from standard poor s rating services  and of ba with a stable outlook from moody s investors service 
in january  we entered into an agreement to extend the term of our accounts receivable securitization facility to january  as well as reduce the underlying cost of the facility 
cost reductions in the new agreement would result in an effective interest rate of approximately libor plus basis points based on the drawn balance of million as of december  we expect to renew this facility again in january as it currently provides us a vehicle to accelerate the cash collection of customer receivables 
dividends our board of directors declared regular quarterly cash dividends of seven cents per share in each quarter of and  resulting in an annual dividend rate of cents per share 
our senior credit facility and the indenture governing our outstanding senior subordinated notes contain restrictions that may limit our ability to pay our regular quarterly cash dividend in the future 

table of contents contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december  sr 
operating unsecured subordinated other revolving leases notes due term note notes due debt facilities total in thousands and beyond total during  we expect to make capital expenditures of approximately million primarily to introduce new products  to improve operating processes  to shift the production capacity to lower cost locations and to reflect investments in information technology 
we expect to use our available cash and internally generated funds to fund these expenditures 
new accounting pronouncements in january and december  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
and no 
 revised fin r  consolidation of variable interest entities 
these statements  which address accounting for entities commonly known as special purpose or off balance sheet entities  require consolidation of certain interests or arrangements by virtue of holding a controlling financial interest in such entities 
certain provisions of fin r related to interests in special purpose entities were applicable for the period ended december  we must apply fin r to our interests in all entities subject to the interpretation as of the first interim or annual period ending after march  we have considered the application of fin and finr to our investments  receivables securitization program and other business relationships and concluded that the adoption of this new method of accounting for variable interest entities did not and is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial position 
application of critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  sales and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  income taxes  restructuring  pensions and other post retirement benefits  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we record product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
for products that include installation  if the installation meets the criteria to be considered a separate element  product revenue is recognized upon delivery  and recognition of installation revenue is delayed until the installation is complete 
for sales that include customer specified acceptance criteria  revenue is recognized only after the acceptance criteria have been met 
revenue from services is deferred and recognized over the 
table of contents contractual period or as services are rendered and accepted by the customer 
when arrangements include multiple elements  we use objective evidence of fair value to allocate revenue to the elements and recognize revenue when the criteria for revenue recognition have been met for each element  all in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
because the majority of our sales relate to specific manufactured products or units rather than long term customized projects  we generally do not experience significant changes in original estimates 
further  we have not experienced any significant product returns or refunds or promotional allowances that require significant estimation 
allowances for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we generally compute our allowance for doubtful accounts by applying specific percentage reserves on accounts that are past due and deemed uncollectible  and specifically reserving for customers known to be in financial difficulty 
therefore  if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  we may have to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts 
this would reduce our earnings 
inventory valuation 
we initially value inventory at actual cost to purchase and or manufacture 
we periodically review these values to ascertain that market value of the inventory continues to exceed its recorded cost 
generally  reductions in value of inventory below cost are caused by our maintenance of stocks of products in excess of demand or technological obsolescence of the inventory 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and  when necessary  record provisions for excess and obsolete inventory based on either our estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements or historical trailing usage of the product 
if our sales do not materialize as planned or at historic levels  we may have to increase our reserve for excess and obsolete inventory 
this would reduce our earnings 
if actual market conditions are more favorable than anticipated  inventory previously written down may be sold  resulting in lower costs of sales and higher income from operations than expected in that period 
value of long lived assets  including intangibles 
we carry a variety of long lived assets on our balance sheet including property and equipment  investments  identifiable intangible assets and goodwill 
we periodically review the carrying value of all of these assets based  in part  upon current estimated market values and our projections of anticipated future cash flows 
we undertake this review on an annual basis for assets such as goodwill and non amortizing intangible assets and on a periodic basis for other long lived assets when facts and circumstances suggest that cash flows emanating from those assets may be diminished 
any impairment charge that we record reduces our earnings 
the initial assessment of goodwill recoverability under sfas no 
resulted in a million charge to our earnings 
this charge  relating to goodwill in our lighting reporting unit within our optoelectronics business segment  was caused by expected declines in profitability and cash flows as a result of softness in key end markets 
we completed the annual impairment tests of goodwill for and concluded that there was no impairment 
while we believe that our estimates of current value are reasonable  different assumptions regarding items such as future cash flows and the volatility inherent in markets which we serve could affect our evaluations and result in impairment charges against the carrying value of those assets 
in addition  we currently evaluate the remaining useful life of our intangible assets that are not being amortized at least annually to determine whether events or circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life 
if events or circumstances indicate that the useful life of nonamortizing intangible assets are no longer indefinite  the assets will be tested for impairment in accordance with sfas these intangible assets will then be amortized prospectively over their estimated remaining useful life and accounted for in the same manner as other intangible assets that are subject to amortization 
employee compensation and benefits 
retirement and post retirement benefit plans are a significant cost of doing business and represent obligations that will be ultimately settled far in the future and therefore are subject to estimation 
pension accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future benefit costs over the employee s approximate service period based on the terms of the plans and the investment and funding decisions made by us 
we are required to make assumptions regarding such variables as the expected long term rate of return on assets and the discount rate applied to determine service cost and interest cost to arrive at pension income or expense for the year 
as of december   we estimated the expected long term 
table of contents rate of return in the united states was percent  and ranged from to percent for our plans outside the united states 
we have analyzed the rates of return on assets used and determined that these rates are reasonable based on the plans historical performance relative to the overall markets in the countries where we invest the assets as well as our current expectations for long term rates of returns for our pension assets 
our management will continue to assess the expected long term rate of return on plan assets assumption for each plan based on relevant market conditions and will make adjustments to the assumptions as appropriate 
discount rate assumptions were based on the prevailing market long term interest rates at the measurement date 
if any of our assumptions were to change  our pension plan expenses would also change 
a one percent decrease in the estimated return on plan assets would increase pre tax pension expense by million for in the united states and by million for for all plans outside the united states 
retirement and post retirement benefit plan expense is allocated to cost of sales  research and development and selling  general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statement of operations 
we incurred expenses of million in  million in and million in for our retirement and post retirement plans 
we expect expenses of approximately million in for our retirement and post retirement plans 
we have reduced the volatility in our health care costs provided to our retirees by adopting a defined dollar plan feature 
under the defined dollar plan feature  our total annual liability for health care costs to any one retiree is limited to a fixed dollar amount  regardless of the nature or cost of the health care needs of that retiree 
our future liability therefore  cannot be impacted by future changes in the cost of health care 
restructuring activities 
our financial statements detail specific charges relating to restructuring activities as well as the actual spending that has occurred against the resulting accruals 
our restructuring charges are estimates based on our preliminary assessments of severance benefits to be granted to employees  based on known benefit formulas and identified job grades  costs to abandon certain facilities based on known lease costs of sub rental income  and asset impairments as discussed above under value of long lived assets  including intangibles 
because these accruals are estimates  they are subject to change as a result of deviations from initial restructuring plans or subsequent information that may come to our attention 
for example  actual severance costs may be less than anticipated if employees voluntarily leave prior to the time at which they would be entitled to severance or if anticipated legal hurdles in foreign jurisdictions prove to be less onerous than expected 
in addition  unanticipated successes or difficulties in terminating leases and other contractual obligations may lead to changes in estimates 
when such changes in estimates occur  they are reflected in our financial statements on the income statement line entitled restructuring charges  net 
gains or losses on dispositions 
when we record the disposition of an asset or discontinuance of an operation  we make an estimate relative to the amount we expect to realize on the sale or disposition 
this estimate is based on a variety of factors  including current interest in the market  alternative markets for the assets and other relevant factors 
if anticipated proceeds are less than the current carrying amount of the asset or operation  we record a loss 
if anticipated proceeds are greater than the current carrying amount of the asset or operation  we recognize a gain net of expected contingencies when the transaction has been consummated 
accordingly  we may realize amounts different than were first estimated 
during the year ended december   we recognized million in losses from the dispositions of divested businesses classified as discontinued operations and million in gains from the disposition of assets  comprised largely of excess facilities 
the million included additional losses from the final disposition of our telecommunications components and entertainment lighting businesses as well as working capital adjustments related to the sale of our security and detection business 
these losses were offset by gains from the resolution of contingencies associated with the divestiture of the technical services business 
any such changes decrease or increase current earnings and are recorded either against the gains on disposition or discontinued operations line items appearing in our income statement 
income taxes 
our business operations are global in nature  and we are subject to taxes in more than countries 
tax laws and tax rates vary substantially in these jurisdictions and are subject to change given the political and economic climate in those countries 
we report and pay income tax based on operational results and applicable law 
our tax provision contemplates tax rates in effect to determine both our current and deferred tax position 
any significant fluctuation in rates or changes in tax laws could cause our estimates of 
table of contents taxes we anticipate either paying or recovering in the future to change 
such changes could lead to either increases or decreases in our effective tax rate 
in addition  we have established valuation allowances against a variety of tax attributes  including net operation loss carryforwards  foreign tax credits and other credits 
valuation allowances take into consideration among other things  limitations imposed upon the use of the tax attributes and reduce the value of such items to the amount that is deemed to be recoverable 
improvements or other changes in our operations  domestically and internationally could increase our ability to utilize these tax attributes in the future 
the release of valuation allowances in periods when these tax attributes become realizable would reduce our effective tax rate 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks financial instruments financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of temporary cash investments  marketable securities and accounts receivable 
we believe we had no significant concentrations of credit risk as of december  in the ordinary course of business  we enter into foreign exchange contracts for periods consistent with our committed exposures to mitigate the effect of foreign currency movements on transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
transactions covered by hedge contracts include inter company and third party receivables and payables 
the contracts are primarily in european and asian currencies  have maturities that do not exceed months  have no cash requirements until maturity and are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet 
credit risk is minimal as the foreign exchange instruments are contracted with major banking institutions 
unrealized gains and losses on our foreign currency contracts are recognized immediately in earnings for hedges designated as fair value and  for hedges designated as cash flow  the related unrealized gains or losses are deferred as a component of other comprehensive income in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
deferred gains and losses are recognized in income in the period in which the underlying anticipated transaction occurs 
for the year ended december   we did not engage in hedges designated as cash flow 
the notional amount of the outstanding foreign currency contracts was approximately million at december  and million as of december   and the approximate fair value of these foreign currency derivative contracts designated as fair value hedges was insignificant 
the duration of the foreign currency derivative contracts is generally day for market risk market risk 
we are exposed to market risk  including changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates 
to manage the volatility relating to these exposures  we enter into various derivative transactions pursuant to our policies to hedge against known or forecasted market exposures 
foreign exchange risk 
as a multinational corporation  we are exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates 
these exposures can take a variety of different forms as our international sales grow  exposure to volatility in exchange rates could have a material impact on our financial results 
reported sales made in foreign currencies by our international subsidiaries  when translated into us dollars for financial reporting purposes  can fluctuate due to exchange rate movement 
while exchange rate fluctuations can impact reported revenues and earnings  this impact is purely a result of the translation effect and does not materially impact our short term cash flows 
in all parts of the world  our subsidiaries  on occasion  invoice third party customers in foreign currencies other than the one in which they primarily do business 
we refer to primary business currency as the functional currencies 
movements in the invoiced currency relative to the functional currency 
table of contents result in both realized and unrealized transaction gains or losses that directly impact our cash flows and our results of operations 
our manufacturing and distribution organization is worldwide 
accordingly  inventories may be manufactured in one location  stored in another  and distributed in a third location 
this results in a wide array of intercompany transactions transactions that are billed and paid in many different currencies 
our cash flows and our results of operations are therefore directly impacted by fluctuations in exchange rates of currencies involved 
the cash flow needs of each of our foreign subsidiaries vary through time 
accordingly  there may be times when a subsidiary lends to or borrows from either the parent company or another affiliate 
these advances  again being denominated in currencies other than a particular entity s functional currency  can expose it to fluctuations in exchange rates that can impact both our cash flows and results of operations 
in order to repay debt or satisfy operational needs  we may remit cash from our foreign locations to the united states 
when this occurs  we are liquidating foreign currency net asset positions and converting them into united states dollars 
our cash flows and our results of operations are therefore also impacted by these transactions 
we use foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage the risk of exchange rate fluctuations 
the derivative instruments held by us are not leveraged and are not held for trading purposes 
we specifically use forward contracts to hedge our foreign denominated assets and liabilities and use a combination of forward and option contracts to hedge anticipated cash flows 
our hedging activity is intended to offset the impact of currency fluctuations on assets  liabilities and cash flows denominated in foreign currencies 
the success of our hedging program depends on forecasts of transaction activity in various currencies 
to the extent that these forecasts are overstated or understated during periods of currency volatility  we could experience unanticipated currency gains or losses 
the principal currencies hedged are the british pound  canadian dollar  euro  japanese yen  and singapore dollar 
in those currencies where there is a liquid  cost effective forward market  we maintain hedge coverage between our established minimum and maximum percentages of our anticipated transaction exposure for periods not to exceed one year 
the gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the value of the related exposure 
foreign currency risk value at risk disclosure we utilize a value at risk model to determine the potential earning fair value exposures presented by our foreign currency related financial instruments 
as discussed above  we seek to minimize this exposure through our hedging program 
our value at risk computation is based on the monte carlo simulation  utilizing a confidence interval and a holding period of days 
as of december   this computation estimated that there is a chance that the market value of the underlying exposures and the corresponding derivative instruments either increase or decrease due to foreign currency fluctuations by more than million 
this value at risk measure is consistent with our financial statement disclosures relative to our foreign currency hedging program 
specifically  during each of the four quarters of fiscal  the value at risk ranged between million and million  and averaged approximately million 
interest rate risk 
as described above  our debt portfolio includes both fixed rate and variable rate instruments 
fluctuations in interest rates can therefore have a direct impact on both our short term cash flows as they relate to interest and our earnings 
in january  we initiated  for a portion of our fixed rate debt portfolio  interest rate swaps that in effect convert fixed rate debt to variable rate debt 
these swaps have been designated as fair value hedges 
these swaps will be marked to market in our consolidated financial statements so that fair value movements in these swaps will be offset by the fair value movement in the debt 
interest rate risk sensitivity as of december   our debt portfolio is comprised of fixed rate debt and variable rate debt 
after giving effect to the interest rate swap entered into in january  of our debt portfolio is fixed and is variable 
our current debt covenants require that we 
table of contents maintain at least of our debt portfolio in fixed rate debt as defined in the credit agreement 
our current earnings exposure for changes in interest rates can be summarized as follows changes in interest rates can cause interest charges on our variable rate debt comprised of million of term loan and million of swapped notes to fluctuate 
a increase or approximately basis points in current interest rates would cause an additional pre tax charge to our earnings of million for fiscal year changes in interest rates can cause our cash flows relative to interest payments on variable rate debt to fluctuate 
as described above  an increase of or approximately basis points in current interest rates would cause our cash outflows to increase by million for fiscal year changes in interest rates can cause the value of our fixed rate debt to change 
however  such a value change has no impact on either our earnings or our cash flows unless we determine that we wish to retire this debt in the open market 
forward looking information and factors affecting future performance the following important factors affect our business and operations generally or affect multiple segments of our business and operations our operating results may continue to be harmed by cyclical downturns affecting several of the industries into which we sell our products 
some of the industries and markets into which we sell our products are cyclical 
industry downturns are often characterized by reduced product demand  excess manufacturing capacity and erosion of average selling prices and profits 
significant downturns in our customers markets and in general economic conditions have resulted in a reduced demand for several of our products and have hurt our operating results 
for example  during  our operating results were adversely affected by downturns in many of the markets we serve  including the pharmaceutical  biomedical  semiconductor and aerospace markets 
current economic conditions have caused a decrease in capital spending by many of our customers  which in turn has adversely affected our sales and business 
if we do not introduce new products in a timely manner  our products could become obsolete and our operating results would suffer 
we sell many of our products in industries characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product and service introductions and evolving industry standards 
without the timely introduction of new products and enhancements  our products could become technologically obsolete over time  in which case our sales and operating results would suffer 
the success of our new product offerings will depend upon several factors  including our ability to accurately anticipate customer needs  innovate and develop new technologies and applications  successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner  price our products competitively and manufacture and deliver our products in sufficient volumes and on time  and differentiate our offerings from our competitors offerings 
many of our products are used by our customers to develop  test and manufacture their products 
therefore  we must anticipate industry trends and develop products in advance of the commercialization of our customers products 
in developing new products  we may be required to make significant investments before we can determine the commercial viability of the new product 
if we fail to accurately foresee our customers needs and future activities  we may invest heavily in research and development of products that do not lead to significant sales 

table of contents in addition  some of our licensed technology is subject to contractual restrictions  which may limit our ability to develop or commercialize products for some applications 
for example  some of our license agreements are limited to the field of life sciences research  and exclude clinical diagnostics applications 
our debt may adversely affect our cash flow and may restrict our investment opportunities 
as of december   we had approximately million in outstanding indebtedness  excluding obligations under our accounts receivable securitization facility 
our level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate sufficient cash to pay the principal or interest in respect of our indebtedness 
we have million in additional borrowing capacity available to us under our revolving credit facility 
we may also obtain additional long term debt and working capital lines of credit to meet future financing needs  which would have the effect of increasing our total leverage 
our leverage could have negative consequences  including increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions  limiting our ability to obtain additional financing  limiting our ability to acquire new products and technologies through acquisitions or licensing  requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness  thereby reducing the amount of our cash flow available for other purposes  including capital expenditures  limiting our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industries in which we compete  and placing us at a possible competitive disadvantage with less leveraged competitors and competitors that may have better access to capital resources 
a significant portion of our indebtedness bears interest at floating rates 
as a result  our interest payment obligations on this indebtedness will increase if interest rates increase 
our ability to satisfy our obligations and to reduce our total debt depends on our future operating performance and on economic  financial  competitive and other factors beyond our control 
our business may not generate sufficient cash flow to meet these obligations or to successfully execute our business strategy 
if we are unable to service our debt and fund our business  we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures  seek additional financing or equity capital  restructure or refinance our debt or sell assets 
we may not be able to obtain additional financing or refinance existing debt or sell assets on terms acceptable to us or at all 
restrictions in our senior credit facility and the indenture governing our notes may limit our activities 
our senior credit facility and the indenture relating to our notes contain  and future debt instruments to which we may become subject may contain  restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that could otherwise benefit our company  including restrictions on our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness  pay dividends on  redeem or repurchase our capital stock  make investments  create liens  sell assets  
table of contents in the case of our restricted subsidiaries  incur obligations that restrict their ability to make dividend or other payments to us  in the case of our restricted subsidiaries  guarantee or secure indebtedness  enter into transactions with affiliates  create unrestricted subsidiaries  and consolidate  merge or transfer all or substantially all of our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries on a consolidated basis 
we are also required to meet specified financial ratios under the terms of our senior credit facility 
our ability to comply with these financial restrictions and covenants is dependent on our future performance  which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors  including factors that are beyond our control such as foreign exchange rates  interest rates  changes in technology and changes in the level of competition 
our failure to comply with any of these restrictions or covenants may result in an event of default under the applicable debt instrument  which could permit acceleration of the debt under that instrument and require us to prepay that debt before its scheduled due date 
also  an acceleration of the debt under our senior credit facility would trigger an event of default under our notes  and a default under our notes would trigger an event of default under the senior credit facility and possibly other debt 
if an event of default occurs  we may not have sufficient funds available to make the required payments under our indebtedness 
if we are unable to repay amounts owed under our senior credit facility  those lenders may be entitled to foreclose on and sell the collateral that secures our borrowings under that agreement 
our inability to repay amounts owed under our senior credit facility may also cause a default under other of our obligations including our accounts receivable securitization facility 
economic  political and other risks associated with foreign operations could adversely affect our international sales 
because we sell our products worldwide  our businesses are subject to risks associated with doing business internationally 
our sales originating outside the united states represented more than of our total sales in the fiscal year ended december  we anticipate that sales from international operations will continue to represent a substantial portion of our total sales 
in addition  many of our manufacturing facilities  employees and suppliers are located outside the united states 
accordingly  our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates  changes in a country s or region s political or economic conditions  particularly in developing or emerging markets  longer payment cycles of foreign customers and difficulty of collecting receivables in foreign jurisdictions  trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements  differing tax laws and changes in those laws  difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations  differing labor laws and changes in those laws  differing protection of intellectual property and changes in that protection  and differing regulatory requirements and changes in those requirements 

table of contents our quarterly operating results are subject to significant fluctuation  and we may not be able to adjust our operations to effectively address changes we do not anticipate 
given the nature of the markets in which we participate  we cannot reliably predict future sales and profitability 
changes in competitive  market and economic conditions may require us to adjust our operations  and we can offer no assurance of our ability to make such adjustments or to make them quickly enough to adapt to changing conditions 
a high proportion of our costs are fixed  due in part to our significant sales  research and development and manufacturing costs 
thus  small declines in sales could disproportionately affect our operating results in a quarter 
factors that may affect our quarterly operating results include demand for and market acceptance of our products  competitive pressures resulting in lower selling prices  adverse changes in the level of economic activity in regions in which we do business  adverse changes in industries  such as pharmaceutical  biomedical  semiconductors and aerospace  on which we are particularly dependent  changes in the portions of our sales represented by our various products and customers  delays or problems in the introduction of new products  our competitors announcement or introduction of new products  services or technological innovations  increased costs of raw materials or supplies  and changes in the volume or timing of product orders 
we may not be able to successfully execute acquisitions or license technologies  integrate acquired businesses or licensed technologies into our existing business or make acquired businesses or licensed technologies profitable 
we have in the past  and may in the future  supplement our internal growth by acquiring businesses and licensing technologies that complement or augment our existing product lines  such as our acquisition of packard bioscience company in november we may be unable to identify or complete promising acquisitions or license transactions for many reasons  including competition among buyers and licensees  the need for regulatory and other approvals  our inability to raise capital to fund these acquisitions  the high valuations of businesses and technologies  and restrictions in the instruments governing our indebtedness  including the indenture governing the notes and our new senior credit facility 
some of the businesses we may seek to acquire may be unprofitable or marginally profitable 
accordingly  the earnings or losses of acquired businesses may dilute our earnings 
for these acquired businesses to achieve acceptable levels of profitability  we must improve their management  operations  products and market penetration 
we may not be successful in this regard and may encounter other difficulties in integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations 
to finance our acquisitions  we may have to raise additional funds  either through public or private financings 
we may be unable to obtain such funds or may be able to do so only on terms unacceptable to us 

table of contents if we do not successfully integrate our life sciences and analytical instruments business units  we may not achieve the benefits we anticipate we will derive from the combination of these businesses 
in  we achieved in excess of the original range of to million in pre tax cost savings from the combination of our life sciences and analytical instruments businesses  announced in the fourth quarter of in  we are targeting additional pre tax cost savings of between million and million  for a combined pre tax cost savings of between million and million relative to fiscal cost levels 
while we believe these cost savings to be reasonable  they are estimates that are inherently difficult to predict  are necessarily speculative in nature and are subject to various integration risks 
the integration risks include the possibility that we may experience a loss of productivity  sales and key personnel and that the information technology systems of these two businesses may not be fully compatible 
if any of the potential difficulties were to occur and persist  the business results of our life and analytical sciences reporting segment could suffer 
in addition  unforeseen factors may offset some or all of the estimated cost savings or other benefits from the integration 
as a result of these integration risks and possible unforeseen factors  our actual cost savings  if any  could differ or be delayed  compared to our estimates 
moreover  our capability to more fully capitalize  through their combination  on the strengths of our former life sciences and analytical instruments businesses sales  service and research and development organizations may be compromised 
our loss of licenses may require us to stop selling products or lose competitive advantage 
we may not be able to renew our existing licenses or licenses we may obtain in the future on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
if we lose the rights to a patented or other proprietary technology  we may need to stop selling products incorporating that technology and possibly other products  redesign our products or lose a competitive advantage 
potential competitors could in license technologies that we fail to license and potentially erode our market share 
our licenses typically subject us to various economic and commercialization obligations 
if we fail to comply with these obligations we could lose important rights under a license  such as the right to exclusivity in a market 
in some cases  we could lose all rights under the license 
in addition  rights granted under the license could be lost for reasons out of our control 
for example  the licensor could lose patent protection for a number of reasons  including invalidity of the licensed patent  or a third party could obtain a patent that curtails our freedom to operate under one or more licenses 
if we do not compete effectively  our business will be harmed 
we encounter aggressive competition from numerous competitors in many areas of our business 
we may not be able to compete effectively with all of these competitors 
to remain competitive  we must develop new products and periodically enhance our existing products 
we anticipate that we may also have to adjust the prices of many of our products to stay competitive 
in addition  new competitors  technologies or market trends may emerge to threaten or reduce the value of entire product lines 
if we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance with the regulations of the united states food and drug administration and other governmental agencies  we may be forced to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution  and we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties 
some of the products produced by our life and analytical sciences business unit are subject to regulation by the united states food and drug administration and similar international agencies 
in addition  some of the activities of our fluid sciences business unit are subject to regulation by the united states federal aviation administration 
these regulations govern a wide variety of product activities  from design and development to labeling  manufacturing  promotion  sales  resales and distribution 
if we fail to comply with those regulations or those of similar international agencies  we may have to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution 
in addition  we could be subject to fines or criminal prosecution 

table of contents changes in governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses 
we compete in markets in which we or our customers must comply with federal  state  local and foreign regulations  such as environmental  health and safety and food and drug regulations 
we develop  configure and market our products to meet customer needs created by these regulations 
any significant change in these regulations could reduce demand for our products or increase our costs of producing these products 
obtaining and enforcing patent protection for our proprietary products  processes and technologies may be difficult and expensive  we may infringe intellectual property rights of third parties 
patent and trade secret protection is important to us because developing and marketing new technologies and products is time consuming and expensive 
we own many united states and foreign patents and intend to apply for additional patents to cover our products 
we may not obtain issued patents from any pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us 
the claims allowed under any issued patents may not be broad enough to protect our technology 
third parties may seek to challenge  invalidate or circumvent issued patents owned by or licensed to us or claim that our products and operations infringe their patent or other intellectual property rights 
in addition to our patents  we possess an array of unpatented proprietary technology and know how and we license intellectual property rights to and from third parties 
the measures that we employ to protect this technology and these rights may not be adequate 
moreover  in some cases  the licensor can terminate a license or convert it to a non exclusive arrangement if we fail to meet specified performance targets 
we may incur significant expense in any legal proceedings to protect our proprietary rights or to defend infringement claims by third parties 
in addition  claims of third parties against us could result in awards of substantial damages or court orders that could effectively prevent us from manufacturing  using  importing or selling our products in the united states or abroad 
our results of operations will be adversely affected if we fail to realize the full value of our intangible assets 
as of december   our total assets included billion of net intangible assets 
net intangible assets consist principally of goodwill associated with acquisitions and costs associated with securing patent rights  trademark rights and technology licenses  net of accumulated amortization 
these assets have historically been amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives 
in connection with our adoption of sfas no 
 we discontinued the amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets beginning in fiscal instead  we test these items  at a minimum  on an annual basis for potential impairment by comparing the carrying value to the fair market value of the reporting unit to which they are assigned 
future impairment testing may result in additional intangible asset write offs  which could adversely affect our results of operations
