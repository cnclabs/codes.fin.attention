item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the years ended december    and in addition  this section contains forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements are subject to the inherent uncertainties in predicting future results and conditions 
certain factors that could cause actual results and conditions to differ materially from those projected in these forward looking statements are described in the investment considerations section on page critical accounting policies the sec has recently issued cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies 
the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that are both most important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results  and that require management s most difficult  subjective  or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain and may change materially in subsequent periods 
the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements requires estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and related notes 
significant estimates made by the company include valuation of loans  evaluation of the recoverability of accounts receivable and income tax assets  and the assessment of litigation and other contingencies 
the company s ability to collect accounts receivable and recover the value of its loans depends on a number of factors  including financial conditions and its ability to enforce provisions of its contracts in the event of disputes  through litigation if necessary  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  to record net assets and liabilities at estimated realizable values 
the matters that give rise to such provisions are inherently uncertain and may require complex and subjective judgments 
although the company believes that estimates and assumptions used in determining the recorded amounts of net assets and liabilities at december   are reasonable  actual results could differ materially from the estimated amounts recorded in the company s financial statements 
general the company is a specialty finance company that has a leading position in originating and servicing loans that finance taxicab medallions and various types of commercial businesses 
since  the year in which the company became a public company  it has increased its medallion loan portfolio at a compound annual growth rate of  and its commercial loan portfolio at a compound annual growth rate of 
total assets under our management  which includes assets serviced for third party investors  were approximately  as of december   and have grown from  at the end of  a compound annual growth rate of 
the company s loan related earnings depend primarily on its level of net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between the total yield on the company s loan portfolio and the average cost of borrowed funds 
the company funds its operations through a wide variety of interest bearing sources  such as revolving bank facilities  debentures issued to and guaranteed by the sba  and bank term debt 
net interest income fluctuates with changes in the yield on the company s loan portfolio and changes in the cost of borrowed funds  as well as changes in the amount of interest bearing assets and interest bearing liabilities held by the company 
net interest income is also affected by economic  regulatory  and competitive factors that influence interest rates  loan demand  and the availability of funding to finance the company s lending activities 
the company  like other financial institutions  is subject to interest rate risk to the degree that its interest earning assets reprice on a different basis than its interest bearing liabilities 
the company also invests in small businesses in selected industries through its subsidiary mci 
mci s investments are typically in the form of secured debt instruments with fixed interest rates accompanied by warrants to purchase an equity interest for a nominal exercise price such warrants are included in equity investments on the consolidated balance sheets 
interest income is earned on the debt investments 
realized gains or losses on investments are recognized when the investments are sold or written off 
the realized gains or losses represent the difference between the proceeds received from the disposition of portfolio assets  if any  and the cost of such portfolio assets 
in addition  changes in unrealized appreciation or depreciation of investments are recorded and represent the net change in the estimated fair values of the portfolio assets at the end of the period as compared with their estimated fair values at the beginning of the period 
generally  realized gains losses on investments and changes in unrealized appreciation depreciation on investments are inversely related 
when an appreciated asset is sold to realize a gain  a decrease in the previously recorded unrealized appreciation occurs 
conversely  when a loss previously recorded as unrealized depreciation is realized by the sale or other disposition of a depreciated portfolio asset  the reclassification of the loss from unrealized to realized causes a decrease in net unrealized depreciation and an increase in realized loss 
the company s investment in media  as a wholly owned portfolio investment company  is also subject to quarterly assessments of fair value 
the company uses media s actual results of operations as the best estimate of changes in fair value  and records the result as a component of unrealized appreciation depreciation on investments 
trends in investment portfolio the company s investment income is driven by the principal amount of and yields on its investment portfolio 
to identify trends in the yields  the portfolio is grouped by medallion loans  commercial loans  and equity investments 
the following table illustrates the company s investments at fair value and the portfolio yields at the dates indicated

portfolio summary total portfolio yield the weighted average yield of the total portfolio at december  was  a decrease of basis points from at december   which was a decrease of basis points from at december  the decreases primarily reflected the reductions in the general level of interest rates in the economy  evidenced by the reduction in the prime rate from in early to by year end the general rate decrease is partially mitigated by the sizable number of fixed rate medallion loans which reprice at longer intervals  and the generally high yields including some at fixed rates  on the commercial portfolio 
the company expects to try to continue increasing both the percentage of commercial loans in the total portfolio and the origination of floating and adjustable rate loans and non new york medallion loans 
medallion loan portfolio the company s medallion loans comprised of the net portfolio of  at december   compared to of  at december  and of  at december  the medallion loan portfolio increased by  or in  reflecting increases in all markets  particularly in new york  and chicago  and reversing the reductions during in most markets  especially in new york  and the effect of the reclassification of certain chicago loans to owned medallions 
in  a substantial amount of the growth reflected the repurchase of participations generated in  complimented by new business and the conversion of owned medallions into earning assets 
in  the company declined to renew more marginable credits  slowed origination activity  and continued efforts to participate loans to third party lenders  for the purpose of conserving cash resources for debt service 
the company retained a portion of those participating loans and earns a fee for servicing the loans for the third parties 
total medallion loans serviced for third parties were  and  at december  and the weighted average yield of the medallion loan portfolio at december  was  a decrease of basis points from at december   which was down basis points from at december  the decreases in yield primarily reflected the generally lower level of interest rates in the economy  and the effects of borrower refinancings 
at december   of the medallion loan portfolio represented loans outside new york  compared to and at year end and the company continues to focus its efforts on originating higher yielding medallion loans outside the new york market 
collateral appreciation participation loans during the first half  the company originated collateral appreciation participation loans collateralized by chicago taxi medallions of  of which  was syndicated to other financial institutions 
in consideration for modifications from its normal taxi medallion lending terms  the company offered loans at higher loan to value ratios  and was entitled to earn additional interest income based upon any increase in the value of all  of the collateral 
during and  additional interest income was recorded  compared to a decrease of  for  which was reflected in investment income on the consolidated statements of operations and in accrued interest receivable on the consolidated balance sheets 
during  of the medallions were returned to the company in lieu of repayment of the loans 
as a result   of these loans were carried in other assets  and  were carried in medallion loans  in total representing of the company s assets 
in addition  the borrower had not paid interest due of  subsequently  the company reached agreement to sell of the medallions to new borrowers at book value upon the transfer of the ownership of the medallion licenses by the city of chicago  and medallions for  had been reclassified back to medallion loans by the end of  reflecting the transfers to date 
the company also reached an agreement on a term payout of the interest due with the original borrower  which is carried at  and is on nonaccrual at december  the remaining returned medallions were sold to subsidiaries of mfc  including the syndicated portion  funded by notes with several banks 
these medallions are being leased to fleet operators while being held for long term appreciation in value 
the remaining loans for medallions were due in june  and all of the medallions were returned to the company in lieu of repayment of the loans 
the company has entered into negotiations with certain fleet operators who would buy the loans for full value  similar to the transaction described above  and as of february   of these medallions for  had been reclassified back to medallion loans 
however  there can be no assurances that the balance of such refinancings will occur 
as a ric  the company is required to mark to market these investments on a quarterly basis  as it does on all of its other investments 
the company believes that it has adequately calculated the fair market value of these investments in each accounting period  by relying upon information such as recent and historical medallion sale prices 
commercial loan portfolio since  and until  the company shifted the total portfolio mix toward a higher percentage of commercial loans  which historically had higher yields than medallion loans  and represented of the net investment portfolio as of december  commercial loans declined by  or during  continuing the trend begun in the decrease in both years reflected decreases in all business lines  particularly in the sba section a and asset based lending businesses  reflecting the slowdown in originations due to liquidity constraints  and the sales or participations of certain assets  loan payoffs and maturities  and in  the time lag associated with regenerating the loan pipeline once the liquidity constraints disappeared mid year 
total commercial loans serviced for third parties were  and  at december  and the weighted average yield of the commercial loan portfolio at december  was  a decrease of basis points from at december   which was up basis points from at december  the decrease in reflected downward repricing pressure consistent with the interest rate drops over the last few years 
the increase in primarily reflected the payoff or sale of lower yielding section a and asset based loans to both improve liquidity and enhance the portfolio yield 
the company continues to originate adjustable rate and floating rate loans tied to the prime rate to help mitigate its interest rate risk in a rising interest rate environment 
at december   variable rate loans represented approximately of the commercial portfolio  compared to and at december  and although this strategy initially produces a lower yield  we believe that this strategy mitigates interest rate risk by better matching our earning assets to their adjustable rate funding sources 
delinquency and loan loss experience we generally follow a practice of discontinuing the accrual of interest income on our loans that are in arrears as to interest payments for a period of days or more 
we deliver a default notice and begin foreclosure and liquidation proceedings when management determines that pursuit of these remedies is the most appropriate course of action under the circumstances 
a loan is considered to be delinquent if the borrower fails to make a payment on time  however  during the course of discussion on delinquent status  we may agree to modify the payment terms of the loan with a borrower that cannot make payments in accordance with the original loan agreement 
for loan modifications  the loan will only be returned to accrual status if all past due interest payments are brought fully current 
based upon the assessment of our collateral position  we evaluate most of these relationships on an enterprise value basis and expect to locate and install a new operator to run the business and reduce the debt 
for credit that is collateral based  we anticipate that a substantial portion of the principal amount of delinquent loans would be collected upon foreclosure of such loans  if necessary 
there can be no assurance  however  that the collateral securing these loans will be adequate in the event of foreclosure 
the following table shows the trend in loans days or more past due as of december  medallion loans commercial loans secured mezzanine sba section a asset based receivable other secured commercial total commercial loans total loans days or more past due percentage is calculated against the total loan portfolio 
in general  collection efforts over the past months have substantially contributed to the sizable reduction in the overall delinquency patterns 
the decrease in medallion delinquencies from a year ago primarily represents improvements as the economic fallout from the events of september  have receded and business for many fleet owners and individual drivers has returned to more normal patterns of delinquencies 
the decrease in secured mezzanine delinquencies primarily reflected the conversion of a  loan into an equity position in a portfolio investment 
otherwise  the overall increase in secured mezzanine financing delinquencies primarily reflected the impact of the economy on certain concession and media properties  some of which is believed to be of temporary nature  and is not unusual given the nature of this kind of business and the current stage of the economic cycle 
the continued improvement in the trend of delinquencies in the sba section a portfolio and the other commercial secured loan portfolio primarily reflected management s efforts to collect and restructure nonperforming loans  the satisfactory resolution of several large long term workout credits  and the foreclosure of certain loans  transferring them to other assets 
included in the sba section a delinquency figures are   and  at december    and  which represented loans repurchased for the purpose of collecting on the sba guarantee 
the company is actively working with each delinquent borrower to bring them current  and believes that any potential loss exposure is reflected in the company s mark to market estimates on each loan 
although there can be no assurances as to changes in the trend rate  management believes that any loss exposures are properly reflected in reported asset values 
we monitor delinquent loans for possible exposure to loss  by analyzing various factors  including the value of the collateral securing the loan and the borrower s prior payment history 
under the act  our loan portfolio must be recorded at fair value or marked to market 
unlike other lending institutions  we are not permitted to establish reserves for loan losses 
instead  the valuation of our portfolio is adjusted quarterly to reflect our estimate of the current realizable value of our loan portfolio 
since no ready market exists for this portfolio  fair value is subject to the good faith determination of management and the approval of our board of directors 
because of the subjectivity of these estimates  there can be no assurance that  in the event of a foreclosure or the sale of portfolio loans we would be able to recover the amounts reflected on our balance sheet 
in determining the value of our portfolio  management and the board of directors may take into consideration various factors such as the financial condition of the borrower and the adequacy of the collateral 
for example  in a period of sustained increases in market interest rates  management and the board of directors could decrease its valuation of the portfolio if the portfolio consists primarily of fixed rate loans 
our valuation procedures are designed to generate values which approximate the value that would have been established by market forces and are therefore subject to uncertainties and variations from reported results 
based upon these factors  net unrealized appreciation or depreciation on investments is determined  or the amount by which our estimate of the current realizable value of our portfolio is above or below our cost basis

unlike other lending institutions  we are not permitted to establish reserves for loan losses 
instead  the valuation of our portfolio is adjusted quarterly to reflect estimates of the current realizable value of the loan portfolio 
these percentages represent the discount or premiums that investments are carried on the books at  relative to their par value 
equity investments equity investments were   and  of the company s total portfolio at december    and equity investments are comprised of common stock and warrants  primarily held by mci 
the increase in equities during and was primarily a result of the unrealized appreciation recorded on a publicly traded investment which was sold during investment in and loans to media the investments and loans to media represent the company s investment in its taxicab advertising business  including contributed capital  the company s share of accumulated losses  and intercompany loans provided to media for operating capital 
trend in interest expense the company s interest expense is driven by the interest rates payable on its short term credit facilities with banks  fixed rate  long term debentures issued to the sba  and other short term notes payable 
the establishment of the merrill lynch bank  usa mlb line of credit in september and its favorable renegotiation in september had the effect of dramatically reducing the company s cost of funds 
the company s borrowing costs increased during the first nine months of  until the mlb line was established  as a result of amendments to the prior credit facilities and senior secured notes 
the amendments to the credit facilities and senior secured notes entered into during involved changes  and in some cases increases  to the interest rates payable thereunder 
in addition  during events of default  the interest rate on the loans was increased by percentage points 
the effect of this was to keep borrowing costs abnormally high during a period when rates were otherwise declining 
see the table below for the average cost of borrowed funds 
the september  amendments repriced the bank loans to for the company and for mfc  and repriced mfc s senior secured notes to 
in addition to the interest rate charges   was incurred through december  for attorneys and other professional advisors  most working on behalf of the lenders  and for prepayment penalties and default interest charges  of which  and  was expensed as part of costs of debt extinguishment in and   and  was expensed as part of interest expense during and  and and  was expensed as part of professional fees in and the balance of  which relates solely to the trust s new line of credit with mlb will be charged to interest expense over the remaining term of the line of credit 
during the third quarter  the trust closed a  line of credit with mlb for lending on medallion loans  which was priced at libor plus  excluding fees and other costs 
all of the draws on this line were paid to mfc for medallion loans purchased  and were used by mfc to repay higher priced debt with the banks and noteholders  and to purchase loans for the trust from participants and affiliates 
during the third quarter  this line was renewed and extended  and borrowings are now generally at libor plus 
in addition   of higher priced sba debentures were repaid during the year  and  was drawn back at lower borrowing rates 
the company s cost of funds is primarily driven by the rates paid on its various debt instruments and their relative mix  and changes in the levels of average borrowings outstanding 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for details on the terms of all outstanding debt 
the company s debentures issued to the sba typically have terms of ten years 
the company measures its borrowing costs as its aggregate interest expense for all of its interest bearing liabilities divided by the average amount of such liabilities outstanding during the period 
the following table shows the average borrowings and related borrowing costs for   and average balances have declined over the last two years  primarily reflecting the sale or participation of loans to other financial institutions  reductions in the level of loan originations or refinancings  and the usage of operating cash flow to raise capital for debt reductions and other corporate purposes 
the decline in borrowing costs reflected the utilization of the lower cost revolving line of credit with mlb  and the trend of declining interest rates in the economy  partially offset by higher cost bank debt and related renewal expenses  and additional long term sba debt also at higher rates

the company will continue to seek sba funding to the extent it offers attractive rates 
sba financing subjects its recipients to limits on the amount of secured bank debt they may incur 
the company uses sba funding to fund loans that qualify under sbia and sba regulations 
the company believes that financing operations primarily with short term floating rate secured bank debt has generally decreased its interest expense  but has also increased the company s exposure to the risk of increases in market interest rates  which the company mitigates with certain hedging strategies 
at december    and  short term floating rate debt constituted   and of total debt  respectively 
taxicab advertising in addition to its finance business  the company also conducts a taxicab rooftop advertising business through media  which began operations in november media s revenue is affected by the number of taxicab rooftop advertising displays currently showing advertisements  and the rate charged customers for those displays 
at december   media had approximately  installed displays in the united states 
the company expects that media will continue to expand its operations by entering new markets on its own or through acquisition of existing taxicab rooftop advertising companies 
although media is a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  its results of operations are not consolidated with the company s operations because sec regulations prohibit the consolidation of non investment companies with investment companies 
during the last three years  media s operations were constrained by a very difficult advertising environment that resulted from the september  terrorist attacks and a general economic downturn  compounded by the rapid expansion of taxicab tops inventory that occurred during and media began to recognize losses as growth in operating expenses exceeded growth in revenue 
media is actively pursuing new sales opportunities  including expansion and upgrading of the sales force  and has taken steps to reduce operating expenses  including renegotiation of fleet payments for advertising rights to better align ongoing revenues and expenses  and to maximize cash flow from operations 
media has developed an operating plan to fund only necessary operations out of available cash flow and intercompany borrowings  and to escalate its sales activities to generate new revenues 
although there can be no assurances  media and the company believe that this plan will enable media to weather this downturn in the advertising cycle and maintain operations at existing levels until such time as business returns to historical levels 
during  continued negotiations with certain fleets were concluded with the result that  that media had accrued as payments to these fleets was reversed against media s cost of fleet services 
also  in  media settled a claim against one of its fleet operators 
the result was a termination of certain contractual relations  the payment of  to media  the transfer of certain assets to the fleet operator  and the forgiveness of certain liabilities media owed the fleet operator 
the net result was a  gain reflected as other income in media s statement of operations 
a portion of the proceeds from this settlement was used by media to repay the balance of its us third party outstanding debt 
also during  media determined that certain tops were no longer usable  and  of these tops were written off to depreciation expense 
in  a substantial portion of media s revenues arose from the realization of amounts that had been paid for and deferred from prior periods 
also  media recorded a  tax provision to establish a valuation allowance against the future realization of a deferred tax asset that was recorded in prior periods relating to actual tax payments made for taxable revenue that had not been recorded for financial reporting purposes  of which  was reversed in as a result of changes in the tax laws 
media retains a net operating loss carryforward of  at december  the company charges media for salaries and benefits and corporate overhead paid by the company on media s behalf 
during  these amounts owed by media to the company were capitalized as equity 
the decrease in equipment and prepaid signing bonuses included the adjustments related to the contract settlement and the tops writeoff described above 
the increase in accounts receivables and deferred revenue reflect increased sales activity to be recognized in future periods 
in july  media acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of mmj  a taxi advertising operation similar to those operated by media in the us  which has advertising rights on approximately  cabs servicing various cities in japan 
the terms of the agreement provide for an earn out payment to the sellers based on average net income over the next three years 
mmj accounted for approximately of media s consolidated revenue during  compared to and during and factors affecting net assets factors that affect the company s net assets include net realized gain or loss on investments and change in net unrealized appreciation or depreciation on investments 
net realized gain or loss on investments is the difference between the proceeds derived upon sale or foreclosure of a loan or an equity investment and the cost basis of such loan or equity investment 
change in net unrealized appreciation or depreciation on investments is the amount  if any  by which the company s estimate of the fair value of its investment portfolio is above or below the previously established fair value or the cost basis of the portfolio 
under the act and the sbia  the company s loan portfolio and other investments must be recorded at fair value 
unlike certain lending institutions  the company is not permitted to establish reserves for loan losses  but adjusts quarterly the valuation of the loan portfolio to reflect the company s estimate of the current value of the total loan portfolio 
since no ready market exists for the company s loans  fair value is subject to the good faith determination of the company 
in determining such fair value  the company and its board of directors consider factors such as the financial condition of its borrowers and the adequacy of its collateral 
any change in the fair value of portfolio loans or other investments as determined by the company is reflected in net unrealized depreciation or appreciation of investments and affects net increase in net assets resulting from operations but has no impact on net investment income or distributable income 
the company s investment in media  as a wholly owned portfolio investment company  is also subject to quarterly assessments of its fair value 
the company uses media s actual results of operations as the best estimate of changes in fair value  and records the result as a component of unrealized appreciation depreciation on investments 
consolidated results of operations for the years ended december  and net increase in net assets resulting from operations was  or per diluted common share  up  from losses of  or per share in  primarily reflecting reduced costs of debt extinguishment  net appreciation on investments  lower professional fees and other operating expenses  improved results at media  and higher net interest income  partially offset by lower noninterest income

the yield on the investment portfolio was in  down from a year ago  reflecting the refinancing activities of the customer base to take advantage of the lower level of market interest rates prevalent in the economy compared to the recent past  and the movement towards a greater concentration in lower yielding medallion loans 
average investments outstanding were  down from  a year ago  primarily reflecting the nonrenewal of certain business and sales of participation interests  so the company could raise cash as the banks and senior noteholders required the company to reduce the level of borrowings in the revolving lines of credit and senior notes 
medallion loans were  at year end  up  or from  a year ago  representing of the investment portfolio compared to a year ago  and were yielding  compared to a year ago 
the increase in loans primarily reflected efforts to book new business and repurchase certain participations  primarily in the new york city  chicago  and boston markets  to maximize the utilization of the lower cost mlb line 
as medallion loans renewed during the year and new business was booked  they were priced at generally lower current market rates 
the commercial loan portfolio was  at year end  compared to  at the prior yearend  a decrease of  or 
commercial loans represented of the investment portfolio  compared to a year ago  and yielded  compared to a year ago  reflecting the downward repricing pressure consistent with the interest rate drops over the last few years 
the decrease in commercial loans from a year ago occurred in all business lines  especially in the asset based lending and sba section a businesses 
the decreases in the loan portfolios were primarily a result of the banks and senior noteholders requiring the company to reduce the level of outstandings in the revolving lines of credit and senior notes

interest expense was  in  down  or from  in included in interest expense in was  related to the amortization of debt origination costs  partially offset by  of interest reversals compared to  of additional costs associated with the debt refinancings in the decrease in interest expense was primarily due to lower borrowing costs and  to a lesser extent  to lower average debt outstanding 
the cost of borrowed funds was  compared to a year ago  a decrease of  primarily attributable to the increased utilization of the lower cost mlb line compared to the higher priced bank and noteholder debt that resulted from amendments entered into late in and in  that tended to inflate the cost of borrowings 
average debt outstanding was  in  compared to  a year ago  a decrease of  reflecting the final payout of bank and noteholder debt during  and the net paydown of higher cost sba debentures  partially offset by the increased utilization of the mlb line

the decrease in gains on sale under the sba program primarily reflected a decrease in loans sold  as well as lower market determined premiums received on the sales in other income  which is comprised of servicing fee income  prepayment fees  late charges  and other miscellaneous income  was  in  down  or from  a year ago 
included in was  related to reversing a portion of the servicing asset impairment reserve which was no longer required due to improved prepayment patterns in the servicing asset pools   from deal termination and extension fees  and  from profit sharing income

professional fees were  in  down  or from  in  primarily reflecting sharply reduced legal and accounting fees in as a result of new accounting and legal counsel relationships and efficiencies  compared to substantially higher levels in  which also included legal and consultant costs related to debt negotiations

adjusted for the writedown  the portfolio yield in was  and the decline in was basis points  primarily reflecting the series of rate drops initiated by the federal reserve bank beginning in early  which reduced the prime lending rate by basis points 
average medallion loans represented of the total average investment portfolio at december   compared to at december   while average commercial loans were down slightly to from a year ago 
yields on medallion loans were at yearend  compared to a year ago  and yields on commercial loans were  compared to for the increase in the yield on commercial loans primarily reflected the asset based lending business allowing lower yielding credits to run off  replacing them with higher yielding new business 
medallion loans were  at yearend  down  or from  at the end of  reflecting reductions in most markets  particularly in new york  and the reclassification of certain chicago loans to owned medallions 
the commercial loan portfolio was  at yearend  compared to  a year ago  a decrease of  or  reflecting decreases in all business lines  especially the sba section a and asset based lending businesses 
in general  the decreases in the loan portfolios were a result of the banks and senior noteholders requiring the company to reduce the level of outstandings in the revolving lines of credit and senior notes 
see page for a table which shows loan balances and portfolio yields by type of loan 
during the first half  the company originated collateral appreciation participation loans collateralized by chicago taxi medallions of  of which  was syndicated to other financial institutions 
in consideration for modifications from its normal taxi medallion lending terms  the company offered loans at higher loan to value ratios  and is entitled to earn additional interest income based upon any increase in the value of all  of the collateral 
during  additional interest income was recorded  compared to a decrease of  for  which was reflected in investment income on the consolidated statements of operations and in accrued interest receivable on the consolidated balance sheets 
during  of the medallions were returned to the company in lieu of repayment of the loans 
as a result   of these loans was carried in other assets  and  was carried in medallion loans  in total representing of the company s assets 
in addition  the borrower had not paid interest due of  subsequently  the company reached agreement to sell of the medallions to a new borrower at book value  upon the transfer of the licenses by the city of chicago  and medallions for  were reclassified back to medallion loans at yearend  reflecting the transfers to date 
the company also had a buyer in discussions for the remaining returned medallions  and reached agreement on a term payout of the interest due with the original borrower  which is carried on nonaccrual  although payments continue to be made 
in addition  the medallions which had remained in the loan portfolio  was also on nonaccrual  although payments continue to be made 
interest expense was  in  down  or from  in  primarily reflecting lower average balances outstanding 
the company s borrowings from its bank lenders and noteholders were repriced several times during and as a result of the negotiations and amendments to the loan agreements and notes 
the impact of all of this was to increase the company s borrowing costs by  or basis points in  and by  or basis points in  compared to the rates in effect at the beginning of excluding these amounts  interest expense in would have been  down  or from  in in addition  during  the majority of the company s loans matured and were subject to intensive discussions concerning the ultimate liquidation of the outstandings 
the costs associated with these discussions of  went well above and beyond the normal interest charges on the debt  and were classified to operating expenses as costs of debt extinguishment 
average debt outstanding was  for  compared to  for  a decrease of  or 
the company s debt is primarily tied to floating rate indexes  which began falling during early  and continued to drop until late in the year 
the company s average borrowing costs were and in and  respectively  compared to declines in market rates of over basis points during the period 
approximately of the company s debt was short term and floating or adjustable rate in both and see page for a table which shows average balances and cost of funds for the company s funding sources 
net interest income was  and the net interest margin was for  down  or from  or in  primarily reflecting the decreases in yields and balances in the loan portfolio  and the  reduction in additional interest income on the collateral appreciation participation loans in  partially offset by lower borrowing costs associated with reduced levels of borrowings at lower rates of interest 
adjusted for the impact of the additional interest on the collateral appreciation participation loans  the net interest margin was for noninterest income was  in  up  or from  in the company had gains on the sale of loans of  which included gains on the sale of the guaranteed portion of sba a loans of  down  or from  a year ago  which only included sba sales 
during   of loans were sold under the sba program  compared to  for  a decline of 
the decline in gains on sba sales reflected a decrease in loans sold  partially offset by a higher level of market determined premiums received on the sales in the periods 
offsetting the decline in sba guaranteed sales were sales of  of the unguaranteed portion of these loans held by the company that were sold for a gain of  other income  which is comprised of servicing fee income  prepayment fees  late charges  and other miscellaneous income  of  in was up  from  a year ago  primarily reflecting charges to revalue the servicing fee receivable by  in  as a result of substantial increases in prepayments on the serviced portfolio in which resulted from the sharp decrease in interest rates  among other factors  and in  from a success fee earned on a mezzanine investment of  unusually large prepayment penalties of  for two loans  a  referral fee  and  from insurance proceeds received on a customer 
excluding those charges and fees  other income of  was down  or from  in  primarily reflecting the impact of a lower asset base on fee income 
operating expenses were  in  up  or from  in  and included costs related to debt extinguishment of  for prepayment penalties  default interest charges  loan fees  legal fees  and consultant costs in  and the charges described above for excluding these costs  operating expenses were  in  up  or from  in salaries and benefits expense for of  were down  or from  in  primarily reflecting an decrease in average headcount 
professional fees of  were up  or from  a year ago  which also reflected the writeoff of  of capitalized costs in associated with certain financing transactions which were no longer being pursued 
excluding the writeoff  the increase reflected  of increased amortization of capitalized costs associated with debt and other financial transactions  the reimbursement of  of legal fees in  and increased legal and accounting expenses 
amortization of goodwill was in  reflecting the change in accounting rules which no longer allow for goodwill amortization  compared to  in  which also included the  writeoff of all remaining goodwill related to the acquisition of bll 
other operating expenses of  in were up  or from  in  primarily reflecting operational cleanups that occurred in  which reduced operating expenses by  and by a higher level of collection costs on delinquent loans  and increased insurance and other office related expenses  partially offset by lower bank charges shown in costs of debt extinguishment in and computer expenses 
net unrealized appreciation on investments was  in  compared to depreciation of  in net unrealized appreciation on investments net of media was  compared to depreciation of  a year ago 
unrealized appreciation depreciation arises when the company makes valuation adjustments to the investment portfolio 
when investments are sold or written off  any resulting realized gain loss is grossed up to reflect previously recorded unrealized components 
as a result  movement between periods can appear distorted 
the activity resulted from the reversals of unrealized depreciation associated with fully depreciated loans and equity investments which were charged off of  and the increase in valuation of equity investments of  partially offset by net unrealized depreciation of  net unrealized depreciation on foreclosed properties of  and recoveries of  the activity resulted from unrealized depreciation of  reflecting the recessionary impact on borrower operations and collateral values  and by the reversals of unrealized appreciation associated with sold investments  primarily equities  of  partially offset by the reversals of unrealized depreciation associated with investments fully written off  primarily fully depreciated loans which were charged off  of  and the increase in valuation of investments of  primarily in equity securities 
also included in unrealized appreciation depreciation on investments were the net losses of the media division of the company 
media generated a net loss of  in  an increase of  compared to a net loss of  in included in was a  tax benefit to reverse a portion of the  charge taken in to establish a reserve against the realizability of deferred tax benefits previously recorded due to changes in media s tax situation and the greater costs associated with the rapid increase in tops under contract and cities serviced  which outpaced the increase in revenue 
the reversal resulted from the change in the tax law allowing for an additional two year carryback of net operating losses 
adjusted for the above items  media lost  in  compared to a loss of  in the decline in profits in primarily reflected decreased revenue  which continued to be impacted by contract cancellations and other business retrenchments resulting from the terrorist attacks in new york city and a general economic downturn  partially offset by reduced fleet costs which declined at a slower rate than revenue as fleet contracts were renegotiated 
advertising revenues were  in  down  or from  in revenue in also included  related to contracts that were cancelled in prior periods due to legislative changes and other factors 
this revenue was recognized upon determination that media had no further continued obligations under the contract 
during  media exerted a greater effort to reduce the amount of deferred revenue by increasing capacity utilization  resulting in a drop of  in deferred revenue to  at december   compared to yearend  which included an increase of  in and a reduction of  in  including the  related to contract cancellations referred to above 
to the extent that media cannot generate additional advertising revenue to replace the deferred revenue recorded in  media s results of operations will continue to be negatively impacted 
vehicles under contract in the us were  down or from  a year ago  primarily reflecting efforts to reduce fleet costs 
media s results also included losses of  and  for and  respectively  related to foreign operations  tops racks under contract  which are suffering from the same slowdown in advertising that is hurting the us market 
the company s net realized loss on investments was  in  compared to  for  reflecting the above and direct chargeoffs of  in and  in the company s net realized unrealized loss on investments was  in  compared to  for  reflecting the above 
asset liability management interest rate sensitivity the company  like other financial institutions  is subject to interest rate risk to the extent its interest earning assets consisting of medallion loans and commercial loans reprice on a different basis over time in comparison to its interest bearing liabilities consisting primarily of credit facilities with banks and subordinated sba debentures 
having interest bearing liabilities that mature or reprice more frequently on average than assets may be beneficial in times of declining interest rates  although such an asset liability structure may result in declining net earnings during periods of rising interest rates 
abrupt increases in market rates of interest may have an adverse impact on our earnings until we are able to originate new loans at the higher prevailing interest rates 
conversely  having interest earning assets that mature or reprice more frequently on average than liabilities may be beneficial in times of rising interest rates  although this asset liability structure may result in declining net earnings during periods of falling interest rates 
this mismatch between maturities and interest rate sensitivities of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities results in interest rate risk 
the effect of changes in interest rates is mitigated by regular turnover of the portfolio 
based on past experience  the company anticipates that approximately of the portfolio will mature or be prepaid each year 
the company believes that the average life of its loan portfolio varies to some extent as a function of changes in interest rates 
borrowers are more likely to exercise prepayment rights in a decreasing interest rate environment because the interest rate payable on the borrower s loan is high relative to prevailing interest rates 
conversely  borrowers are less likely to prepay in a rising interest rate environment 
in addition  the company manages its exposure to increases in market rates of interest by incurring fixed rate indebtedness  such as ten year subordinated sba debentures 
the company had outstanding sba debentures of  with a weighted average interest rate of  constituting of the company s total indebtedness as of december  also  portions of the floating rate debt with banks reprice at intervals of as long as months  further mitigating the immediate impact of changes in market interest rates 
a relative measure of interest rate risk can be derived from the company s interest rate sensitivity gap 
the interest rate sensitivity gap represents the difference between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  which mature and or reprice within specified intervals of time 
the gap is considered to be positive when repriceable assets exceed repriceable liabilities  and negative when repriceable liabilities exceed repriceable assets 
a relative measure of interest rate sensitivity is provided by the cumulative difference between interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities for a given time interval expressed as a percentage of total assets 
the following table presents the company s interest rate sensitivity gap at december  the principal amount of medallion loans and commercial loans are assigned to the time frames in which such principal amounts are contractually obligated to be paid 
the company has not reflected an assumed annual prepayment rate for medallion loans or commercial loans in this table 
dollars in thousands less than year more than and less than years more than and less than years more than and less than years more than and less than years more than and less than years thereafter total earnings assets floating rate loans adjustable rate loans fixed rate loans cash total earning assets liabilities revolving line of credit bank loans sba secured notes total liabilities interest rate gap cumulative interest rate gap the company s interest rate sensitive assets were  and interest rate sensitive liabilities were  at december  the one year cumulative interest rate gap was a negative  or of interest rate sensitive assets  compared to  or at december  however  using our estimated prepayment refinancing rate for medallion loans to adjust the interest rate gap resulted in a positive gap of  or at december  the company seeks to manage interest rate risk by originating adjustable rate loans  by incurring fixed rate indebtedness  by evaluating appropriate derivatives  pursuing securitization opportunities  and by other options consistent with managing interest rate risk 
interest rate cap agreements from time to time  the company enters into interest rate cap agreements to manage the exposure of the portfolio to increases in market interest rates by hedging a portion of its variable rate debt against increases in interest rates 
we entered into an interest rate cap agreement on a notional amount of  limiting our maximum libor exposure on our revolving credit facility until june  to 
total premiums paid under interest rate cap agreements were expensed  and there are no unamortized premiums on the balance sheet as of december  liquidity and capital resources our sources of liquidity are the revolving line of credit with mlb  unfunded commitments from the sba for long term debentures that are issued to or guaranteed by the sba  loan amortization and prepayments  and participations or sales of loans to third parties 
as a ric in and earlier years  and as expected for and later years  we are required to distribute at least of our investment company taxable income  consequently  we have primarily relied upon external sources of funds to finance growth 
in september  the trust entered into a  revolving line of credit with mlb for the purpose of funding medallion loans acquired from mfc and others 
at december    of this line was available for future use  and in september  this line of credit may grow to  at our option 
in may  the company applied for and received  of additional funding with the sba  to be committed by the sba in total  subject to the infusion of additional equity capital into the respective subsidiaries  and in december  an additional  of funding was committed by the sba  free from any additional equity capital contribution 
at december    is available under these commitments 
since sba financing subjects its recipients to certain regulations  the company will seek funding at the subsidiary level to maximize its benefits 
the components of our debt were as follows at december  balance percentage rate revolving line of credit sba debentures notes payable to banks total outstanding debt weighted average contractual rate as of december  contractual obligations expire or mature at various dates through march  the following table shows all contractual obligations at december  payments due by period less than year years years years years more than years total floating rate borrowings fixed rate borrowings operating lease obligations total in december  mb was approved for business by its regulators  and capitalized with  of initial capital 
although no banking activities occurred during  deposit gathering began in january utilizing primarily financial brokers to raise funds 
at the current required capital levels  it is expected  although there can be no guarantee  that deposits of approximately  could be raised to fund future loan origination activity 
as of february   approximately  of deposits had been raised 
the company values its portfolio at fair value as determined in good faith by management and approved by the board of directors in accordance with the company s valuation policy 
unlike certain lending institutions  the company is not permitted to establish reserves for loan losses 
instead  the company must value each individual investment and portfolio loan on a quarterly basis 
the company records unrealized depreciation on investments and loans when it believes that an asset has been impaired and full collection is unlikely 
the company records unrealized appreciation on equities if it has a clear indication that the underlying portfolio company has appreciated in value and  therefore  the company s security has also appreciated in value 
without a readily ascertainable market value  the estimated value of the company s portfolio of investments and loans may differ significantly from the values that would be placed on the portfolio if there existed a ready market for the investments 
the company adjusts the valuation of the portfolio quarterly to reflect management s estimate of the current fair value of each investment in the portfolio 
any changes in estimated fair value are recorded in the company s statement of operations as net unrealized appreciation depreciation on investments 
the company s investment in media  as a wholly owned portfolio investment company  is also subject to quarterly assessments of its fair value 
the company uses media s actual results of operations as the best estimate of changes in fair value  and records the result as a component of unrealized appreciation depreciation on investments 
in addition  the illiquidity of our loan portfolio and investments may adversely affect our ability to dispose of loans at times when it may be advantageous for us to liquidate such portfolio or investments 
in addition  if we were required to liquidate some or all of the investments in the portfolio  the proceeds of such liquidation may be significantly less than the current value of such investments 
because we borrow money to make loans and investments  our net operating income is dependent upon the difference between the rate at which we borrow funds and the rate at which we invest these funds 
as a result  there can be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our interest income 
in periods of sharply rising interest rates  our cost of funds would increase  which would reduce our net operating income before net realized and unrealized gains 
we use a combination of long term and short term borrowings and equity capital to finance our investing activities 
our long term fixed rate investments are financed primarily with short term floating rate debt  and to a lesser extent with long term fixed rate debt 
we may use interest rate risk management techniques in an effort to limit our exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
such techniques may include various interest rate hedging activities to the extent permitted by the act 
the company has analyzed the potential impact of changes in interest rates on interest income net of interest expense 
assuming that the balance sheet were to remain constant and no actions were taken to alter the existing interest rate sensitivity  a hypothetical immediate change in interest rates would have affected net increase decrease in assets at december   by approximately  on an annualized basis  compared to  and  for and although management believes that this measure is indicative of the company s sensitivity to interest rate changes  it does not adjust for potential changes in credit quality  size and composition of the assets on the balance sheet  and other business developments that could affect net increase decrease in assets in a particular quarter or for the year taken as a whole 
accordingly  no assurances can be given that actual results would not differ materially from the potential outcome simulated by this estimate 
during the second and third quarters  the company completed an equity offering of  common shares at per share raising over  of additional capital 
the company continues to work with investment banking firms and other financial intermediaries to investigate the viability of a number of other financing options which include  among others  the sale or spin off certain assets or divisions  the development of a securitization conduit program  and other independent financing for certain subsidiaries or asset classes 
these financing options would also provide additional sources of funds for both external expansion and continuation of internal growth

prepayments on loans are influenced significantly by general interest rates  medallion loan market rates  economic conditions  and competition 
loan sales are a major focus of the sba section a loan program conducted by bll  which is primarily set up to originate and sell loans 
increases in sba section a loan balances in any given period generally reflect timing differences in selling and closing transactions 
furthermore  the company was approved to receive federal deposit insurance from the fdic insurance on its deposits in its industrial loan corporation subsidiary to be headquartered in salt lake city  utah 
mb was capitalized and began operations  including the soliciting of deposits  in december no deposits were received until january the company believes that its credit facilities with mlb and the sba  and cash flow from operations after distributions to shareholders  and deposits generated at mb will be adequate to fund the continuing operations of the company s loan portfolio and advertising business 
media funds its operations through internal cash flow and historically through intercompany debt  and during such debt was contributed to media as equity 
media is not a ric and  therefore  is able to retain earnings to finance growth 
media has developed an operating plan to fund only necessary operations out of available cash flow and intercompany borrowings  and to escalate its sales activities to generate new revenues 
although there can be no assurances  media and the company believe that this plan will enable media to weather this downturn in the advertising cycle and maintain operations at existing levels until such time as business returns to historical levels

 consolidated financial statements 
variable interest entities  some of which were formerly referred to as special purpose entities  are generally entities for which their other equity investors do not provide significant financial resources for the entity to sustain its activities  do not have voting rights or have voting rights that are disproportionately high compared with their economic interests 
under fin r  variable interest entities must be consolidated by the primary beneficiary 
the primary beneficiary is generally defined as having the majority of the risks and rewards of ownership arising from the variable interest entity 
fin r also requires certain disclosures if a significant variable interest is held but not required to be consolidated

at december  investment considerations interest rate fluctuations may adversely affect the interest rate spread we receive on our taxicab medallion and commercial loans 
because we borrow money to finance the origination of loans  our income is dependent upon the difference between the rate at which we borrow funds and the rate at which we loan funds 
while the loans in our portfolio in most cases bear interest at fixed rates or adjustable rates which adjust at various intervals  we finance a substantial portion of such loans by incurring indebtedness with adjustable or floating interest rates which adjust immediately to changes in rates 
as a result  our debt may adjust to a change in interest rates more quickly than the loans in our portfolio 
in periods of sharply rising interest rates  our costs of funds would increase  which would reduce our portfolio income before net realized and unrealized gains 
accordingly  like most financial services companies  we face the risk of interest rate fluctuations 
although we intend to continue to manage our interest rate risk through asset and liability management  including the use of interest rate caps  general rises in interest rates will tend to reduce our interest rate spread in the short term 
in addition  we rely on our counterparties to perform their obligations under such interest rate caps 
a decrease in prevailing interest rates may lead to more loan prepayments  which could adversely affect our business 
our borrowers generally have the right to prepay their loans upon payment of a fee ranging from to days interest 
a borrower is likely to exercise prepayment rights at a time when the interest rate payable on the borrower s loan is high relative to prevailing interest rates 
in a lower interest rate environment  we will have difficulty re lending prepaid funds at comparable rates  which may reduce the net interest spread we receive 
we have traditionally been a ric  and because as a ric we must distribute our income  we may have a continuing need for capital if we continue to qualify as a ric in the future 
we have a continuing need for capital to finance our lending activities 
our current sources of capital and liquidity are the following line of credit for medallion lending  raising deposits at mb  loan amortization and prepayments  sales of participation interests in loans  fixed rate  long term sba debentures that are issued to the sba  and borrowings from other financial intermediaries 
as a ric in and earlier years  and as expected for and later years  we are required to distribute at least of our investment company taxable income  consequently  we have primarily relied upon external sources of funds to finance growth 
at december   we had  available under the company s revolving line of credit with mlb which can increase by  in september   at our option   available under outstanding commitments from the sba  and  available under a loan sale agreement with a participant bank 
in addition  mb has begun raising deposits  generating additional liquidity for the company 
we may have difficulty raising capital to finance our planned level of lending operations 
although the company has demonstrated an ability to meet significant debt amortization requirements in the last two years  has received approval to operate mb and begin raising federally insured deposits  and has several refinancing options in progress and under consideration  there can be no assurance that additional funding sources to meet amortization requirements or future growth targets will be successfully obtained 
see the additional discussion related to the credit facilities and note agreements in the liquidity and capital resources section on page lending to small businesses involves a high degree of risk and is highly speculative 
lending to small businesses involves a high degree of business and financial risk  which can result in substantial losses and should be considered speculative 
our borrower base consists primarily of small business owners that have limited resources and that are generally unable to achieve financing from traditional sources 
there is generally no publicly available information about these small business owners  and we must rely on the diligence of our employees and agents to obtain information in connection with our credit decisions 
in addition  these small businesses often do not have audited financial statements 
some smaller businesses have narrower product lines and market shares than their competition 
therefore  they may be more vulnerable to customer preferences  market conditions or economic downturns  which may adversely affect the return on  or the recovery of  our investment in these businesses 
our borrowers may default on their loans 
we primarily invest in and lend to companies that may have limited financial resources 
numerous factors may affect a borrower s ability to repay its loan  including the failure to meet its business plan  a downturn in its industry or negative economic conditions  the death  disability or resignation of one or more of the key members of management  or the inability to obtain additional financing from traditional sources 
deterioration of a borrower s financial condition and prospects may be accompanied by deterioration of the collateral for the loan 
expansion of our portfolio and increases in the proportion of our portfolio consisting of commercial loans could have an adverse impact on the credit quality of the portfolio 
we borrow money  which may increase the risk of investing in our common stock 
we use financial leverage through banks and our long term subordinated sba debentures 
leverage poses certain risks for our stockholders  including the following it may result in higher volatility of both our net asset value and the market price of our common stock  since interest is paid to our creditors before any income is distributed to our stockholders  fluctuations in the interest payable to our creditors may decrease the dividends and distributions to our stockholders  and in the event of a liquidation of the company  our creditors would have claims on our assets superior to the claims of our stockholders 
our failure to remedy certain internal control deficiencies at our bll subsidiary could have an adverse affect on our business operations 
the company s bll subsidiary has been operating under an agreement with the state of connecticut to  among other things  improve bll s liquidity and capital ratios  correct certain operational weaknesses  improve the quality of assets  and increase the level of valuation allowances  the latter of which has already been reflected in these financial statements 
the board of directors of bll has entered into an agreement to address these areas of concern  which are similar to those in previous reports 
there can be no assurance that bll will be able to fully comply with its provisions 
bll has historically represented less than of the profits of the company 
if we are unable to continue to diversify geographically  our business may be adversely affected if the new york city taxicab industry experiences a sustained economic downturn 
although we have diversified from the new york city area  a significant portion of our taxicab advertising and loan revenue is derived from new york city taxicabs and medallion loans collateralized by new york city taxicab medallions 
an economic downturn in the new york city taxicab industry could lead to an increase in defaults on our medallion loans and may also adversely affect the operation of our taxicab rooftop advertising business 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to sufficiently diversify our operations geographically 
an economic downturn could result in certain of our commercial loan customers experiencing declines in business activities  which could lead to difficulties in their servicing of their loans with us  and increasing the level of delinquencies  defaults  and loan losses in our commercial loan portfolio 
although the company believes the estimates and assumptions used in determining the recorded amounts of net assets and liabilities at december  are reasonable  actual results could differ materially from the estimated amounts recorded in the company s financial statements 
the loss of certain key members of our senior management could adversely affect us 
our success is largely dependent upon the efforts of senior management 
the death  incapacity  or loss of the services of certain of these individuals could have an adverse effect on our operations and financial results 
there can be no assurance that other qualified officers could be hired 
acquisitions may lead to difficulties that could adversely affect our operations 
by their nature  corporate acquisitions entail certain risks  including those relating to undisclosed liabilities  the entry into new markets  operational  and personnel matters 
we may have difficulty integrating acquired operations or managing problems due to sudden increases in the size of our loan portfolio 
in such instances  we might be required to modify our operating systems and procedures  hire additional staff  obtain and integrate new equipment  and complete other tasks appropriate for the assimilation of new business activities 
there can be no assurance that we would be successful  if and when necessary  in minimizing these inherent risks or in establishing systems and procedures which will enable us to effectively achieve our desired results in respect of any future acquisitions 
competition from entities with greater resources and less regulatory restrictions may decrease our profitability 
we compete with banks  credit unions  and other finance companies  some of which are sbics  in the origination of taxicab medallion loans and commercial loans 
many of these competitors have greater resources than the company and certain competitors are subject to less restrictive regulations than the company 
as a result  there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to identify and complete financing transactions that will permit us to continue to compete successfully 
our taxicab rooftop advertising business competes with other taxicab rooftop advertisers as well as with all segments of the out of home advertising industry 
we also compete with other types of advertising media  including cable and network television  radio  newspapers  magazines  billboards and other forms of outdoor advertising and direct mail marketing 
certain of these competitors have also entered into the taxicab rooftop advertising business 
many of these competitors have greater financial resources than the company and offer multiple types of advertising as well as production facilities 
there can be no assurance that we will continue to compete with these businesses successfully 
the valuation of our loan portfolio is subjective and we may not be able to recover our estimated value in the event of a foreclosure or sale of a substantial portion of portfolio loans 
under the act  our loan portfolio must be recorded at fair value or marked to market 
unlike other lending institutions  we are not permitted to establish reserves for loan losses 
instead  the valuation of our investment portfolio is adjusted quarterly to reflect our estimate of the current realizable value of our loan portfolio 
since no ready market exists for this portfolio  fair value is subject to the good faith determination of our management and the approval of our board of directors 
because of the subjectivity of these estimates  there can be no assurance that in the event of a foreclosure or the sale of portfolio loans we would be able to recover the amounts reflected on our balance sheet 
if liquidity constraints required the sale of a substantial portion of the portfolio  such an action may require the sale of certain assets at amounts less than their carrying amounts 
in determining the value of our portfolio  management and the board of directors may take into consideration various factors such as the financial condition of the borrower and the adequacy of the collateral 
for example  in a period of sustained increases in market interest rates  management and the board of directors could decrease its valuation of the portfolio if the portfolio consists primarily of fixed rate loans 
our valuation procedures are designed to generate values which approximate the value that would have been established by market forces and are therefore subject to uncertainties and variations from reported results 
considering these factors  we have determined that the fair value of our portfolio is below its cost basis 
at december   our net unrealized depreciation on investments was approximately  or of our net investment portfolio 
based upon current market conditions and current loan to value ratios  management believes  and our board of directors concurs  that the net unrealized depreciation on investments is adequate to reflect the fair value of the portfolio 
changes in taxicab industry regulations that result in the issuance of additional medallions could lead to a decrease in the value of our medallion loan collateral 
every city in which we originate medallion loans  and most other major cities in the us  limits the supply of taxicab medallions 
this regulation results in supply restrictions that support the value of medallions 
actions that loosen these restrictions and result in the issuance of additional medallions into a market could decrease the value of medallions in that market 
if this were to occur  the value of the collateral securing our then outstanding medallion loans in that market could be adversely affected 
there has been discussion that new york city may increase the number of medallions by as many as  auctioned over a three year period beginning in  preceded by a fare hike 
although there can no be no assurances  our experience in past auctions has been that medallion values held or appreciated 
we are unable to forecast with any degree of certainty whether any other potential increases in the supply of medallions will occur 
in new york city  chicago  boston  and in other markets where we originate medallion loans  taxicab fares are generally set by government agencies 
expenses associated with operating taxicabs are largely unregulated 
as a result  the ability of taxicab operators to recoup increases in expenses is limited in the short term 
escalating expenses can render taxicab operations less profitable  and could cause borrowers to default on loans from the company  and could potentially adversely affect the value of the company s collateral 
a significant portion of our taxicab advertising and loan revenue is derived from loans collateralized by new york city taxicab medallions 
according to new york city taxi and limousine commission data  over the past years new york city taxicab medallions have appreciated in value an average of each year 
however  for sustained periods during that time  taxicab medallions have declined in value 
during  the value of new york city taxicab medallions increased by approximately for individual medallions and for corporate medallions 
our failure to re establish our ric status in and beyond could lead to a substantial reduction in the amount of income distributed to our shareholders 
in  changes were enacted to the federal tax laws which  among other things  significantly reduced the tax rate on dividends paid to shareholders from a corporation s previously taxed income 
assuming we qualify as a ric for or subsequent taxable years  we are unable to predict the effect of such changes upon our common stock 
as noted above  we did not qualify as a ric in  and expect to not elect ric status in in order to take advantage of corporate net operating loss carryforwards  although we expect that we would meet all ric qualification tests 
if we do not file as a ric for more than two consecutive years  and then seek to requalify and elect ric status  we would be required to recognize gain to the extent of any unrealized appreciation on our assets unless we make a special election to pay corporate level tax on any such unrealized appreciation recognized during the succeeding year period 
absent such special election  any gain we recognize would be deemed distributed to our stockholders as a taxable distribution 
prior to  we along with some of our subsidiaries elected to be treated as rics under the code 
as rics  we generally were not subject to federal income tax on investment company taxable income which includes  among other things  dividends and interest reduced by deductible expenses distributed to our shareholders 
if we or those of our subsidiaries that were also rics fail to qualify or elect to not be treated as rics in or beyond  our respective income would become fully taxable and a substantial reduction in the amount of income available for distribution to us and to our shareholders could result 
to qualify as a ric  we must meet certain income  distribution  and diversification requirements 
however  because we use leverage  we are subject to certain asset coverage ratio requirements set forth in the act 
these asset coverage requirements could  under certain circumstances  prohibit us from making distributions that are necessary to maintain our ric status or require that we reduce our leverage 
in addition  the asset coverage and distribution requirements impose significant cash flow management restrictions on us and limit our ability to retain earnings to cover periods of loss  provide for future growth and pay for extraordinary items 
certain of our loans  including the medallion collateral appreciation participation loans  could also be re characterized in a manner that would generate non qualifying income for purposes of the ric rules 
in this event  if such income exceeds the amount permissible  we could fail to satisfy the requirement that a ric derive at least of its gross income from qualifying sources  with the result that we would not meet the requirements of subchapter m for qualification as a ric 
qualification as a ric is made on an annual basis and  although we and some of our subsidiaries qualified as regulated investment companies in the past  no assurance can be given that each will qualify for such treatment in and beyond 
failure to qualify as a ric would subject us to tax on our income and could have material adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations 
our sbic subsidiaries may be unable to meet the investment company requirements  which could result in the imposition of an entity level tax 
the sbia regulates some of our subsidiaries 
the sbia restricts distributions by a sbic 
our sbic subsidiaries that are also rics could be prohibited by sba regulations from making the distributions necessary to qualify as a ric 
each year  in order to comply with the sba regulations and the ric distribution requirements  we must request and receive a waiver of the sba s restrictions 
while the current policy of the sba s office of sbic operations is to grant such waivers if the sbic makes certain offsetting adjustments to its paid in capital and surplus accounts  there can be no assurance that this will continue to be the sba s policy or that our subsidiaries will have adequate capital to make the required adjustments 
if our subsidiaries are unable to obtain a waiver  compliance with the sba regulations may result in loss of ric status and a consequent imposition of an entity level tax 
the internal revenue code s diversification requirements may limit our ability to expand our taxicab rooftop advertising business and our medallion collateral appreciation participation loan business 
we intend to continue to pursue an expansion strategy in our taxicab rooftop advertising business 
we believe that there are growth opportunities in this market 
however  the asset diversification requirements for rics could restrict such expansion 
these requirements provide that to qualify as a ric  not more than of the value of our total assets may be invested in the securities other than us government securities or securities of other rics of any one issuer 
while our investments in ric subsidiaries are not subject to this diversification test so long as these subsidiaries qualify as rics  our investments in media and mb would be subject to this test should we elect to qualify as a ric in the future 
at the time of our original investment  media represented approximately of our total assets  which is in compliance with the diversification test 
assuming we had maintained our ric status  the subsequent growth in the value of media by itself would not re trigger the test even if media represented in excess of of our assets 
however  under the ric rules  the test would have to be reapplied in the event that we made a subsequent investment in media  loaned to it or acquired another taxicab rooftop advertising business 
the application of this assets valuation rule to us and our investment in media in light of our loss of ric status in and is unclear  although compelling arguments can be made that it should continue to apply if we re qualify as a ric in the future 
provided that it does apply  it will be important that we take actions to satisfy the diversification requirement in order to maintain our ric status during those years 
as a result  maintenance of ric status in the future could limit our ability to expand our taxicab rooftop advertising business 
it will be our policy to expand our advertising business through internally generated growth 
we expect to consider an acquisition in this area only if we will be able to meet ric diversification requirements 
additionally the company s investment in mb  while representing only of the company s total assets at december   currently falls well within the guidelines of the test described above 
however  as an anticipated future growth vehicle of the company  the investment in mb will need to be monitored for continued compliance with the test 
the fair value of the collateral appreciation participation loan portfolio at december  was  which represented of the total investment portfolio  and the owned medallion portion was  or of total assets 
we will continue to monitor the levels of these asset types in conjunction with the diversification tests  assuming we re qualify for ric status 
our past use of arthur andersen llp as our independent auditors may pose risks to us and also limit your ability to seek potential recoveries from them related to their work 
effective july   the company dismissed its independent auditors  arthur andersen llp andersen  in view of recent developments involving andersen  and engaged pricewaterhousecoopers llp to serve as the company s independent public accountants and to audit the financial statements for the years ended december  and as a public company  we are required to file periodic financial statements with the sec that have been audited or reviewed by an independent accountant 
as our former independent auditors  andersen provided a report on our consolidated financial statements as of and for each of the five fiscal years in the period ended december  sec rules require us to obtain andersen s consent to the inclusion of its audit report in our public filings 
however  andersen was indicted and found guilty of federal obstruction of justice charges  and has informed the company that it is no longer able to provide such consent as a result of the departure from andersen of the former partner and manager responsible for the audit report 
under these circumstances  rule a under the securities act of  as amended  permits the company to incorporate the audit report and the audited financial statements without obtaining the consent of andersen 
the sec has recently provided regulatory relief designed to allow public companies to dispense with the requirement that they file a consent of andersen in certain circumstances 
notwithstanding this relief  the inability of andersen to provide either its consent or customary assurance services to us now and in the future could negatively affect our ability to  among other things  access the public capital markets 
any delay or inability to access the public markets as a result of this situation could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
we depend on cash flow from our subsidiaries to make dividend payments and other distributions to our shareholders 
we are primarily a holding company  and we derive most of our operating income and cash flow from our subsidiaries 
as a result  we rely heavily upon distributions from our subsidiaries to generate the funds necessary to make dividend payments and other distributions to our shareholders 
funds are provided to us by our subsidiaries through dividends and payments on intercompany indebtedness  but there can be no assurance that our subsidiaries will be in a position to continue to make these dividend or debt payments 
we operate in a highly regulated environment 
we are regulated by the sec  the sba  and the fdic  and the utah department of financial institutions 
in addition  changes in the laws or regulations that govern bdcs  rics  sbics  or banks may significantly affect our business 
laws and regulations may be changed from time to time  and the interpretations of the relevant laws and regulations also are subject to change 
any change in the laws or regulations that govern our business could have a material impact on our operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s business activities contain elements of risk 
the company considers the principal types of risk to be fluctuations in interest rates and portfolio valuations 
the company considers the management of risk essential to conducting its businesses 
accordingly  the company s risk management systems and procedures are designed to identify and analyze the company s risks  to set appropriate policies and limits and to continually monitor these risks and limits by means of reliable administrative and information systems and other policies and programs 
the company values its portfolio at fair value as determined in good faith by management and approved by the board of directors in accordance with the company s valuation policy 
unlike certain lending institutions  the company is not permitted to establish reserves for loan losses 
instead  the company must value each individual investment and portfolio loan on a quarterly basis 
the company records unrealized depreciation on investments and loans when it believes that an asset has been impaired and full collection is unlikely 
the company records unrealized appreciation on equities if it has a clear indication that the underlying portfolio company has appreciated in value and  therefore  the company s security has also appreciated in value 
without a readily ascertainable market value  the estimated value of the company s portfolio of investments and loans may differ significantly from the values that would be placed on the portfolio if there existed a ready market for the investments 
the company adjusts the valuation of the portfolio quarterly to reflect management s estimate of the current fair value of each investment in the portfolio 
any changes in estimated fair value are recorded in the company s statement of operations as net unrealized appreciation depreciation on investments 
the company s investment in media  as a wholly owned portfolio investment company  is also subject to quarterly assessments of its fair value 
the company uses media s actual results of operations as the best estimate of changes in fair value  and records the result as a component of unrealized appreciation depreciation on investments 
in addition  the illiquidity of our loan portfolio and investments may adversely affect our ability to dispose of loans at times when it may be advantageous for us to liquidate such portfolio or investments 
in addition  if we were required to liquidate some or all of the investments in the portfolio  the proceeds of such liquidation may be significantly less than the current value of such investments 
because we borrow money to make loans and investments  our net operating income is dependent upon the difference between the rate at which we borrow funds and the rate at which we invest these funds 
as a result  there can be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our interest income 
in periods of sharply rising interest rates  our cost of funds would increase  which would reduce our net operating income before net realized and unrealized gains 
we use a combination of long term and short term borrowings and equity capital to finance our investing activities 
our long term fixed rate investments are financed primarily with short term floating rate debt  and to a lesser extent with long term fixed rate debt 
we may use interest rate risk management techniques in an effort to limit our exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
such techniques may include various interest rate hedging activities to the extent permitted by the act 
the company has analyzed the potential impact of changes in interest rates on interest income net of interest expense 
assuming that the balance sheet were to remain constant and no actions were taken to alter the existing interest rate sensitivity  a hypothetical immediate change in interest rates would have affected net increase decrease in assets at december   by approximately  on an annualized basis  compared to  and  for and although management believes that this measure is indicative of the company s sensitivity to interest rate changes  it does not adjust for potential changes in credit quality  size and composition of the assets on the balance sheet  and other business developments that could affect net increase decrease in assets in a particular quarter or for the year taken as a whole 
accordingly  no assurances can be given that actual results would not differ materially from the potential outcome simulated by this estimate
