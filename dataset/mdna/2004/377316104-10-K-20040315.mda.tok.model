refer to item business for additional information 
our industry has been adversely impacted by an imbalance between supply and demand for certain of our products 
in this environment during  we experienced declining sales volumes and lower average selling prices primarily in our more commodity like products offered by our printing converting papers business unit 
a number of events occurred that impacted our results of operations and financial condition in  including we experienced difficult market conditions in our printing converting papers business unit  resulting in a decline in revenue of million  or we increased unit volumes in engineered products by and in long fiber overlay papers by 
during  the us dollar weakened by approximately compared to the euro 
this favorably impacted translated results of operations by approximately million in the benefit reported from non cash pension income declined by million in compared to we initiated the neenah restructuring  which included permanently shutting down certain equipment and processes  and eliminating approximately positions 
these actions resulted in pre tax charges totaling million in glatfelter 
table of contents we recorded an million pre tax charge relating to our former ecusta division 
of this amount  million was to fully reserve for receivables due from parties that purchased ecusta from us 
the remaining million is for contingent landfill closure costs 
we completed a million investment in a new  state of the art  inclined wire papermaking machine in gernsbach  germany to support growth initiatives in long fiber overlay papers 
we entered into a consent decree with certain governmental agencies that requires us to contribute a total of million to fund the clean up of contamination of the lower fox river near our neenah facility 
our board of directors declared  effective in the third quarter of  a per common share cash dividend  or lower than previous amounts

results of operations versus the following table sets forth summarized results of operations year ended december in thousands net sales gross profit operating income income from continuing operations net loss from discontinued operations net income earnings per diluted share from continuing operations earnings per diluted share the consolidated results of operations for the years ended december  and include the following significant items in thousands  except per share after tax eps income loss gain on sale of timberlands restructuring related charges ecusta related reserves asset write downs escrow settlement restructuring charges environmental matters the above items increased earnings from continuing operations by million  or per diluted share in  and decreased earnings from continuing operations in by million  or per share 
the decline in earnings was primarily due to lower sales volumes and selling prices in the printing converting papers business unit and higher costs of products sold  primarily due to lower non cash pension income  higher raw material prices  and increased market related down time 
business units we manage our organization along separate business units engineered products  long fiber overlay papers and printing converting papers  as well as tobacco papers  which are sold pursuant to a supply agreement that expires in mid in the latter part of  we completed the implementation of a new information system to provide  among other things  more complete business unit reporting

there is no comprehensive  authoritative body of guidance for management accounting equivalent to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  therefore  the financial results of individual business units are not necessarily comparable with similar information for any other company 
the management accounting process uses assumptions and allocations to measure performance of the business units 
methodologies are refined from time to time as management accounting practices are enhanced and businesses change 
costs to produce products sold are allocated to the respective business unit based on standard costs and a proportion of manufacturing variances 
the costs incurred by support areas not directly aligned with the business unit are allocated primarily based on an estimated utilization of support area services 
management evaluates results of operations before energy sales  non cash pension income  restructuring related charges  unusual items and effects of asset dispositions because it believes this is a more meaningful representation of the operating performance of its core papermaking businesses  the profitability of business units and the extent of cash flow generated from core operations 
this presentation is closely aligned with the management and operating structure of our company 
it is also on this basis that company s performance is evaluated internally and by our board of directors 
sales and costs of products sold year ended december in thousands change net sales energy sales net total revenues cost of products sold gross profit gross margin as a percent of net sales the decline in net sales was primarily due to a million net sales volume related decline as lower volumes in our printing converting papers and tobacco papers more than offset sales volume growth in our engineered products and long fiber overlay papers business units 
in addition each business unit experienced lower average selling prices  in constant currency rates  aggregating million 
the impact of lower sales volumes and selling prices was partially offset by a million favorable effect of a weaker us dollar on translated international results

the market price of natural gas is a significant component of our neenah facility s production costs as the cost of the facility s steam is dependent on natural gas market prices 
during we experienced increases in natural gas market prices 
based on expected production levels and contractual obligations  a per decatherm increase in the cost of natural gas is expected to increase the cost of operating our neenah facility by approximately million per year 
thus far in  natural gas market prices appear to have stabilized and we expect the price to decline moderately compared with the levels during non cash pension income non cash pension income results from the considerably over funded status of our plans 
the amount of pension income recognized each year is determined using various actuarial assumptions and certain other factors  including the fair value of our pension assets as of the beginning of the year 
because the value of our plan assets as of january   was lower than the previous year and due to changes in actuarial assumptions  the amount of non cash pension income recognized in was less than the following summarizes non cash pension income for each year

the remaining increase was primarily due to a lower benefit from non cash pension income and higher depreciation  primarily attributable to an information technology system implemented in the latter part of restructuring charge in september  we announced the decision to permanently shut down a paper making machine and the deinking process at our neenah  wi facility 
the abandoned machines and processes had been primarily supporting our printing converting papers business unit 
the neenah restructuring was initiated to allow us to reallocate resources to more fully support opportunities in higher growth  more profitable specialty markets 
these initiatives will result in the elimination of approximately positions and is expected to be completed by march  the results of operations include related pre tax charges of approximately million  of which million are reflected in the consolidated income statements as components of costs of products sold  and million are reflected as restructuring charges

the increase in cost of products sold is primarily due to the increase in net sales volume

these strategic timberland sales are designed to monetize the underlying value of certain assets 
environmental matters we are subject to loss contingencies resulting from regulation by various federal  state  local and foreign governmental authorities with respect to the environmental impact of mills we operate  or have operated 
to comply with environmental laws and regulations  we have incurred substantial capital and operating expenditures in past years 
we anticipate that environmental regulation of our operations will continue to become more burdensome and that capital and operating expenditures necessary to comply with environmental regulations will continue  and perhaps increase  in the future 
in addition  we may incur obligations to remove or mitigate any adverse effects on the environment resulting from our operations  including the restoration of natural resources and liability for personal injury and for damages to property and natural resources 
because environmental regulations are not consistent worldwide  our ability to compete in the world marketplace may be adversely affected by capital and operating expenditures required for environmental compliance
