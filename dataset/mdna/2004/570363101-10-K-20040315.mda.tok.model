item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview maritrans serves the petroleum and petroleum product distribution industry by using tank barges  tugboats and oil tankers to provide marine transportation services primarily along the gulf and atlantic coasts of the united states 
between and  the company has transported at least million barrels annually  with a high of million barrels in and a low of million barrels in the company sold vessels in resulting in a reduction in capacity 
in and  the company has transported million and million barrels  respectively 
many factors affect the number of barrels transported and may affect future results for the company 
such factors include the company s vessel and fleet size and average trip lengths  the continuation of federal law restricting united states point to point maritime shipping to us vessels the jones act  domestic oil consumption  environmental laws and regulations  oil companies decisions as to the type and origination point of the crude that it processes  changes in the amount of imported petroleum products  competition  labor and training costs and liability insurance costs 
overall us oil consumption during fluctuated between million and million barrels a day 
maritrans has successfully rebuilt four of its existing  single hulled  barges to a double hull design configuration  which complies with the provisions of the opa see table in legislation under item 
the company intends to apply the same methodology to all of its remaining single hull barges 
the timing of the rebuilds will be determined by a number of factors  including market conditions  shipyard pricing and availability  customer requirements and opa retirement dates for the vessels 
the opa retirement dates fall between and each of the company s superbarges represent approximately to percent of the total fleet capacity  which will be removed from revenue generating service during the rebuilding of that vessel 
results of operations time charter equivalent tce is a commonly used industry measure where direct voyage costs are deducted from revenue 
maritrans enters into various types of charters  some of which involve the customer paying substantially all voyage costs  while other types of charters involve maritrans paying some or substantially all of the voyage costs 
the company s management believes that the presentation of tce revenue provides useful information regarding the company s financial condition and results of operations because tce revenue essentially nets the voyage costs and voyage revenue to yield a measure that is comparable between periods regardless of the types of contracts utilized 
these voyage costs are included in the operations expense line item on the consolidated statements of income 
the company began reporting on the tce basis in the first quarter of tce revenue is a non gaap financial measure and a reconciliation of tce revenue to revenue  the most directly comparable gaap measure  is set forth below 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  revenues tce revenue for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  is as follows voyage revenue   voyage costs   time charter equivalent   vessel utilization available days   revenue days   tce revenue increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   an increase of million or percent primarily due to an increase in vessel utilization 
the increase in utilization had a positive impact on voyage revenue and resulted from fewer vessels out of service for maintenance and double hull rebuilding in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  in the second quarter of  the maritrans was taken out of service for her double hull rebuild and returned to service in november the ocean states was taken out of service early in september for her double hull rebuild and is expected to return to service in the second quarter of barrels of cargo transported increased from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december  the majority of the company s fleet was deployed in contract business in with limited exposure to the jones act spot market 
demand for the company s services in its contract business during the current year increased compared to due to high refinery margins experienced by the philadelphia area refineries in  the need to supply mtbe inventories to the northeastern us and added demand for gasoline additives on the west coast in the second and third quarters of in the fourth quarter of  demand for the company s services was similar to reflecting comparable market characteristics 
the company had limited exposure to the spot market in spot market rates were higher than in driven primarily by the impact of world and oil industry events early in the year on clean product inventory levels throughout the us these events  including the war with iraq  the oil industry strike in venezuela  seasonal us gulf refinery maintenance and increased distillate demand caused by the cold first quarter in the northeastern us  increased the demand for jones act vessels through the first three quarters of in order to re supply the depleted clean product inventories  and to handle the added demand for gasoline additives in the west coast caused by the ban of mtbe in gasoline 
in the fourth quarter of  the spot market characteristics were similar to those in refined product imports  particularly from europe  continued to have a dampening effect on demand for jones act transportation of refined products into the eastern us in in  other than the scheduled double hull rebuilding  the company expects to experience out of service time consistent with levels for scheduled maintenance and may have more exposure to the spot market if all expiring contracts are not renewed 
utilization is expected to be at levels due to the out of service time of the double hull rebuilds 
volumes of cargo transported in the northeast are expected to decrease in as a result of cyclical dredging at customer refining facilities in early which will result in a reduced demand for the company s services 
the company believes its contract rates will be similar to late in the fourth quarter of several design issues were identified in three of the double hull rebuilt  barrel class barges that led the company to remove these vessels from service and further inspect and re analyze the original rebuild designs 
working with industry experts and the american bureau of shipping  the company identified structural enhancements that will improve the long term strength of these three barges 
the company has acted in the first quarter of to make these repairs and enhancements  and as a result will experience out of service time that will lower first quarter results

she re entered service in the first quarter of term contract rates renewed with customers in were renewed at higher levels than those experienced in on long term contracts 
the increase in these rates resulted from a more stable supply demand relationship in the jones act trade 
these rate increases had a positive impact on revenue and helped to offset the weak spot market 
spot market rates were significantly lower in than in as a result of the following factors 
warm weather in the early part of in the northeast reduced the demand for heating oil resulting in excess distillate inventory through most of the year 
the cold weather in the northeast in the fourth quarter of increased heating oil demand  but that demand was met mostly by the high inventories and imports from europe 
saw a continued reduction in the demand for jet fuel  which began with the terrorist attack of september th and continued throughout the year 
gasoline demand remained high throughout this demand was met primarily from increased imports from europe as their sluggish economy reduced their internal demand 
refined product imports typically reduce demand for the company s services by diminishing the need for us gulf refineries to supply product to the atlantic coast 
barrels of cargo transported decreased from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december   due to decreases in demand and utilization as discussed above 
operations expense voyage costs decreased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   a decrease of million or percent 
the primary decrease in voyage costs was in fuel costs  which resulted from the downturn in the economy in the later part of and continued in the average price per gallon of fuel decreased approximately percent in compared to operations expense  excluding voyage costs discussed above  increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   an increase of million or percent

maintenance expense maintenance expenses increased million or percent from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  routine maintenance expenses incurred during voyages and in port declined million in compared to expenditure levels for maintenance incurred in shipyards increased million in this reflects efforts being made to meet increased regulatory and customer vetting requirements and rising shipyard costs 
in the second half of the company increased its shipyard accrual rate to reflect the expected rise in costs resulting from the above mentioned requirements  which increases the scope and frequency of maintenance performed in the shipyard and results in increased costs
