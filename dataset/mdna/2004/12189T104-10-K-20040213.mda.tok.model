government regulation and legislation rail operations are subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the surface transportation board stb of the united states department of transportation dot  the federal railroad administration of dot  the occupational safety and health administration osha as well as state regulatory agencies 
the stb has jurisdiction over disputes and complaints involving certain rates  routes and services  the sale or abandonment of rail lines  applications for line extensions and construction  and consolidation or merger with  or acquisition of control of  rail common carriers 
the outcome of stb proceedings can affect the costs and profitability of bnsf s business 

table of contents 
index to financial statements dot and osha have jurisdiction under several federal statutes over a number of safety and health aspects of rail operations 
state agencies regulate some aspects of rail operations with respect to health and safety in areas not otherwise preempted by federal law 
bnsf railway s rail operations  as well as those of its competitors  are subject to extensive federal  state and local environmental regulation 
these laws cover discharges to water  air emissions  toxic substances  and the generation  handling  storage  transportation and disposal of waste and hazardous materials 
this regulation has the effect of increasing the cost and liabilities associated with rail operations 
environmental risks are also inherent in rail operations  which frequently involve transporting chemicals and other hazardous materials 
many of bnsf railway s land holdings are and have been used for industrial or transportation related purposes or leased to commercial or industrial companies whose activities may have resulted in discharges onto the property 
as a result  bnsf railway is now subject and will from time to time continue to be subject to environmental cleanup and enforcement actions 
in particular  the federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla  also known as the superfund law  generally imposes joint and several liability for cleanup and enforcement costs  without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct  on current and former owners and operators of a site 
accordingly  bnsf railway may be responsible under cercla and other federal and state statutes for all or part of the costs to cleanup sites at which certain substances may have been released by bnsf railway  its current lessees  former owners or lessees of properties  or other third parties 
further discussion is incorporated by reference from note to the consolidated financial statements 
competition the business environment in which bnsf railway operates remains highly competitive 
depending on the specific market  deregulated motor carriers  other railroads and river barges may exert pressure on price and service levels 
the presence of advanced  high service truck lines with expedited delivery  subsidized infrastructure and minimal empty mileage continues to affect the market for non bulk  time sensitive freight 
the potential expansion of longer combination vehicles could further encroach upon markets traditionally served by railroads 
in order to remain competitive  bnsf railway and other railroads continue to develop and implement operating efficiencies to improve productivity 
as railroads streamline  rationalize and otherwise enhance their franchises  competition among rail carriers intensifies 
bnsf railway s primary rail competitor in the western region of the united states is the union pacific railroad company up 
other class i railroads and numerous regional railroads and motor carriers also operate in parts of the same territories served by bnsf railway 
based on weekly reporting to the association of american railroads  in  bnsf s share of the western united states rail traffic was approximately percent

v 
burlington northern santa fe corporation and the burlington northern and santa fe railway company  no 
district court of tarrant county  texas  th judicial district is a state court action filed on october  the plaintiffs causes of action include alleged breach of contract  negligence  and breach of fiduciary duties with respect to a special dividend that was paid in by a burlington northern santa fe corporation bnsf predecessor  santa fe southern pacific corporation sfsp 
the complaint alleges that sfsp erroneously informed shareholders as to the tax treatment of the dividend specifically  the apportionment of the dividend as either a distribution of earnings and profits or a return of capital which allegedly caused some shareholders to overpay their income taxes 
the plaintiffs assert through their expert s report  that sfsp had essentially no accumulated earnings and profits and that the entire dividend distribution should have been treated as a return of capital  rather than the approximately percent that sfsp determined was a return of capital 
bnsf believes these claims lack merit and that it has substantial defenses on both the merits of these claims and the attempted class action  and it is defending these claims vigorously

index to financial statements introduction bnsf railway continues to be one of the primary rail transporters in north america 
based on weekly reporting to the association of american railroads  for  bnsf s share of the western united states rail traffic was approximately percent  a point market share gain compared with the increase in market share was primarily driven by the company s strong growth in intermodal traffic 
strong growth in international and truckload business  along with increased export demand for grain and continued heavy demand for construction and building products enabled bnsf to achieve percent revenue growth in compared with three of bnsf s four business groups experienced year over year revenue growth  however  coal revenues were down slightly 
for  the company anticipates continued revenue growth as both the global and u 
s economies continue to expand 
in  high fuel costs again impacted bnsf s operating income  accounting for half of the percent increase in operating expenses 
bnsf mitigated some of the fuel price increases through the company s fuel hedging program as well as through fuel surcharges added to a majority of bnsf s transportation rates 
each year capital expenditures are a significant use of cash for bnsf 
in  bnsf increased its capital expenditures by approximately million  over the prior year  to approximately billion to purchase  instead of lease  locomotives as well as to advance construction of double track on a portion of bnsf railway s transcontinental route 
the company plans to incur approximately billion in capital expenditures in approximately billion of the total planned capital expenditures will be for maintenance of business activities  primarily consisting of expenditures to maintain bnsf s track  signals  bridges and tunnels

average revenue per car unit decreased percent in to  from  in consumer products revenues of  million for were million  or percent  greater than the increase in consumer products revenue is primarily due to increased volumes in the international  truckload and perishable sectors 
the reduction in average revenue per unit of percent is primarily related to the strong growth in the international sector  which has lower average revenue per unit 
industrial products revenues increased million  or percent  to  million for the revenue increase is primarily due to increased business in steel  taconite  clay and minerals in the construction products sector and increased military  lumber  plywood  particle board and paper traffic in the building products sector  which were somewhat offset by lower plastics traffic 
rate increases along with increased fuel surcharges contributed to a percent increase in average revenue per car 
coal revenues of  million for decreased million  or percent  versus a year ago 
the decrease is primarily a result of lower volumes from the first quarter draw down of utility stockpiles  weaker demand due to milder weather  utility plant shutdowns and the conversion of a utility plant from coal to natural gas 
the average revenue per car grew slightly 
agricultural products revenues of  million for were million  or percent  higher than revenues for this increase is primarily due to more ethanol shipments from plants in the midwest to california and higher shipments of ethanol by products 
increased export shipments of soybeans also contributed to growth 
the average revenue per car was down slightly due to a change in traffic mix partially offset by increased fuel surcharges

additionally  at the time of the merger of burlington northern railroad company and the atchison  topeka and santa fe railway company atsf  the company recorded a decrease in the fair market value of former atsf locomotives 
the decrease was amortized over the remaining useful life of the locomotives and resulted in an annual decrease to depreciation expense 
the amortization period expired at the end of  accordingly  this will cause and future years depreciation expense to increase by approximately million 
in addition  depreciation expense will increase from capital expenditure activity 
equipment rents expenses for of million were million  or percent  higher than primarily due to volume growth partially offset by decreases in intermodal and carload equipment rent expenses 
decreases in intermodal and carload equipment rent expenses are a result of greater use of private trailers and containers  as well as favorable lease renegotiations and short term lease rate incentives

additionally  consumer products revenues includes an automotive revenue contract settlement gain of million 
international increases were driven by favorable trans pacific trade and new contracts 
truckload revenues were up due to strong growth from the company s primary accounts and modal conversion of highway traffic from new and existing shippers 
the reduction in revenue per car unit is related to a decrease in automotive traffic and an increase in international traffic  which primarily moves in containers and unit trains  and due to the lower cost structure  moves at lower rates per unit 
industrial products revenues of  million for were million  or percent  lower than an increase in the chemicals and plastics sector tied to strength in automotive and home construction along with a new contract was more than offset by general softness in the petroleum  building and construction product sectors 
petroleum was down due to higher heating fuel inventories as a result of the mild winter 
building and construction product sectors were down primarily due to weak paper and steel markets 
coal revenues of  million for decreased million  or percent  versus volume was lower than primarily as a result of reduced demand in the first half of caused by mild winter weather 
revenue per car unit decreased as a result of modest price decreases related to the renewal of some contracts and rate adjustment factors in existing contracts that were negative in the first half of the year 
agricultural products revenues of  million for were million  or percent  lower than revenues for primarily due to decreased soybean  wheat and corn exports due to global market conditions 
the decrease in export traffic resulted in lower revenue per unit because of a shorter length of haul 
domestic corn shipments to feedlots were also down from as a result of reduced feedlot demand  high inventory levels remaining from shipments and crop production conditions

critical accounting estimates in the ordinary course of business  the company makes a number of estimates and assumptions related to the reporting of results of operations and financial position in the preparation of its financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
the following discussion addresses the company s most critical accounting estimates 
management has discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates described below with the audit committee of the board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the company s disclosure relating to it in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
legal bnsf and its subsidiaries are parties to a number of legal actions and claims  various governmental proceedings and private civil suits arising in the ordinary course of business  including those related to environmental matters  federal employers liability act claims by bnsf railway employees  other personal injury claims  and disputes and complaints involving certain transportation rates and charges including complaints seeking refunds of prior charges paid for coal transportation and the prescription of future rates for such movements 
some of the legal proceedings include claims for punitive as well as compensatory damages  and a few proceedings purport to be class actions 
while the final outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty  considering among other things the meritorious legal defenses available and liabilities that have been recorded along with applicable insurance  it is the opinion of bnsf s management that none of these items will have a material adverse effect on the results of operations  financial position or liquidity of bnsf 
however  an unexpected adverse resolution of one or more of these items could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations in a particular quarter or fiscal year 
bnsf s most significant claims relate to personal injury and environmental matters 
these claims are discussed in more detail below 

table of contents 
index to financial statements personal injury personal injury claims  including work related injuries to employees  are a significant expense for the railroad industry 
employees of bnsf are compensated for work related injuries according to the provisions of the federal employers liability act fela 
fela s system of requiring the finding of fault  coupled with unscheduled awards and reliance on the jury system  contributed to significant increases in expense in past years 
bnsf has implemented a number of safety programs to reduce the number of personal injuries as well as the associated claims and personal injury expense 
the company recognized personal injury expenses of approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
bnsf made payments for personal injuries of approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
at december  and  the company had recorded liabilities of million and million  respectively  related to personal injury claims 
of these amounts  million and million are included in current liabilities in and  respectively 
bnsf s liabilities for personal injury claims are undiscounted 
critical estimate the company uses a third party actuarial firm that performs actuarial reviews to assist the company in estimating its personal injury claims 
these estimates are based on the covered population  activity levels and trends in the frequency  and the costs of covered injuries 
personal injury liability and ultimate expense projections are estimated using standard actuarial methodologies 
these actuarial method procedures include unasserted claims  except for certain occupational illnesses  which  due to their unpredictability  are accrued on an as reported basis 
the company has not materially changed its methodology for calculating personal injury liabilities in the three years presented 
there are currently no known trends  demands  commitments  events or uncertainties that are reasonably likely to occur and materially affect the methodology or assumptions described above 
environmental the company s operations  as well as those of its competitors  are subject to extensive federal  state and local environmental regulation 
bnsf s operating procedures include practices to protect the environment from the risks inherent in railroad operations  which frequently involve transporting chemicals and other hazardous materials 
additionally  many of bnsf s land holdings are and have been used for industrial or transportation related purposes or leased to commercial or industrial companies whose activities may have resulted in discharges onto the property 
as a result  bnsf is subject to environmental cleanup and enforcement actions 
in particular  the federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of cercla  also known as the superfund law  as well as similar state laws generally impose joint and several liability for cleanup and enforcement costs on current and former owners and operators of a site without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct 
bnsf has been notified that it is a potentially responsible party prp for study and cleanup costs at approximately superfund sites for which investigation and remediation payments are or will be made or are yet to be determined the superfund sites and  in many instances  is one of several prps 
in addition  bnsf may be considered a prp under certain other laws 
accordingly  under cercla and other federal and state statutes  bnsf may be held jointly and severally liable for all environmental costs associated with a particular site 
if there are other prps  bnsf generally participates in the cleanup of these sites through cost sharing agreements with terms that vary from site to site 
costs are typically allocated based on relative volumetric contribution of material  the amount of time the site was owned or operated  and or the portion of the total site owned or operated by each prp 
environmental costs include initial site surveys and environmental studies of potentially contaminated sites as well as costs for remediation and restoration of sites determined to be contaminated 
liabilities for environmental cleanup costs are initially recorded when bnsf s liability for environmental cleanup is both probable and a reasonable estimate of associated costs can be made 
adjustments to initial estimates are recorded as necessary based upon additional information developed in subsequent periods 
bnsf conducts an ongoing environmental contingency analysis  which considers a combination of factors including independent consulting reports  site visits  legal reviews  analysis of the likelihood of participation in and the ability of other prps to pay for cleanup  and historical trend analyses 

table of contents 
index to financial statements environmental related expenses are a significant expense for bnsf and the railroad industry 
bnsf is involved in a number of administrative and judicial proceedings and other mandatory cleanup efforts at approximately sites  including the superfund sites  at which it is participating in the study or cleanup  or both  of alleged environmental contamination 
the company recognized environmental expenses of approximately million  million and million during  and  respectively 
bnsf paid approximately million  million and million during  and  respectively  for mandatory and unasserted claims cleanup efforts  including amounts expended under federal and state voluntary cleanup programs 
bnsf has recorded liabilities for remediation and restoration of all known sites of million at december   compared with million at december  of these amounts  million and million  respectively  are included in current liabilities 
bnsf s environmental liabilities are not discounted 
bnsf anticipates that the majority of the accrued costs at december   will be paid over the next five years and no individual site is considered to be material 
critical estimate liabilities recorded for environmental costs represent bnsf s best estimates for remediation and restoration of these sites and include both asserted and unasserted claims 
unasserted claims are not considered to be a material component of the liability 
although recorded liabilities include bnsf s best estimates of all costs  without reduction for anticipated recoveries from third parties  bnsf s total cleanup costs at these sites cannot be predicted with certainty due to various factors such as the extent of corrective actions that may be required  evolving environmental laws and regulations  advances in environmental technology  the extent of other parties participation in cleanup efforts  developments in ongoing environmental analyses related to sites determined to be contaminated  and developments in environmental surveys and studies of potentially contaminated sites 
as a result  future charges to income for environmental liabilities could have a significant effect on results of operations in a particular quarter or fiscal year as individual site studies and remediation and restoration efforts proceed or as new sites arise 
however  the company believes it is unlikely any identified matters  either individually or in the aggregate  will have a material adverse effect on bnsf s results of operations  financial position or liquidity 
the company has not materially changed its methodology for identifying and calculating environmental liabilities in the three years presented 
there are currently no known trends  demands  commitments  events or uncertainties that are reasonably likely to occur and materially affect the methodology or assumptions described above 
income taxes bnsf is subject to various federal  state and local income taxes in the taxing jurisdictions where the company operates 
bnsf accounts for income taxes by providing for taxes payable or refundable in the current year and for deferred tax assets and liabilities for future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in financial statements or tax returns 
bnsf recorded total income tax expense  including federal  state and other income taxes  of million  million  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
bnsf s consolidated balance sheets reflect million and million of net current deferred tax assets at december  and  respectively 
also included in bnsf s consolidated balance sheets are  million and  million of net non current deferred tax liabilities at december  and  respectively 
classification of deferred tax assets and liabilities as current or non current is determined by the financial statement classification of the asset or liability to which the temporary difference is related 
if a temporary difference is not related to an asset or liability for financial reporting  it is classified according to the expected reversal date of the temporary difference 
valuation allowances are established to reduce deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
bnsf has not recorded a valuation allowance  as it believes that the deferred tax assets will be fully realized in the future 
the federal income tax returns of bnsf s predecessor companies  burlington northern  inc and santa fe pacific corporation are closed through and the business combination date of september  respectively 
bnsf is currently under internal revenue service examination for years through in addition  bnsf and its subsidiaries have various state income tax returns in the process of examination  administrative appeal or litigation 
the company believes that adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that might be assessed for open years through 
table of contents 
index to financial statements critical estimate bnsf makes estimates of the potential liability based on its assessment of all potential tax exposures 
in addition  the company uses factors such as applicable law  current information  and past experience with similar issues to make these judgements 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates that apply to taxable income in the period in which the deferred tax asset or liability is expected to be realized or paid 
changes in the company s estimates regarding the statutory tax rate to be applied to the reversal of deferred tax assets and liabilities could materially affect the effective tax rate 
the company has not materially changed its methodology for calculating income tax expense for the years presented and there are currently no known trends  demands  commitments  events or uncertainties that are reasonably likely to occur and materially affect the methodology or assumptions described above 
pensions and other post employment benefits bnsf sponsors a noncontributory qualified bnsf retirement plan  which covers substantially all non union employees and a nonqualified bnsf supplemental retirement plan  which covers certain officers and other employees 
the benefits under these plans are based on years of credited service and the highest five year average compensation levels 
bnsf s funding policy is to contribute annually not less than the regulatory minimum and not more than the maximum amount deductible for income tax purposes with respect to the funded plan 
certain salaried employees of bnsf that have met age and years of service requirements are eligible for medical benefits and life insurance coverage during retirement 
the retiree medical plan is contributory and provides benefits to retirees  their covered dependents and beneficiaries 
retiree contributions are adjusted annually 
the plan also contains fixed deductibles  coinsurance and out of pocket limitations 
the basic life insurance plan is noncontributory and covers retirees only 
optional life insurance coverage is available for some retirees  however  the retiree is responsible for the full cost 
bnsf s policy is to fund benefits payable under the medical and life insurance plans as they come due 
employees beginning salaried employment with bnsf subsequent to september   are not eligible for medical benefits during retirement 
the company expects to record a net pension cost of approximately million in as opposed to net pension benefits of million and million recorded in and  respectively 
in addition  the company recorded a net pension cost of million in at december  and  the company reported pension benefit obligations of  million and  million  respectively 
the company recorded a net other post employment benefits opeb cost of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
at december  and the company reported opeb obligations of million and million  respectively 
critical estimate annual pension and opeb expenses are calculated by third party actuaries using standard actuarial methodologies 
the actuaries assist the company in making estimates based on historical information  current information and estimates about future events and circumstances 
significant assumptions used in the valuation of pension and opeb include expected return on plan assets  discount rate  rate of increase in compensation levels and the health care cost trend rate 
these assumptions are critical to the company s estimate of expenses and liabilities  and changes to these estimates could have a material impact on the company s results of operations and financial position 
the discount rate is a component estimate of both pensions and opeb 
the expected return on plan assets is a factor that only influences the funded pension plans 
health care cost trend rates only affect opeb costs 
bnsf uses a discount rate that reflects the current bond market and an expected rate of return on assets that reflects the expected long term rates of return on plan assets 

table of contents 
index to financial statements from time to time  the company will change pension and opeb assumptions to better approximate current conditions and expected future experience 
general softness in the economy and the decline in the investment markets during and prompted bnsf to decrease the rate of return on plan assets used in the net cost calculation from percent in to percent for and the discount rate has also been changed within the past three years 
discount rates of percent  percent and percent were used to calculate net benefit costs for years ending december   and  respectively 
the associated discount rate was lowered to percent for the calculation of net benefit cost 
unforeseen changes in the investment markets or other external factors could prompt changes in these estimates in future years 
a fifty basis point change in the rate of return on plan assets assumption would effect future annual pension expense by approximately million 
depreciation due to the capital intensive nature of the railroad industry  depreciation expense is a significant component of the company s operating expense 
the company recorded depreciation and amortization expense of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
at december  and  the company had property and equipment  net balances of  million and  million  which include  million and  million  respectively  of accumulated depreciation 
critical estimate the company uses the group method of depreciation under which a single depreciation rate is applied to the gross investment in a particular class of property  despite differences in the service life or salvage value of individual property units within the same class 
as required by the federal surface transportation board stb  the company conducts studies of depreciation rates and the required accumulated depreciation balance at least every three years for equipment property and at least every six years for track structure and other roadway property 
the company uses external consultants to conduct these studies 
the consultants rely on statistical analysis  historical retirement data  industry knowledge and discussions with management to assess the impact of new technologies and maintenance practices 
changes in the estimated service lives of the assets and their related depreciation rates are implemented prospectively and the difference between the calculated accumulated depreciation and the amount recorded is amortized over the average service lives of the assets 
a study conducted in resulted in the company adopting new depreciation rates for hardware and software  other road assets and locomotives that resulted in a net decrease in annual depreciation expense of million
