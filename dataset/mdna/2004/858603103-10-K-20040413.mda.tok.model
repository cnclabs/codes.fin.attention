information presented above for the quarters ended march   june  and september  have been restated to reflect the retroactive application of the impairment loss recognized in accordance with the adoption of sfas no 
 effective january  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
results of operations overview net income for the year ended december  was  the highest it has been since additionally  was also encouraging for several other reasons 
net sales for the year ended december  was  as compared to  for the year ended december  this increase ended the trend of a three year decline in net sales 
in connection with the going private transaction  in april the company signed a merger agreement  subject to stockholder approval  with a company formed by the management group interested in taking the company private  in september the company finalized a  working capital loan agreement with merrill lynch to assist in financing the privatization of the company  in november the company filed a preliminary proxy with the securities and exchange commission outlining the basic terms of the going private transaction and three lawsuits the company was involved in were either settled in the company s favor or dismissed 
year ended december  as compared to as indicated above  net sales increased slightly for the year ended december   and as disclosed in our previously filed quarterly reports  sales were favorably impacted by a higher than normal volume of sales of quinsana medicated talc to the military  as a result of the deployment of troops to the middle east 
this factor was instrumental in increasing net sales for the retail segment by almost  it also helped increase the overall gross profit margin of the company because of the favorable impact these sales had on the sales mix 
earnings per share  before the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle  for the year ended december  was  compared to the 
per share achieved for the comparable period in net sales of professional wet goods for the year ended december   declined approximately  however the net sales of hard goods increased approximately  for that same period  leaving the overall professional segment down approximately  from the comparable period in the company continues to seek out reputable and creditworthy distributors for the image and sorbie brands in an effort to increase the exposure of these products to the public  however  the company does not have the marketing budget of more well known and widely distributed brands 
increasing market share for wet goods is more difficult than for hard goods as the company s subsidiaries are more strategically positioned in the hardgoods marketplace 
as a result of the decline in the net sales of wet goods  as described above  net sales of the manufacturing segment also declined 
a small portion of this decline can be attributed to a decline in private label manufacturing  however  management is optimistic that private label manufacturing will increase in  especially after giving consideration to new customer accounts developed in the latter part of gross profit for the year ended december   increased to  from the  achieved in the comparable period of the gross margin in was  compared to in these increases  as indicated above  were due to the more favorable sales mix realized by the company as a result of higher sales of retail products 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  increased substantially over the comparable period in  largely as a result of management bonuses due officers in accordance with their employment contracts 
insurance costs increased over  a significant portion of which is as a result of the increased cost of the directors and officers insurance 
management bonuses were computed based upon the comparison of current year earnings per share to a base year  in accordance with terms of the officers employment contracts  and amounted to  for the year ended december   and was included in administrative expenses 
no bonuses were payable for the year ended december  due to the results achieved in interest income and interest expense both declined during the year ended december   as a result of continued low interest rates 
interest income should decline in if the anticipated going private transaction is consummated and a significant amount of cash is utilized in connection with such transaction 
it is also anticipated that interest expense will decline significantly in since the company will have satisfied its obligation to the colgate palmolive company arising as a result of the acquisition of certain brands 
included in other income was the  royalty payment from color me beautiful  as well as a  settlement in connection with the department of transportation lawsuit 
the provision for income taxes of  provided for in the statement of operations includes state income taxes of approximately  payable to certain states outside of florida where the company is deemed to have business nexus 
in addition  both federal and state income taxes were adversely affected by the non deductibility of certain expenses incurred in connection with the going private transaction and are considered permanent differences 
these items  among others  had the effect of increasing the effective tax rate of the company from to approximately 
since the management bonuses discussed above were not disbursed prior to march   they will not be deductible by the company on its federal income tax return and therefore are considered a temporary difference and will not be deductible until paid in the company has sufficient other temporary differences  primarily amortization  that can be utilized in  as a result it is anticipated that a minimal amount of federal income taxes will currently be payable for the year ended december  the ultimate utilization of any tax deduction and or any net operating loss nol carryforward that the company may have may be limited  however  by the contemplated going private transaction 
year ended december  as compared to net sales for decreased primarily as a result of declines in the revenues from the company s professional and manufacturing business segments 
the decline in net sales for the professional segment was approximately  over the past several years  there has been a consolidation in the distribution network for professional products and this has had an adverse impact on net sales 
the manufacturing segment experienced a decline in sales as a result of a decline in private label production 
the retail segment showed a small sales increase  largely on the strength of an increase in sales of talc products 
in the retail environment  the company is continually faced with demands for up front concessions  such as slotting allowances  from major retailers in order to carry retail products from suppliers like stephan and the company s reluctance to pay all of these charges may inhibit the overall distribution of some items to certain markets or geographic areas 
gross profit decreased  to  in when compared to levels 
this decrease was due to an overall decline in net sales and a continuing change in the overall mix of business 
the morris flamingo stephan and williamsport subsidiaries professional business segment accounted for approximately of consolidated net sales  an increase of over levels 
these two subsidiaries have traditionally had lower gross margins than other entities comprising the professional group 
the company continues to devote efforts to improving the gross profit margins of these two divisions  though they have improved slightly over the retail personal care products operating segment experienced a moderate increase in net sales  with a increase in net sales of the brands acquired from colgate offsetting decreased net sales of other retail brands 
net retail sales in were  as compared to  in by offering quantity discounts  the company was successful in acquiring new customers  but experienced a lower gross margin due to discounts and promotional pricing 
in addition  due to the continued consolidation in the chain drug store industry  the amount of discounting and promotional allowances large retailers demand of their suppliers has increased  which reduces the gross profit margins on brands supplied to those retailers 
the company responded to these discounting pressures in an effort to maintain market share without materially sacrificing our profitability by selectively participating in promotional programs that would benefit both the company and the customer 
management of the company was able to substantially reduce expenses  with selling  general and administrative expenses sg a decreasing in excess of  from  in to  in the company significantly reduced payroll and related costs as well as professional fees 
in addition  the decline in sales resulted in reduced freight and delivery expenses 
the implementation of sfas no 
 with respect to goodwill and trademark amortization  reduced amortization expense which is included in sg a by  in interest expense decreased over  in as a result of a decrease in outstanding debt and lower interest rates  interest income also declined over  due to significantly lower interest rates 
interest income for the year ended december   was  compared to  earned in other income included royalty payments from color me beautiful of  in connection with the marketing of frances denney products  and a royalty fee of  for the temporary licensing of new era products 
income before income taxes and cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle was  an increase over the corresponding period in  as a result of the reasons indicated above  however income before the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle as a result of the application of sfas no 
was  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  this decrease was due to an abnormally high provision for income taxes as a result of a reduction in the realizable value of the company s charitable contribution carryforward 
this valuation allowance caused the effective tax rate for the year ended december  to increase to  as compared to for the prior year  and was taken because it is anticipated that the time limit on the deductibility of the charitable contribution carryforward will expire before it can be utilized 
should taxable income increase in the near future  some of this write down may be recoverable 
net income for the year ended december   was adversely impacted by the write down of goodwill and other intangible assets  an aggregate of approximately million was written off  with a net after tax effect of reducing income by approximately million 
the net loss for the year ended december   after taking into consideration the goodwill and other intangible assets charge  was  basic earnings per share for the year ended december   before the effect of the goodwill and other intangible assets charge was  compared to 
for the year ended december  after giving effect to the adjustment for the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets  the net loss per share was 
the average number of shares outstanding   was the same in and liquidity and capital resources working capital increased  from december   and was approximately  at december  cash and cash equivalents increased to  as compared to  as of december  total cash  including certificates of deposit cds  increased from  at december  to  at december  the company has continued to secure its outstanding long term debt with wachovia bank with all of these cds 
while the cds periodically mature  they are classified as non current and not included in working capital or cash and cash equivalents 
the company does not anticipate any significant capital expenditures in the near term and management believes that there is sufficient cash on hand and working capital to satisfy upcoming requirements  including any funds that may be needed in connection with the going private transaction 
as announced in october  the company secured a  line of credit with merrill lynch business financial services  inc this line of credit will be available for use in the going private transaction  if necessary  and contains certain financial and other related covenants  all of which the company is currently in compliance with 
the company does not have any off balance sheet financing or similar arrangements 
inventory levels continued to decline as management continued to engage its efforts to reduce the overall amount of inventory on hand  both through the use of more effective inventory control techniques  as well as a more thorough phasing out of old  obsolete or slow moving items 
the company has not experienced any material adverse impact from the effects of inflation in the last several years 
management maintains some flexibility to increase prices and does not have any binding contract pricing with either customers or vendors 
many of the company s products  as well as the components used  are petroleum based products  and as a result  the prices for raw materials are and will continue to be subject to oil prices which  in turn  are subject to various political or economic pressures 
the company does not presently foresee any material increase in the costs of raw materials or component costs  and our management believes it has the flexibility of calling upon multiple vendors and the ability to increase prices to offset any price changes

recent events as previously reported  on april   the company announced that the previously formed special committee consisting of two outside directors had accepted a bid by a management led group to purchase all of the shares of common stock of the company not already owned by such group 
the acquisition group s initial bid was to purchase all of the company s common stock at per share in cash  which offer was later revised to per share with to be paid in cash  and to be paid by a month  unsecured debt instrument providing for interest at an annual rate of 
on march   the company announced that the bid was further revised to an all cash price of per share  to more appropriately reflect the updated fairness opinion received from suntrust robinson humphrey 
on september   at no cost to shareholders  the company entered into a working capital management account wcma agreement with merrill lynch business financial services inc providing for the creation of a wcma line of credit not to exceed  borrowings against the line of credit will be collateralized by the company s accounts receivable and inventories and the debt will bear a variable interest rate using a month libor rate plus 
the provisions of the credit line include periodic accounting and reporting requirements  maintenance of certain business and financial ratios as well as restrictions on additional borrowings 
in late and during the special committee received from curtis rudolph  a shareholder of the company  an indication of his interest in acquiring the common stock of the company  however  no offer was forthcoming 
in november  mr 
rudolph initiated an action in florida state court broward county  florida seeking to obtain a review of certain books and records of the company to which he claimed he was entitled as a shareholder of the company 
the company had previously denied him access to those books and records due to his unwillingness to sign a non disclosure agreement relating to the company s non public information in the standard form required of other potential bidders for the company 
in january  pursuant to a settlement agreement with the company  mr 
rudolph agreed to execute the non disclosure agreement 
by letter dated january   mr 
rudolph reiterated his interest in making a proposal to acquire the company 
on or about february   mr 
rudolph submitted an unexecuted proposal to acquire substantially all of the assets and assume certain liabilities of the company 
the special committee rejected this proposal as it was unexecuted  contained certain unacceptable terms  was subject to unacceptable conditions  and was structured as an asset purchase rather than a stock purchase 
in particular  the asset purchase structure presented substantial negative tax consequences to the company and its shareholders and was deemed impractical 
under the circumstances  the special committee determined mr 
rudolph s proposal to not be in the best interests of the company s shareholders 
the board of directors  through its special committee  attempted to negotiate with mr 
rudolph  but no further offer has been forthcoming 
on april   the board of directors approved a definitive merger agreement the merger agreement pursuant to which the company will be acquired by gunhill enterprises  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of eastchester enterprises  inc eastchester enterprises  inc 
is owned by frank f 
ferola  thomas m 
d ambrosio  john depinto and shouky a 
shaheen all of whom are current board members together with their affiliates the acquisition group 
the company entered into the agreement following approval by its board of directors based in part upon the unanimous recommendation of the special committee comprised of non management and disinterested directors of the company s board of directors 
the special committee has received an opinion from suntrust robinson humphrey that the merger consideration to be paid pursuant to the merger agreement is fair from a financial point of view to the stockholders other than the acquisition group 
on october   the company executed an amended and restated merger agreement extending certain dates and making minor changes to the original merger agreement and on november   in connection with the going private transaction  the company filed a preliminary proxy with the securities and exchange commission 
in march  the company executed a further amendment to the merger agreement which  among other things  incorporated the new consideration offered by the acquisition group of per share in cash 
if prior to the closing of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement  as amended  the special committee concludes that its failure to provide information to  or engage in discussions with  third parties who are interested in acquiring the company  would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to stephan s stockholders  then the special committee may thereafter continue to provide information to  and engage in discussions and negotiations with  such interested parties 
under specified circum stances  stephan has the right to terminate the agreement and to enter into an agreement with a party proposing a competing transaction which is deemed superior to the transaction proposed by the acquisition group 
completion of the merger is subject to customary closing conditions  including stockholder approval 
the special committee has agreed to extend the closing date of the transaction to no later than july  as discussed above  the company has secured a  line of credit with merrill lynch unused at december   a portion of which may be used in the going private transaction 
company stockholder approval will be solicited by means of a proxy statement  which will be mailed by the company to stockholders upon completion of the required securities and exchange commission filing and review process 
independent legal counsel and investment banking advisors have been retained to advise the special committee in connection with the transaction 
after incurring approximately  of expenses through december   it is estimated that the remaining costs associated with this process will be approximately  as previously reported  due to the length of time for the going private transaction to be consummated  the company has not submitted any matters to a vote of its security holders since the company s september  annual meeting 
in accordance with the rules and regulations of the american stock exchange amex  the company was required to promptly notify its stockholders and amex  in writing  indicating the reasons for the failure to have a meeting and to use good faith efforts to ensure that an annual meeting is held as soon as reasonably practicable 
the company expects to do this in its proxy materials to be filed in connection the proposed going private transaction 
in addition  the company will include annual meeting materials in its revised proxy statement 
the company believed it was in violation of certain amex rules with respect to the composition of the board of directors and the audit committee which could subject the company to civil penalties and or the delisting of the company s stock 
the company  based upon on going discussions with amex and the company s legal counsel  now believes that none of the aforementioned issues are of a material nature and any penalties  if levied  would not be material to the company s financial position or results of operations 
current trends while net sales were favorably impacted in from the sales of quinsana medicated talc to the military  as previously indicated  sales levels of this product returned to normal after the initial phase of the middle east conflict 
the company is optimistic that new supply and manufacturing agreements for amenities and retail products  executed in with several new customers  will help maintain a level of sales consistent with the prior year 
these sales  however  will be at a lower gross margin and in all likelihood  will adversely impact the gross profit margin of the company 
additionally  it is anticipated that the effect of these new customers will not be felt until the latter part of  and as such  first and second quarter sales for  when compared to  may be significantly lower 
discussion of critical accounting policies the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates if different assumptions were used or different events ultimately transpire 
we believe that the following are the most critical accounting policies that requires management to make difficult  subjective and or complex judgments  often due to a need to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain valuation of accounts receivable the ultimate amount of collections received against outstanding accounts receivable must take into account returns  allowances and deductions that may be made by our customers 
many retailers to whom we sell products take deductions for various forms of marketing expenses  as well as participating in nationwide reclamation cooperatives for processing damaged goods 
other expenses to which we are subject to  in addition to those experienced in the retail environment but also with professional products sold to distributors include deductions for freight if the invoice is paid within specified terms  co op advertising allowances  new store warehouse allowances and  from time to time  limited rebate programs 
we attempt to estimate these costs  as well as providing for anticipated bad debts  by recording allowances based upon our experience  economic conditions  normal customer inventory levels and or competitive conditions 
actual returns  credits or allowances  as well as the condition of any product actually returned  may differ significantly from the estimates used by the company 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost  determined by the first in  first out fifo method  or market 
we periodically evaluate inventory levels  giving consideration to factors such as the physical condition of the goods  the sales patterns of finished goods and the useful life of particular packaging  componentry and finished goods and estimate a reasonable amount to be provided for slow moving  obsolete or damaged inventory 
these estimates could vary significantly  either favorably or unfavorably  from actual requirements based upon future economic conditions  customer inventory levels or competitive factors that were not foreseen or did not exist when the valuation allowances were established 
impairment of long lived assets and goodwill the company periodically evaluates whether events or circumstances have occurred that would indicate that long lived assets may not be recoverable or that the remaining useful life may be impaired 
when such events or circumstances are present  the company assesses the recoverability of long lived assets by determining whether the carrying value will be recovered through the expected future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset 
if the results of this testing indicates an impairment of the carrying value of the asset  an impairment loss equal to the excess of the asset s carrying value over its fair value is recorded 
the long term nature of these assets requires the estimation of its cash inflows and outflows several years into the future and only takes into consideration circumstances known at the time of the impairment test 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets are to be evaluated for impairment on an annual basis  and between annual tests  whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may exceed its fair value 
the use of various acceptable and appropriate methods of valuation requires the use of long term planning forecasts and assumptions regarding industry specific economic conditions that are outside the control of the company 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company does not own or maintain an interest in derivative or other financial instruments for which fair value disclosure would be required under statement of financial accounting standards no 
in addition  the company does not invest in securities that would require disclosure of market risk  nor does it have floating rate loans or foreign currency exchange rate risks 
the company has no interest rate risk on its fixed rate debt since the interest rate on the note payable to a bank resets annually upon the anniversary of the loan august at basis points above the certificate of deposit interest rate that collateralizes the loan
