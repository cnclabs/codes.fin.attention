item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations certain matters discussed or incorporated by reference in this annual report on form k including  but not limited to matters described in this section are forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected 
see item business forward looking statements critical accounting policies general hcc s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the financial information contained within our consolidated financial statements is  to a significant extent  based on approximate measures of the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred 
a variety of factors could affect the ultimate value that is obtained either when earning income  recognizing an expense  recovering an asset or relieving a liability 
in certain instances  we use a discount factor and prepayment assumptions to determine the present value of assets and liabilities 
a change in the discount factor or prepayment spreads could increase or decrease the values of those assets and liabilities which would result in either a beneficial or adverse impact to our financial results 
we use historical loss factors as one factor in determining the inherent loss that may be present in our loan portfolio 
actual losses could differ significantly from the historical factors that we use 
the company applies accounting principles board apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and related interpretations to account for its stock option plan awards 
other estimates that we use are related to the expected useful lives of our depreciable assets 
in addition gaap itself may change from one previously acceptable method to another method 
although the economics of our transactions would be the same  the timing of events that would impact our transactions could change 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is an estimate of the losses that may be sustained in our loan portfolio 
the allowance is based on two basic principles of accounting 
statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for contingencies  which requires that losses be accrued when they are probable of occurring and estimable and sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  which requires that losses be accrued based on the differences between that value of collateral  present value of future cash flows or values that are observable in the secondary market and the loan balance 
the company s allowance for loan losses has three basic components the formula allowance  the specific allowance and the unallocated allowance 
each of these components is determined based upon estimates that can and do change when the actual events occur 
the formula allowance uses an historical loss view as an indicator of future losses and  as a result formula losses could differ from the loss incurred in the future 
the specific allowance uses various techniques to arrive at an estimate of loss 
historical loss information and fair market value of collateral are used to estimate those losses 
the use of these values is inherently subjective and our actual losses could differ from the estimates 
the unallocated allowance captures losses that are attributable to various economic events  industry or geographic sectors whose impact on the portfolio have occurred but have yet to be recognized in either the formula or specific allowances 
for further information regarding our allowance for credit losses  see allowance for probable loan losses on page loan sales and servicing the amounts of gains recorded on sales of loans and the initial recording of servicing assets and interest only strips is based on the estimated fair values of the respective components 
in recording the initial value of the servicing assets and the fair value of the i o strips receivable  the company uses estimates which are made based on management s expectations of future prepayment and discount rates 
for the year ended december   management s estimate of constant prepayment rate cpr was and the weighted average discount rate assumption was 
these prepayment and discount rates were based on current market conditions and historical performance of the various pools 
if actual prepayments with respect to sold loans occur more quickly than projected the carrying value of the servicing assets may have to be adjusted through a charge to earnings 
a corresponding decrease in the value of the i o strip receivable would also be expected 
stock based compensation under apb no 
 compensation cost for stock options is measured as the excess  if any  of the fair market value of the company s stock at the date of the grant over the amount required to be paid to the company by the optionee upon exercising the option 
because the company s stock option plan provides for the issuance of options at a price of no less than the fair market value at the date of the grant  no compensation cost is required to be recognized for the stock option plan on the date of grant

overall the changes in volume contributed  to net interest income while the effect of the changes in rates reduced this contribution by  resulting in the overall increase in from of  the decrease in from was due to reductions in short term interest rates which immediately affected the rates applicable to the majority of the company s loans  however  the company s ability to reprice its interest earning liabilities lagged the repricing of its interest earning assets

the loan loss provision and level of allowance for each period is dependent upon many factors  including loan growth  net charge offs  changes in the composition of the loan portfolio  delinquencies  management s assessment of the quality of the loan portfolio  the valuation of problem loans and the general economic conditions in the company s market area 
periodic fluctuations in the provision for loan losses result from management s assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for probable loan losses  however  actual loan losses may vary from current estimates

the increase in service charges and other fees was primarily from an increase in demand deposit accounts resulting in customers paying additional fees for services 
the increase in equipment leasing was primarily from the leasing of medical and test equipment for eleven months in  as opposed to one month in in december of  the leasing agreement was renegotiated resulting in the reclassification of the lease as a direct financing lease which is included as part of the loan portfolio at december  the increases in service charges and fees were primarily the result of an increase in activity resulting from the growth of the company 
the increases in appreciation of company owned life insurance of  was primarily the result of increases in the cash surrender value of the corporate owned life insurance policies  which provides a funding source for the company s supplemental executive retirement plan 
the above increases were offset by the decrease in gain on sale of securities available for sale of  due to market conditions and the decrease on sale of the credit card portfolio of  sold in the increase in noninterest income in over was primarily due to increased sales of and related gains on sales of sba loans of  an increase in servicing income of  an increase in service charges and other fees of  and increase in brokered fees of  and an increase in gains on sales of securities of  the increased sales of sba loans were attributable to the strategic focus in on increasing sba origination and to take advantage of the favorable market conditions for both the sales of the guaranteed portions of the loans and available for sale securities

in  client services expense decreased  due to a reduction in services fees charged to the company from third party vendors 
the increase of  in other noninterest expenses in compared to was primarily attributable to an increase of  in amortization of the company s investments in low income housing projects and depreciation on leased equipment offset by the decreases of  in retirement plan expense 
in  the increase in occupancy and equipment expenses of  and the increase in professional fees of  was in support of the overall growth of the company  client service expense decreased  due to a reduction in both the level and pricing for certain of these services 
advertising and promotion fees decreased  from as certain advertising and sponsorships were discontinued in provision for income taxes the company files consolidated federal and combined state income tax returns

the provision for income taxes was  for the years ended december  and  and  for the year ended december  the company s effective tax rates were   and for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the effective tax rates are lower than the statutory rate of primarily due to the company s investment in corporate owned life insurance policies whose earnings are not subject to taxes  low income housing tax credits and investments in municipal securities 
financial condition at december   the company s total assets were  up from  at december  the total loan portfolio was  down slightly from  at december   and total deposits were  also down slightly from  at december  the growth in total assets reflects an increase in the investment portfolio which was funded primarily from  in other borrowings

the loan portfolio is primarily composed of commercial loans to companies principally engaged in manufacturing  wholesale and service businesses and real estate lending  with the balance in direct equipment finance leases and consumer loans 
while no specific industry concentration is considered significant  the company s lending operations are located in the company s market areas that are dependent on the technology and real estate industries and their supporting companies 
real estate values in portions of santa clara county and neighboring san mateo county are among the highest in the country at present 
the company s borrowers could be adversely impacted by a downturn in these sectors of the economy which could reduce the demand for loans and adversely impact the borrowers abilities to repay their loans 
the following table presents the company s loans outstanding at year end by loan type december of of of of of dollars in thousands total total total total total commercial    real estate mortgage    real estate land and construction    direct financing lease  consumer    total loans    deferred loan costs fees allowance for loan losses    loans  net    the change in the company s loan portfolio is primarily due to the increase in the commercial and real estate mortgage loan portfolio and in the direct financing lease offset by the normal maturation on the real estate land and construction loans and a decline in consumer loans due to pay offs in installment loans 
the increase in the commercial and real estate mortgage loan portfolios is due to the company s continued expansion and focus on originating these types of loans 
the company s commercial loans are made for working capital  financing the purchase of equipment or for other business purposes 
such loans include loans with maturities ranging from thirty days to one year and term loans  with maturities normally ranging from one to five years 
short term business loans are generally intended to finance current transactions and typically provide for periodic principal payments  with interest payable monthly 
term loans normally provide for floating interest rates  with monthly payments of both principal and interest 
the company is an active participant in the small business administration sba and california guaranteed lending programs  and has been approved by the sba as a lender under the preferred loan program 
the company regularly makes sba guaranteed loans and considers such loans to be investment loans  however  the guaranteed portion of these loans may be sold in the secondary market depending on market conditions and  once it is determined they will be sold  are classified as held for sale and carried at the lower of cost or market 
in the event of the sale of a guaranteed portion sba loan  the company retains the servicing rights for the sold portion 
as of december    and  million  million and million  respectively  in sba loans were serviced by the company for others 
the company s real estate term loans consist primarily of loans made based on the borrower s cash flow and are secured by deeds of trust on commercial and residential property to provide a secondary source of repayment 
it is the company s policy to restrict real estate term loans to no more than of the lower of the property s appraised value or the purchase price of the property  depending on the type of property and its utilization 
the company offers both fixed and floating rate loans 
maturities on such loans are generally restricted to between five and ten years on an amortization ranging from fifteen to twenty five years with a balloon payment due at maturity  however  sba and certain other real estate loans easily sold in the secondary market may be granted for longer maturities 
the company s real estate land and construction loans are primarily interim loans made by the company to finance the construction of commercial and single family residential properties 
these loans are typically short term 
the company utilizes underwriting guidelines to assess the likelihood of repayment from sources such as sale of the property or permanent mortgage financing prior to making the construction loan 
the company s direct financing lease represents a master agreement for lease of electronic testing equipment 
the original agreement was amended in december  which resulted in a reclassification of the lease from equipment under operating leases to a direct financing lease 
the amended agreement is for five years with an option for the borrower to repurchase the equipment beginning in october  the lease has an estimated residual value of  and matures in november the company makes consumer loans for the purpose of financing automobiles  various types of consumer goods  and other personal purposes 
additionally  the company makes equity lines of credit and equity loans available to its clientele 
consumer loans generally provide for the monthly payment of principal and interest 
most of the company s consumer loans are secured by the personal property being purchased  or  in the instances of equity loans or lines  real property 
with certain exceptions  the banks are permitted to make extensions of its credit to any one borrowing entity up to of the banks capital and reserves for unsecured loans and up to of the banks capital and reserves for secured loans 
for hbc these lending limits were million and million at december  the company does not have any concentrations in its loan portfolio by industry or group of industries  however  and of its net loans were secured by real property as of december  and this is attributed the company s continued focus on these types of lending 
the following table presents the maturity distribution of the company s loans as of december  the table shows the distribution of such loans between those loans with predetermined fixed interest rates and those with variable floating interest rates 
floating rates generally fluctuate with changes in the prime rate as reflected in the western edition of the wall street journal 
as of december   approximately of the company s loan portfolio consisted of floating interest rate loans 
over one due in year but one year less than over dollars in thousands or less five years five years total commercial   real estate mortgage    real estate land and construction  direct financing lease  consumer  total loans    loans with variable interest rates   loans with fixed interest rates    total loans    hbc is a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its clients 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit 
those instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk  in excess of the amounts recognized in the balance sheet 
hbc s exposure to credit loss in the event of non performance of the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual notional amount of those instruments 
hbc uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on balance sheet instruments 
credit risk is the possibility that a loss may occur because a party to a transaction failed to perform according to the terms of the contract 
hbc controls the credit risk of these transactions through credit approvals  limits  and monitoring procedures 
management does not anticipate any significant losses as a result of these transactions 
commitments to extend credit as of december  were as follows dollars in thousands commitments to extend credit   standby letters of credit   commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a client as long as there is no violation of conditions established in the contract 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses 
since some of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
hbc evaluates each client s creditworthiness on a case by case basis 
the amount of collateral obtained  if deemed necessary by hbc upon extension of credit  is based on management s credit evaluation of the borrower 
collateral held varies but may include cash  marketable securities  accounts receivable  inventory  property  plant and equipment  income producing commercial properties  and or residential properties 
fair value of these instruments is not material 
standby letters of credit are written conditional commitments issued by hbc to guaranty the performance of a client to a third party 
the premiums received of  on the outstanding standby letters of credit are deferred until the guarantee is utilized or expires 
the credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to clients 
nonperforming assets nonperforming assets consist of nonaccrual loans  loans past due days and still accruing  troubled debt restructurings and other real estate owned 
management generally places loans on nonaccrual status when they become days past due  unless they are well secured and in the process of collection 
when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status  any interest previously accrued but not collected is generally reversed from income 
loans are charged off when management determines that collection has become unlikely 
restructured loans are those where hbc have granted a concession on the interest paid or original repayment terms due to financial difficulties of the borrower 
other real estate owned oreo consists of real property acquired through foreclosure on the related underlying defaulted loans 
the following table shows nonperforming assets at the dates indicated december dollars in thousands nonaccrual loans   loans days past due and still accruing restructured loans total nonperforming loans   foreclosed assets total nonperforming assets   nonperforming assets as a percentage of period end loans plus foreclosed assets 
as of december   the company had  in loans on nonaccrual status  which were considered impaired loans 
the impaired loans had a related valuation allowance of  as of december  the company had  in loans past due days or more and still accruing interest and no restructured loans as of december  as of december   the company had  in loans on nonaccrual status  which were considered impaired loans 
the impaired loans had a related valuation allowance of  as of december  the company had no loans past due days or more and still accruing interest and no restructured loans as of december  as of december   the company had no loans on nonaccrual status  no significant loans past due days or more and still accruing interest  no restructured loans  no foreclosed assets  and no impaired loans 
for the year ended december   the company had  foregone interest income on nonaccrual loans  compared to  and zero for the years ended december  and for the year ended december  and  the company recognized  and  respectively  in interest income for cash payments received on nonaccrual loans 
the company did not recognize any such income for the year ended december  the company assigns to all of its loans a risk grade consistent with the system recommended by regulatory agencies 
grades range from pass to loss depending on credit quality  with pass representing loans that involve an acceptable degree of risk 
management conducts a critical evaluation of the loan portfolio monthly 
this evaluation includes periodic loan by loan review for certain loans to evaluate the level of impairment as well as detailed reviews of other loans either individually or in pools based on an assessment of the following factors past loan loss experience  known and inherent risks in the portfolio  adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay  collateral value  loan volumes and concentrations  size and complexity of the loans  recent loss experience in particular segments of the portfolio  bank regulatory examination results  and current economic conditions in the company s marketplace  in particular the state of the technology industry and the real estate market 
this process attempts to assess the risk of loss inherent in the portfolio by segregating loans into four components for purposes of determining an appropriate level of the allowance watch  special mention  substandard and doubtful 
additionally  the company maintains a program for regularly scheduled reviews of certain new and renewed loans by an outside loan review consultant 
any loans identified during an external review process that expose the company to increased risk are appropriately downgraded and an increase in the allowance for loan losses is established for such loans 
further  the company is examined periodically by the fdic  frb  and the department  at which time a further review of loan quality is conducted 
loans that demonstrate a weakness  for which there is a possibility of loss if the weakness is not corrected  are categorized as classified 
classified loans include all loans considered as substandard  doubtful  and loss and may result from problems specific to a borrower s business or from economic downturns that affect the borrower s ability to repay or that cause a decline in the value of the underlying collateral particularly real estate 
as of december   the principal balance of classified loans  which include all loans internally graded as substandard  doubtful  and loss  was  these loans constituted of total loans and of capital and reserves as of that date 
as of december   the principal balance of classified loans was  these loans constituted of total loans and of capital and reserves as of that date 
at december   the principal balance of classified loans was  these loans constituted of total loans and of capital and reserves at that date 
during the first quarter of  the company identified a  unsecured credit with risks identified that create doubt about the full future repayment under the original terms of the agreement 
the loan has been placed on nonaccrual status and the company has established a specific reserve for this loan 
other than this loan and the loans already classified at december   the company has not identified any potential problem loans that would result in these loans being included as nonperforming or classified loans at a future date 
allowance for probable loan losses it is the policy of management to maintain the allowance for probable loan losses at a level adequate for risks inherent in the loan portfolio 
based on information currently available to analyze loan loss delinquency and a history of actual charge offs  management believes that the loan loss allowance is adequate 
however  the loan portfolio can be adversely affected if california economic conditions and the real estate market in the company s market area were to weaken 
also any weakness of a prolonged nature in the technology industry would have a negative impact on the local market 
the effect of such events although uncertain at this time  could result in an increase in the level of nonperforming loans and increased loan losses  which could adversely affect the company s future growth and profitability 
no assurance of the ultimate level of credit losses can be given with any certainty 
loans are charged against the allowance when management believes that the collectibility of the principal is unlikely

however  historical net charge offs are not necessarily indicative of the amount of net charge offs that the company will realize in the future

loans are charged against the allowance when management believes that the collectibility of the principal is doubtful 
the company s methodology for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance consists of several key elements  which include specific allowances  the formula allowance and the unallocated allowance 
specific allowances are established in cases where management has identified significant conditions or circumstances related to a credit that management believes indicate the probability that a loss may be incurred in excess of the amount determined by the application of the formula allowance 
as of december  and  nonperforming loans had a related specific valuation allowance of  and  respectively 
there were no specific allowances allocated as of december  as the company did not have any impaired loans 
the formula allowance is calculated by applying loss factors to outstanding loans and certain unused commitments 
loss factors are based on management s experience and may be adjusted for significant factors that  in management s judgment  may affect the collectibility of the portfolio as of the evaluation date 
due to the company s limited historical loss experience  management utilizes its prior industry experience to determine the loss factor for each loan category 
the formula allowance on december  was  compared to  on december  the increase was attributable to several factors  most notably the growth in commercial loans  the increase in classified credits  which have a greater assigned loss factor and the company s pro active efforts in addressing the potential impact of changing economic conditions within the market place through an increase in the factors affecting the formula reserve allocations 
the unallocated allowance is based upon management s evaluation of various conditions that are not directly measured in the determination of the formula and specific allowances 
the evaluation of the inherent loss with respect to these conditions is subject to a higher degree of uncertainty because they are not identified with specific problem credits or portfolio segments 
as of december   the company s unallocated allowance was  compared to  on december  the decrease in the unallocated allowance was primarily due to the efforts in addressing the potential impact of changing economic conditions through an increase in the factors affecting the formula reserve allocations 
in evaluating the appropriateness of the unallocated allowance  management considered the following factors bank s lending policies and procedures changes in lending policies and procedures  including underwriting standards and collection  charge off  and recovery practices 
economic conditions changes in national and local economic and business conditions  trends  and developments  including the condition of various market segments 
changes in the bank s lending management and staff changes in the experience  ability and depth of lending management and other relevant staff 
changes in trend and volume of past due and classified loans changes in the trend of the volume and severity of past due and classified loans  and trends in the volume of nonaccrual loans  troubled debt restructurings and other loan modifications 
quality of the bank s loan review system changes in the quality of the bank s loan review system and the degree of oversight by the bank s board of directors 
credit concentrations the existence and effect of any concentrations of credit and changes in the level of such concentrations 
there can be no assurance that the adverse impact of any of these conditions on the bank will not be in excess of the current level of unallocated reserves 
the current business  economic  and real estate markets along with the seasoning of the portfolio and the nature and duration of the current business cycle will affect the amount of unallocated reserve 
in an effort to improve its analysis of risk factors associated with its loan portfolio  the company continues to monitor and to make appropriate changes to its internal loan policies 
these efforts better enable the company to assess risk factors prior to granting new loans and to assess the sufficiency of the allowance for loan losses 
management believes that it has adequately provided an allowance for estimated probable losses in the credit portfolio 
significant deterioration in northern california real property values or economic downturns could impact future operating results  liquidity or capital resources and require additional provisions to the allowance or cause losses in excess of the allowance

market risk market risk is the risk of loss to future earnings  to fair values  or to future cash flows that may result from changes in the price of a financial instrument 
the value of a financial instrument may change as a result of changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  equity prices and other market changes that affect market risk sensitive instruments 
market risk is attributed to all market risk sensitive financial instruments  including securities  loans  deposits  borrowings  its trading activities for its own account  and its role as a financial intermediary in customer related transactions 
the objective of market risk management is to avoid excessive exposure of the company s earnings and equity to loss and to reduce the volatility inherent in certain financial instruments 
interest rate sensitivity the planning of asset and liability maturities is an integral part of the management of an institution s net yield 
to the extent maturities of assets and liabilities do not match in a changing interest rate environment  net yields may change over time 
even with perfectly matched repricing of assets and liabilities  risks remain in the form of prepayment of loans or investments or in the form of delays in the adjustment of rates of interest applying to either earning assets with floating rates or to interest bearing liabilities 
the company has generally been able to control its exposure to changing interest rates by maintaining primarily floating interest rate loans and a majority of its time certificates with relatively short maturities 
the table below sets forth the interest rate sensitivity of the company s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities as of december   using the rate sensitivity gap ratio 
for purposes of the following table  an asset or liability is considered rate sensitive within a specified period when it can be repriced or when it is scheduled to mature within the specified time frame due due in d ue within three afte r one three to twelve to five due after not rate dollars in thousands months months ye ars five years sensitive total interest earning assets federal funds sold  interest bearing deposits in other institutions 
 securities total loans  including loans held for sale  net of deferred costs   total interest earning assets   cash and due from banks other assets total assets   interest bearing liabilities demand  interest bearing  savings and money market  time deposits   other borrowings   notes payable to subsidiary grantor trusts  total interest bearing liabilities   demand noninterest bearing  accrual interest payable and other liabilities shareholders equity total liabilities and shareholders equity   interest rate sensitivity gap   cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap   cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap ratio interest rate changes do not affect all categories of assets and liabilities equally or at the same time 
varying interest rate environments can create unexpected changes in prepayment levels of assets and liabilities  which may have a significant effect on the net interest margin and are not reflected in the interest sensitivity analysis table 
because of these factors  an interest sensitivity gap report may not provide a complete assessment of the exposure to changes in interest rates 
to supplement traditional gap analysis  the company performs simulation modeling to estimate the potential effects of changing interest rate environments 
the process allows the company to explore the complex relationships within the gap over time and various interest rate environments 
for additional information on the company s simulation model and the methodology used to estimate the potential effects of changing interest rates  see item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk below 
liquidity risk represents the potential for loss as a result of limitations on the company s ability to adjust for future cash flows  to meet the needs of depositors and borrowers  and to fund operations on a timely and cost effective basis 
the liquidity policy approved by the board requires annual review of the company s liquidity by the asset liability committee  which is composed of senior executives  and the finance and investment committee of the board of directors 
the company s internal asset liability committee and the finance and investment committee of the board each meet monthly to monitor the company s investments  liquidity needs and to oversee its asset liability management 
the company evaluates the rates offered on its deposit products on a weekly basis 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a financial institution  the company s primary component of market risk is interest rate volatility 
fluctuations in interest rates will ultimately impact both the level of income and expense recorded on most of the company s assets and liabilities  and the market value of all interest earning assets  other than those which have a short term to maturity 
since all of the company s interest bearing assets and liabilities are located at hbc  all of the company s interest rate risk exposure lies at that level  as well 
as a result  all interest rate risk management procedures are performed at hbc s level 
based upon the nature of the company s operations  the company is not subject to foreign exchange or commodity price risk 
the company has no market risk sensitive instruments held for trading purposes 
as of december   the company does not use interest rate derivatives to hedge its interest rate risk 
the company s exposure to market risk is reviewed on a regular basis by the asset liability committee alco 
interest rate risk is the potential of economic losses due to future interest rate changes 
these economic losses can be reflected as a loss of future net interest income and or a loss of current fair market values 
the objective is to measure the effect on net interest income and to adjust the balance sheet to minimize the inherent risk while at the same time maximize income 
management realizes certain risks are inherent  and that the goal is to identify and accept the risks 
management uses two methodologies to manage interest rate risk a standard gap analysis  and an interest rate shock simulation model 
the detail from the company s gap analysis is shown in item  above  and is not discussed here 
the company applies a market value mv methodology to gauge its interest rate risk exposure as derived from its simulation model 
generally  mv is the discounted present value of the difference between incoming cash flows on interest earning assets and other investments and outgoing cash flows on interest bearing liabilities and other liabilities 
the application of the methodology attempts to quantify interest rate risk as the change in the mv which would result from a theoretical basis point basis point equals change in market interest rates 
both a basis point increase and a basis point decrease in market rates are considered 
at december   it was estimated that the company s mv would increase in the event of a basis point increase in market interest rates 
the company s mv at the same date would decrease in the event of a basis point decrease in market interest rates 
presented below  as of december  and  is an analysis of the company s interest rate risk as measured by changes in mv for instantaneous and sustained parallel shifts of basis points in market interest rates market value as a of market value as a of change change present value of assets change change present value of assets dollars in thousands in market in market in market in market change in rates value value mv ratio change bp value value mv ratio change bp bp   bp bp   management believes that the mv methodology overcomes three shortcomings of the typical maturity gap methodology 
first  it does not use arbitrary repricing intervals and accounts for all expected future cash flows 
second  because the mv method projects cash flows of each financial instrument under different interest rate environments  it can incorporate the effect of embedded options on an institutions interest rate risk exposure 
third  it allows interest rates on different instruments to change by varying amounts in response to a change in market interest rates  resulting in more accurate estimates of cash flows 
however  as with any method of gauging interest rate risk  there are certain shortcomings inherent to the mv methodology 
the model assumes interest rate changes are instantaneous parallel shifts in the yield curve 
in reality  rate changes are rarely instantaneous 
the use of the simplifying assumption that short term and long term rates change by the same degree may also misstate historic rate patterns  which rarely show parallel yield curve shifts 
further  the model assumes that certain assets and liabilities of similar maturity or period to repricing will react the same to changes in rates 
in reality  certain types of financial instruments may react in advance of changes in market rates  while the reaction of other types of financial instruments may lag behind the change in general market rates 
additionally  the mv methodology does not reflect the full impact of annual and lifetime restrictions on changes in rates for certain assets  such as adjustable rate loans 
when interest rates change  actual loan prepayments and actual early withdrawals from certificates may deviate significantly from the assumptions used in the model 
finally  this methodology does not measure or reflect the impact that higher rates may have on adjustable rate loan clients ability to service their debt 
all of these factors are considered in monitoring the company s exposure to interest rate risk 
liquidity risk represents the potential for loss as a result of limitations on our ability to adjust our future cash flows to meet the needs of depositors and borrowers and to fund operations on a timely and cost effective basis 
the liquidity policy approved by the board requires annual review of the company s liquidity by the asset liability committee  which is composed of senior executives  and the finance and investment committee of the board of directors
