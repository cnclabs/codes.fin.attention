we serve both the do it yourself diy and the commercial installer  or do it for me difm  markets 
the diy market  which is comprised of consumers who typically repair and maintain vehicles themselves  is the foundation of our business 
sales to the diy market represented approximately of our net sales for fiscal the difm market is comprised of auto repair professionals  fleet owners  governments and municipalities and accounted for over of the annual sales in the us automotive aftermarket industry in  according to statistics published by lang marketing resources  inc sales to the difm market represented approximately of our net sales for fiscal in  we began targeting the difm market to leverage our existing store base  fixed costs  inventory and in store personnel

table of contents industry overview we compete in the us automotive aftermarket industry  which has annual sales in excess of billion 
this industry includes replacement parts excluding tires  accessories  maintenance items  batteries and automotive fluids for cars and light trucks 
the industry is comprised of the diy market and the difm market 
we believe that the us automotive aftermarket industry is characterized by stable demand and is growing because of increases in the size and age of automotives in use  the number of miles driven annually per vehicle  the number of licensed drivers  the percentage of the total light vehicle fleet represented by light trucks including suvs  which generate higher average aftermarket product purchases versus such purchases generated per car  and the number of light vehicles coming off warranty  particularly leased vehicles  which we believe are often under maintained and  therefore  may require higher than average maintenance and repair expenditures in the post warranty period 
despite significant consolidation of automotive aftermarket retailers in recent years  the industry remains highly fragmented 
our primary competitors include national and regional automotive parts chains  wholesalers  jobber stores  independent operators  automobile dealers  and discount stores and mass merchandisers that carry automotive products 
competitive strengths we believe that our competitive strengths include the following leading market position in the western united states 
we are the largest specialty retailer of automotive parts and accessories in the western united states and have the number one market position in of the geographic markets in which we operate  based on store count 
research conducted by a third party market research company indicates that  on an aggregate basis for our key markets  we have better brand name recognition than our major competitors 
we believe that this is due to the long operating history of our stores  our advertising and marketing programs  the breadth of our product selection and our reputation for superior customer service 
as the largest specialty retailer of automotive parts and accessories in the western united states  we believe we have certain competitive advantages over smaller retail chains and independent operators 
these advantages include our brand name recognition as a trusted source of automotive parts and accessories  our ability to make available a broad selection of products on a timely basis  marketing and distribution efficiencies due to economies of scale  and our advanced store level information and distribution systems  which are the result of our significant investments in recent years 
we also believe that we enjoy a competitive advantage over mass merchandisers due to our focus on automotive parts and accessories and our knowledgeable sales associates 
focus on customer service 
our promise of great service  our internally developed customer service initiative  has been well received 
recruiting  training and retaining high quality sales associates is a major component of our focus on customer service 
our training programs and incentives encourage our sales associates to develop technical expertise  which enables them to effectively advise customers on product selection and use 
we have an average of two automotive society of engineers  or ase  certified mechanics per store 
research conducted by a third party market research company indicates that  on an aggregate basis for our key markets  consumers rate our sales associates as the most knowledgeable and helpful more frequently than those of our major competitors 
to further satisfy our customers needs  we also offer free testing of certain parts  no hassle return policies  electronically maintained warranties and a customer service call center 

table of contents timely availability of a broad selection of brand name products 
our stores typically offer a store specific mix of approximately  skus 
we also operate a highly efficient network of strategically located depots to provide approximately of our stores an additional  skus on a same day delivery basis 
through our extensive on line vendor network  we make available up to an additional  skus on a same day delivery basis to approximately of our stores and up to  additional skus on a next day delivery basis to substantially all of our stores 
while our stores also stock high quality generic products that appeal to our value conscious customers  we feature a broad selection of national brand name products that help generate customer traffic and have strong consumer appeal  particularly in the difm market 
sophisticated store level information and distribution systems 
in recent years  we have made significant investments in sophisticated store level information systems and warehouse and distribution systems in order to more effectively manage our inventory and increase the availability of products to our customers 
our sophisticated inventory management systems provide inventory movement forecasting based on history  trends and seasonality 
our systems have enhanced our ability to predict the size and timing of product requirements by closely monitoring service level goals  vendor lead times and cost of inventory assumptions 
our store level replenishment system generates orders based upon store on hand and store model stock quantities 
store model stock quantities are determined by an automatic model stock adjustment system that utilizes historical sales patterns  seasonality and store presentation requirements 
we also maintain a store specific precision pricing program that seeks to optimize margins while maintaining price competitiveness 
our fully integrated warehouse and distribution network and our strategically located depots  which operate using state of the art technology  have allowed us to significantly improve distribution efficiency 
in addition  these investments have allowed us to both improve our in stock inventory levels and reduce delivery costs and times for products 
profitable commercial sales program 
we are well positioned to effectively service our difm customers  who typically require convenient locations  a higher level of customer service and timely availability of brand name products 
beginning in  we significantly increased our marketing efforts to the difm market  added sales personnel dedicated to our difm customers  increased the breadth and depth of our product selection and improved and expanded our distribution systems 
this has enabled us to add significant sales volume to each of our stores with minimal incremental cost 
we currently operate difm sales centers in approximately half of our stores and difm sales have grown from million  or approximately  of net sales in fiscal to million  or approximately  of net sales in fiscal our commercial sales program growth has increased the sales base for participating stores  created improved efficiencies and allowed us to enhance the product selection for our diy customers 
highly experienced and proven management team 
we are led by an innovative management team with a wealth of automotive aftermarket and retail industry experience 
maynard jenkins  our chairman and chief executive officer  has served in his current position since january and has years of retail management experience  including years as a chief executive officer 
martin fraser  our president and chief operating officer  has been with us for years  serving in a number of key positions prior to his current role  including executive vice president merchandising  distribution and commercial and sr 
vice president merchandising  transportation  replenishment and marketing 
our senior management team averages over years of retail industry experience 
we believe the strength and experience of our management team has enabled us to deliver exceptional operating and financial results and to emerge as a leader in our highly competitive industry 
store operations our stores are divided into nine geographic regions southwest  rocky mountain  northwest  northern plains  southern california  coastal california  los angeles  bay area and northern california 
a regional manager  each of whom oversees seven to eleven district managers  administers each region 
each of our district managers has responsibility for between and stores 

table of contents the table below sets forth  as of february   the geographic distribution of our stores and the trade names under which they operated 
checker schucks kragen company auto parts auto supply auto parts total california washington arizona colorado minnesota oregon utah nevada wisconsin idaho new mexico texas alaska montana wyoming hawaii north dakota south dakota michigan total our stores are generally open seven days a week  with hours from am to am am to am on sundays 
the average store employs approximately to employees  including a store manager  two assistant store managers and a staff of full time and part time employees 
store formats approximately of our stores are freestanding  with the balance principally located within strip shopping centers 
the stores  which range in size from  to  square feet  average approximately  square feet in size and offer a store specific mix of between  and  skus 
we have three prototype store designs  which are   and  square feet in size 
the store size for a given new location is selected generally based upon sales volume expectations determined through demographics and the detailed market analysis that we prepare as part of our site selection process 
the following table categorizes our stores by size  as of february  store size number of stores  sq

table of contents staffed with knowledgeable parts personnel and is equipped with our electronic parts catalog 
the remaining selling space contains gondolas for accessories and maintenance items  including oil and air filters  additives  waxes and other items  together with specifically designed shelving for batteries and  in many stores  oil products 
real estate strategy our real estate strategy is focused on our existing or contiguous markets and includes opening new stores  relocating under performing stores with expiring leases to better locations  and expanding selected stores 
our market strategy group  which is a part of our real estate department  utilizes a sophisticated  market based approach that identifies and analyzes potential store locations based on detailed demographic and competitive studies 
these demographic and competitive studies include analysis of population density  growth patterns  age  per capita income  vehicle traffic counts and the number and type of existing automotive related facilities  such as automotive parts stores and other competitors within a pre determined radius of the potential new location 
these potential locations are compared to our existing locations to determine opportunities for opening new stores and relocating or expanding existing stores 
the following table sets forth our store development activities during the periods indicated fiscal year beginning stores new stores relocated stores closed stores including relocated stores ending stores expanded stores total new  relocated and expanded stores we expect to open  relocate or expand approximately stores in fiscal store merchandising our store merchandising program  which classifies our product mix into separate categories  is designed to determine the optimal inventory mix at each individual store based on that store s historical sales 
we believe that we can improve store sales  gross profit margin and inventory turnover by tailoring individual store inventory mix based on historical sales patterns for each of the product categories 
as part of our profitability enhancement program pep in fiscal  we completed a comprehensive review of slower selling items that met neither current return criteria nor our objective for inventory turns 
this review resulted in the elimination of certain merchandise  and the transfer of certain goods to stores that turn the merchandise satisfactorily 
purchasing merchandise is selected from over suppliers and purchased for all stores by personnel at our corporate headquarters in phoenix  arizona 
no one class of product and no single supplier accounted for as much as of our purchases in fiscal our inventory management systems include the e trim buying system  which provides inventory movement forecasting based upon history  trend and seasonality 
combined with service level goals  vendor 
table of contents lead times and cost of inventory assumptions  the e trim buying system determines the timing and size of purchase orders 
approximately of the dollar values of transactions are sent via electronic data interchange  with the remainder being sent by a computer facsimile interface 
our store replenishment system generates orders based upon store on hand and store model stock 
this includes an automatic model stock adjustment system utilizing historical sales  seasonality and store presentation requirements 
we also can allocate seasonal and promotional merchandise based upon a store s history of prior promotional and seasonal sales 
our stores offer products with nationally recognized  well advertised brand names  such as armor all  autolite  castrol  dayco  fel pro  fram  havoline  mobil  monroe  pennzoil  prestone  quaker state  raybestos  stant  sylvania  turtle wax and valvoline 
in addition to brand name products  our stores carry a wide variety of high quality generic products 
because nationally recognized manufacturers that produce similar brand name products that enjoy a high degree of consumer acceptance produce most of our generic products  we believe that our generic products are of a quality that is comparable to such brand name products 
commercial sales program in addition to our primary focus on serving the diy consumer  we have significantly increased our marketing directed at the commercial or difm customer in the automotive replacement parts market 
the commercial or difm market constitutes in excess of of the annual sales in the automotive aftermarket and is currently growing at a faster rate than the do it yourself market 
our commercial sales program  which is intended to facilitate penetration of this market  is targeted toward professional mechanics  auto repair shops  auto dealers  fleet owners  mass and general merchandisers with auto repair facilities and other commercial repair outlets located near our stores 
we have made a significant commitment to this portion of our business and upgraded the information systems capabilities available to the commercial sales group 
in addition  we employ one district sales manager for approximately every five stores with a commercial sales center 
this district sales manager is responsible for servicing existing commercial accounts and developing new commercial accounts 
in addition  at a minimum  each commercial sales center has a dedicated in store salesperson  driver and delivery vehicle 
we believe we are well positioned to effectively and profitably service commercial customers  who typically require a higher level of customer service and broad product availability 
the commercial market has traditionally been serviced primarily by jobbers 
recently  however  automotive specialty retailing chains  such as us  have entered the commercial market 
the chains typically have multiple locations in given market areas and maintain a broad inventory selection 
we believe we have significant competitive advantages in servicing the commercial market because of our experienced sales associates  conveniently located stores  attractive pricing and ability to consistently deliver a broad product offering with an emphasis on national brand names 
as of february   we operated commercial service centers in approximately half of our stores 
our sales to commercial accounts including sales by stores without commercial service centers decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal on a comparable store basis  commercial sales increased in fiscal over fiscal advertising we support our marketing and merchandising strategy primarily through print advertising  in store promotional displays and radio and television advertising 
the print advertising consists of color circulars that are produced by our in house advertising department 
we also advertise on radio  television and billboards primarily to reinforce our image and name recognition 
television advertising is primarily targeted to sports programming and radio advertising is primarily aired during commuting hours 
advertising efforts include spanish language television and radio as well as bilingual store signage 
in store signs and displays are used to promote products  identify departments  and to announce store specials 
we also sponsor two national hot

associates as of february   we employed approximately  full time associates and approximately  part time associates 
approximately of our personnel are employed in store level operations  in distribution and in our corporate headquarters  including our call center and priority parts operation 
we have never experienced any material labor disruption and believe that our labor relations are good 
except for a limited number of associates located at certain stores in the northern california market  who have been represented by a union for many years  none of our personnel are represented by a labor union 
csk tech  our sales associate development program  is dedicated to the continuous education of store associates through structured on the job training and formal classroom instruction 
the curriculum focuses on four areas of the associates development customer service skills  basic automotive systems  advanced automotive systems  and management development 
much of the training is delivered through formal classes in training centers that are fully equipped with the same systems as are in our stores 
we believe that our training programs enable sales associates to provide a high level of service to a wide variety of customers ranging from less knowledgeable do it yourself consumers to more sophisticated purchasers requiring diagnostic advice 
we also provide continuing training programs for store managers and district managers designed to assist them in increasing store level efficiency and improving their potential for promotion 
in addition  we require periodic meetings of district and store managers to facilitate and enhance communications within our organization 
many of our current associates have passed the ase p test  a nationally recognized certification for auto parts technicians 
competition we compete in both the diy and difm markets of the automotive aftermarket industry  which is highly fragmented and generally very competitive 
we compete primarily with national and regional retail automotive parts chains such as autozone  inc and the pep boys manny  moe and jack  inc  wholesalers or jobber stores some of which are associated with national automotive parts distributors or associations  such as napa  automobile dealers  and discount stores and mass merchandisers that carry automotive replacement parts  maintenance items and accessories such as wal mart stores  inc 
as the largest specialty retailer of automotive parts and accessories in the western united states  we believe we have certain competitive advantages over smaller retail chains and independent operators 
these advantages include our brand name recognition as a trusted source of automotive parts and accessories  our ability to make available a broad selection of products on a timely basis  marketing and distribution efficiencies achieved from economies of scale  and our advanced store level information and distribution systems  which are the result of our significant investments in recent years 
we also believe that we enjoy a competitive advantage 
table of contents over mass merchandisers due to our focus on automotive parts and accessories and our knowledgeable sales associates 
the principal competitive factors that affect our business are store location  customer service  product selection  availability  quality and price 
while we believe that we compete effectively in our various markets  certain competitors are larger in terms of number of stores and sales volume  have greater financial and management resources and have been operating longer in certain geographic areas 
trade names  service marks and trademarks we have the right to exclusively use the trade name checker nationwide in connection with the automotive parts retailing business pursuant to a settlement and use agreement with the owner of the federal registration for such trademark 
we own and have registered the service mark schucks with the united states patent and trademark office for use in connection with the automotive parts retailing business 
we expect to file a renewal for this mark prior to june   based on its current expiration date 
we have common law rights to use the trade name kragen in connection with the automotive parts retailing business 
in addition  we own and have registered numerous trademarks with respect to many of our private label products and advertising and marketing strategies 
we believe that our various trade names  service marks and trademarks are important to our merchandising strategy  but that our business is not otherwise dependent on any particular service mark  trade name or trademark 
there are no infringing uses known by us that materially affect the use of such marks 
warehouse and distribution our warehouse and distribution system utilizes bar coding  radio frequency scanners and sophisticated conveyor and put to light systems 
we instituted engineered labor standards and incentive programs in each of our distribution centers  which have contributed to improved labor productivity 
each store is currently serviced by one of our three main distribution centers  with the regional distribution centers handling bulk materials  such as oil 
all of our merchandise is shipped by vendors to our distribution centers  with the exception of batteries  which are shipped directly to stores by the vendor 
we have sufficient warehouse and distribution capacity to meet the requirements of our expected growth plans for the foreseeable future 
seasonality our business is somewhat seasonal in nature  with the highest sales occurring in the months of june through october overlapping our second and third fiscal quarters 
in addition  our business is affected by weather conditions 
while unusually severe or inclement weather tends to reduce sales  as our customers are more likely to defer elective maintenance during such periods  extremely hot and cold temperatures tend to enhance sales by causing auto parts to fail and sales of seasonal products to increase 
environmental matters we are subject to various federal  state and local laws and governmental regulations relating to the operation of our business  including those governing the handling  storage and disposal of hazardous substances  the recycling of batteries and used lubricants  and the ownership and operation of real property 
for example  under environmental laws  a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substances in soil or groundwater 
such laws often impose joint and several liability and liability may be imposed without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of  or was responsible for  the release of such hazardous substances 
we have recorded no liabilities to provide for the cost of environmental remediation activities  as we do not believe that we have incurred any such liabilities 
at some of our locations acquired in prior years  automobiles are serviced in automotive service facilities that we sublease to third parties 
as a result of investigations undertaken in connection with such acquisitions  we are aware that soil or groundwater may be contaminated at some of these properties 
although there can be no assurance  based on current information and  in some cases  indemnities we obtained from the former 
table of contents operators of these facilities  we believe that any such contamination will not result in any liabilities that would have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
as part of our operations  we handle hazardous materials in the ordinary course of business and our customers may bring hazardous materials onto our property in connection with  for example  our oil recycling program 
we currently provide a recycling program for batteries and for the collection of used lubricants at certain of our stores as a service to our customers pursuant to agreements with third party vendors 
the batteries and used lubricants are collected by our associates  deposited into vendor supplied containers pallets and then disposed of by the third party vendors 
in general  our agreements with such vendors contain provisions that are designed to limit our potential liability under applicable environmental regulations for any damage or contamination that may be caused by the batteries and lubricants to off site properties including as a result of waste disposal and to our properties  when caused by the vendor 
we do not believe that compliance with environmental laws and regulations has had a material impact on our operations to date  but there can be no assurance that future compliance with such laws and regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows

item legal proceedings during the third quarter of fiscal  we received notification from the state of california board of equalization the board of an assessment for approximately million for sales tax and approximately million for related interest based on the board s audit findings for the tax periods of october through september during this time period  we refunded the sales tax associated with battery cores to customers who returned a battery core to our stores 
the board believes that the sales tax associated with the battery cores should have been remitted to the taxing authority rather than refunded to the customers 
based on the board s position  we could be responsible for the sales tax and related interest associated with this matter for the audited periods of october through september  plus the additional unaudited time period through december  when we changed our business practices in this area 
we believe that we have a strong basis under california law for disputing the payment of this assessment and have filed a petition for redetermination with the board 
our practices through december relative to the handling of taxes on battery cores had been consistent for over a decade  and it is our position that our consistent treatment of battery core charges  together with prior tax audits and tax auditors written commentary concerning our handling of such charges  permits us to rely upon precedent set in prior audits 
reliance on prior audits is a position that is supportable under california law 
we also have other defenses  and intend to vigorously defend our position with regard to this matter 
a liability for the potential sales tax and related interest payments has not been recorded in our consolidated financial statements 
we currently and from time to time are involved in other litigation incidental to the conduct of our business  including asbestos and similar product liability claims  slip and fall and other general liability claims  discrimination and employment claims  vendor disputes  and miscellaneous environmental and real estate claims 
the damages claimed in some of this litigation are substantial 
based on internal review  we accrue reserves using our best estimate of probable and reasonably estimable contingent liabilities 
we do not currently believe that any of the legal claims  individually or in the aggregate  will result in liabilities material to our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows

in march  the emerging issues task force eitf of the financial accounting standards board fasb reached consensus on certain matters discussed in eitf  accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor 
eitf states that allowances provided by our vendors are presumed to be a reduction in the costs of purchasing inventories to be recognized in inventory and cost of sales  except for that portion that is a reimbursement for costs incurred by us to sell the vendors products 
in order to qualify as a reimbursement  the costs must be specific  identifiable and incremental  to be recognized as a reduction to operating and administrative expenses 
under previous accounting guidance  we accounted for all non performance based vendor allowances as a reduction of inventory cost and allocated performance based vendor allowances as a reduction of advertising expense or cost of goods sold  as appropriate  in the period the expense was incurred 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we adopted the provisions of eitf and implemented a policy of considering all cooperative advertising arrangements and other vendor allowances to be a reduction of product costs  unless we are specifically required to substantiate costs incurred to the vendor and do so in the normal course of business 
for fiscal   and  vendor allowances totaling approximately million  million  million and million  respectively  were classified as a reduction to advertising expense in operating and administrative expense rather than as a reduction to cost of sales as currently required by eitf during fiscal  and  we incurred transition and integration costs associated with certain store acquisitions of million  million and million  respectively 
these costs have been included in operating and administrative expenses 
amounts relate to costs incurred in connection with the closure of existing stores

however  expenses related to refinancing activities in fiscal reduced our pre tax income by million 
our improvement in operating results reflects the following key business strategies drive customer traffic and increase sales base 
our marketing and merchandising strategy is designed to drive customer traffic and build market share 
our strategy is to make available to our customers one of the broadest selections of quality brand name products on a timely basis in order to maximize customer satisfaction and generate loyal repeat customers

our advertising programs are specifically tailored to target our various customer constituencies for maximum appeal and effectiveness 
targeted pricing philosophy 
our pricing philosophy is that we should not lose a customer because of price 
our pricing strategy is to offer everyday low prices at each of our stores 
as a result  we closely monitor our competitors pricing levels through our precision pricing program  which analyzes prices at the store level rather than at the market or chain level 
this initiative enables us to establish pricing levels at each store based upon that store s local market competition 
our entry level products offer excellent value by meeting standard quality requirements at low prices 
in addition  our sales associates are encouraged to offer alternative products at slightly higher price points 
these products typically provide extra features  improved performance  an enhanced warranty  or are nationally branded items 
focus on customer service 
we aim to provide the highest level of customer service in our industry in order to generate repeat business by  among other things  staffing our stores with well trained associates  including an average of two ase certified technicians per store  which allows us to provide high quality diagnostic support 
another integral part of our focus on customer satisfaction includes utilizing our sophisticated product distribution and store level systems to provide our customers with a broad selection of parts and accessories on a timely basis 

table of contents accelerate growth of hispanic customer base 
long term upward trends in the hispanic population  particularly in key markets in the southwest and california  present an opportunity for increased sales and market share 
we have implemented a hispanic marketing initiative using spanish language media and marketing messages to focus on this growing market segment 
seventeen of our key markets are currently included in the program 
continue to improve profitability and cash flow 
we continually review our operations in order to ensure that we are optimally allocating our resources and have an appropriate cost structure that will enable us to grow our net sales  profitability and cash flow 
in recent years we have generated increased cash flows and lowered outstanding debt balances 
this was due largely to our improved operating results  which were fueled by strong comparable store sales  and by improving our gross margins and successfully leveraging our operating and administrative costs 
results of operations and outlook we are very pleased with our operating results for fiscal our merchandising department continues to improve our category management 
this improvement has allowed us to achieve annual comparable store sales increases  while at the same time control our inventory levels  which increased by only during fiscal relative to fiscal comparable sales were strong in all regions 
balanced growth across all regions demonstrates the strength of our merchandise and operational model 
superior customer service has resulted in higher dollar average transactions  fewer returns  and improved customer satisfaction 
we believe our new items give our customers quality automotive related products at exceptional values 
these new items have also enhanced the customer experience inside the store  giving our customers additional reasons to shop our stores 
our marketing program continues to drive sales 
weekly print advertising featuring exceptional values and new products has been very well received by our customers 
our promotional activities also played an important part in achieving our sales objectives for comparable store sales 
our spanish language marketing campaign that we started in the spring of continues to be effective in communicating with our spanish speaking customers 
during fiscal  we rolled out our free automotive systems test called fast diagnostic program to approximately half of our stores 
this program allows customers to put a security deposit down to use diagnostic equipment that reads their vehicle s onboard computer and retrieves diagnostic information 
the information is then uploaded into our stores computers and the customer receives a print out of the results 
by assisting diy customers with this information  we can get them the right parts the first time  improving customer service and lowering returns 
customer use of this program continues to increase and we remain committed to improving this new customer service 
for fiscal  we will continue our focus on top line growth by increasing sales of existing product offerings and offering new products to attract new customers into our stores 
we expect our sales to continue to grow  and we will use that growth to take advantage of lower product costs and the increased dollar average of sales  which should increase our operating margin dollars 
at the same time  we expect to continue to improve our financial position 
for fiscal  we are forecasting same store sales increases in the low to mid single digit range 
we expect our gross profit percentage for fiscal to approximate the levels of fiscal in january  we completed a refinancing of our debt and expect pre tax annual savings during fiscal of approximately million to million in interest expense  assuming no significant changes in variable interest rates 
overview the discussion that follows includes several references to charges and effects relating to the following significant events that occurred during the periods covered in june  we refinanced our senior credit facility  increasing the availability and reducing the interest rate

commercial sales represent sales to commercial accounts  including sales from stores without commercial sales centers 
we evaluate comparable or same store sales based on the change in net sales commencing after the time a new or acquired store has been open for twelve months 
therefore  sales for the first twelve months a new or acquired store is open are 
table of contents not included in the comparable store calculation 
stores that have been relocated are included in comparable store sales 
retail sales and comparable store sales increased in fiscal compared to fiscal as a result of an increase in average sale per customer and the attraction of new customers to our stores through our new product offerings including performance products  garage maintenance items and specialty auto related items 
commercial sales decreased slightly  while comparable stores commercial sales increased in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase in comparable commercial sales reflects sales increases in our ongoing commercial centers  while the overall reduction in commercial sales reflects our consolidation of certain commercial sales centers in an effort to improve overall profitability 
net sales for all stores and comparable stores increased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to our improved liquidity which allowed us to replenish our store inventories to more normal levels of product availability  the commencement of a new merchandising program that features garage maintenance and organizational products  and an increased emphasis on promotional activities and promotional pricing to stimulate customer awareness and improve customer counts in our stores 
total commercial sales increased in fiscal compared to fiscal gross profit gross profit consists primarily of net sales less the cost of sales and warehouse and distribution expenses 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales may be affected by variations in our product mix  price changes in response to competitive factors and fluctuations in merchandise costs and vendor programs 
gross profit for fiscal was million  or of net sales  compared to million  or of net sales for fiscal adjusting fiscal for the effects of eitf would have increased fiscal gross profit by million and gross profit as a percent of net sales to  which  as a percent of net sales  is relatively consistent with fiscal during fiscal  we began selling several new product offerings  which resulted in higher average dollar transactions and higher gross profit dollars  but carry slightly lower gross profit rates 
sales of these new products allows us to further leverage our fixed store level selling and operational costs 
the lower margins on new products are partially offset by our continued emphasis on lowering acquisition costs of inventory in our existing product categories 
gross profit for fiscal was million  or of net sales  compared to million  or of net sales for fiscal gross profit increased in fiscal over fiscal due to increased cash discounts and vendor allowances as a result of our improved sales volume and liquidity 
gross profit was negatively impacted in fiscal primarily as a result of our pep  in which million of charges were incurred relating to reduction in inventory values and costs associated with inventory review and disposal 
although we had anticipated higher gross profit levels for  we did not achieve this result because of lower than expected vendor volume purchase allowances and cash discounts during the year due principally to lower than typical in stock inventory levels in the period 
we have historically utilized prompt payment and other cash discount programs offered by vendors 
because of the need to pay for a class action lawsuit settlement and term loan amortization payments  we made efforts to retain cash during most of fiscal and did not take full advantage of the contractual vendor allowances 
in addition  our change of advertising strategy to emphasize promotional discounts through newspaper advertising to increase retail customer count resulted in a reduction to the realized gross profit margin during the period 
operating and administrative expenses operating expenses consist of operating and administrative expenses and also include the costs of store closing and restructuring costs including the pep  legal settlements  secondary offering costs and goodwill amortization in fiscal years prior to 
operating and administrative expenses are comprised of store payroll  store occupancy  advertising expenses  other store expenses and general and administrative expenses  including salaries and related benefits of corporate employees  administrative office occupancy expenses  data processing  professional expenses and other related expenses 

table of contents operating expenses increased by approximately million to million  or of net sales  in fiscal from million  or of net sales  in fiscal the following items impacted the comparability of operating expenses for the fiscal years indicated net advertising expense in fiscal included million of vendor allowances  which reduced operating expenses and  as a result of eitf  similar allowances were classified in cost of sales during fiscal store closing and other restructuring costs were million higher during fiscal than in fiscal  primarily as a result of charges associated with our change in closed store strategy during the fourth quarter of fiscal see note to the consolidated financial statements 
during fiscal  we incurred a charge for workers compensation of approximately million reflecting increased loss reserves for claims incurred during plan years through and claims relating to the acquired paccar stores  in response to increasing medical and claims costs  primarily in california 
operating expenses as a percent of sales continue to be favorably impacted by our ability to leverage our fixed operating costs over our increasing sales and our continued focus on expense controls 
operating expenses decreased by approximately million to million  or of net sales  in fiscal from million  or of net sales  in fiscal operating expenses in fiscal were impacted by the following store closing and other restructuring charges of million associated with our pep 
charges of million for amortization of goodwill  which in subsequent fiscal years  is no longer amortized 
the settlement of a lawsuit for million 
interest expense interest expense for fiscal decreased to million from million for fiscal this decrease primarily reflects a million reduction in interest expense due to lower average outstanding debt levels throughout the year and a million reduction in interest expense as a result of lower average interest rates due  in part  to our refinancing 
interest expense for fiscal increased to million from million for the comparable period of fiscal higher average interest rates  primarily on our fixed rated debt  and increased amortization of deferred financing fees as a result of our refinancing  increased interest expense 
these increases were partially offset by reduced interest expense associated with lower average outstanding debt balances and less vendor interest on accounts payables because of our improved liquidity in fiscal in addition  during february  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement  which reduced our interest expense by million during fiscal loss on debt retirement in january  we completed a refinancing of our debt that included the redemption of approximately of our outstanding million senior notes  the issuance of million senior subordinated notes and the amendment of our senior credit facility 
in conjunction with these transactions  we incurred a loss on debt retirement of million that included early redemption premiums  the write off of certain deferred financing fees and other direct costs partially offset by a prorata adjustment representing the unamortized gain on a terminated interest rate swap 
in june  we refinanced our senior credit facility and redeemed the remaining balance of our outstanding senior subordinated notes 
in conjunction with these transactions  we incurred a loss on debt retirement of approximately million that included early redemption premiums  the write off of certain financing fees and other direct costs 
as a result of all of these transactions  we recorded a total of million in loss on debt retirement during fiscal 
table of contents during fiscal  we redeemed million of our senior subordinated notes 
in conjunction with this transaction  we incurred a loss on debt retirement of million that included early redemption premiums  the write off of certain financing fees and other direct costs 
during fiscal  we used the proceeds from a note offering together with borrowings under a million credit facility and the gross proceeds of a million private placement of convertible subordinated debentures to refinance our prior credit facility 
in conjunction with these transactions  we incurred a loss on debt retirement of approximately million for the write off of certain financing fees 
income tax expense income tax expense for fiscal was million or of income before income taxes  compared to million or for fiscal the effective tax rate in fiscal is lower than the effective tax rate in fiscal primarily due to an adjustment of tax reserves in relating to a matter for which the statute of limitations expired 
income tax expense for fiscal was million or  compared to an income tax benefit of million or for fiscal the effective tax rate in fiscal is lower than the effective tax rate benefit in fiscal primarily as a result of state tax credits 
profitability enhancement program pep during the second quarter of fiscal  we implemented our pep to reduce costs  improve operating efficiencies and close under performing stores 
as a result of the pep  we recorded total restructuring and other charges of million  which are detailed in the following paragraphs 
the table below summarizes the charges relating to the pep amounts recorded as store closing and restructuring charges reserve for store closing costs write down for impairment of store site costs and store related property and equipment reserve for workforce reduction other total amounts recorded as charges to cost of sales provision for excess inventories actual costs incurred for inventory review and disposal total grand total store closing costs under the pep  we increased the store closing reserve by approximately million 
approximately million of the charge related to the planned closure of stores based on several factors including market saturation  store profitability  and store size and format 
of these planned closures  were closed as of february  and charges relating to two of the stores were subsequently eliminated from the reserve upon the sale of these stores and the transfer of the lease commitments to the new owner 
in addition  we recorded an increase to the reserve for prior years plans of approximately million relating to existing closed stores that had longer than anticipated vacancy periods as a result of the continued economic slowdown 
the pep charge also includes a million write down for impairment of leasehold improvements and other store related property and equipment  which has been recorded as a direct reduction of net property and equipment balances 
see store closures in a subsequent section of this management s discussion and analysis of 
table of contents financial condition and results of operations for further discussion regarding closed stores and the related impact on our results of operations  liquidity and capital resources 
other profitability enhancement program costs as a result of the consolidation of certain regional operations and general and administrative functions under our pep  we terminated employees and eliminated open positions 
the terminated employees worked primarily in human resources  information technology and real estate 
as a result of these actions  the restructuring charges included a provision for severance and benefits of approximately million 
we have also accrued other costs and charges incidental to the restructuring 
these costs include early termination fees for operating lease commitments and other asset impairments aggregating approximately million 
inventory and related charges as a part of the pep  we completed an inventory review to increase inventory turnover  provide an optimal inventory level at each store location  liquidate inventory not meeting our new asset return levels  and write down the carrying value of inventory relating to the stores planned for closure 
as a result of the analysis  we elected to establish a reserve for excess inventories resulting from the decision to eliminate certain product lines and to liquidate inventory from closed stores 
in conjunction with this decision  a provision of million was recorded to reduce inventory values 
in addition  we incurred actual costs of approximately million related to labor  warehouse and distribution  freight and other operating costs associated with the inventory review and disposal 
these costs are reflected as cost of sales in the accompanying statement of operations for fiscal impact of the pep based on the initiatives described above  the pep reduced fiscal and operating expenses by approximately million  which related to the reduction of certain personnel  communications and transportation costs 
we anticipate that these cost savings will be applicable to future years as well 
in addition  the stores closed as a result of the pep incurred operating losses of million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
certain of these stores incurred operating losses during fiscal as a result of their remaining open for a portion of the year 
all stores were closed prior to the end of fiscal liquidity and capital resources recent events in january  we completed a refinancing of our debt that included the redemption of approximately of our outstanding million senior notes and the issuance of million senior subordinated notes 
the new senior subordinated notes mature on january  and require semi annual interest payments on january and july we also amended our senior credit facility  increasing the amount of our facility by million to million  consisting of a million term loan and a million revolving credit facility 
the new term loan is to be repaid in eleven installments consisting of nine million dollar payments made semiannually beginning in june the last two payments are for approximately million each in december and at maturity  june the revolving credit facility matures in june at february  there were no borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
interest accrues under the new credit facility at a variable rate  which is a function of the spread over the alternate base rate as defined in the agreement or the eurodollar rate as defined in the agreement depending on our borrowing decisions 
the senior credit facility that we amended was established in june when we replaced our million senior credit facility with a new million senior collateralized  asset based credit facility consisting of a million term loan and a million revolving credit commitment 
we used proceeds from the june senior credit facility to redeem the remaining million in aggregate principal amount of our senior subordinated notes  including accrued and unpaid interest 
table of contents associated therewith 
as of february   we were in compliance with the financial covenants and we anticipate meeting all required covenants under our senior credit facility during fiscal in conjunction with the above mentioned transactions  we applied the provisions of eitf debtor s accounting for changes in line of credit or revolving debt arrangements for the revolving credit portion of the credit facilities and eitf debtor s accounting for a modification or exchange of debt instruments for the term portion of the credit facilities 
in total in  we incurred a loss on debt retirement of million that included early redemption premiums  the write off of certain financing fees  a prorata adjustment representing the unamortized fair market value swap adjustment as noted below and other direct costs 
the carrying value of deferred debt issuance costs totaling million as of the january transaction date is being amortized to interest expense over the corresponding life of the respective portion of the senior credit facility or the senior subordinated notes 
our intention is to redeem the remaining million of the senior notes in december when callable at of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest 
we anticipate that we will incur a charge associated with this transaction of approximately million for the redemption premium  write offs associated with deferred financing fees and fair value adjustment of the related interest rate swap that we entered into in february as discussed below 
during february  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement that effectively converted the interest rate payment obligation on million of our senior notes to a floating rate in order to hedge the fair value of such notes against potential movements in market interest rates 
on june   we terminated the swap agreement and received in consideration thereof the sum of million  which represented the fair market value of the swap agreement on that date 
upon redemption in january of approximately of the senior notes associated with the swap agreement  we wrote off approximately of the unamortized fair market value adjustment as an offset to the loss on debt retirement 
the remaining fair market value adjustment is currently reflected on our consolidated balance sheet as part of our long term debt 
this amount will be amortized as an offset to interest expense through the maturity date of the senior notes june  or will be written off upon their anticipated earlier redemption as described above 
on april   we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to effectively convert million of our senior subordinated notes due to a floating rate  set quarterly in arrears  equal to the month libor basis points 
the agreement is for the term of the notes 
the hedge will be accounted for as a fair value hedge  accordingly  the fair value of the derivative and changes in the fair value of the underlying debt will be reported on our consolidated balance sheet and recognized in results of operations 
based upon our assessment of effectiveness of the hedge  changes in the fair value of this derivative and the underlying debt are not expected to result in a material impact on net income 
overview of liquidity debt is an important part of our overall capitalization 
while we are still highly leveraged  our outstanding debt continues to decline 
our outstanding debt balance at the end of fiscal was million  a decrease of million from our outstanding debt of million at the end of fiscal our primary cash requirements include working capital primarily inventory  interest on our debt and capital expenditures 
we intend to finance our cash requirements with cash flow from operations  borrowings under our senior credit facility and short term trade credit relating to extended payment terms for inventory 
table of contents purchases 
the following table outlines certain key financial measures that impact our liquidity in thousands  except ratio february  february  february  cash availability under revolving credit facility working capital debt including capital lease obligations to equity ratio our cash balance has improved due to higher sales and operating profit and reduced interest expense 
the availability under our senior credit facility has increased million as a result of our refinancing 
this increase in availability is partially offset by the outstanding loan balance of our senior credit facility being million higher in fiscal than in fiscal primarily due to the increase in the term portion of the credit facility and million of additional letter of credit commitments relative to fiscal finally  our borrowing capacity was million lower at february  due to borrowing base restrictions under our prior credit facility 
at the end of fiscal  we had net working capital of million  an increase of million  or  compared to fiscal working capital increased primarily due to a million increase in cash due to our increasing sales and profitability  a million increase in inventories consistent with the acquisition of new product types in support of our new merchandise programs  and a million increase in receivables primarily as a result of new vendor rebate and cooperative advertising programs 
these increases were partially offset by working capital decreases from a million increase in accounts payable relating to increased inventory purchases  a million increase in accrued payroll related expenses primarily as a result of increased workers compensation reserves  and a million increase in current liabilities due to the required amortization payments on our new term loan 
analysis of cash flows operating activities during fiscal  net cash provided by operating activities was million compared to million of cash provided by operating activities during fiscal the most significant components of the change are a cash outflow of million during fiscal related to premiums paid to purchase debt  a cash inflow during fiscal of million associated with the termination of our interest rate swap agreement  and a decrease in cash used to support working capital requirements as inventory growth offset by accounts payable was million during fiscal compared to million during fiscal during fiscal  net cash provided by operating activities was million compared to million of cash used in operating activities during fiscal the significant components of the change are net income for fiscal of million compared to a loss of million in the fiscal period  which is partially offset by million of non cash inventory and fixed asset charges during the period as a result of our pep  net changes in other assets and liabilities  whereby million was used during fiscal compared to million during fiscal  a million premium payment made during fiscal as part of our retirement of million of outstanding senior subordinated notes  and an million payment made during fiscal as a result of our settlement of certain class action lawsuits 
investing activities net cash used in investing activities totaled million in fiscal  compared to million used in investing activities during fiscal capital expenditures increased to million during fiscal as compared to million during the comparable period in fiscal the increase in capital expenditures relates to the upgrade of certain information systems along with the purchase of certain leased assets 
in addition  during the fiscal period we received million in proceeds from certain fixed asset sales and million in cash proceeds from the sale of stores in west texas 

table of contents net cash used in investing activities totaled million in fiscal compared to million used in investing activities during fiscal the decrease in cash used in investing activities during fiscal was the result of million in proceeds from the sale of stores in west texas in fiscal  and million less in capital expenditures in fiscal than in the comparable period 
these sources of cash were offset in part by million less in proceeds from assets held for sale in fiscal we have budgeted approximately million for capital expenditures for fiscal  primarily for new stores and general corporate purposes 
we opened  relocated or expanded stores in fiscal and expect to open  relocate or expand approximately stores in fiscal we anticipate that the majority of these stores will be financed under arrangements structured as operating leases that require minimal capital expenditures for fixtures and store equipment 
for the remainder of our planned new  relocated or expanded stores  we expect to spend approximately  per store for leasehold improvements 
in addition to capital expenditures  each new store  except for relocated stores  will require an estimated investment in working capital  principally for inventories  of approximately  financing activities net cash used in financing activities totaled million in fiscal  compared to million used in financing activities during fiscal as a result of our refinancing  we generated million of net financing proceeds 
in fiscal  we sold approximately million shares of our common stock in an underwritten public offering and used the proceeds to redeem a portion of our senior subordinated notes 
the stock sales and note redemption resulted in net cash proceeds of million 
the most significant components of the change in financing activities year over year relate to net cash received from the refinancing provided million more in cash than the sale of stock and note redemption in fiscal  net payments on normal loan activity during fiscal were million higher than net loan payments in fiscal  payments on capital lease obligations in fiscal were million higher than in fiscal primarily resulting from the buy out of certain lease obligations  and stock option exercises in fiscal provided million of additional cash year over year

those fiscal transactions resulted in net cash proceeds of million 
in fiscal we completed a refinancing that provided million in net cash proceeds 
the most significant components of the change in financing activities year over year relate to net cash received from the refinancing in fiscal provided million more in cash than the sale of stock and note redemption in fiscal  net payments on normal loan activity during fiscal were million higher than net loan payments in fiscal 
table of contents off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations we lease our office and warehouse facilities  all but one of our retail stores  and some of our equipment 
certain of the equipment leases are classified as capital leases and  accordingly  the equipment and related obligation are recorded on our balance sheet 
however  substantially all of our store leases are operating leases with private landlords and provide for monthly rental payments based on a contractual amount 
the majority of these lease agreements are for base lease periods ranging from to years  with three to five renewal options of five years each 
certain store leases also provide for contingent rentals based upon a percentage of sales in excess of a stipulated minimum 
we believe that the long duration of our store leases offer security for our store locations without the risks associated with real estate ownership 
we currently have leases for our corporate headquarters and an adjacent parking lot with a landlord  which until november  was a related party 
previously we had entered into sale leaseback or other financing arrangements with related parties 
we believe that the terms of the transactions with the related parties were no less favorable than terms we may have been able to receive from independent third parties at the time of the applicable transaction 
we also believe that these transactions as a whole are not material to our financial statements 
for more information on related party transactions  refer to note of the consolidated financial statements 
in order to facilitate an understanding of our contractual obligations and commercial commitments  the following data is provided in thousands payments due by period within after contractual obligation total year years years years long term debt capital lease obligations operating lease obligations total contractual obligations see recent events for discussion relating to our long term debt 
operating lease obligations are not reduced to reflect sublease income 
other commercial commitments consist of standby letters of credit totaling million at february   all of which expire in our inventory purchase commitments are cancelable and therefore not included in the above table 
store closures we provide an allowance for estimated costs to be incurred in connection with store closures 
on an on going basis  store locations are reviewed and analyzed based on several factors including market saturation  store profitability  and store size and format 
in addition  we analyze sales trends and geographical and competitive factors to determine the viability and future profitability of our store locations 
if a store location does not meet our required projections  it is considered for closure 
as a result of our acquisitions over the last several years  we have closed numerous locations as a result of store overlap with previously existing store locations 
the allowance for store closing costs is included in accrued expenses and other long term liabilities in the accompanying financial statements and primarily consists of three components future rents to be paid over the remaining terms of the lease agreements for the stores net of estimated probable sublease recoveries  lease commissions associated with the anticipated store subleases  and occupancy expenses associated with the closed store vacancy periods 
prior to january   such costs were recognized when a store was specifically identified  costs could be estimated and closure was planned to be completed within the next twelve months in accordance with eitf  liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a 
table of contents restructuring 
no provision was made for employee termination costs 
for stores to be relocated  such costs were recognized when an agreement for the new location had been reached with a landlord and site plans met preliminary municipal approvals 
during the period that they remained open for business  the rent and other operating expenses for the stores to be closed continued to be reflected in normal operating expenses 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas no 

sfas no 
requires companies to recognize the fair value of costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
examples of costs covered by sfas include lease rental and termination costs and certain employee severance costs that are associated with a restructuring  discontinued operation  store closing  or other exit or disposal activity 
we have applied sfas no 
prospectively to exit or disposal activities initiated or exit plans substantially modified after december  as required 
the refinancing completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal and the ongoing improvement in our operating results have increased our cash flow and financial flexibility  enabling us to pursue an alternate strategy to reduce our current portfolio of closed stores  which includes lease buyouts and foregoing lease extensions on locations that we currently sublease at a marginal profit 
this change in strategy requires us to establish a new closed store reserve based upon the guidance in sfas no 
and reverse the existing closed store reserve that was previously established under eitf sfas no 
requires that costs under a lease contract for a closed store be recognized at fair value and that the amount of remaining lease payments owed be reduced by estimated sublease income but not to an amount less than zero 
this change in methodology resulted in a non cash charge of million during the fourth quarter of fiscal the charge reflects the elimination from the reserve of net sublease income previously recorded for leases with incremental estimated sublease income in excess of the costs of the original lease  partially offset by the discounting of net cash outflow 
sublease income in excess of costs associated with the lease will be recognized in future periods as it is earned 
as of february   we had a total of store locations included in the allowance for store closing costs 
of this total  locations were vacant and locations were subleased 
in addition to these stores  we had service centers of which were vacant and were subleased 
future rent expense will be incurred through the expiration of the non cancelable leases  the longest of which runs through january activity in the allowance for store closings and the related payments for the three fiscal years ended february   including the pep  is as follows in thousands fiscal year balance  beginning of year store closing costs adjustment of allowance to reflect change in exit strategy under sfas no

table of contents during fiscal  we recorded the following million in charges associated with the reversal of the reserve established under eitf and the establishment of a new closed store reserve on the basis of our change in exit strategy in accordance with the guidance in sfas no 
 million in charges under sfas no 
associated with the closure of stores  with the majority closed at the expiration of the master lease  revisions in estimates of million primarily relating to plan year resulting from changes in estimated vacancy periods and lower realized sublease rates 
during fiscal  we recorded the following gross store closing costs of million relating to the identification of stores for closure  an adjustment to prior plans of million primarily due to management s decision to utilize a warehouse and storage facility that was previously included within the plan year accrual in conjunction with purchase accounting adjustments as a result of certain acquisitions  and revisions in estimates of million million for plan year  million for plan year and million for plan years prior to relating to existing closed stores that have had longer than anticipated vacancy periods as a result of the continued economic slowdown 
during fiscal  we recorded the following gross store closing costs of million million from the pep relating to the identification of stores for closure  an adjustment to prior plans of million due to two stores previously identified for closure under our pep that were subsequently removed as they were sold and the lease commitments were transferred to the new owner  and revisions in estimates of million million for plan year  million for plan year and million for plan years prior to relating to existing closed stores that had longer than anticipated vacancy periods as a result of the economic slowdown 
on a store count basis  activity and the remaining number of stores to be closed are summarized as follows number of stores to be closed beginning stores plan stores balance to store count by fiscal year balance added amendments closed be closed we expect net cash outflows for closed store locations of approximately million during fiscal and the remainder of cash outflows to primarily occur during fiscal  and we plan to fund these outflows from normal operating cash flows and borrowings under our senior credit facility 
we anticipate that we will close or relocate approximately stores during fiscal we anticipate that the majority of these closures will occur at the end of the lease terms  resulting in minimal closed store costs 
we anticipate total cash outflows relating to these stores of approximately million  which includes estimated incremental costs to be measured at fair value when incurred 
factors affecting liquidity and capital resources sales trends our business is somewhat seasonal in nature  with the highest sales occurring in the months of june through october overlapping our second and third fiscal quarters 
in addition  our business is affected by weather conditions 
while unusually severe or inclement weather tends to reduce sales  as our customers are more likely to defer elective maintenance during such periods  extremely hot and cold temperatures tend to enhance sales by causing auto parts to fail and sales of seasonal products to increase 
inflation we do not believe our operations have been materially affected by inflation 
we believe that we will be able to mitigate the effects of future merchandise cost increases principally through economies of scale resulting from increased volumes of purchases  selective forward buying and the use of alternative suppliers 

table of contents debt covenants our credit agreement contains negative covenants and restrictions on actions by us and our subsidiaries including  without limitation  restrictions and limitations on indebtedness  liens  guarantees  mergers  asset dispositions not in the ordinary course of business  investments  loans  advances and acquisitions  payment of dividends  transactions with affiliates as defined in the credit agreement  change in business conducted  and certain prepayments other than in the ordinary course of business and amendments of subordinated indebtedness 
our credit agreement requires that we meet certain financial covenants  ratios and tests  including a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio 
the consolidated leverage ratio is consolidated total funded debt  as defined in the credit agreement  divided by consolidated ebitda as defined in the credit agreement 
the interest coverage ratio is consolidated ebitda  as defined in the credit agreement  divided by cash interest expense  as defined in the credit agreement 
at february   our consolidated leverage ratio was to  and our interest coverage ratio was to  both of which were in compliance with the related covenants 
we anticipate meeting all required covenants under our credit agreement in fiscal a breach of the covenants  ratios  or restrictions contained in our credit agreement could result in an event of default thereunder 
upon the occurrence of such an event of default  the lenders under our credit agreement could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the credit agreement  together with accrued interest  to be immediately due and payable 
if we were unable to repay those amounts  the lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure the indebtedness 
if the lenders under the credit agreement accelerate the payment of the indebtedness  we cannot be assured that our assets would be sufficient to repay in full that indebtedness  which is secured by substantially all of our assets 
although we have significantly reduced our outstanding debt over recent years  we are still highly leveraged 
the degree to which we are leveraged could have important consequences on our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions or general corporate purposes 
a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations must be dedicated to the payment of interest on our indebtedness  thereby reducing the funds available for other purposes 
we are substantially more leveraged than some of our competitors  which might place us at a competitive disadvantage to those competitors that have lower debt service obligations and significantly greater operating and financial flexibility than we do 
we may not be able to adjust rapidly to changing market conditions and we may be more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in general economic conditions or in our business 
credit ratings currently  our debt instruments are rated by the major debt rating agencies as shown below description of debt moody s rating standard poor s term loan ba b revolver ba b notes b n a notes b b interest rates financial market risks relating to our operations result primarily from changes in interest rates 
interest earned on our cash equivalents as well as interest paid on our variable rate debt is sensitive to changes in interest rates 
our variable rate debt relates to borrowings under our senior credit facility  which is primarily vulnerable to movements in the libor rate 
see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk below for a more detailed explanation about our variable interest rate risk 

table of contents critical accounting matters we define a critical accounting matter as one that is both significant to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations  and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
inventories and cost of sales net realizable value 
inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market  cost being determined utilizing the last in  first out lifo method 
our inventory levels have been generally consistent in recent years and thus  under lifo  cost of sales reflect the costs of the most currently purchased inventories 
inventory carrying balances on the other hand  reflect the costs relating to prices paid in prior years under the lifo method 
our costs of acquiring inventories through normal purchasing activities have been moderately decreasing  as our increased size  financial performance and cash flows have enabled us to take advantage of volume discounts and lower product acquisition costs 
accordingly  it costs us less money to replace inventory today than the lifo balances carried for similar inventory in our financial statements 
as a result of the lifo method of accounting for inventory and the ability to obtain lower product acquisition costs  we recorded reductions to cost of goods sold of million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
as a result of the above  the replacement cost of inventories including capitalization was million and million at february  and february   respectively  as compared to financial statement carrying values of million and million 
while financial statement carrying balances are higher than replacement costs  such carrying balances are not higher than the net realizable value amount nrv we expect to earn by selling the inventory through our retail stores in the normal course of business 
under generally accepted accounting principles  nrv reflects the expected selling price of the inventories  less selling costs and a normal profit margin to compute our nrv floor 
we evaluate the difference between carrying balances and the nrv of our inventories at each balance sheet reporting date 
at february   we estimated that the nrv of our inventories exceeded carrying balances by approximately million 
vendor programs 
cost of sales includes product cost  net of earned vendor rebates  discounts and allowances 
we recognize vendor rebates  discounts and allowances based on the terms of written agreements generally as inventory is sold 
a few of our agreements have several year terms thus requiring recognition over an extended period 
at each balance sheet reporting date  we reduce inventory carrying balances by an estimate of purchase discounts and volume rebates that remain in ending inventory at period end  based upon inventory turnover rates 
such discounts and rebates reduced inventory balances by approximately million and million as of february  and february   respectively 
inventory handling costs 
certain operating and administrative costs associated with purchasing and handling of inventory are capitalized in inventories 
the amounts of such costs included in inventories as of february  and february  were approximately million and million  respectively 
deferred tax asset included in our net deferred tax liability are deferred tax assets of million as of february   reflecting the benefit of federal and state tax loss carryforwards approximating million and million  which begin to expire in and  respectively 
realization is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income prior to expiration of the loss carryforwards 
utilization of certain of the net operating loss carryforwards may be limited under section of the internal revenue code 
although realization is not assured  management believes it is more likely than not that all of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
accordingly  we believe that no valuation allowance is required for deferred tax assets 

table of contents legal matters during the third quarter of fiscal  we received notification from the state of california board of equalization the board of an assessment for approximately million for sales tax and approximately million for related interest based on the board s audit findings for the tax periods of october through september during this time period  we refunded the sales tax associated with battery cores to customers who returned a battery core to our stores 
the board believes that the sales tax associated with the battery cores should have been remitted to the taxing authority rather than refunded to the customers 
based on the board s position  we could be responsible for the sales tax and related interest associated with this matter for the audited periods of october through september  plus the additional unaudited time period through december  when we changed our business practices in this area 
we believe that we have a strong basis under california law for disputing the payment of this assessment and filed a petition for redetermination with the board in october our practices through december relative to the handling of taxes on battery cores had been consistent for over a decade  and it is our position that our consistent treatment of battery core charges  together with prior tax audits and tax auditors written commentary concerning our handling of such charges  permits us to rely upon precedent set in prior audits 
reliance on prior audits is a position that is supportable under california law 
we also have other defenses  and intend to vigorously defend our position with regard to this matter 
we have not recorded a liability for the potential sales tax and related interest payments in our consolidated financial statements 
we currently and from time to time are involved in other litigation incidental to the conduct of our business  including asbestos and similar product liability claims  slip and fall and other general liability claims  discrimination and employment claims  vendor disputes  and miscellaneous environmental and real estate claims 
the damages claimed in some of this litigation are substantial 
based on an internal review  we accrue reserves using our best estimate of the probable and reasonably estimable contingent liabilities 
we do not currently believe that any of these legal claims  individually or in the aggregate  will result in liabilities material to our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
however  if our estimates related to these contingent liabilities are incorrect  the future results of operations for any particular fiscal quarter or year could be materially adversely affected 
self insurance reserves we purchase third party insurance for workers compensation  automobile  product and general liability claims that exceed a certain dollar threshold 
however  we are responsible for the payment of claims under these insured limits 
in estimating the obligation associated with incurred losses  we utilize loss development factors prepared by independent third party actuaries 
these development factors utilize historical data to project the future development of incurred losses 
loss estimates are adjusted based upon actual claims settlements and reported claims 
during fiscal we recorded million of workers compensation expense reflecting increased loss reserves for claims incurred during plan years through and claims relating to the acquired paccar stores  in response to increasing medical and claims costs  primarily in california 
our self insurance reserves approximated million and million at february  and february   respectively  and are included with current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
store closing costs if a store location does not meet our required standards  it is considered for closure 
we provide an allowance for estimated costs to be incurred in connection with store closures 
we establish this allowance based on an assessment of market conditions for rents and include assumptions for vacancy periods and sublease rentals 
in fiscal years and  we were required to make adjustments of million and million  respectively  to the allowance because actual market conditions were different from the assumptions we made at the time we established the allowance 
we may be required to make further adjustments in future periods 
there are several significant assumptions that underlie the estimates inherent in the closed store reserve 
these assumptions include real estate broker estimates for vacancy periods and estimated sublease rates 
table of contents based on the broker s experience and expertise  estimates for occupancy expenses based on historical averages and  in the case of real estate taxes  subject to changes by taxing authorities  and credit adjusted discount rates 
accordingly  we continuously review these assumptions and revise the reserve as necessary 
in addition  there are certain assumptions that are sensitive to deviations and could produce actual results significantly different from management s original assumptions 
these assumptions may be revised as follows national or regional economic conditions that can shorten or lengthen vacancy periods  deterioration of neighborhoods surrounding store locations resulting in longer than anticipated vacancy periods  changing subtenant needs resulting in functional obsolescence of store locations  and subtenant defaults or bankruptcies resulting in vacant properties 
historically  we have recorded revisions in estimates to the closed store reserve that have resulted from these issues 
these revisions usually result from overall longer vacancy periods on store locations and realized sublease rates lower than originally anticipated

in fiscal  we recorded a loss on debt retirement of million in our consolidated statement of operations as a component of income before income taxes 
accordingly  for fiscal and  we reclassified pretax amounts of million and million  respectively  and presented them as losses on debt retirement in our consolidated statements of operations as a component of income before income taxes 
in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation fin no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  which addresses the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under guarantees 
fin no 
also requires the recognition of a liability by a guarantor at the inception of certain guarantees 
the initial measurement of this liability is the fair value of the guarantee at inception 
the recognition of the liability is required even if it is not probable that payments will be required under the guarantee or if the guarantee was issued with a premium payment or as part of a transaction with multiple elements 
fin no 
disclosure requirements were effective for our year ended february  and the initial recognition and measurement provisions were applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after february  in the ordinary course of our business  from time to time  we enter into agreements with unrelated parties  which may contain indemnity obligations triggered by pre existing conditions  or our prior performance eg  environmental contamination or third party acts 
these indemnification provisions are the result of negotiated transactions and  in each such case  we have determined that the indemnity obligation is acceptable based on one or more factors  including the existence of an indemnification in our favor by an unrelated third party  availability of insurance coverage  the remote possibility that the triggering event would occur  and or the determination that the cost of performing the indemnity obligation would not be significant 
we are not aware of the occurrence of any triggering event or condition that would have a material adverse impact on our financial statements as a result of an indemnity 
table of contents obligation relating to any such triggering event or condition 
accordingly  the adoption of fin no 
is not expected to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
in january  the fasb issued fin no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb 
the primary objectives of fin no 
are to provide guidance on the identification of entities for which control is achieved through means other than through voting rights variable interest entities and how to determine when and which business enterprise should consolidate the variable interest entity the primary beneficiary 
fin no 
must be applied to all the company s existing relationships no later than the first quarter of fiscal we are in process of completing our analysis  however  we do not expect that fin no 
will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in march  the eitf of the fasb reached consensus on certain matters discussed in eitf  accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor 
eitf states that allowances provided by our vendors are presumed to be a reduction in the costs of purchasing inventories to be recognized in inventory and cost of sales  except for that portion that is a reimbursement for costs incurred by us to sell the vendors products 
in order to qualify as a reimbursement  the costs must be specific  identifiable and incremental  to be recognized as a reduction to operating and administrative expenses 
under previous accounting guidance  we accounted for all non performance based vendor allowances as a reduction of inventory cost and allocated performance based vendor allowances as a reduction of advertising expense or cost of goods sold  as appropriate  in the period the expense was incurred 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we adopted the provisions of eitf and implemented a policy of considering all cooperative advertising arrangements and other vendor allowances to be a reduction of product costs  unless we are specifically required to substantiate costs incurred to the vendor and do so in the normal course of business 
for fiscal and fiscal  vendor allowances totaling approximately million and million  respectively  were classified as a reduction to advertising expense in operating and administrative expense rather than as a reduction to cost of sales as currently required by eitf the following table adjusts the amounts reported for cost of sales  gross margin and operating and administrative expenses from fiscal and fiscal to be comparable with current requirements of eitf fiscal fiscal adjusted for adjusted for as reported eitf as reported eitf in thousands cost of sales cost of sales  percent to sales gross profit gross profit  percent to sales operating and administrative expense operating and administrative expense  percent to sales the change in accounting principle had no impact on cash flow 
we do not expect eitf to have a material impact on our future net income

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk financial market risks relating to our operations result primarily from changes in interest rates 
we hold no securities for purposes of trading 
interest earned on our cash equivalents as well as interest paid on our variable rate debt is sensitive to changes in interest rates 
in february  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement  which converted the interest payment obligation on million of our senior notes to a floating rate 
on june   we terminated this swap agreement and received in consideration thereof the sum of million 
in january  we redeemed approximately of the notes associated with this swap agreement and recorded as an offset to our loss on debt retirement  of the unamortized balance of the amount received for the rate swap termination 
the remaining balance will be amortized as an offset to interest expense through the maturity date of the senior notes june  or written off upon their earlier redemption 
our variable rate debt relates to borrowings under our senior credit facility  which is primarily vulnerable to movements in the libor rate 
our variable and fixed rate debt at february  consisted of the following in thousands average interest fixed or debt facility balance rate variable senior credit facility term loan  variable senior credit facility revolver variable senior notes  fixed unamortized original issue discount on senior notes fair market value of rate swap on million of senior notes sfas no 
hedge accounting adjustment senior subordinated notes  fixed total debt less capital leases the coupon rate of these notes is  however the effective interest rate is due to amortization of the original issue discount net of the reduction in interest expense resulting from the interest rate swap 
at february   of our outstanding debt was at variable interest rates and of our outstanding debt was at fixed interest rates 
with million in variable rate debt outstanding  a change in the libor rate to which this variable rate debt is indexed would result in a million change in our annual interest expense 
this estimate assumes that our debt balance remains constant for an annual period and the interest rate change occurs at the beginning of the period 
during april  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to convert million of our senior notes due to a floating rate  set quarterly in arrears  equal to the month libor basis points 
the agreement is for the term of the notes 
the hedge will be accounted for and recognized in results of operations as a fair value hedge  accordingly  the fair value of the derivative and changes in the fair value of the underlying debt will be reported on our balance sheet 
based upon our assessment of effectiveness of the hedge  changes in the fair value of this derivative and the underlying debt are not expected to result in a material impact on net income 
assuming the interest rate swap was in effect at the end of fiscal  approximately of our outstanding debt would have been variable 
a change in the libor rate would result in a million change in our annual interest expense
