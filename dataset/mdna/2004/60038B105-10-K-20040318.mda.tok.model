item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this form k 
general we were formed as a delaware limited liability company on december   and organized and began operations on january  inception date 
we were converted into a delaware corporation on april  when all of the outstanding equity interests of the limited liability company were converted into shares of common stock of the corporation 
unless otherwise indicated  all information that we present in this form k for any date or period gives effect to the conversion as if it had occurred on that date or as of the beginning of that period and all references to common stock for periods before the conversion mean our issued and outstanding membership interests 
overview we have developed and patented a process called hydrogen on demand that safely generates pure hydrogen or electricity from environmentally friendly raw materials 
in the process  the energy potential of hydrogen is carried in the chemical bonds of sodium borohydride  which in the presence of a catalyst releases hydrogen or produces electricity 
the primary input components of the reaction are water and sodium borohydride  a derivative of borax  which is found in substantial natural reserves globally 
hydrogen from this system can be used to power fuel cells  as well as fed directly to internal combustion engines 
we also have patents covering boron based longer life batteries 
our goal is to convert our technology from the research and development stage to commercialization 
our losses have resulted primarily from costs associated with product development and research and development activities as well as non cash amortization of preferred stock and non cash charges related to the issuance of stock options and warrants to employees and third parties 
as a result of planned expenditures in the areas of research  product development and marketing and additional non cash charges relating to employee stock options  we expect to incur additional operating losses for the foreseeable future 
results of operations year ended december  versus revenues 
we recorded  of revenues during the year ended december  compared with revenues of  in the decline in revenue was attributable to fewer sales of large prototype systems and services to the transportation markets and more sales of smaller systems designed for standby power and consumer electronics markets 
in the near term  revenues are expected to be derived substantially from up front license fees  research contracts with various federal  state and local agencies  collaborations with other companies  management services  and royalty payments or joint venture revenue from licensees or strategic partnerships 
revenues will be recognized in the period in which technology is delivered  licensing revenues are earned  or as services are performed

rent expense under the operating lease was approximately   and  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
in connection with the amended lease agreement  the company issued a letter of credit to the landlord for  in lieu of a cash security deposit 
the letter of credit was collateralized with a portion of the company s cash and is classified as restricted cash 
the funds used for collateral will not be available for use in operations 
between january and april  we received an aggregate of  from a recoverable grant award from the state of new jersey commission on science and technology 
the funds were used to partially fund costs directly related to development of our technology 
the recoverable grant is required to be repaid when we generate net sales in a fiscal year 
the repayment obligation  which began in june  ranges from to of net sales over a ten year period 
we are obligated to repay the unpaid amount of the original grant at the end of the ten year period 
we repaid approximately  of the award during the second quarter of  which represents of the net sales 
based upon of the net sales   is due to be repaid in the company received net proceeds from the sale of new jersey net operating losses nol s in conjunction with the new jersey emerging technology and biotechnology financial assistance program of  and  in and  respectively 
this program allows certain companies to apply to transfer new jersey nol s to other companies 
this program  if continued by the state in future years  may produce similar cash inflows for the company 
we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents  together with the approximate million cash available from the recent private placement financing  together with future expected conversions of unsecured debentures  and projected cash generated from our operations will be sufficient to satisfy anticipated cash needs of our operations through at least the fiscal year 
we may raise additional funds through public or private financing  collaborative relationships or other arrangements 
we cannot be assured that additional funding  if sought  will be available or will be on terms favorable to us 
further  any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders  and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
our failure to raise capital when needed may harm our business and operating results 
critical accounting policies application of critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and other financial information 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
in addition  our reported financial condition and results of operations could vary due to a change in the application of a particular accounting standard 
we regard an accounting estimate underlying our financial statements as a critical accounting estimate if the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of estimation and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used in the current period  or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  would have had a material effect on the presentation of financial condition  changes in financial condition  or results of operations 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
not all of these significant accounting policies  however  require management to make difficult  complex or subjective judgments or estimates 
our management has discussed our accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors  and we believe that our estimates relating to revenue recognition  convertible debt and stock options described below fit the definition of critical accounting estimates 
revenue recognition the company s near term revenues will be derived substantially from contracts that require the company to deliver hydrogen generation technology  management services  system design and prototype systems and licensing of technology for test and evaluation 
it is anticipated that revenues will be recognized in the period in which the technology is delivered or licensed revenue is earned 
convertible debt the company accounts for the issuance and conversion of convertible debt in accordance with apb no 
 accounting for convertible debt and debt issued with stock purchase warrants 
as a result  the company has and will record original issue discounts to the extent the fair value of the debt is below the face value of the instrument and amortize the discount over the life of the instrument 
to the extent conversions of debt into common stock are made prior to the maturity date of the instrument  the company will record as interest expense a ratable proportion of the discount associated with the face value of the debt converted 
the company accounts for issuances of convertible debt in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf no 
 application of issue no 
to certain convertible instruments eitf no 
 and eitf no 
 accounting for convertible securities with beneficial conversion features or contingently adjustable conversion ratios eitf no 

as a result of certain conversion price discounts included within the company s outstanding debt instruments  the company will record interest expense resulting from beneficial conversion features as described under the caption liquidity and capital resources above 
stock options the company has recorded non cash charges in  and to the fair value of warrants issued to certain third parties 
certain parties have the ability to earn new awards based on defined milestones and service periods 
the accounting methodology requires a re valuing of the related earned warrants at each reporting period using a black scholes pricing model 
due to this variable accounting methodology  it is difficult to predict the amount of additional non cash charges the company will incur related to these warrants 
the company also records non cash charges for the difference between the grant price and market price on the date of grant related to certain stock options issued to employees and elected directors below market prices as defined by apb no 
the non cash charge is recognized ratably over the related vesting period of the respective option contracts 
as of june   all of these options were vested 
the company also discloses pro forma information regarding net income and earnings per share that is required by sfas no 
this information is required to be determined as if the company had accounted for its employee stock options under the fair value method of that statement 
the fair value of options granted for the fiscal years ended december   and has been estimated at the date of grant using a black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
in addition  option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected stock price volatility 
the company s options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options  and changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate 
due to these highly subjective assumptions  the non cash charges incurred in  and for warrants issued to third parties and the pro forma disclosures of net loss and loss per share for fiscal  and  are not likely to be representative of non cash charges and the pro forma effects on net loss and loss per share  respectively  in future years 
impact of recently issued accounting standards in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin 
fin addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities with certain defined characteristics 
this interpretation applies immediately to variable interest entities created after january   and to variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date 
it applies in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after december   to variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that it acquired before february  the company determined it had no variable interest entities and this interpretation did not have any impact on the accompanying financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
this statement establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
it requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability or an asset in some circumstances 
this statement is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  this statement did not have a material impact on the company s financial statements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure of market risk 
market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position  operating results or cash flows due to changes in us interest rates 
this exposure is directly related to our normal operating activities 
our cash and cash equivalents are invested with high quality issuers and are generally of a short term nature 
as a result  we do not believe that near term changes in interest rates will have a material effect on our future results of operations 
our systems ability to produce energy depends on the availability of sodium borohydride  which has a limited commercial use and is not manufactured in vast quantities 
there are currently only two major manufacturers of sodium borohydride and there can be no assurance that the high cost of this specialty chemical will be reduced 
once we commence full operations in the future  we may need to enter into long term supply contracts to protect against price increases of sodium borohydride 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to enter into these agreements to protect against price increases
