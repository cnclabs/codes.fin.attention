item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview during the year ended december   the financial services industry experienced a record low interest rate environment 
the company felt the impact of this low rate environment through unprecedented refinancing and prepayment activity in both the loan and securities portfolios which in turn decreased the company s realized yields on interest bearing assets 
in addition  while interest expense also decreased during the year  the interest expense on the company s fhlb fixed rate advances continued to adversely impact the company s net interest rate margin 
the average cost of these advances for the year ended december  was and significantly impacted the company s cost of interest bearing liabilities 
while the advances can be prepaid  the company would incur a substantial penalty which is calculated based on the present value of the future cash flows at current interest rates 
as of december   the company estimated the prepayment penalty to be million to pay off the aggregate advances 
should interest rates increase  the company expects the estimated prepayment penalties to decrease 
until then  the cost of these borrowings are expected to significantly impact future earnings 
in its efforts to mitigate the effects of the low interest rate environment  the company continued its strong effort to develop and enhance programs to support commercial and small business growth by hiring six new commercial loan officers and seven credit administration professionals to bolster the rapidly growing commercial lending function 
the commercial real estate and multi family residential loan portfolios grew from december  to december  the compression of the net interest margin also caused many in the industry  including the company  to look for other  non rate sensitive ways to increase income 
the company increased non interest income through fees from its overdraft protection program odp and commissions from its alternative investment program as a way to offset the impact from low interest rates 
non interest expense for the year ended december  was adversely affected by a million contribution to the company s defined benefit pension plan which was made to keep the plan appropriately funded and to avoid significantly higher estimated contributions in future years 
even after this contribution  compensation and employee benefits in remained relatively flat at of average assets 
also included in non interest expense is the million amortization related to the cost of the company s rrp 
the company amortized the costs of this plan over the five year vesting period 
in may  the plan will be fully vested and the company should realize a decrease in non interest expense related to the rrp 
lower pre tax income and tax planning efforts resulted in a reduction of total income tax expense to  for the year ended december  from million in the effective tax rates dropped to of pre tax income compared to for the company estimates that its effective rate for should return to previous levels 
critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and follow general practices within the industry in which it operates 
application of these principles requires management to make estimates or judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements  accordingly  as this information changes  the financial statements could reflect different estimates or judgments 
certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates  and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported 
estimates or judgments are necessary when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value  when a decline in the value of an asset not carried on the financial statements at fair value warrants an impairment write down or valuation reserve to be established  or when an asset or liability needs to be recorded contingent upon a future event 
carrying assets and liabilities at fair value inherently results in more financial statement volatility 
the fair values and the information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based either on quoted market prices or are provided by other third party sources  when available 
when third party information is not available  valuation adjustments are estimated in good faith by management primarily through the use of internal cash flow modeling techniques 
the most significant accounting policies followed by the company are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
these policies along with the disclosures presented in the other financial statement notes and in this management s discussion and analysis  provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined 
management views critical accounting policies to be those which are highly dependent on subjective or complex judgments  estimates and assumptions  and where changes in those estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on the financial statements 
management currently views the determination of the allowance for losses on loans to be a critical accounting policy 
allowance for losses on loans 
the allowance for losses on loans represents management s estimates of probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio which is the largest asset type on the consolidated balance sheet 
estimating the amount of the allowance for losses on loans requires significant judgment using estimates such as the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans  estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience  and consideration of current economic trends and conditions  all of which may be susceptible to significant change 
loan losses are charged off against the allowance  while recoveries of amounts previously charged off are credited to the allowance 
the company establishes provisions for losses on loans  which are charged to operations  in order to maintain the allowance for losses on loans at a level which is deemed appropriate to absorb losses inherent in the portfolio 
in determining the appropriate level of the allowance for losses on loans  management considers past and anticipated loss experience  evaluations of real estate collateral  current and anticipated economic conditions  volume and type of lending  and levels of non performing and other classified loans 
the amount of the allowance is based on estimates  and ultimate losses may vary from such estimates 
management assesses the allowance for losses on loans on a quarterly basis and makes appropriate provisions to maintain the allowance at an appropriate level 
the actual determination of the total provision is the combination of specific reserves  which may be established from time to time on individual classified assets and a general reserve that is based in part on certain ratios applied to various loan pools as stratified by the company considering historical charge offs and delinquency levels 
to the extent that actual outcomes differ from management estimates  an additional provision for loan losses could be required that could adversely affect earnings or financial position in future periods 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination processes  periodically review the bank s provision for losses on loans and the carrying value of its other non performing assets  based on information available to them at the time of their examinations 
any of these agencies could require the bank to make additional provisions for losses on loans in the future 
additionally  the company engages an independent third party to review its commercial loans and commercial real estate loans every four to six months 
the recommendations of this review are reviewed and compared to the company s asset classification  and adjustments are made as deemed appropriate by management 
changes in financial condition general 
during the year ended december   the company s total assets decreased by million to billion from billion at december  the significant changes in the composition of the company s balance sheet during the year ended december  include a net decrease in cash and cash equivalents of million  net decrease in securities of million  net increase in loans receivable of million  net increase in total deposits of million  and repayment of million in advances from the fhlb 
the shift between securities and loans receivable is a direct result of the company continuing its strategy to shift its assets from lower yielding securities to higher yielding commercial loans 
management is focused on developing its commercial relationships in its efforts to not only increase total yield on assets but to also provide an additional source of low cost funding through commercial deposits 
the company is also reinvesting excess funds in relatively low yielding assets with estimated average durations of two years or less as well as overnight funds with the expectation that they will be readily available for investment in higher yielding assets when the interest rate cycle turns upward 
the increase in deposits for the year was mainly a result of third and fourth quarter promotions for above market rate short term certificates of deposit which were offered as part of the bank s efforts to increase market share and build customer relationships 
at december   the company had approximately million outstanding in certificates of deposit with an average cost of from these promotions which will reprice during the first two quarters of as the company continues to expand into new markets  it may use similar promotions during to build market share and add new customer relationships 
the company has not  and does not intend to  utilize any other source of brokered deposits for building its deposit base in the future 
stockholders equity decreased during the year ended december  by million primarily due to million in repurchases of  shares of the company s common stock for treasury through the company s share repurchase program  and million of dividends declared on the company s common stock during the above decreases in stockholders equity were partially offset by net income of million  a million increase in accumulated other comprehensive income resulting from an increase in the market value of securities  net of tax  million from exercised stock options  million in shares earned for the company s employee stock ownership plan see note in the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k  and million of shares held by the company s retention and retirement plan becoming vested and issued to plan participants see note to the consolidated financial statements

the low interest rate environment impacts both interest income and interest expense 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net income 
net income for the year ended december  was million  or per diluted share per basic share  compared to million  or per diluted share per basic share  for the year ended december  the historically low interest rate environment continued in causing further deterioration in the company s net interest margin 
net interest income for the year ended december  decreased by million or from the previous year 
the company s results for the year ended december  were also adversely affected by a million contribution to the company s defined benefit pension plan to keep the plan appropriately funded and to avoid significantly higher estimated contributions in future years 
as with many pension plans  the company s plan had been adversely affected by three years of declining investment returns and record low interest rates which caused the level of funded benefits to drop significantly 
net interest income 
net interest income is the principal source of earnings for the company and consists of interest income on loans and investment securities less interest expense on deposits and borrowed funds 
net interest income is a function of the company s interest rate spread which is the difference between the average yield earned on the company s interest earning assets and the average rate paid on its interest bearing liabilities and the relative amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the company s average interest rate spreads were and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the company s net interest margin which is net interest income as a percentage of average interest earning assets was and during the years ended december  and  respectively 
the company s net interest income for the year ended december  totaled million and represented a million decrease from million for the year ended december  the decrease in net interest income was due primarily to the combined effects of the low interest rate environment and lower average balances of interest earning assets for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  interest income 
the company reported total interest income of million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the million or decrease was primarily due to a million decrease in total interest earning assets as well as a decrease in the average yield on interest earning assets of basis points for the year ended december  as compared to the company s interest earning assets continued to decline during as a result of unprecedented refinancing activity which caused significant rate reductions within the loan portfolio and accelerated amortization of premiums on its mortgage backed securities portfolio 
given the continuing low interest rate environment  the company has reinvested these funds predominantly in relatively low yielding assets with estimated average durations of two years or less as well as overnight funds with the expectation that they will be readily available for investment in higher yielding assets when the interest rate cycle turns upward 
during  the company made considerable progress in its strategy to transfer assets from lower yielding securities to higher yielding loans 
during the year ended december  compared to the previous year  average loan balances increased million or while the average balance of the company s securities portfolio decreased million or 
the company believes it has made significant progress in positioning the balance sheet to take advantage of the next interest rate cycle 
interest expense 
in contrast to the adverse impact on the asset side of the balance sheet  the low interest rate environment in provided some positive opportunities on the funding side 
the company proactively managed its funding costs throughout by aggressively lowering the interest rate paid on its non maturity deposits which historically have not been rate sensitive 
total interest expense amounted to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the million or reduction in interest expense during was primarily the result of a basis point reduction in the rate paid on total deposits coupled with a million decrease in the average balance of total deposits 
provision for losses on loans 
the company s provision for losses on loans was million for the year ended december  compared to million in the increase in provision is a result of the company s increased emphasis on growing the commercial real estate and multi family residential loan portfolios which are generally deemed to involve more risk of loss than single family residential real estate loans 
this change in emphasis has resulted in an increase in the allowance for losses on loans 
the company s allowance for losses on loans to total loans was and at december  and  respectively 
the company s non performing loans were million at december  compared to million at december   which represents an increase of million 
the primary changes in non performing loans by category included a decrease in non performing single family residential loans of approximately million  an increase in non performing commercial real estate  multi family residential and other commercial loans of approximately million  and an increase in non performing construction and land development loans of million 
the increase in non performing commercial real estate  multi family residential and construction and land development loans was primarily due to three loans with aggregate carrying values of million which were transferred to non accrual status in the fourth quarter of the company believes that these three loans are fully collateralized  and its risk of loss  if any  is minimal on these loans 
the ratio of the company s allowance for losses on loans to non performing loans was at december  compared to at december  although management believes that the company s allowance for losses on loans was adequate at december  based on available facts and circumstances  there can be no assurances that additions will not be necessary in the future 
any such additional provisions for losses on loans would adversely affect the company s results of operations 
non interest income 
the company reported non interest income of million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the primary reasons for the increase in non interest income in compared to were a million increase in fees on deposit accounts  and million increase in net gains on the sale of securities  which were partially offset compared to the company s results in by the absence of insurance commissions of million and the million net gain on sale of insurance agency that were realized during the increase in deposit fees during was mainly realized from the company s popular odp for retail and business checking customers 
during the first full year of the program  the company has of its retail and of its small business accounts enrolled in the program which provides a discretionary service or courtesy overdraft in case the customer s account becomes overdrawn 
normal overdraft fees and charges still apply under this program 
the company also realized  of commission income during the first full year of outsourcing its alternative investment program 
through this program the company s third party outsourcing partner sold nearly million of tax deferred annuities and other investments as an alternative investment to our depositors during this low rate environment 
management expects continued increases in overdraft fee income from its odp program as well as increased commission fee income from annuity sales through its outsourcing arrangement 
non interest expense 
the company reported non interest expense of million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  while the company s salary expense remained relatively stable during compared to  compensation and employee benefits expense increased as a result of a million payment to the company s defined benefit pension plan during the fourth quarter of as with many pension plans  the company s plan was adversely affected by three years of declining investment returns and record low interest rates which caused the level of funded benefits to drop significantly 
the voluntary contribution was made to keep the plan funded at a level deemed appropriate 
the company froze the benefits associated with this plan in march although no further benefits will accrue while the freeze remains in place  the freeze does not reduce the benefits accrued to date 
even though the benefits are frozen  the company will review the funding level and will continue to make necessary contributions to keep the plan appropriately funded 
professional fees were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the increase in professional fees was mainly the result of the company hiring independent third parties to perform an information systems technology assessment which led to the decision to move forward to upgrade our core data processor and helped prioritize additional technology systems and upgrades needed over the next few years  improve the process and underwriting for the company s home equity lines of credit heloc program which led to a successful implementation of our heloc equity access card  and implement an automated processing and underwriting program within the residential loan processing system to provide the company with a tiered pricing model which will lead to an improved yield and turnaround time thus making the company more competitive in originating residential mortgages 
income tax expense 
the company s income tax expense amounted to  and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the company s effective tax rates were and for the years ended december  and  respectively

the company estimates that its effective rate for should return to previous levels 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net income 
the company reported net income of million for the year ended december  compared to net income of million for the year ended december  the company s net interest income for the year ended december  decreased million from the year ended december  for the year ended december   results of operations were affected by lower average balances of interest earning assets  which is comprised primarily of loans and securities  as the result of continued accelerated repayments on mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities in the low interest rate environment  higher interest earning assets in compared to as the company emphasized the origination of commercial real estate  multi family residential and construction and land development loans  the realization of a million gain on the sale of the insurance agency assets  and the absence of a million gain on the sale of two laporte county bank branches recognized in net interest income

interest income 
the company reported total interest income of million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the million or decrease was primarily due to a million decrease in the average balances of securities from million in to million in  a reduction of basis points in the average yield earned on securities  the average balances of real estate loans decreasing by million to million in from million in  and a reduction of basis points in the yield earned on real estate loans

this change in emphasis was the primary reason for the increase in the allowance for losses on loans since the company s allowance for losses on loans to total loans was at december  compared to at december  the company s non performing loans were million at december  compared to million at december  the primary changes in non performing loans when comparing to were an overall decrease in non performing single family residential loans of approximately million and an increase in non performing commercial real estate loans 
the increase in non performing commercial real estate loans was primarily due to one loan of approximately million on a motel  which became non performing in the third quarter of the ratio of the company s allowance for losses on loans to non performing loans was at december  compared to at december  non interest income

the company s income tax expense amounted to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the company s effective rates were and for the years ended december  and the company has implemented several tax strategies in the past few years that have resulted in significant reductions in its effective tax rates 
liquidity and commitments the company s liquidity  represented by cash and cash equivalents  is a product of operating  investing and financing activities 
the company s primary historical sources of funds are deposits  scheduled payments of amortizing loans and mortgage backed securities  prepayments and maturities of outstanding loans and mortgage backed securities  maturities of investment securities and other short term investments  funds provided from operations  and borrowings from the fhlb 
scheduled payments from the amortization of loans  mortgage backed securities  maturing investment securities  and short term investments are relatively predictable sources of funds  while deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by market interest rates  economic conditions and competitive rate offerings 
in addition  the company invests excess funds in federal funds sold and other short term interest earning assets which provide liquidity to meet lending requirements 
at december   the company had cash and cash equivalents of million which was a decrease of million from december  liquidity management is both a daily and long term function 
excess liquidity is generally invested in short term investments such as interest bearing deposits and federal funds sold 
on a longer term basis  the company invests funds not used for maintaining and expanding the loan portfolio in securities  historically mortgage backed securities 
given the current low interest rate environment  the company is investing these funds predominantly in relatively low yielding assets with estimated average durations of two years or less with the expectation that the funds will be readily available for investment in higher yielding assets when the interest rate market turns upward 
the company uses its sources of funds primarily to meet its ongoing commitments  fund loan commitments  pay maturing certificates of deposit and savings withdrawals  and maintain a securities portfolio 
the company anticipates that it will continue to have sufficient funds to meet its current commitments 
the liquidity needs of the parent company  cfs bancorp  inc  consist primarily of operating expenses  dividend payments to stockholders and stock repurchases 
the primary sources of liquidity are securities available for sale and dividends from the bank 
on a parent company only basis  at december   the company had million in securities available for sale and  for the year ended december  received million in dividends from the bank 
however  these sources can also be supplemented by fees assessed by the company to the bank 
under certain banking regulations  the bank is required to file a notice or  under certain circumstances  an application with the ots prior to paying any dividends to the company 
in addition  the bank is required to maintain certain regulatory capital requirements 
at december   the bank was well capitalized 
see note in the consolidated financial statements for more information on the bank s regulatory capital 
contractual obligations 
the following table presents significant fixed and determinable contractual obligations to third parties by payment date as of december  payments due by period over one over three one year through through or less three years five years over five years total dollars in thousands federal home loan bank advances    operating leases   see note in the consolidated financial statements for further discussion surrounding the company s fhlb advances 
the company s operating lease obligations reflected above include the future minimum rental payments  by year  required under the lease terms for premises and equipment 
many of these leases contain renewal options  and certain leases provide options to purchase the leased property during or at the expiration of the lease period at specific prices 
see also to note in the consolidated financial statements for further discussion related to the company s operating leases 
the company also has commitments to fund maturing certificates of deposit which are scheduled to mature within one year or less 
these deposits total million at december  based on historical experience  management believes that a significant portion of the maturing deposits will remain with the bank 
off balance sheet obligations 
the company is a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers 
these financial instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheet 
the company s exposure to credit loss in the event of non performance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit and letters of credit is represented by the contractual notional amount of those instruments 
the company uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on balance sheet instruments 
the following table details the amounts and expected maturities of significant commitments as of december  over one over three one year through through or less three years five years over five years total dollars in thousands commitments to extend credit residential property   nonresidential property   commercial loans   commitments to fund unused lines of credit   letters of credit    credit enhancements     commitments to extend credit  including loan commitments  lines of credit and letters of credit do not necessarily represent future cash requirements  in that these commitments often expire without being drawn upon 
letters of credit include credit enhancements which are related to the issuance by municipalities of taxable and nontaxable revenue bonds 
the proceeds from the sale of such bonds are loaned to for profit and not for profit companies for economic development projects 
in order for the bonds to receive a triple a rating which provides for a lower interest rate  the fhlb in issues  in favor of the bond trustee  an irrevocable direct pay letter of credit for the account of the bank 
since the bank  in accordance with the terms and conditions of a reimbursement agreement between the fhlb in and the bank  would be required to reimburse the fhlb in for draws against the letter of credit  these facilities are analyzed  appraised  secured by real estate mortgages  and monitored as if the bank funded the project initially 
the company has not used  and has no intention of using  any significant off balance sheet financing arrangements for liquidity purposes 
in addition  the company has not had  and has no intention to have  any significant transactions  arrangements or other relationships with any unconsolidated  limited purpose entities that could materially affect the company s liquidity or capital resources 
the company has not traded in and has no intention of trading in derivatives or commodity contracts 
impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and related financial data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results generally in terms of historical dollars  without considering changes in relative purchasing power over time due to inflation 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all of the company s assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates generally have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than does the effect of inflation 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the bank  like other financial institutions  is subject to interest rate risk irr 
irr refers to the risk that changes in market interest rates might adversely affect net interest income or the net portfolio value npv of its assets  liabilities  and off balance sheet contracts 
irr is primarily the result of an imbalance between the price sensitivity of the bank s assets and its liabilities 
these imbalances can be caused by differences in the maturity  repricing  and coupon characteristics of assets and liabilities as well as options such as loan prepayment options 
the bank maintains a written asset liability management policy that establishes written guidelines for the asset liability management function  including the management of net interest margin  interest rate risk  and liquidity 
the asset liability management policy falls under the authority of the board of directors who in turn assigns its formulation  revision  and administration to the asset liability committee alco 
the alco meets monthly and consists of certain senior officers of the bank and one outside director 
the results of the monthly meetings are reported to the board of directors 
the primary duties of the alco are to develop reports and establish procedures to measure and monitor irr  verify compliance with board approved irr tolerance limits  take appropriate actions to mitigate those risks  monitor and discuss the status and results of implemented strategies and tactics  monitor the bank s capital position  review the current and prospective liquidity positions  and monitor alternative funding sources 
while maintaining its interest rate spread objectives  the bank attempts to reduce interest rate risk with a variety of strategies designed to maintain what the bank believes to be an appropriate relationship between its assets and liabilities 
first  the bank emphasizes real estate mortgage loans and commercial loans with adjustable interest rates or fixed rates of interest for an initial term of three or five years  that convert to an adjustable rate based on the one  three and five year constant maturity of united states treasury obligations as the index after the initial terms and for subsequent adjustment periods 
at december   the bank had approximately million of adjustable rate loans in its portfolio 
second  the bank s mortgage backed securities portfolio is made up primarily of securities that have expected average lives of five years or less at time of purchase 
third  the bank has a substantial amount of savings  demand deposit and money market accounts which the bank believes may be less sensitive to changes in interest rates than certificate accounts 
at december   the bank had million of these types of accounts 
the bank utilizes the ots npv model as its primary method of monitoring its exposure to irr 
the npv represents the excess of the present value of expected cash flows from assets over the present value of expected cash flows from liabilities 
the npv model estimates the sensitivity of the bank s npv over a series of instantaneous and sustained parallel shifts in interest rates 
on a quarterly basis  the alco reviews the calculations of npv as adjusted for expected cash flows from off balance sheet contracts  if any  for compliance with board approved tolerance limits 
the table below presents  as of december  and  an analysis of the bank s irr as measured by changes in npv for instantaneous and sustained parallel shifts in the yield curve in basis point increments  up to basis points and down basis points in and in accordance with ots regulations 
as illustrated in the table  the bank s npv in the base case basis point change increased million from million at december  to million at december  the primary reason for the increase was a reduction in the effective duration of the bank s fixed rate certificates of deposit and long term borrowings 
net portfolio value year ended december  amount change change amount change change dollars in thousands assumed change in interest rates basis points as modeled above  a decrease in interest rates of basis points would have an adverse impact on the bank s npv while an increase in interest rates of basis points would have a positive impact on the npv 
as rates begin to rise up to basis points  the adverse change in the value of the bank s assets is more than offset by the positive change in the value of the its liabilities 
as rates rise beyond basis points  the depreciation in the value of the bank s assets is not offset by the change in the value of its liabilities 
this is indicated by the negative and negative change in the and basis points scenarios  respectively  at december  at december  and december   the bank was within the board approved tolerance limits in each rate scenario 
this npv model is a static model and does not consider potential adjustments of strategies by management on a dynamic basis in a volatile rate environment in order to protect or conserve equity values 
as such  actual results may vary from the modeled results 
the above analysis includes the assets and liabilities of the bank only 
inclusion of holding company assets and liabilities would increase npv nominally at all levels
