excluding this million tax payment  fiscal year operating cash flow was million 
this increase from the prior year was primarily a result of growth in our business and the corresponding increase in net income 
the fiscal year growth of operating cash flow over fiscal year was negatively impacted by deferred taxes  which decreased from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year the decrease in deferred taxes was primarily due to differences in timing of deductibility of amortization as well as other tax and book differences 

table of contents during fiscal year  we generated million in cash flow from operations compared to the fiscal year amount of approximately million 
this increase from the prior year was primarily a result of growth in our business and the corresponding increase in net income 
the year over year growth in operating cash flow was also positively impacted by deferred taxes  which increased from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year this increase was a result of an increase in the amount of deductible goodwill and accelerated depreciation on property and equipment 
accounts receivable fluctuations may have a significant impact on our cash flows from operations 
the payments received from customers on our billed accounts receivables and the increase in such accounts receivable are reflected as a single component of our cash flow from operations  and the timing of collections of these receivables may have either a positive or negative impact on our liquidity

we believe this free cash flow metric provides an additional measure of available cash flow after we have satisfied the capital expenditure requirements of our operations  and should not be taken in isolation to be a measure of cash flow available for us to satisfy all of our obligations and execute our business strategies 
we also rely on cash flows from investing and financing activities  which together with free cash flow  are expected to be sufficient for us to execute our business strategies 
our measure of free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies

draws made under our credit facility are normally made to fund cash acquisitions  share repurchases and general working capital requirements 
during fiscal year  the balance outstanding under our credit facility for borrowings ranged from to million 
at june   we had million available under our credit facility  after giving effect to outstanding letters of credit of million that secure certain contractual performance and other obligations 
these letters of credit reduce the availability of our credit facility 
we had million outstanding on our credit facility  which is reflected in long term debt 
in august  letters of credit outstanding were reduced by million 
certain contracts  primarily in our government segment  require us to provide a surety bond or a letter of credit as a guarantee of performance 
as of june   outstanding surety bonds of million and million of our outstanding letters of credit secure our performance of contractual obligations with our clients 
in addition  we had approximately million of letters of credit outstanding which serve as collateral for our surety bond program 
approximately million of letters of credit secure our casualty insurance programs 
in general  we would only be liable for the amount of these guarantees in the event of default in our performance of our obligations under each contract  the probability of which we believe is remote 
we believe that we have sufficient capacity in the surety markets and liquidity from our cash flow and credit facility to respond to future requests for proposals 
our board of directors has authorized two share repurchase programs totaling billion of our class a common stock 
on september   we announced that our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program of up to million of our class a common stock and on april   we announced that our board of directors authorized a new  incremental share repurchase program of up to million of our class a common stock 
the programs  which are open ended  will allow us to repurchase our shares on the open market from time to time in accordance with sec rules and regulations  including shares that could be purchased pursuant to sec rule b the number of shares to be purchased and the timing of purchases will be based on the level of cash and debt balances  general business conditions and other factors  including alternative investment opportunities 
we intend to fund the repurchase program from various sources  including  but not limited to  cash on hand  cash flow from operations  and borrowings under our existing revolving credit facility 
as of june   we had repurchased approximately million shares at a total cost of approximately million 
we have not repurchased any shares subsequent to june  through the date of this filing 
on february   we completed the redemption of our convertible subordinated notes due february  the notes 
holders of of all the outstanding notes converted their notes to shares of our class a common stock per  principal amount of notes in accordance with the procedures specified in the related indenture governing the notes 
as the result of such conversions  approximately million shares of our class a common stock were issued to such noteholders at the conversion price of per share 
the remaining notes were redeemed in cash at of the principal amount  resulting in a cash redemption of  our management believes that available cash and cash equivalents  together with cash generated from operations and available borrowings under our credit facility  will provide adequate funds for our anticipated internal growth needs  including working capital expenditures 
our management also believes that cash provided by operations will be sufficient to satisfy all existing debt and other contractual obligations as they become due 
however  we intend to continue our growth through acquisitions and from time to time to engage in discussions with potential acquisition candidates 
in order to pursue such opportunities  which could require significant commitments of capital  we may be required to incur debt or to issue additional potentially dilutive securities in the future 
no assurance can be given as to our future acquisition and expansion opportunities and how such opportunities will be financed

table of contents for the amount of these guarantees in the event of default in our performance of our obligations under each contract  the probability of which we believe is remote 
we are obligated to make certain contingent payments to former shareholders of acquired entities upon satisfaction of certain contractual criteria 
as of june   the maximum aggregate amount of the outstanding contingent obligations is approximately million 
upon satisfaction of the specified contractual criteria  any such payment would result primarily in a corresponding increase in goodwill 
we have indemnified lockheed martin corporation against certain specified claims from certain pre sale litigation  investigations  government audits and other issues related to the divested federal business 
our contractual maximum exposure under these indemnifications is million  however  we believe the actual exposure to be significantly less 
as of june   other accrued liabilities include a reserve for these claims in an amount we believe to be adequate at this time 
as discussed in item legal proceedings  we have agreed to indemnify mantech international corporation with respect to the doj investigation related to purchasing activities at hanscom during the period our education services business  which is included in our commercial segment  performs third party student loan servicing in the federal family education loan program ffel on behalf of various financial institutions 
we service these loans for investors under an outsourcing arrangement and do not acquire any servicing rights that are transferable by us to a third party 
at june   we serviced a ffel portfolio of approximately million loans with an outstanding principal balance of approximately billion 
some servicing agreements contain provisions that  under certain circumstances  require us to purchase the loans from the investor if the loan guaranty has been permanently terminated as a result of a loan default caused by our servicing error 
if defaults caused by us are cured during an initial period  any obligation we may have to purchase these loans expires 
loans that we purchase may be subsequently cured  the guaranty reinstated and then we repackage the loans for sale to third parties 
we evaluate our exposure under our purchase obligations on defaulted loans and establish a reserve for potential losses  or default liability reserve  through a charge to the provision for loss on defaulted loans purchased 
the reserve is evaluated periodically and adjusted based upon management s analysis of the historical performance of the defaulted loans 
this reserve was approximately million and million at june  and  respectively 
during fiscal years  and  we purchased and charged against the reserve million  million and million of loans  respectively  and recovered or sold loans with proceeds totaling million  million and million  respectively  which were credited to our reserve 
we recorded provisions of million  million and million in fiscal years  and  respectively 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions or conditions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties and may result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements involve significant judgments and estimates 
revenue recognition 
a significant portion of our revenue is recognized based on objective criteria that does not require significant estimates or uncertainties 
for example  transaction volumes and time and costs under time and material and cost reimbursable arrangements are based on specific  objective criteria under the contracts 
accordingly  revenues recognized under these methods do not require the use of significant estimates that are susceptible to change 
revenue recognized using the percentage of completion accounting method does require the use of estimates and judgment as discussed below 
our policy follows the guidance from sec staff accounting bulletin revenue recognition sab 
sab provides guidance on the recognition  presentation  and disclosure of revenue in financial statements and updates existing staff accounting bulletin topic to be consistent with recently issued guidance  primarily emerging issues task force issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
we recognize revenues when persuasive evidence of 
table of contents an arrangement exists  the services have been provided to the client  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
during fiscal year  approximately of our revenue was recognized based on transaction volumes  approximately were fixed fee based  wherein our revenue is earned as we fulfill our performance obligations under the arrangement  approximately were related to cost reimbursable contracts  approximately of our revenues were recognized using percentage of completion accounting and the remainder is related to time and material contracts 
revenues on cost reimbursable contracts are recognized by applying an estimated factor to costs as incurred  such factor being determined by the contract provisions and prior experience 
revenues on unit price contracts are recognized at the contractual selling prices of work completed and accepted by the client 
revenues on time and material contracts are recognized at the contractual rates as the labor hours and direct expenses are incurred 
revenues for business process outsourcing services are recognized as services are rendered  generally on the basis of the number of accounts or transactions processed 
information technology processing revenues are recognized as services are provided to the client  generally at the contractual selling prices of resources consumed or capacity utilized by our clients 
revenues from annual maintenance contracts are deferred and recognized ratably over the maintenance period 
revenues from hardware sales are recognized upon delivery to the client and when uncertainties regarding customer acceptance have expired 
revenues on certain fixed price contracts where we provide information technology system development and implementation services are recognized over the contract term based on the percentage of development and implementation services that are provided during the period compared with the total estimated development and implementation services to be provided over the entire contract using statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts sop 
sop requires the use of percentage of completion accounting for long term contracts that are binding agreements between us and our customers in which we agree  for compensation  to perform a service to the customer s specifications 
these services require that we perform significant  extensive and complex design  development  modification and implementation activities for our customers systems 
performance will often extend over long periods  and our right to receive future payment depends on our future performance in accordance with the agreement 
the percentage of completion methodology involves recognizing revenue using the percentage of services completed  on a current cumulative cost to total cost basis  using a reasonably consistent profit margin over the period 
due to the longer term nature of these projects  developing the estimates of costs often requires significant judgment 
factors that must be considered in estimating the progress of work completed and ultimate cost of the projects include  but are not limited to  the availability of labor and labor productivity  the nature and complexity of the work to be performed  and the impact of delayed performance 
if changes occur in delivery  productivity or other factors used in developing the estimates of costs or revenues  we revise our cost and revenue estimates  which may result in increases or decreases in revenues and costs  and such revisions are reflected in income in the period in which the facts that give rise to that revision become known 
eitf addresses the accounting treatment for an arrangement to provide the delivery or performance of multiple products and or services where the delivery of a product or system or performance of services may occur at different points in time or over different periods of time 
the emerging issues task force reached a consensus regarding  among other issues  the applicability of the provisions regarding separation of contract elements in eitf to contracts where one or more elements fall within the scope of other authoritative literature  such as sop eitf does not impact the use of sop for contract elements that fall within the scope of sop  such as the implementation or development of an information technology system to client specifications under a long term contract 
where an implementation or development project is contracted with a client  and we will also provide services or operate the system over a period of time  eitf provides the methodology for separating the contract elements and allocating total arrangement consideration to the contract elements 
we adopted the provisions of eitf on a prospective basis to transactions entered into after july  we believe that eitf did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
revenues earned in excess of related billings are accrued  whereas billings in excess of revenues earned are deferred until the related services are provided 
valuation of goodwill and intangibles 
due to the fact that we are primarily a services company  our business acquisitions typically result in significant amounts of goodwill and other intangible assets  which affect the amount of future period 
table of contents amortization expense and possible expense we could incur as a result of an impairment 
in addition  in connection with our revenue arrangements  we incur costs to originate contracts and to perform the transition and setup activities necessary to enable us to perform under the terms of the arrangement 
we capitalize certain incremental direct costs in connection with these activities and amortize them over the term of the arrangement 
from time to time  we also provide certain inducements to customers in the form of various arrangements  including contractual credits  which are capitalized and amortized as a reduction of revenue over the term of the contract 
the determination of the value of goodwill and other intangibles requires us to make estimates and assumptions about future business trends and growth 
we continually evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the balance of goodwill or intangible assets may not be recoverable 
in evaluating impairment  we estimate the sum of expected future cash flows derived from the goodwill or intangible asset 
such evaluation is significantly impacted by estimates and assumptions of future revenues  costs and expenses and other factors 
if an event occurs which would cause us to revise our estimates and assumptions used in analyzing the value of our goodwill or other intangibles  such revision could result in a non cash impairment charge that could have a material impact on our financial results 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we make estimates of the collectibility of our accounts receivable 
we specifically analyze accounts receivable and historical bad debts  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends  and changes in our customer payment terms and collection trends when evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts 
any change in the assumptions used in analyzing a specific account receivable may result in additional allowance for doubtful accounts being recognized in the period in which the change occurs 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the sec issued sab sab updates existing staff accounting bulletin topic revenue recognition to be consistent with recently issued guidance  primarily eitf we do not believe that sab has had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
risks related to our business the risks described below should not be considered to be comprehensive and all inclusive 
additional risks that we do not yet know of or that we currently think are immaterial may also impair our business operations 
if any events occur that give rise to the following risks  our business  financial condition  cash flow or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected  and as a result  the trading price of our class a common stock could be materially and adversely impacted 
these risk factors should be read in conjunction with other information set forth in this report  including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes 
loss of  or reduction of business from  clients 
the loss of clients and or the reduction of volumes and services provided to our clients could materially affect our revenues  profitability and cash flows 
in addition  we incur fixed costs related to our information technology outsourcing and business process outsourcing clients 
therefore the loss of any one of our significant clients could leave us with a significantly higher level of fixed costs than is necessary to serve our remaining clients  thereby reducing our revenues  profitability and cash flow 
termination of all or a part of a contract by a client or deterioration of the financial condition of a client 
we may be required to make significant capital investments in order to attract and retain large outsourcing agreements 
the termination of all or a part of a client contract or the deterioration of the financial condition or prospects of a client has in the past  and may in the future  result in an impairment of the net book value of the assets recorded  including a portion of our intangible assets  and a reduction in our earnings and cash flow 
competition 
we expect to encounter additional competition as we address new markets and new competitors enter our existing markets 
if we are forced to lower our pricing or if demand for our services decreases  our business  financial condition  results of operations  and cash flow may be materially and adversely affected 
some of our competitors have greater resources  and they may be able to use their resources to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies or to devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products and services 
in addition  we must frequently compete with a client s own internal business process and information technology capabilities  which may constitute a fixed cost for the client 
difficulties in executing our acquisition strategy 
we intend to continue to expand our business through the acquisition of complementary companies 
we cannot  however  make any assurances that we will be able to identify any potential acquisition 
table of contents candidates or consummate any additional acquisitions or that any future acquisitions will be successfully integrated or will be advantageous to us 
without additional acquisitions  we are unlikely to maintain historical total growth rates 
failure to properly manage our operations and our growth 
we have rapidly expanded our operations in recent years 
we intend to continue expansion in the foreseeable future to pursue existing and potential market opportunities 
this rapid growth places a significant demand on our management and operational resources 
in order to manage growth effectively  we must implement and improve our operational systems  procedures  and controls on a timely basis 
if we fail to implement these systems  procedures and controls on a timely basis  we may not be able to service our clients needs  hire and retain new employees  pursue new business  complete future acquisitions or operate our businesses effectively 
we could also trigger contractual credits to clients 
failure to properly transition new customers to our systems  properly budget transition costs or accurately estimate new contract operational costs could result in delays in our contract performance  trigger service level penalties or result in contracts whose profit margins did not meet our expectations or our historical profit margins 
failure to properly integrate acquired operations could result in increased cost 
as a result of any of these problems associated with expansion  our business  financial condition  and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
government clients termination rights  audits and investigations 
a substantial portion of our revenues are derived from contracts with state and local governments and from contracts with the department of education 
governments and their agencies may terminate most of these contracts at any time  without cause 
also  our department of education contracts are subject to the approval of appropriations being made by the united states congress to fund the expenditures to be made by the federal government under these contracts 
additionally  government contracts are generally subject to audits and investigations by government agencies 
if the government finds that we improperly charged any costs to a contract  the costs are not reimbursable or  if already reimbursed  the cost must be refunded to the government 
if the government discovers improper or illegal activities in the course of audits or investigations  the contractor may be subject to various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions  which may include termination of contracts  forfeiture of profits  suspension of payments  fines and suspensions or debarment from doing business with the government 
any resulting penalties or sanctions could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flow 
further  the negative publicity that arises from findings in such audits  investigations or the penalties or sanctions therefore could have an adverse effect on our reputation in the industry and reduce our ability to compete for new contracts and may also have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flow 
exercise of contract termination provisions and service level penalties 
most of our contracts with our clients permit termination in the event our performance is not consistent with service levels specified in those contracts  or provide for credits to our clients for failure to meet service levels 
in addition  if clients are not satisfied with our level of performance  our clients may seek damages as permitted under the contract and or our reputation in the industry may suffer  which could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations  and cash flow 
pricing risks 
some of our contracts contain provisions requiring that our services be priced based on a pre established standard or benchmark regardless of the costs we incur in performing these services 
some of our contracts contain pricing provisions that require the client to pay a set fee for our services regardless of whether our costs to perform these services exceed the amount of the set fee 
some of our contracts contain re pricing provisions which can result in reductions of our fees for performing our services 
in such situations  we are exposed to the risk that we may be unable to price our services to levels that will permit recovery of our costs  and may adversely affect our operating results and cash flow 
loss of significant software vendor relationships 
our ability to service our clients depends to a large extent on our use of various software programs that we license from a small number of primary software vendors 
if our significant software vendors were to terminate or refuse to renew our contracts with them  we might not be able to replace the related software programs and would be unable to serve our clients  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  revenues  profitability and cash flow 
intellectual property infringement claims 
we rely heavily on the use of intellectual property 
we do not own the majority of the software that we use to run our business  instead we license this software from a small number of primary vendors 
if these vendors assert claims that we or our clients are infringing on their software or related intellectual property  we could incur substantial costs to defend these claims  which could have a material effect on our profitability and cash flow 
in addition  if any of our vendors infringement claims are ultimately successful  our vendors could require us to cease selling or using products or services that incorporate the challenged software or technology  to obtain a license or additional licenses from our vendors  or to redesign our products and services which rely on the challenged software or technology 
if we are unsuccessful in the 
table of contents defense of an infringement claim and our vendors require us to initiate any of the above actions  then such actions could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flow 
rapid technological changes 
the markets for our information technology services are subject to rapid technological changes and rapid changes in client requirements 
we may be unable to timely and successfully customize products and services that incorporate new technology or to deliver the services and products demanded by the marketplace 
federal and state laws relating to individually identifiable information 
we process and store information relating to identifiable individuals  both in our role as a service provider and as an employer 
as a result  we are subject to numerous federal and state laws and regulations designed to protect individually identifiable information  including financial and health information 
for example  in  congress passed the health insurance portability and accountability act and as required therein  the department of health and human services established regulations governing  among other things  the privacy  security and electronic transmission of individually identifiable health information 
we have taken measures to comply with each of those regulations on or before the required dates 
other federal and state laws apply to the processing of individually identifiable information as well  and additional legislation may be enacted at any time 
failure to comply with these types of laws may subject us to liability for monetary damages  fines and or criminal prosecution and may have a material adverse effect on our profitability and cash flow 
budget deficits at  or fluctuations in the number of requests for proposals issued by  state and local governments and their agencies 
a substantial portion of our revenues are derived from contracts with state and local governments and their agencies 
currently  many state and local governments that we have contracts with are facing potential budget deficits 
also  the number of requests for proposals issued by state and local government agencies is subject to fluctuation 
while this has not had a material adverse impact on our results of operations through fiscal year  it is unclear what impact  if any  these deficits may have on our future business  revenues  results of operations and cash flow 
international risks 
recently we have expanded our international operations and have also contemplated the acquisition of companies formed and operating in foreign countries 
we have approximately  employees in mexico  guatemala  india  ghana  jamaica  dominican republic  spain  malaysia  ireland  germany and china  as well as several other countries  that support our commercial business process outsourcing services 
international operations and acquisitions are subject to a number of risks including  but not limited to the following fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  licensing and labor counsel requirements  staffing key managerial positions  cultural differences  integration of companies  their management  and operations  which are located in distant locations  data privacy laws adopted by various countries in which we do business  including but not limited to member states of the european union  general economic conditions in foreign countries  additional expenses and risks inherent in conducting operations in geographically distant locations  laws of those foreign countries  political instability  trade restrictions such as tariffs and duties or other controls affecting foreign operations  and other factors that may adversely affect our business  financial condition and operating results 
armed hostilities and terrorist attacks 
terrorist attacks and further acts of violence or war may cause major instability in the us and other financial markets in which we operate 
in addition  armed hostilities and acts of terrorism may directly impact our physical facilities and operations  which are located in north america  central america  south america  europe  africa  australia  asia and the middle east  or those of our clients 
these developments subject our worldwide operations to increased risks and  depending on their magnitude  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
failure to attract and retain necessary technical personnel and skilled management and qualified subcontractors 
our success depends to a significant extent upon our ability to attract  retain and motivate highly skilled and qualified personnel and to subcontract with qualified  competent subcontractors 
if we fail to attract  train  and retain  sufficient numbers of these technically skilled people or are unable to contract with qualified  competent subcontractors  our business  financial condition  and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected 
our success also depends on the skills  experience  and performance of key members of our management team and on qualified  competent subcontractors 
the loss of any key employee or the loss of a key subcontract relationship could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition  cash flow  results of operations and prospects 
servicing risks 
we service for various lenders and under various service agreements a portfolio of approximately billion of loans made under the federal family education loan program  which loans are guaranteed by a federal government agency 
if a loan is in default  then a claim is made upon the guarantor 
if the guarantor denies the claim because of a servicing 
table of contents error  then under certain of the servicing agreements we may be required to purchase the loan from the lender 
upon purchase of the loan  we attempt to cure the servicing errors and either sell the loan back to the guarantor which must occur within a specified period of time or sell the loan on the open market to a third party 
we are subject to the risk that we may be unable to cure the servicing errors or sell the loan on the open market 
our reserves  which are based on historical information  may be inadequate if our servicing performance results in the requirement that we repurchase a substantial number of loans  which repurchase could have a material adverse impact on our cash flow and profitability 
disruption in utility or network services 
our services are dependent on the companies providing electricity and other utilities to our operating facilities  as well as network companies providing connectivity to our facilities and clients 
while there are backup systems in many of our operating facilities  an extended outage of utility services may have a material adverse effect on our operations  revenues  cash flow and profitability 
indemnification risk 
our contracts  including our agreements with respect to divestitures  include various indemnification obligations 
if we are required to satisfy an indemnification obligation  that may have a material adverse effect on our business  profitability and cash flow 
other risks 
we have attempted to identify material risk factors currently affecting our business and company 
however  additional risks that we do not yet know of  or that we currently think are immaterial  may occur or become material 
these risks could impair our business operations or adversely affect revenues  cash flow or profitability 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
sensitivity analysis is one technique used to measure the impact of changes in the interest rates and foreign exchange rates on our results of operations or financial position 
the following analysis provides a framework to understand our sensitivity to hypothetical changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates as of june  we have variable rate debt instruments 
our variable rate debt instruments are subject to market risk from changes in interest rates 
risk can be estimated by measuring the impact of a near term adverse movement of in short term market interest rates 
if these rates averaged higher or lower during fiscal years and  there would have been no material adverse impact on our results of operations 
we conduct business in the united states and in foreign countries 
we are exposed to foreign currency risk from changes in the value of underlying assets and liabilities of our non united states denominated foreign investments and foreign currency transactions 
risk can be estimated by measuring the impact of a near term adverse movement of in foreign currency rates against the us dollar 
if these rates averaged higher or lower in fiscal years or  there would have been no material adverse impact on our results of operations or financial position
