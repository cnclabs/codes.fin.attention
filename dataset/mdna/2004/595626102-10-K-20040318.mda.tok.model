b beginning in fiscal  the company began a process to transform itself from a worldwide operator of both franchised and company operated shops into a focused operator of the north american franchise system 
this transformation included the sale of midas franchised and company operated shop businesses in europe and australia  and a shift in focus to the licensing of midas trademarks and know how outside of north america 
within north america  the transformation included changing consumer perceptions about midas and the products and services offered  improving relationships with franchisees and redeploying assets to improve returns

retail operations consist of franchised and company operated midas shops in north america and licensed midas shops in other countries 
supply chain activities include the manufacture and distribution of exhaust products  the operation of a warehouse network that distributed automotive parts and accessories to midas and non midas automotive repair shops  and value added merchandising services under which the company establishes relationships with vendors who distribute products directly to midas shops 
real estate activities include the development  ownership and leasing of midas shops in north america 
midas has historically operated as an under car specialist focused on the replacement of exhaust  brakes  and shocks and struts 
as recently as  exhaust and brake repair services constituted of midas retail shop revenues in the us market 
as automobile manufacturers began to employ non corrosive stainless steel exhaust systems in the mid s  the average life of an original equipment exhaust system began to increase from three years to over years 
as a result  beginning in the mid s  midas core exhaust replacement business began to experience sustained revenue declines 
this trend  combined with the increased technological complexity and durability of newer vehicles  has changed the nature of automotive repairs 
today  the services performed over the lifetime of a vehicle are more likely to be maintenance services and light repair work 
in response to the above described trends  and in order to offset declining sales of exhaust products in the company s retail and wholesale distribution operations  the company began to expand its retail service offerings across the midas system 
in fiscal  the company launched an initiative to expand into categories such as general repair  heat exchange products and climate control services 
this expansion of midas retail service 
table of contents offerings has substantially offset the continuing deterioration in the exhaust replacement market  in which exhaust sales have declined at an average rate of per year at us midas shops since as a result  the average sales of a us midas system shop has been fairly stable over the past five years 
however  the financial and operating impact on the company s wholesale operations was much more severe 
from to  total revenues in the traditional wholesale distribution operation decreased more than driven by the steep erosion in the market for exhaust product replacement 
the company s wholesale operation expanded its product offerings in fiscal and in order to support the retail system s drive into new services 
however  the parts required in the new services tended to be higher cost  such that midas dealers preferred just in time sourcing of many of these parts 
consequently  the expansion of products in the wholesale operation did not significantly slow the decline in sales through the traditional wholesale distribution channel 
additionally  in fiscal the company launched parts warehouse  inc pwi  a network of small  quick delivery warehouses to serve the growing just in time parts requirements of midas and non midas professional installers 
while this operation better matched the evolving wholesale distribution needs of midas dealers  its growth from start up in fiscal to stores by fiscal required substantial working capital  and profitability suffered due to start up costs and low sales at newer locations 
by the close of fiscal  both the traditional wholesale parts distribution and the pwi quick delivery parts distribution operations were losing money 
furthermore  the company had over million in inventory committed to wholesale parts distribution  and held substantial accounts receivable related to these operations 
in growing these businesses during fiscal and  midas had incurred significant debt  which had risen to more than million 
during late fiscal and early fiscal  midas management determined that the wholesale operation was no longer a strategic asset and began the process of outsourcing the distribution of parts in north america and disposing of most wholesale distribution and pwi assets 
while the erosion in the profitability of the wholesale operation precipitated the need for change  the company s decision to outsource the wholesale parts distribution needs of the midas system has become the catalyst for a much more far reaching and dramatic restructuring of the midas system that is currently underway 
the midas business transformation during fiscal  midas developed and began to implement a plan to dramatically restructure the company s operations and re direct the company s strategic focus towards the midas retail system 
this plan is intended to transform the company by improving profitability  enhancing the competitive position of the midas retail system  strengthening the company s balance sheet and reducing the future capital requirements 
this transformation encompasses sweeping changes in the way midas dealers are supplied with genuine midas products and other replacement auto parts  a re definition of the service relationship between midas dealers and their customers  and a shift in the way the company approaches its relationship with midas franchisees 
certain aspects of the transformation have been completed in fiscal during the past year  the company outsourced the wholesale distribution of genuine midas products and other replacement parts  closed all but one of the company s regional distribution centers  disposed of all pwi quick delivery distribution locations through sale or closure  closed or re franchised company operated shops  and significantly reduced corporate administrative overhead 
however  other changes to the way midas does business continue to evolve  and this process will continue during fiscal the ultimate objective of this business transformation is reflected in midas vision of midas management is working towards increase in midas shop sales on a same store basis 
three core services brakes  exhaust and maintenance 
doubling of midas dealer profits 
one midas the company and midas dealers working together as one in support of the retail system 

table of contents with these goals in mind  midas management is committed to the company s mission of becoming the most trusted professional and first choice for customers auto service needs 
the specific components of the midas business transformation and how the company intends to move forward are discussed in greater detail below 
distribution transformation historically  the company supported the midas franchise network with manufacturing of certain exhaust products and distribution of genuine midas products and other replacement auto parts on a weekly basis to its retail shops in north america 
the company distributed these products through a network of regional wholesale parts distribution centers 
additionally  as dealers began to source more product on a just in time basis  the company supported numerous midas dealers through its network of pwi quick delivery locations 
together  these two wholesale operations provided a significant portion of the typical midas dealer s ongoing parts sourcing needs 
however  the combined wholesale operation generated operating losses  driven by eroding sales of traditional wholesale products  especially exhaust  and start up losses associated with newer pwi locations 
furthermore  as of the end of fiscal  the company still needed to build an additional to pwi locations to adequately cover midas dealers across north america 
in response to the operating losses and significant current and future capital requirements of these wholesale operations  midas determined that continuing to support the traditional midas wholesale distribution operation and the growth of the pwi network was no longer financially viable  and that the parts sourcing needs of midas system dealers could be better served by outsourcing the distribution of genuine midas parts in the us and canada 
thus  during fiscal midas closed its traditional midas wholesale parts distribution and pwi quick delivery operations and appointed autozone  inc and uni select inc as the exclusive distributors of genuine midas products in the us and canada  respectively 
the company s agreements with autozone and uni select provide for the weekly distribution of replacement parts to midas retail shops  consistent with the service previously provided by the company s traditional wholesale operation 
the company believes these agreements enable midas dealers to purchase both genuine midas product and other replacement auto parts at favorable pricing  and provide dealers with access to just in time parts delivery through a broad network of quick delivery parts distribution sites across north america 
under the agreements with autozone and uni select  the company receives royalties on the sale of all products sold by autozone and uni select to midas dealers throughout north america 
these royalties are intended to offset the cash expenses associated with the lifetime warranty issued on all genuine midas products 
thus  through this distribution transformation process  the company has eliminated operating losses and working capital requirements associated with the traditional midas wholesale and pwi operations  and replaced them with product royalties that require little working capital investment 
retail transformation the midas system of retail service shops has historically operated as an under car specialist focused primarily on the replacement of exhaust  brakes  and shocks and struts 
consequently  much of the work performed by midas shops represented one time repair transactions 
however  changes in the quality of original equipment parts and the technological complexity of automobiles over the past decade have changed the nature of automotive repair 
the services performed over the lifetime of today s vehicles are more likely to be scheduled maintenance services and light repair work 
the company s initial response to these trends was to promote the expansion of services offered by midas dealers 
this program was known as the new midas and was launched in fiscal while the midas retail system made progress in broadening its services  it has not yet been successful in developing ongoing service relationships with its customers 
going forward  midas is focused on becoming less dependent upon one time transactions and more focused on building long term customer relationships 
the company intends to transform itself from a repair business that offers maintenance service  into a maintenance business that performs repairs 
to this end  the company has 
table of contents re defined the core services of the midas system to now encompass exhaust  brakes and maintenance 
midas is launching a major retail initiative in fiscal to significantly expand dealer sales of tires and related tire services 
also  the company is currently developing a comprehensive program targeting the fleet vehicle maintenance market segment 
this program is designed to leverage the national scope of the midas system and equip dealers with the necessary tools to build sustainable fleet service revenues 
finally  the company is developing a customer relationship marketing crm program with its dealers primarily focused on increasing repeat shop visits 
with these programs in place  the company believes it will begin to drive top line sales growth in the midas system after several years of virtually no growth on a same store basis 
corporate transformation with the outsourcing of the company s wholesale distribution and pwi operations during fiscal  midas corporate direction is focused on the midas retail system 
now and in the future  all of the company s operations and activities are assessed based on their contribution to the overall corporate goal of building a successful retail system in north america and the world 
as part of the company s restructuring  all corporate positions were evaluated 
consistent with the company s strategic focus  there has been a significant reduction in the total number of employees across all operations  from approximately  employees at the close of fiscal to approximately at the end of fiscal in addition to the decrease in the total number of employees  the nature of the work performed has changed  as existing roles have been re defined 
for example  whereas before this transformation process began the company s franchise system district managers were engaged in monitoring compliance with various wholesale initiatives  today their roles are squarely focused on assisting midas franchisees and coordinating the rollout of key retail initiatives 
this corporate transformation will continue to evolve based on the needs of the retail system 
midas believes it has taken the necessary steps to eliminate excess administrative expense and focus management action towards the new corporate direction 
financial transformation as of fiscal year end  midas was a highly leveraged company with substantial investments in fixed assets and working capital 
midas wholesale distribution operations  including the traditional midas wholesale operation and the pwi network  were both generating operating losses 
the combined wholesale distribution operation had over million in merchandise inventory  and the company held more than million in accounts receivable generated by wholesale activity 
furthermore  the company maintained its investment in regional distribution centers and pwi locations with ongoing capital expenditures 
facing continuing losses in the wholesale operations  midas determined that continuing to support the traditional midas wholesale distribution operation and pwi network was no longer financially viable  and that the parts sourcing needs of midas system dealers could be better achieved by outsourcing the distribution of genuine midas products and other replacement parts in the us and canada 
as a result  during fiscal midas closed all but one of its regional distribution centers and disposed of all of its pwi locations through sale or closure 
the liquidation of inventory from the various wholesale operations enabled midas to pay down more than million in debt by fiscal year end in addition  the company was able to substantially reduce accounts payable and fund costs and ongoing obligations associated with the business transformation 
write offs associated with the business transformation process have led to a large decrease in shareholders equity 
however  as of year end fiscal  the company s balance sheet reflects much less leverage 
going forward in  total sales will decline to approximately million from the more than million in sales generated in fiscal on this reduced sales base midas believes it will return to profitability in fiscal  generating substantial cash flow in excess of the company s capital investment requirements 
in the long term  midas management believes it can achieve operating margins through the successful execution of the company s vision 
table of contents business transformation charges the charges recorded in association with the company s business transformation process in fiscal and fiscal are summarized in the following tables business transformation charges by strategic initiative fiscal year disposition of parts warehouse  inc rationalization of company operated shops redesign of the wholesale distribution network severance and administrative costs total business transformation charges business transformation charges by activity fiscal year warranty reserve establishment inventory write down goodwill write off and impairment accounts receivable write down fixed asset write off and impairment severance and other separation costs non recoverable lease costs warehouse and other closure costs financing costs pension asset write down other costs total business transformation charges additional information regarding each of the business transformation costs listed in the above summary is presented in note of notes to financial statements 
fiscal reporting periods fiscal year was comprised of weeks  while fiscal years and were comprised of weeks 
results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal sales and revenues for fiscal decreased million or from fiscal to million 
replacement part sales and product royalties decreased million to million from million in fiscal replacement part sales through the company s traditional wholesale distribution channel increased driven primarily by the sale and liquidation of wholesale inventory in connection with the company s recent agreements to outsource wholesale parts distribution to autozone  inc in the us and uni select inc 
in canada 
excluding the sale and liquidation of inventory related to the company s decision to outsource wholesale distribution  replacement part sales through the traditional channel would have decreased during fiscal  consistent with long term negative sales trends in the traditional wholesale channel  as well as reflecting the closure of all but one of the company s traditional wholesale warehouses by fiscal year end replacement part sales through the company s pwi wholesale distribution channel  which served the just in time replacement parts needs of midas dealers and customers outside the midas system  decreased  reflecting the closure of all pwi stores during fiscal 
table of contents within the retail auto service business  franchise royalties and license fees decreased million or from fiscal the decrease was primarily due to a decline in international royalties and license fees due to a restructuring of the company s licensing agreement with magneti marelli spa comparable shop sales at retail in north america were approximately flat compared to the prior year 
a reduction in the midas system total shop count from the prior fiscal year was offset by favorable canadian currency exchange rates and an increase in franchise fees as a result of the re franchising of company operated shops during the fiscal year 
revenues from company operated shops declined million  or a decrease of from fiscal the sales decrease primarily reflects a decline in comparable shop sales of  the closure of under performing shops and the re franchising of shops during fiscal the number of company operated shops in operation at january  declined to  compared to shops at the end of fiscal revenue from real estate rentals was down million to fiscal driven by the reduction in the midas system shop count  partially offset by favorable canadian currency exchange rates and rental revenue from re franchised company operated shops 
the company s gross profit margin  including business transformation charges of million in fiscal and million in fiscal  decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal the company s gross profit margin excluding business transformation charges decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal this decline was primarily due to the company s sale of certain wholesale inventory at cost in connection with the outsourcing of traditional midas wholesale distribution to autozone and uni select  and the liquidation of inventory in the pwi distribution channel 
the increased proportion of total sales related to franchise royalties  and royalties received on the sale of replacement parts by autozone and uni select to midas dealers in the us and canada  helped to somewhat offset the negative margin impact of sales related to the wholesale inventory reduction process 
lower margins in real estate primarily reflect reduced rental income on certain sales based rental agreements  the full year impact of depreciation associated with a sale and leaseback of certain previously owned retail properties in fiscal  as well as reduced rental revenue from midas dealers due to shop closures 
during fiscal  the company entered into supply agreements with autozone  inc in the us and uni select inc 
in canada to provide weekly distribution of genuine midas products and other automotive parts to midas dealers throughout north america 
as a result of these outsourcing arrangements  the company no longer operates the traditional midas wholesale distribution business in the us or canada  and the company has ceased operations in all but one of the company s wholesale distribution centers 
during fiscal  the company recorded an inventory write down of million to reduce its wholesale distribution inventory to its expected net realizable value 
this write down was recorded as a component of cost of sales 
in fiscal  the company recorded a charge of million in cost of sales to reduce the value of pwi inventory to its expected net realizable value  as the company had committed to the liquidation of pwi prior to the close of fiscal the company recorded an additional business transformation charge in cost of sales during fiscal to establish a million accrual for estimated future warranty claims 
this accrual relates to warranties issued to customers in the u 
s and canada for certain exhaust and brake parts that carry a lifetime warranty 
the company had not historically maintained an accrual for estimated future warranty claims related to its lifetime guarantee of exhaust and brake products 
instead  the company had historically recorded expenses related to these product warranties as warranty claims were incurred 
this was due to the fact that the average warranty claim generated gross profit to the company  as the revenues and gross profit to midas from a warranty claim exceeded the cost of reimbursement to the franchisee 
as a result of the outsourcing of the wholesale distribution function to autozone in the us and uni select in canada  midas will no longer generate sufficient gross profit on a warranty claim to offset the average warranty claim reimbursement 
consequently  the company recorded million in charges to reflect its estimated liability associated with outstanding warranties in the us and canada 
on a going forward basis  midas will accrue for the expected future cost of warranty redemptions at the time of the original installation of the warranted part 
this treatment will not affect cash flow associated with warranty redemptions 
selling  general and distribution expenses for fiscal decreased million  or from to million 
lower operating expenses resulted from fewer pwi stores and company operated shops in 
table of contents operation  the closure of all but one of the company s wholesale distribution centers and a reduction in payroll expense due to administrative headcount reductions made in association with the company s business transformation process 
however  these savings were partially offset by incremental expenses incurred during the sale and closure of pwi stores and company operated shop locations  and higher distribution costs related to the liquidation of inventory 
during fiscal  the company recorded charges of million as part of selling  general and distribution expenses related to the company s business transformation process 
these charges are described above and in note of notes to financial statements 
as a result of the above  the company s operating loss increased million from a loss of million in fiscal to a loss of million in fiscal excluding the impact of the above described business transformation charges of million  operating income in fiscal would have been million compared to million in fiscal after excluding million in business transformation charges 
interest expense increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal as a result of higher interest rates compared to the prior year  higher average debt levels  and the amortization of fees associated with the company s financing agreement completed on march  the company s effective tax rate was in both fiscal and fiscal as a result of the above items  the company s net loss increased million from a net loss of million in fiscal to a net loss of million in fiscal results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal sales and revenues for fiscal increased million or from fiscal to million  as a decline in replacement part sales was offset by increased sales from company operated shops 
replacement parts sales for fiscal decreased million to million from million in fiscal replacement parts sales through the company s traditional wholesale distribution channel declined 
this performance was driven mostly by continued erosion in demand for replacement exhaust systems and increased just in time parts sourcing by traditional wholesale customers 
at the same time  replacement parts sales through the company s pwi wholesale distribution channel  which serves the just in time replacement parts needs of midas dealers and customers outside the midas system  increased by 
sales growth in the pwi channel primarily reflected an expanded network of pwi sites compared with the prior year 
within the retail auto service business  fiscal revenues from company operated shops increased million over fiscal the sales increase reflects substantial growth in the average number of company operated shops in operation during fiscal  partially offset by a decrease in comparable shop sales 
royalty revenues and license fees were down from fiscal due to an increase in the number of company operated shops  whose sales no longer generate royalty revenue  as well as a decline of approximately in system wide comparable shop midas retail sales 
revenues from real estate rentals declined slightly 
the company s gross profit margin before inventory write down increased from in fiscal to in fiscal this improvement was primarily due to the increase in higher margin retail sales from company operated shops  as well as improvement in margins on replacement part sales as a result of a more favorable product and customer mix in the company s pwi sales channel 
during the fourth quarter of  the company determined that it would dispose of its pwi operations through the sale of locations and liquidation of inventory and recorded an inventory write down of million to reduce its pwi related inventory to its expected net realizable value 
as a result  the company s gross profit declined million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  and the company s gross profit margin decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal 
table of contents selling  general and distribution expenses for fiscal increased million  or over fiscal to million 
this increase consists of incremental operating expenses associated with additional company operated shops and pwi sites  as well as unusually high medical claim and workers compensation expenses experienced during the second half of the year 
partially offsetting these higher costs were lower operating expenses associated with sales declines in the traditional wholesale parts distribution business and lower corporate administrative expense resulting from actions taken to reduce corporate staff in january as a result of these factors  selling  general and distribution expenses as a percentage of total sales and revenues increased from in fiscal to in fiscal in fiscal  the company recorded business transformation charges of million related to the implementation of its ongoing business transformation initiatives 
these charges are summarized above and described in detail in note of notes to financial statements 
as a result of the above  operating income declined million from income of million in fiscal to a loss of million in fiscal these changes caused a decrease in operating income margin from in fiscal to a negative in fiscal excluding the above described business transformation costs incurred for the write down of inventory and business transformation charges  the company s operating income decreased million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal interest expense increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal as result of higher debt levels associated with funding the company s expansion of its company operated shop and pwi businesses over the past two years 
the company s effective tax rate was in fiscal compared to in fiscal as a result of the above items  the company s net income decreased million from income of million in fiscal to a net loss of million in fiscal liquidity  financial condition and capital resources following is a summary of the company s cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities for fiscal and  respectively in millions fiscal year net cash provided by used in operating activities net cash provided by used in investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities net change in cash and cash equivalents midas cash and cash equivalents increased million during fiscal the company s operating activities generated net cash of million during fiscal compared to million of cash used in fiscal the year over year improvement in cash flow from operations of million was primarily due to a million decrease in net income and a million increase in the deferred tax benefit  offset by a million increase in business transformation costs net of payments  a million increase in amortization of debt discount and financing fees  and changes in assets and liabilities requiring million less cash than the prior year 
changes in assets and liabilities generated million of cash in fiscal compared to a use of million in fiscal the million source of cash in fiscal was primarily due to a million reduction in inventory and a million reduction in receivables required to support the substantially smaller wholesale parts distribution operation and an million increase in accrued expenses  partially offset by a million reduction in accounts payable 
the million use of cash in 
table of contents fiscal consisted primarily of a million reduction in accounts payable due to the expiration of vendor terms granted to support the growth in inventory  a million decrease in accrued expenses due to the timing of advertising payments  and an million increase in accounts receivable 
investing activities generated million in cash during fiscal compared to using million in cash during fiscal fiscal investing activities primarily consisted of million in systems development projects and other maintenance capital expenditures  offset by million in cash generated as the result of asset sales related to the company s business transformation process 
during fiscal  the company generated cash through a sale and leaseback of the company s taunton distribution facility  the sale of certain parts warehouse  inc pwi locations and the re franchising of certain company operated shops 
fiscal investing activities primarily consisted of ongoing systems development and capital expenditures to upgrade company operated shops acquired during the fourth quarter of fiscal net cash used in financing activities was million in fiscal  compared to net cash generated of million during fiscal in fiscal  the company issued million warrants in connection with the debt restructuring discussed below 
these warrants were valued at million and recorded as an increase in paid in capital 
additionally  the company had a net reduction in debt and lease obligations of million and paid million for debt financing fees 
in fiscal  the cash was primarily generated through an increase in net borrowings  including the incurrence of a finance lease obligation related to the sale and leaseback of owned properties 
the company suspended the payment of dividends to shareholders in and does not expect that it will resume dividend payments in the near future 
during fiscal  the company improved liquidity through the refinancing of its prior debt structure 
as of december   the company had a five year  revolving credit facility with a syndicate of commercial banks and financial institutions that enabled the company to borrow funds at variable interest rates on a revolving credit basis up to an aggregate principal amount of million 
the first million of borrowings under this facility was unsecured  while borrowings above million were secured by certain domestic assets of the company 
the company also had million of unsecured debt outstanding with a fixed rate of 
annual principal payments of million were due each year on april th with the final maturity on april  the company s former revolving credit facility was scheduled to expire in january prior to its expiration  the lenders extended the maturity date to march  on march   the company entered into a comprehensive debt restructuring with its existing lenders 
under the terms of the debt restructuring  the company retired both its million revolving credit facility as well as its million unsecured notes 
due to the refinancing of the company s debt in march  all debt was classified as long term in the december  balance sheet 
the replacement facilities reflected an aggregate commitment of million and consisted of a million revolving loan facility  a million term loan a  and a million term loan b 
the new facilities were secured by substantially all of the assets of the company and were scheduled to expire on october  interest on the revolving loan was payable monthly at the prime rate plus or libor plus 
interest on a portion of the term loan a was fixed at  while interest on the balance of the term loan a was payable monthly at the prime rate plus or libor plus 
the interest rate on the term loan b was fixed at cash interest paid monthly plus paid in kind pik  which was added to principal and due at maturity 
availability under the revolving credit facility was based on a borrowing base  which took into consideration the company s inventory and accounts receivable levels 
the revolving credit facility was senior to both the term loan a and term loan b 
in connection with the fiscal debt restructuring  the company issued detachable warrants to its existing lenders for million shares of the company s common stock 
fifty percent of the warrants  were immediately exercisable upon the consummation of the debt agreement 
a provision in the debt agreement 
table of contents allowed the company to reclaim the other fifty percent of the warrants if it achieved certain financial objectives on or before january  in december  the company met the financial objectives and fifty percent of the warrants  were automatically cancelled on january  the exercise price of the warrants is  and the warrants are exercisable at any time up to the tenth anniversary of issuance 
as of january   a total of  warrants of the  warrants have been exercised 
the above described march debt refinancing provided the company with the financial flexibility to implement certain business transformation initiatives in order to improve operating performance  reduce debt and reduce interest expense 
these initiatives included the disposition of pwi  the closing and re franchising of certain company operated shops  and the closing of all but one wholesale distribution center 
the implementation of these initiatives has been substantially completed 
the company generated increased cash flow from these actions and expects to further improve cash flow and reduce debt during fiscal as a direct consequence of the restructuring programs 
on march   the company entered into a new three year  million credit facility to refinance its existing debt facility 
the new debt facility is comprised of a million revolving credit facility and a million term loan 
the new facilities are secured by substantially all of the assets of the company and expire on march  under the terms of the debt refinancing  the company retired its former million revolving credit facility as well as its term a and term b loans 
the refinancing will result in a loss on extinguishment of debt of approximately million as a result of the write off of unamortized debt discount and financing fees 
due to the refinancing of the company s debt in march  all debt was classified as long term in the january  balance sheet 
interest on the million revolving loan is initially payable monthly at libor plus 
interest on the million term loan is initially payable monthly at libor plus 
the interest rates float based on the underlying rate of libor and the company s leverage 
availability under the revolving credit facility is not predicated on a borrowing base 
the term loan requires quarterly principal payments of million on july  and million thereafter 
in addition  the term loan must be prepaid by an amount equal to i of equity issued  or ii of any material asset proceeds in excess of million other than the sale of inventory in the normal course of business  or iii of any excess cash flow as provided for by the agreement 
the new facilities require maintenance of certain financial covenants including maximum allowable leverage and minimum tangible net worth 
in order to manage its interest rate risk  the company expects to enter into interest rate swap agreements during fiscal that will convert a portion of its new debt facility from a floating interest rate into a fixed interest rate 
with the new debt agreement in place  the company believes it has sufficient access to liquidity to move forward and execute the company s strategic initiatives

such decisions include the selection of the appropriate accounting principles to be applied  the assumptions on which to base accounting estimates  and the consistent application of those accounting principles 
due to the type of industry in which the company operates and the nature of its business  and the company s existing business transformation process  the following accounting policies are those that management believes are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results and that require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
valuation of warranty liabilities customers are provided a written warranty from midas on genuine midas products purchased from midas shops in north america 
the warranty will be honored at any midas shop in north america and is valid for the lifetime of the vehicle  but is voided if the vehicle is sold 
the company maintains a warranty accrual to cover the estimated future liability associated with outstanding warranties 
the company determines the estimated value of outstanding warranty claims based on an estimate of the percentage of all warranted products sold and registered in prior periods at retail that are likely to be redeemed  and an estimate of the cost of redemption of each future warranty claim on a current cost basis 
these estimates are computed using actual historical registration and redemption data as well as actual cost information on current redemptions 
prior to fiscal  the company had not maintained an accrual for estimated future warranty claims related to its lifetime guarantee of exhaust and brake products 
instead  the company recorded expenses related to these product warranties as warranty claims were incurred 
this was due to the fact that the average warranty claim generated gross profit to the company  as the revenues and gross profit to midas from a warranty claim exceeded the cost of reimbursement to the franchisee 
as a result of the fiscal outsourcing of the midas distribution function to autozone  inc in the us  and uni select inc in canada  midas no longer generates sufficient gross profit on a warranty claim to offset the average warranty claim reimbursement 
consequently  the company recorded charges during fiscal to reflect its estimated liability associated with outstanding warranties in the us and canada 
on a going forward basis  midas will accrue for the expected future cost of warranty redemptions at the time of the original installation of the warranted part based on the method described above 
this treatment will not affect cash flow associated with warranty redemptions in either the u 
s or canada 

table of contents inventory valuation as a manufacturer and distributor of certain automotive aftermarket parts  inventory has historically represented a substantial portion of the total assets of the company 
inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value 
inventory cost is determined using the weighted average cost method  which approximates the first in  first out method 
additionally  the company periodically evaluates the carrying value of its inventory to assess the proper valuation 
this includes having adequate accruals to cover losses in the normal course of operation  provide for excess and obsolete inventory  and ensure that inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market 
in performing this evaluation the company considers historical data such as actual loss experience  past and projected usage  and actual margins generated from sales of its products 
during fiscal  the company sold and liquidated inventory in connection with the implementation of its ongoing business transformation 
the company recorded charges in fiscal and fiscal to write down certain inventories to their net realizable value as a result of the disposition of pwi and the outsourcing of the company s wholesale parts distribution operation 
in assessing the net realizable value of the inventory that was to be sold and liquidated during fiscal  the company considered original cost  past and projected usage  independent third party appraisals and offers made by potential buyers 
valuation of receivables the company records receivables due from its franchisees and other customers at the time the sale is recorded in accordance with its revenue recognition policies 
these receivables consist of amounts due from the sale of products  royalties due from franchisees and suppliers  rents and other amounts 
the future collectibility of these amounts can be impacted by the company s collection efforts  the financial stability of its customers  and the general economic climate in which it operates 
the company applies a consistent practice of establishing an allowance for accounts that it feels may become uncollectible through reviewing the historical aging of its receivables and by monitoring the financial strength of its franchisees and other customers 
where the company becomes aware of a customer s inability to meet its financial obligations eg where it is in financial distress or has filed for bankruptcy  the company specifically reserves for the potential bad debt to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount it reasonably believes will be collected 
the valuation of receivables is performed on a quarterly basis 
in connection with the disposal of the pwi business and the exit of the midas wholesale distribution business  in valuing outstanding receivable balances the company also considered the reduced collection efforts that result from the closings as well as the increased likelihood that customers will not pay amounts due 
pensions the company has non contributory defined benefit pension plans covering certain of its employees 
the company s funding policy for the us plan is to contribute amounts sufficient to meet the minimum funding requirement of the employee retirement income act of  plus any additional amounts the company may deem to be appropriate 
the company accounts for its defined benefit pension plans in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  which requires that amounts recognized in the financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis 
a minimum liability is required to be established on the balance sheet representing the amount of unfunded accrued pension cost 
this represents the difference between the accumulated benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets 
when it is necessary to establish an additional minimum pension liability  an amount is recorded as an intangible asset limited to unrecognized prior service cost 
any amount in excess of unrecognized prior service cost is recorded as a reduction to shareholders equity through cumulative other comprehensive income  net of tax  in the balance sheet 
as of january   the company has recorded an intangible pension asset of million and an accumulated reduction to shareholders equity of million  net of taxes 
to account for its defined benefit pension plans in accordance with sfas no 
 the company must make three main determinations at the end of each fiscal year first  it must determine the actuarial assumption for the 
table of contents discount rate used to reflect the time value of money in the calculation of the projected benefit obligation for the end of the current fiscal year and to determine the net periodic pension cost for the subsequent year 
for guidance in determining this rate  the company looks at rates of return on high quality fixed income investments and periodic published rate ranges 
see note of notes to financial statements for a listing of the discount rates used by year 
second  the company must determine the actuarial assumption for rates of increase in compensation levels used in the calculation of the accumulated and projected benefit obligations for the end of the current fiscal year and to determine the net periodic pension cost for the subsequent year 
in determining this rate the company looks at its historical and expected rates of annual salary increases 
see note of notes to financial statements for a listing of the rates of increase in compensation levels used by year 
third  the company must determine the expected long term rate of return on assets assumption that is used to determine the expected return on plan assets component of the net periodic pension cost for the subsequent year 
the difference between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return is deferred under sfas no 
and is recognized to net periodic pension cost over a five year period 
see note of notes to financial statements for a listing of the expected long term rates used by year 
the company assumed a long term rate of return of on pension assets in fiscal and in fiscal  but experienced a gain of million in fiscal and a loss of million in fiscal carrying values of goodwill and long lived assets goodwill represents the amount paid in consideration for an acquisition in excess of the fair value of assets acquired 
in accordance with sfas no 
 the company did not amortize goodwill for new acquisitions made after june  for acquisitions prior to that date  the company continued to amortize goodwill through the end of fiscal the company conducts tests for impairment of goodwill annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
the company compares the implied fair values of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount 
if the carrying values of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair values of the goodwill  the carrying values are adjusted for the differences between the fair values and the carrying values 
the key assumptions management makes in determining whether goodwill may be impaired include a projection of the cash flows associated with an acquired business and a determination of the appropriate weighted average cost of capital used to discount those cash flows 
midas evaluates the carrying values of its long lived assets to be held and used in the business by reviewing undiscounted cash flows by reporting unit 
such evaluations are performed whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
if the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows over the remaining lives of the related assets does not exceed the carrying values of the assets  the carrying values are adjusted for the differences between the fair values and carrying values 
additionally  in the case of fixed assets related to locations that will be closed or sold  the company writes down fixed assets to their estimated recovery value 
the company s evaluation of the carrying value of goodwill and other long lived assets as of the end of fiscal indicated that an impairment existed with respect to the goodwill and long lived assets used in company operated shops 
these shops continue to perform significantly below management s expectations 
as a result  the company recorded an impairment charge of million to goodwill and million to long lived assets 
deferred income taxes in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary 
table of contents differences become deductible 
management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible  management believes it is more likely than not that the company will realize the benefits of these deductible differences at january  in the event that management determines the company would not be able to realize all or part of the net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
as of january   the company had recorded a valuation allowance of million against certain state income tax net operating loss carryovers and certain foreign tax credits because the company has determined that it is more likely than not that this portion of these deferred tax assets will not be realized 
self insurance reserves historically  the company has been largely self insured with respect to workers compensation  general liability  and employee medical claims 
in order to reduce its risk and better manage its overall loss exposure  the company purchases stop loss insurance that covers individual claims in excess of the deductible amounts 
the company maintains an accrual for the estimated cost to settle open claims as well as an estimate of the cost of claims that have been incurred but not reported 
these estimates take into consideration the historical average monthly claim volume  the average cost for settled claims  current trends in claim costs  changes in the company s business and workforce  and general economic factors 
these accruals are reviewed on a quarterly basis  or more frequently if factors dictate a more frequent review

fin r replaces fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  which was issued in january the company will be required to apply fin r to variable interests in variable interest entities vie s created after december  for variable interests in vie s created before january   the interpretation will be applied beginning on january  for any vie s that must be consolidated under fin r that were created before january   the assets  liabilities and noncontrolling interests of the vie initially would be measured at their carrying amounts with any difference between the net amount added to the balance sheet and any previously recognized interest being recognized as the cumulative effect of an accounting change 
if determining the carrying amounts is not practicable  fair value at the date fin r first applies may be used to measure the assets  liabilities and noncontrolling interest of the vie 
fin r specifically allows for certain franchisors to not adopt the above described provisions of fin when the franchisees have sufficient decision making authority that enables them to impact the operations and success of the franchise 
midas management believes midas franchisees possess this threshold level of decision making authority and therefore does not treat any of its franchised or licensed shops as vie s
