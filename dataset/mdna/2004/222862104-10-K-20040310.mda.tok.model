federal regulation sarbanes oxley act of on july   president george w 
bush signed into law the sarbanes oxley act of the act 
the act is a comprehensive piece of legislation that will increase the cost of doing business 
the act s principal reforms include the creation of an independent public company accounting oversight board  auditor independence provisions that restrict the non audit services that accountants may provide to their audit clients  a range of corporate governance and responsibility measures  expanded disclosure requirements  including accelerated section a reporting by insiders  mandatory disclosure by analysts of potential conflicts of interest  a range of new penalties for fraud and other violations  and mandatory disclosure of management s assessment of internal controls 
other provisions in the act increase the securities and exchange commission s funding and enforcement powers  and require various studies and reports 
we are compliant with the act 
health insurance portability and accountability act of the health insurance portability and accountability act of hipaa imposes new requirements relating to a variety of issues that affect the company s business  including the privacy and security of medical information  limits on exclusions based on preexisting conditions for certain plans  guaranteed renewability of health care coverage for most employers and individuals and administrative simplification procedures involving the standardization of transactions and the establishment of uniform health care provider  payor and employer identifiers 
various agencies of the federal government have issued regulations to implement certain sections of hipaa 
this law is far reaching and complex  and proper interpretation and practice under the law continues to evolve 
because the rules implementing this law are still evolving  we can not assure you that the costs of compliance with this law will not adversely affect our results of operations or cause us to significantly change the way we operate our business 
the department of health and human services also released its final rule for electronic data standards under the hipaa on august   effective october  this rule establishes the standard data content and format for the electronic submission of claims and other administrative health transactions 
we are compliant with the electronic data standards established by the final rule 

table of contents on december   the department of health and human services released a final rule regarding standards for privacy of individually identifiable health information and the department of health and human services published revisions to the final rule in august the primary purposes of the privacy rule are to protect and enhance the rights of consumers by providing them access to their health information and controlling the inappropriate use of that information  and to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of health care delivery by creating a national framework for health privacy protection that builds on efforts by states  health systems  individual organizations and individuals 
we are compliant with the final rule 
on january   the us department of labor s pension and welfare benefits administration  the internal revenue service and the department of health and human services issued two regulations that provide guidance on the nondiscrimination provisions under the hipaa as they relate to health factors and wellness programs 
these nondiscrimination provisions prohibit a group health plan or group health insurance issuer from denying an individual eligibility for benefits or charging an individual a higher premium based on a health factor 
we currently do not believe that these regulations will have a material adverse effect on our business 
on february   the department of health and human services issued its final rule for security standards under the hipaa 
this rule establishes minimum standards for the security of electronic health information while being held by an entity and while the information is in transit between entities 
the compliance date for the security standards rule is april  we have implemented a plan of action to achieve compliance with the final security standards rule by the compliance date 
employee retirement income security act of the provision of services to certain employee health benefit plans is subject to the employee retirement income security act of erisa 
erisa regulates certain aspects of the relationships between us and employers who maintain employee benefit plans subject to erisa 
some of our administrative services and other activities may also be subject to regulation under erisa 
in addition  some states require licensure or registration of companies providing third party claims administration services for benefit plans 
we provide a variety of products and services to employee benefit plans that are covered by erisa 
the us department of labor adopted federal regulations that establish claims procedures for employee benefit plans under erisa insured and self insured 
the regulations shorten the time allowed for health and disability plans to respond to claims and appeals  establishes new requirements for plan responses to appeals and expands required disclosures to participants and beneficiaries 
the regulations apply to claims filed under a group health plan on or after the first day of the first plan year beginning on or after july  and not later than january  these regulations have not had a material adverse effect on our business 
medicare choice and medicaid some of our hmos contract with the centers for medicare and medicaid services to provide services to medicare beneficiaries pursuant to the medicare choice program 
some of our hmos also contract with states to provide health benefits to medicaid recipients 
as a result  we are subject to extensive federal and state regulation 
the centers for medicare and medicaid services may audit any health plan operating under a medicare choice contract to determine the plan s compliance with federal regulations and contractual obligations 
in addition  we must file cost reimbursement reports for the medicare cost contracts  which are subject to audit and revision 
the centers for medicare and medicaid services and the appropriate state regulatory agency have the right to audit any health plan operating under a medicaid managed care contract to determine the plan s compliance with state and federal law 
in some instances  states engage peer review organizations to perform quality assurance and utilization review oversight of medicaid managed care plans 
our hmos are required to abide by the peer review organizations standards 
the centers for medicare and medicaid services issued a final medicaid managed care rule on january  the final rule includes strengthened beneficiary protections and new provisions designed to protect the rights of participants in the medicaid program 
specifically  the final rule requires states to assure continuous access to care for beneficiaries with ongoing health care needs who transfer from one health plan to another 
the new rule also requires states and plans to identify enrollees with special health care needs and to assess the quality and appropriateness of their care 
this rule has not had a material adverse effect on our business 
the social security act imposes criminal and civil penalties for paying or receiving remuneration which is deemed to include a kickback  bribe or rebate in connection with any federal health care program  including the medicare  medicaid and federal employees health benefits programs 
the law and related regulations have been interpreted to prohibit the payment  solicitation  offering or receipt of any form of remuneration in return for the referral of federal health care program patients or any item or service that is reimbursed  in whole or in part  by any federal health care program 
similar anti kickback provisions have been adopted by many states  which apply regardless of the source of reimbursement 

table of contents the centers for medicare and medicaid services have promulgated regulations that prohibit hmos with medicare contracts from including any direct or indirect payment to physicians or other providers as an inducement to reduce or limit medically necessary services to a medicare beneficiary 
these regulations impose disclosure and other requirements relating to physician incentive plans such as bonuses or withholds that could result in a physician being at substantial financial risk as defined in medicare regulations 
our ability to maintain compliance with such regulations depends  in part  on our receipt of timely and accurate information from our providers 
although we believe we are in compliance with all such medicare regulations  we are subject to future audit and review 
in  as part of the hipaa  congress adopted a statutory exception for certain risk sharing arrangements 
the office of the inspector general has published two safe harbors addressing these risk sharing arrangements 
a safe harbor is a regulation that describes relationships and activities that are deemed not to violate the federal anti kickback statute 
however  failure to satisfy each criterion of an applicable safe harbor does not mean that the arrangement constitutes a violation of the law  rather the arrangement must be analyzed on the basis of its specific facts and circumstances 
we believe that our risk agreements satisfy the requirements of these safe harbors 
in addition  the office of the inspector general has adopted other safe harbor regulations that relate to managed care arrangements 
we believe that the incentives offered by our hmos to medicare and medicaid beneficiaries and the discounts our plans receive from contracting health care providers satisfy the requirements of these safe harbor regulations 
we believe that our arrangements do not violate the federal or similar state anti kickback laws 
federal employees health benefits program we contract with the office of personnel management opm to provide managed health care services under the federal employee health benefits program fehbp 
these contracts with the opm and applicable government regulations establish premium rating arrangements for this program 
the opm conducts periodic audits of its contractors to  among other things  verify that the premiums established under its contracts are in compliance with the community rating and other requirements under fehbp 
the opm may seek premium refunds or institute other sanctions against health plans that participate in the program 
healthamerica pennsylvania  inc healthamerica  our pennsylvania hmo subsidiary  received audit reports from the opm that questioned approximately million of subscription charges that were paid to healthamerica under the fehbp for contract years in the fourth quarter of  healthamerica settled this dispute with the opm and the us department of justice 
the final settlement payment of million was fully reserved by healthamerica and therefore had no impact on earnings  the regulated capital of healthamerica  or our consolidated stockholders equity 
recent federal managed care legislative proposals while both houses of congress passed some form of patients bill of rights legislation in  no such federal legislation currently exists 
despite congress failure to reconcile and pass a final patients bill of rights  the current administration has indicated a willingness to pass some form of patient protection legislation 
such patient protection legislation could adversely affect the managed care industry 
in february  rep 
charlie norwood re introduced patients bill of rights legislation that closely tracks the house version that died in the th congress 
among other provisions  the proposed legislation includes the following would require insurers to have approved utilization review programs  claims procedures and appeal procedures concerning claim denials  would restrict interference by insurers with the doctor patient relationship  would prohibit insurers from discriminating against licensed healthcare professionals with respect to participation in their networks  would provide opportunity for individuals battling life threatening  deadly diseases to participate in a federally approved or funded clinical trial  and would permit every member who is denied care to have a fair  speedy and impartial appeal to a review organization not selected by the insurer  the bill was referred to house subcommittee on employer employee relations on march  the bill s status is unchanged 
we can not predict whether the provisions of the patients bill of rights legislation introduced by rep 
norwood will ultimately be enacted into law 
the house may pass a different version or no version at all  and any passed legislation must be passed by the senate and signed by the president 
we also can not predict what impact any patients bill of rights or other federal legislation would have on our business and operations 

table of contents numerous other proposals have been introduced in the united states congress and various state legislatures relating to managed health care reform 
the provisions of legislation that may be adopted at the state level can not be accurately and completely predicted at this time  and we therefore can not predict the effect of proposed legislation on our operations 
on the federal level  it is possible that some form of managed health care reform may be enacted 
at this time  it is unclear as to when any legislation might be enacted or the content of any new legislation  and we can not predict the effect on our operations of the proposed legislation or any other legislation that may be adopted 
the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of on december   president george w 
bush signed into law the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of this act makes changes to the existing medicare law  including the creation of a new outpatient drug benefit beginning in and an immediate drug discount card for the interim period until january  the act makes managed care organizations eligible to be sponsors of both the drug card and drug benefit plan programs 
in addition  the medicare choice program  renamed medicare advantage  is expanded in a number of ways and payments are increased 
at this time  we can not predict what impacts this new law will have on our business and operations 
this act increased base rate payments to medicare choice plans 
the total increase in for all of our markets averaged 
the increase in revenue is required to be spent as follows to increase benefits to members  to decrease cost sharing of members through reduced co payments and coinsurance  to stabilize provider networks  to decrease member premiums  and to stabilize benefits 
title i of this same law created a prescription drug discount card and provides for a future prescription drug benefit 
we are planning to ensure our members have access to a cms endorsed prescription drug discount card throughout and the prescription drug benefit will be effective on january  this benefit will become part of the medicare choice funding at that time 
the company is currently monitoring the implementation of the law to determine how it will impact our offerings in and will continue to monitor this issue as new regulations are released 
risk management in the normal course of business  we have been named as a defendant in various legal actions such as actions seeking payments for claims denied by the company  medical malpractice actions  employment related claims and other various claims seeking monetary damages 
the claims are in various stages of proceedings and some may ultimately be brought to trial 
incidents occurring through december  may result in the assertion of additional claims 
we maintain general liability  professional liability and employment practices liability insurances in amounts that we believe are appropriate  with varying deductibles for which we maintain reserves 
the professional liability and employment practices liability insurances are carried through our captive subsidiary 
our captive subsidiary provides up to million in professional liability coverage for each single claim and up to million in coverage for each class action claim 
the captive professional liability policy has an aggregate limit of million per year 
the captive is also co insured with a commercial carrier for an additional million for professional liability claims 
additionally  the captive employment practices liability policy provides up to  per single claim  million per class action claim  and an aggregate policy limit of million 
each year we will re evaluate the most cost effective method for insuring these types of claims 
employees at february   we employed  persons  none of whom are covered by a collective bargaining agreement

liquidity and capital resources

risk factors executive level overview general operations we are a leading publicly traded managed health care company with approximately million members  excluding network rental members  as of december  we operate a diversified portfolio of local market health plans  insurance companies and provider networks serving markets 
our operations are based in bethesda  maryland with our local markets primarily covering the mid atlantic  midwest and southeast regions of the united states 
our primary focus is owning and operating health plans with a concentration on risk business with mid sized employer groups 
we operate our health plans with a local focus but with the management expertise  resources and economies of scale of a large  well capitalized company 
we believe the delivery of health care benefits and services is best managed on a market by market basis 
each of our health plans operates under its local market name and has local management  including sales and marketing  medical management  contracting and provider relations personnel that design and manage health benefits to meet the needs of our individual markets 
we believe that our local focus enables us to quickly adapt our products and services to the needs of individual markets and maintain strong relationships with our employer customers  members and health care providers 
we will continue to meet competitive challenges by offering quality products at adequate rates while maintaining our low cost structure 
highlights of performance membership increased over the prior year 
revenue increased over the prior year 
medical loss ratio of improved basis points over the prior year 
selling  general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of revenue  improved by basis points over the prior year 
operating margin of improved basis points over the prior year 
diluted earnings per share increased over the prior year 
cash flows from operations was million  a improvement over the prior year 
total cash and investments increased to billion  a increase over the prior year 
operating revenue and products we generate our operating revenues from premiums for a broad range of managed care and management service products 
premiums for our commercial risk products  for which we assume full underwriting risk  can vary 
for example  premiums for our preferred provider organization ppo and point of service pos products are typically lower than our health maintenance organization hmo premiums due to medical underwriting and higher deductibles and co payments that are typically required of the ppo and pos members 
premium rates for our government programs  medicare choice and state sponsored managed medicaid  are established by governmental regulatory agencies 
these government products are offered in selected markets where we believe we can achieve profitable growth based upon favorable reimbursement levels  provider costs and regulatory climates 

table of contents revenue for our management services products non risk is generally a fixed administrative fee for access to our provider networks and management services  for which we do not assume underwriting risk 
the management services we provide typically include network management  claims processing  utilization review and quality assurance 
in addition  we rent our network of providers network rental  including claims repricing and utilization review  to other managed care plans or non risk employers and assume no underwriting risk 
during the three years ended december   we experienced substantial growth in operating revenues due to membership increases from acquisitions 
we pursue acquisitions that fit into our local market strategy and that we feel are able to operate at target margins for the long term 
acquisitions must have a manageable regulatory and business climate and have the ability to add value to our company 
additionally  membership growth was achieved organically through marketing efforts  geographic expansion and increased product offerings 
our ability to introduce products quickly to each market has helped us to expand our customer base 
in particular  we have been able to a add a large variety of lower cost products  which has proven especially attractive to customers 
in some instances  we have introduced products in one market that we were already administering in another 
such commonality can help not only in properly administering benefit plans from day one  but also in expediting the regulatory approval processes 
although the approval processes are unique to each state  common plan documents can provide additional efficiencies 
operating expenses our medical costs include medical claims paid under contractual relationships with a wide variety of providers and capitation arrangements 
medical costs also include an estimate of claims incurred but not reported ibnr 
our health plans maintain provider networks that furnish health care services through contractual arrangements with physicians  hospitals and other health care providers 
most contracted primary care and specialist physicians are compensated under a discounted fee for service arrangement 
the majority of our contracts with hospitals provide for inpatient per diem or per case hospital rates 
outpatient services are contracted on a discounted fee for service  a per case basis or in some instances a discount from charges basis 
we pay ancillary providers on a fixed fee schedule or a capitation basis 
prescription drug benefits are provided through a formulary comprised of an extensive list of drugs 
drug prices are negotiated through a national network of pharmacies at discounted rates 
a small percentage of our membership is covered by global capitation arrangements 
under the typical arrangement  the provider receives a fixed percentage of premium to cover all the medical costs provided to the globally capitated members 
under some capitated arrangements  physicians may also receive additional compensation from risk sharing and other incentive arrangements 
global capitation arrangements limit our exposure to the risk of increasing medical costs  but expose us to risk as to the adequacy of the financial and medical care resources of the provider organization 
in addition to global capitation arrangements  we have capitation arrangements for ancillary services  such as mental health care 
we are ultimately responsible for the coverage of our members pursuant to the customer agreements 
to the extent that the respective provider organization faces financial difficulties or otherwise is unable to perform its obligations under the capitation arrangements  we will be required to perform such obligations 
consequently  we may have to incur costs in doing so in excess of the amounts we would otherwise have to pay under the original global or ancillary capitation arrangements 
we have established systems to monitor the availability  appropriateness and effectiveness of the patient care we provide 
we collect utilization data in each of our markets that we use to analyze over utilization or under utilization of services and assist our health plans in providing appropriate care for their members and improving patient outcomes in a cost efficient manner 
medical directors also monitor the utilization of diagnostic services and encourage the use of outpatient surgery and testing where appropriate 
each health plan collects data showing each physician s utilization profile for diagnostic tests  specialty referrals and hospitalization collects and presents such data to the health plan s physicians 
the medical directors monitor these results in an effort to ensure the use of cost effective  medically appropriate services 
we operate four regional service centers that perform claims processing  premium billing and collection  enrollment and customer service functions for our plans 
our regional service centers enable us to take advantage of economies of scale  implement standardized management practices at each of our plans and capitalize on the benefits of our integrated information technology systems 
we centralize the underwriting and product pricing functions for our health plans  which allows us to utilize our underwriting expertise and a disciplined pricing strategy at each of our plans 
we believe our centralization of certain administrative functions at the corporate and regional levels gives us a competitive advantage over local market health plans that lack our resources 
cash flows we generate cash through operations 
as a profitable company in an industry that is not capital equipment intensive  we have not needed to use financing methods to generate cash for operations 
we have a low debt to capital ratio and while we did issue senior notes in as described in 
note h to our consolidated financial statements of this form k  the entire proceeds were used to repurchase a portion of our common stock and were not used to fund operations 
our primary use of cash is to pay medical claims 
any excess cash has historically been used for acquisitions and for repurchases of our common stock 

table of contents critical accounting policies the accounting policies described below are ones we consider critical in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies are ones that require difficult  subjective  or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of these policies include significant estimates and assumptions made by us using information available at the time the estimates are made 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
revenue recognition managed care premiums are recorded as revenue in the month in which members are entitled to service 
premiums are based on both a per subscriber contract rate and the number of subscribers in our records at the time of billing 
premium billings are generally sent to employers in the month preceding the month of coverage 
premium billings may be subsequently adjusted to reflect changes in membership as a result of retroactive terminations  additions  or other changes 
due to early timing of the premium billing  we are able to identify the retroactive adjustments for two subsequent months billings 
current period revenues are adjusted to reflect these retroactive adjustments 
based on information received subsequent to generating premium billings  historical trends  bad debt write offs and the collectibility of specific accounts  we estimate  on a monthly basis  the amount of bad debt and future membership retroactivity and adjust our revenue and reserves accordingly 
as of december   we maintained reserves for retroactive billing adjustments of approximately million compared with approximately million at december  we also maintained reserves for doubtful accounts of approximately million and million as of december  and  respectively 
the calculation for these reserves is based on a percentage of the gross accounts receivable with the reserve percentage increasing for the older receivables 
the reserves have declined as a result of an improvement in the aging of our premium receivables 
we also receive premium payments from the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms on a monthly basis for our medicare choice membership 
membership and category eligibility are periodically reconciled with cms and could result in adjustments to revenue 
premiums collected in advance are recorded as deferred revenue 
we contract with the office of personnel management opm to provide managed health care services under the federal employee health benefits program fehbp 
these contracts with the opm and applicable government regulations establish premium rating arrangements for this program 
the opm conducts periodic audits of its contractors to  among other things  verify that the premiums established under its contracts are in compliance with the community rating and other requirements under fehbp 
the opm may seek premium refunds or institute other sanctions against health plans that participate in the program 
our contracts are periodically reconciled by us with the opm and could result in adjustments to revenue 
premiums for services to federal employee groups are subject to audit and review by the opm on a periodic basis 
such audits are usually a number of years in arrears 
we record reserves  on an estimated basis annually  based on appropriate guidelines 
any differences between actual results and estimates are recorded in the year the audits are finalized 
we currently enter into performance guarantees with employer groups where we pledge that we will meet certain standards 
these standards vary widely and could involve customer service  member satisfaction  claims processing  claims accuracy  telephone on hold time  etc 
under these performance guarantees  we could be at risk and may incur penalties for not maintaining the standards established in the contracts 
the risk level varies by agreement with penalties based on a variety of calculations including per member per month  percentage of premium  or percentage of administration fees 
risk levels are evaluated at least quarterly 
we estimate our potential exposure and record appropriate reserves 
the penalties that we have incurred have been immaterial and  although  we can not predict with precision the future effect on our results of operations of these penalties  we expect them to remain immaterial 
medical claims expense and liabilities medical claims liabilities consist of actual claims reported but not paid and estimates of health care services incurred but not reported ibnr 
ibnr estimates are developed using actuarial principles and assumptions that consider  among other things  contractual requirements  historical utilization trends and payment patterns  benefits changes  medical inflation  product mix  seasonality  membership and other relevant factors 
we also establish reserves  if required  for the probability that anticipated future health care costs and contract maintenance costs under the group of existing contracts will exceed anticipated future premiums and reinsurance recoveries on those contracts 
these accruals are continually monitored and reviewed  and as settlements are made or accruals adjusted  differences are reflected in current operations 
changes in assumptions for medical costs caused by changes in actual experience could cause these estimates to change in the near term 
certain situations require judgment in setting reserves  such as system conversions  processing interruptions  environmental changes or other factors 

table of contents we employ a team of actuaries that have developed  refined and used the same set of reserve models over the past several years 
for inpatient reserves  our models use credibility weighting of lag based incurred claim estimates traditional triangle based completion factors and incurred claims estimates calculated as authorized days multiplied by per diem forecasts 
for non inpatient reserves  our models use credibility weighting of lag based incurred claim estimates and trended per member per month estimates 
for both the inpatient and non inpatient reserves  lag based estimates receive little or no credibility weighting in the more current incurral months 
credibility factors are increased for older months within the lag models since those older months have a higher completion factor and are the best indicator of our ultimate cost 
within the reserve setting methodologies for inpatient and non inpatient services  there are certain assumptions that are used 
for inpatient services  authorized days are used for utilization factors  while cost trend assumptions are incorporated into per diem amounts 
the per diem estimates reflect anticipated effects of changes in reimbursement structure and severity mix 
for non inpatient services  a composite trend assumption is applied which reflects anticipated changes in cost per service  provider contracts  utilization  and other factors 
actuarial standards of practice generally require the actuarial developed medical claims estimates to cover obligations under an assumption of moderately adverse conditions 
adverse conditions are situations in which the actual claims are expected to be higher than the otherwise estimated value of such claims 
in many situations  the claims paid amount experienced will be less than the estimate that satisfies the actuarial standards of practice 
medical claims liabilities are recorded at an amount we estimate to be appropriate 
adjustments of prior years estimates may result in additional medical costs or  as we have experienced during the last several years  a reduction in medical costs in the period an adjustment was made 
our reserve models have historically developed favorably suggesting that the accrued liabilities calculated from the models were more than adequate to cover our ultimate liability for unpaid claims 
we believe that this favorable development is a result of good communications between our health plans and our actuarial staff regarding medical utilization  mix of provider rates and other components of medical cost trend 
the following table presents the components of the change in medical liabilities medical claims liabilities and other medical liabilities for the years ended december   and  respectively in thousands 
medical liabilities  beginning of period   acquisitions    reported medical costs current year    prior year    total reported medical costs    claim payments payments for current year    payments for prior year    total claim payments    medical liabilities  end of period   acquisition balances represent medical liabilities as of the applicable acquisition date 
subsequent changes in estimates related to the acquired balances are recorded as adjustments to the settlement account with the acquired entity s previous owner 
the negative amounts noted as prior year medical costs are favorable adjustments for claim estimates being settled for amounts less than originally anticipated 
as noted above  these favorable restatements from original estimates occur due to changes in medical utilization  mix of provider rates and other components of medical cost trends 

table of contents we believe that the amount of medical liabilities is adequate to cover our ultimate liability for unpaid claims as of december   however  actual claim payments and other items may differ from established estimates 
assuming a hypothetical variance between our december  estimates of medical liabilities and actual costs payable  net earnings for the year ended december   would increase or decrease by approximately million and diluted earnings per share would increase or decrease by approximately per share 
investments we account for investments in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
we invest primarily in fixed income securities and classify all our investments as available for sale 
investments are evaluated at least quarterly to determine if declines in value are other than temporary 
in making that determination  we consider all available evidence relating to the realizable value of a security 
this evidence includes  but is not limited to  the following adverse financial conditions of a specific issuer  segment  industry  region or other variables  the length of the time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  our intent and ability to retain our investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value  elimination or reduction in dividend payments  or scheduled interest and principal  rating agency downgrade of a debt security  and expected cash flows of a debt security 
temporary declines in value of investments classified as available for sale are netted with unrealized gains and reported as a net amount in a separate component of stockholders equity 
a decline in fair value below amortized cost that is judged to be other than temporary is accounted for as a realized loss and the write down is included in earnings 
realized gains and losses on the sale of investments are determined on a specific identification basis 
the following table shows our investments gross unrealized losses and fair value  at december   aggregated by investment category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position in thousands 
less than months months or more total description of securities fair value unrealized loss fair value unrealized loss fair value unrealized loss state and municipal bonds  us treasury agency securities   mortgage backed securities    asset backed securities corporate debt and other securities    the securities presented in this table do not meet the criteria for an other than temporarily impaired investment 
these securities have an investment grade credit rating 
the current unrealized loss is the result of interest rate increases and not unfavorable changes in the credit ratings associated with these securities 
these investments are not in high risk industries or sectors and we intend to hold these investments for a period of time sufficient to allow for a recovery in market value 
investments with original maturities in excess of three months and less than one year are classified as short term investments and generally consist of corporate bonds  us treasury notes and commercial paper 
long term investments have original maturities in excess of one year and primarily consist of fixed income securities 

table of contents goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite lives are subject to a periodic assessment for impairment by applying a fair value based test 
we use three approaches to identifying the fair value of our goodwill and other intangible assets a market approach  a market capitalization approach and an income approach 
the market approach estimates a business s fair value by analyzing the recent sales of similar companies 
the market capitalization approach is based on the market value of our total shares outstanding 
the income approach is based on the present value of expected future cash flows 
all three approaches are reviewed together for consistency and commonality 
any impairment charges that may result will be recorded in the period in which the impairment took place 
we have not incurred an impairment charge related to goodwill

note c to the consolidated financial statements for additional disclosure related to intangible assets 
new accounting standards in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure as an amendment to fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
this statement provides alternative methods of transition to the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation and requires prominent disclosure in our footnotes to the financial statements of our interim and annual reports 
unless the accounting rules change  we currently do not expect to transition to the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation  and  accordingly  this statement did not affect our financial position or results of operations 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
this statement addresses the financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring  and nullifies eitf issue no 
 cost associated with lease modification or termination 
sfas no 
requires a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity to be recognized and measured at fair value only when the liability is incurred 
this statement did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued two standards related to business combinations 
the first statement  sfas no 
business combinations  requires all business combinations initiated after june  to be accounted for using the purchase method and prohibits the pooling of interest method of accounting 
sfas no 
also states that acquired intangible assets should be separately recognized upon meeting certain criteria 
such intangible assets include  but are not limited to  trade and service marks  non compete agreements  customer lists and licenses 
we were not significantly affected by the implementation of this statement 
the second statement  sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  requires companies to cease amortization of goodwill 
rather  goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite lives will be subject to a periodic assessment for impairment by applying a fair value based test 
impairment charges may result in future write downs in the period in which the impairment took place 
as required  we adopted sfas no 
for the fiscal year beginning january   and  accordingly  goodwill was not amortized during nor refer to 
note c of our consolidated financial statements for more information 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
effective january   we adopted sfas no 
accordingly  a transition gain of million  net of tax  was recorded in the first quarter of related to one financial investment classified as derivative in nature 
the adjustment was shown separately as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
acquisitions during the three years ended december   we completed several business combinations and membership purchases 
these business combinations are all accounted for using the purchase method of accounting  and  accordingly  the operating results of each acquisition have been included in our consolidated financial statements since their effective date of acquisition 
the purchase price for each business combination was allocated to the assets  including the identifiable intangible assets  and liabilities based on estimated fair values 
the excess of the purchase price over the net identifiable assets acquired was allocated to goodwill 
prior to december   goodwill was amortized over a useful life of years 
in accordance with sfas no 
 effective january   we no longer amortize goodwill 
the purchase price of our membership purchases is allocated to identifiable intangible assets and is being amortized over a useful life of five to twenty years 

table of contents the following table summarizes all business combinations and membership purchases for the three years ended december  the purchase price  in thousands  of each business combination includes the payment for net worth and transition costs 
transition costs are initial estimates of future expenses based on historical experience and known costs 
these estimates may be adjusted as actual expenses are incurred  thereby affecting the final purchase price of the acquisition 
in addition  most of our acquisition agreements contain a provision for a final retroactive balance sheet settlement which may result in adjustments to the purchase price 
the purchase price shown for recent acquisitions  in thousands  is inclusive of all retroactive balance sheet settlements to date and transaction cost adjustments

december  percent change risk membership commercial   medicare   medicaid   total risk membership   non risk membership   total membership   network rental membership   this increase in commercial risk membership is attributable to the acquisitions of altius in the third quarter of and personalcare in the first quarter of  as well as continued organic growth 
medicare membership decreased as a result of the termination of the mid america medicare risk contract as of january  medicaid membership increased primarily as a result of an auto assignment of additional members by the state of missouri due to the withdrawal of a competitor in that market 
non risk membership increased as a result of the altius acquisition and from additional organic membership obtained in our missouri market 
overall organic membership growth  which excludes initial acquisitions and all changes to acquired entities during the first twelve months of operations  was approximately and for the years ended december  and  respectively

table of contents comparison of to managed care premium revenue increased as a result of rate increases on renewals that occurred throughout all markets  acquisitions and organic membership growth 
rate increases on commercial risk renewals averaged for the year commercial yields increased by an average of on a per member per month pmpm basis 
excluding the altius acquisition  the commercial yield increased 
medicare yields increased on a pmpm basis as a result of changes being made to rate structures  as well as changes in demographics 
the acquisitions of mid america  personalcare  and altius resulted in an increase in managed care premium revenue of approximately million 
organic membership growth resulted in an increase to managed care premiums of approximately million 
management services revenue increased due to the increase in non risk membership discussed earlier 
medical costs have increased due to acquisitions  organic growth and medical trend 
our total medical loss ratio medical costs as a percentage of managed care premiums for all products improved 
this favorable change was attributable mostly to our commercial business and is a result of the commercial premium rate increases mentioned above outpacing commercial medical trend 
reported commercial medical trends  net of benefit buy downs  have been below for each of the last two years 
our medicare business medical loss ratio improved as a result of an increase in premium yields discussed above and exiting three counties in the kansas city market on january  our medicaid medical loss ratio increased as a result of changes in the geographical markets in which we operate  and an increase in membership in a capitated service 
we exited the delaware medicaid market on july  within our pennsylvania market  membership in our capitated medicaid behavioral health program has increased significantly during and this program has a high medical loss ratio  but is lower in risk to our company 
our days in total medical claims liabilities have decreased days from prior year due to faster claim receipts and processing cycle times as well as efforts to reduce claim inventories 
selling  general and administrative expense increased primarily due to increased costs associated with acquisitions  an increase in broker commissions and an increase in salary expenses 
broker commissions  excluding acquisitions  have increased due to the growth in both organic membership and in premium yields 
salary expenses  excluding acquisitions  have increased due to annual salary increases  additional amortization expense related to restricted shares of common stock granted in  additional management and sales incentive accruals and incremental salary expense related to our organic membership growth 
as a percentage of revenue  selling  general and administrative expense decreased by 
senior notes interest and amortization expense has increased in due to the issuance of the notes on february   the prior year period represented eleven months of interest compared to twelve months in also contributing to the increase is a million loss on the repurchase of a portion of our senior notes at a premium in the third quarter of other income increased due to a larger investment portfolio in offset by a decrease in interest income as a result of lower interest rates 
additionally  the current year included a gain from our single derivative investment compared to a loss in the prior year 
this derivative investment was sold during the second quarter of our provision for income taxes increased primarily due to an increase in earnings before taxes 
the effective tax rate increased to in from in comparison of to managed care premium revenue increased in over primarily from commercial rate increases that occurred throughout both years and from membership growth  both organically and through the previously discussed acquisitions 
commercial premium rates increased by an average of over on a per member per month pmpm basis  to pmpm

our commercial medical trend for the year ended was and the average trend for the three year period ended december  was 
our medical loss ratio improved in in our commercial and medicare product lines as a result of rate increases outpacing medical trends 

table of contents selling  general and administrative expense increased in primarily due to acquisitions  an increase in fees paid to brokers and incremental salary expense related to the expansion of our customer service organization 
during  we opened a new regional service center in bismarck  north dakota to perform customer service functions related to the mid america acquisition and to create additional capacity for future acquisitions 
as a percentage of revenue  selling general and administrative expense increased slightly by to for depreciation and amortization decreased compared to the prior year primarily due to the adoption of sfas no 
in january in accordance with sfas no 
 we no longer amortize goodwill but rather test for impairment at least once a year 
in  we amortized million in goodwill 
we did not incur any impairment charges during senior notes interest and amortization expense were incurred in due to the issuance of our senior notes on february   as described below in liquidity and capital resources 
other income  net decreased in from due primarily to the change in valuation of a derivative investment 
we recorded a gain in and a loss in related to this derivative 
the decrease is also related to a decrease in the amortization of discounts on investments  offset by an increase in interest income due to cash placed in long term investments to achieve higher yields 
our provision for income taxes increased in due to an increase in operating earnings  offset by a decrease in our effective tax rate from in to in this decrease in the tax rate is the result of strategic tax planning and due to the elimination of goodwill amortization in liquidity and capital resources consolidated our total cash and investments  consisting of cash and cash equivalents and short term and long term investments  but excluding deposits of million restricted under state regulations  increased million to billion at december  from billion at december net cash from operating activities for the year ended december  increased over the prior year due to an increase in net earnings  a decrease in other receivables and an increase in deferred revenue 
these are offset by an increase in the long term deferred tax asset 
other receivables have decreased due to accelerated collections of our pharmacy rebate receivables as a result of improved procedures implemented in deferred revenue has increased due to accelerated collections of premium billings as a result of operational efficiencies experienced at our regional service centers 
net cash from investing activities for the year ended december  improved over the prior year primarily as a result of investment activity  offset by an increased amount of payments for acquisitions 
capital expenditures for the year ended december  were only slightly above that of the prior year 
projected capital investments in of approximately million consist primarily of computer hardware  software and related equipment costs associated with the development and implementation of improved operational and communication systems 
net cash from financing activities for the year ended december  improved over the prior year as result of fewer repurchases of our common stock in on february   we completed the purchase of million shares of our common stock and a warrant exercisable  at that time  for million shares of our common stock  owned by principal health care  inc the aggregate purchase price for the shares of common stock and the warrant was million 
the purchase of the shares and warrant from principal ended their ownership of our common stock 
we financed the stock and warrant repurchase with the proceeds from the sale of million of our senior notes due february  interest on the notes is payable on february and august each year 
as required under the terms of the senior notes  we made interest payments of million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
in addition to the repurchase of our common stock from principal we made repurchases or our common stock  as described below in share repurchase program  at an aggregate cost of million 
in august  we repurchased a portion of our senior notes with a face value of million and a weighted average premium of 
the senior notes contain certain covenants and restrictions regarding incurring additional debt  limiting dividends or other restricted payments  and restricting transactions with affiliates  sales of assets and consolidations or mergers 
we have complied with all covenants under the senior notes 

table of contents net cash from operating activities for the year ended december  increased over due to an increase in net earnings and an increase in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities 
the latter was a result of increases in additional selling  general and administrative liabilities related to our acquisitions and business growth throughout and and an increase in our deferred tax liability 
these increases were offset by a decrease in total medical claims liabilities as a result of the timing of medical claims payments 
also  in we received months worth of medicare premium payments as a result of the timing of cms payments and only months of premium payments were received during which led to the decrease in our deferred revenue 
our investment guidelines emphasize investment grade fixed income instruments in order to provide liquidity to meet future payment obligations and minimize the risk of principal 
the fixed income portfolio includes government and corporate securities with an average quality rating of aa and an average contractual duration of years  as of december  we will continue to fund our working capital requirements from our cash flow from operations 
we believe that because our long term investments are available for sale  the amount of such investments should be considered when assessing our liquidity 
on such basis  current assets plus long term investments available for sale less current liabilities increased to million at december  from million at december  health plans our regulated hmo and insurance company subsidiaries are required by state regulatory agencies to maintain minimum surplus balances  thereby limiting the dividends the parent may receive from its regulated entities 
during  we collected million in dividends from our regulated subsidiaries 
the national association of insurance commissioners naic has proposed that states adopt risk based capital rbc standards that  if adopted  generally require higher minimum capitalization requirements for hmos and other risk bearing health care entities 
rbc is a method of measuring the minimum amount of capital deemed appropriate for a managed care organization to support its overall business operations with consideration for its size and risk profile 
this calculation  approved by the naic  incorporates asset risk  underwriting risk  credit risk and business risk components 
the company s health plans are required to submit an rbc report to the naic and their domiciled state s department of insurance with their annual filing 
the rbc results are used to determine if the health plan s statutory net worth is adequate to support the amount of its calculated risk profile 
regulators also use the rbc results to determine if any regulatory actions are required 
regulatory actions that could take place  if any  range from filing a financial action plan explaining how the plan will increase its statutory net worth to the approved levels  to the health plan being placed under regulatory control 
the majority of states in which we operate health plans have adopted an rbc policy that recommends the health plans maintain statutory reserves at or above the company action level which is currently equal to of their rbc 
we have adopted an internal policy to maintain all of our regulated subsidiaries statutory capital and surplus at or above of their rbc 
some states in which our regulated subsidiaries operate  require deposits to be maintained with the respective states departments of insurance 
the table below summarizes our statutory reserve information  as of december  and in millions except percentage data 
capital and surplus of rbc excess capital and surplus above of rbc capital and surplus as a percentage of rbc statutory deposits the increase in capital and surplus for our regulated subsidiaries is a result of income from and the acquisitions of personalcare and altius  offset by dividends paid to the parent company 
the increase in statutory deposits is mainly a result of the acquisitions of personalcare and altius 
excluding funds held by entities subject to regulation  we had cash and investments of approximately million and million at december  and december   respectively 
the increase in non regulated cash and investments is primarily a result of dividends received from subsidiaries mentioned above and ordinary operating activities offset by payments for acquisitions 
during the year ended december   we made capital contributions of approximately million to our hmo subsidiaries 
this contribution was almost exclusively made to our recently acquired altius health plan in order to increase capital and surplus to appropriate levels 

table of contents other the united states department of health and human services has issued rules  as mandated by the health insurance portability and accountability act of  which  among other things  impose security and privacy requirements with respect to individually identifiable patient data  including a member s transactions with health care providers and payors  as well as requirements for the standardization of certain electronic transaction code sets and provider identifiers 
we have spent approximately million  million and million on compliance matters for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we anticipate spending approximately million in  of which approximately million will be capitalized  related to improved functionality of our electronic transaction code sets  improved provider identifier standards  and improved security and patient information privacy standards

we are a defendant in the provider track in the managed care litigation filed in the united states district court for the southern district of florida  miami division  mdl no 
 styled in re humana  inc  charles b 
shane  md  et al 
vs 
humana  inc  et al 
this action was filed by a group of physicians as a class action against us and twelve other companies in the managed care industry 
in its fourth amended complaint  the plaintiffs have alleged violations of rico  conspiracy to violate rico and aiding and abetting a scheme to violate rico 
in addition to these rico claims  the complaint includes counts for breach of contract  violations of various state prompt payment laws and equitable claims for unjust enrichment and quantum meruit 
we have filed a motion to dismiss each of these claims because they fail to state a cause of action or  in the alternative  to compel arbitration pursuant to the arbitration provisions which exist in our physician contracts 
in response to the motion to dismiss  the trial court dismissed several of the claims and ordered that all physicians who have an arbitration provision in their provider contracts must submit all of their claims to arbitration 
as a consequence of this ruling  all the plaintiffs who have arbitration provisions voluntarily dismissed all of their arbitratable claims 
the trial court excluded from the scope of claims subject to arbitration  the plaintiffs claims of conspiracy  conspiracy to violate rico and aiding and abetting violations of rico 
the defendants  including the company  have appealed the trial court s decision to the th circuit court of appeals 
the appeal has been fully briefed and the parties are awaiting a date for oral argument 
the trial court has certified various subclasses of physicians  however  we are not subject to the class certification order because the motion to certify was filed before we were joined as a defendant 
the plaintiffs have now filed a motion to certify a class as to the company  and we have filed our opposition to that motion 
the trial court has not yet issued a ruling on the motion 
the defendants who were subject to the certification order filed an appeal to the th circuit which has been argued 
the appeals court has not yet issued its decision 
subsequent to this appeal  two companies have entered into settlement agreements with the plaintiffs 
both settlement agreements have been filed with the court and have received final approval 
although we can not predict the outcome  management believes that this lawsuit will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or our results of operations 
management also believes that the claims asserted in this lawsuit are without merit  and we intend to defend our position 
we may be the target of other similar lawsuits involving rico and erisa  generally claiming that managed care companies overcharge consumers and misrepresent that they deliver quality health care 
although we may be the target of other similar lawsuits  we believe there is no valid basis for such lawsuits 
our industry is heavily regulated and the laws and rules governing the industry and interpretations of those laws and rules are subject to frequent change 
existing or future laws could have a significant effect on our operations 
legislation and regulation as a managed health care company  we are subject to extensive government regulation of our products and services 
the laws and regulations affecting our industry generally give state and federal regulatory authorities broad discretion in their exercise of supervisory  regulatory and administrative powers 
these laws and regulations are intended primarily for the benefit of the members of the health plans 
managed care laws and regulations vary significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and changes are frequently considered and implemented 
although the provisions of any legislation adopted at the state or federal level can not be accurately predicted at this time  management believes that the ultimate outcome of currently proposed legislation would not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the short term 
our industry is heavily regulated and the laws and rules governing the industry and interpretations of those laws and rules are subject to frequent change 
existing or future laws could have significant effect on our operations 
inflation in recent years  health care cost inflation has exceeded the general inflation rate 
to reduce the effect of health care cost inflation on our business operations we have  where possible  increased premium rates and implemented cost control measures in our patient care management and provider contracting 
we can not be certain that we will be able to increase future premium rates at a rate that equals or exceeds the health care cost inflation rate or that our other cost control measures will be effective 

table of contents outlook as a result of a strong sales force  a broad product offering  a disciplined underwriting process and superior customer service  we have an organic membership growth target of for the year we operate in highly competitive markets  but believe that the pricing environment is rational in our existing markets  thus creating the opportunity for reasonable price increases 
we will continue to obtain adequate premium increases and expect premium rates to continue to rise at a rate equal to or greater than medical trend in management believes that existing markets have potential for premium growth for our commercial and governmental products 
in  we have received medicare rate increases of  which was from the original adjusted community rating filings and additional as a result of the medicare modernization act passed in december the rate increases will not improve our profitability as the increases are for enhanced member benefits and or network access 
we currently anticipate reducing selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue in  excluding the effect of any future acquisitions  through medical claims auto adjudication  improved customer service  e commerce initiatives  spending controls and fixed costs leverage 
management believes that the foregoing should result in earnings improvements in  although realization is dependent upon a variety of factors  some of which may be outside of our control 
risk factors the risks described below are not the only ones that we face 
additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations 
our business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks 
further  the trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks  and you may lose all or part of your investment 
our results of operations may be adversely affected if we are unable to accurately estimate and control future health care costs 
most of the premium revenue we receive is based upon rates set months before we deliver services 
as a result  our results of operations largely depend on our ability to accurately estimate and control future health care costs 
we base the premiums we charge  at least in part  on our estimate of expected health care costs over the applicable premium period 
factors that may cause health care costs to exceed our estimates include an increase in the cost of health care services and supplies  including pharmaceuticals  higher than expected utilization of health care services  periodic renegotiations of hospital  physician and other provider contracts  the occurrence of epidemics and catastrophic events  changes in the demographics of our members and medical trends affecting them  general inflation or economic downturns  new mandated benefits or other regulatory changes that increase our costs  and other unforeseen occurrences 
in addition  medical claims payable in our financial statements include our estimated reserves for incurred but not reported and unpaid claims  which we call ibnr 
the estimates for submitted claims and ibnr are made on an accrual basis 
we believe that our reserves for ibnr are adequate to satisfy our medical claims liabilities  but we can not assure you of this 
any adjustments to our ibnr reserves could adversely affect our results of operations 
our results of operations will be adversely affected if we are unable to increase premiums to offset increases in our health care costs 
our results of operations depend on our ability to increase premiums to offset increases in our health care costs 
although we attempt to base the premiums we charge on our estimate of future health care costs  we may not be able to control the premiums we charge as a result of competition  government regulations and other factors 
our results of operations could be adversely affected if we are unable to set premium rates at appropriate levels or adjust premium rates in the event our health care costs increase 

table of contents a reduction in the number of members in our health plans could adversely affect our results of operations 
a reduction in the number of members in our health plans could adversely affect our results of operations 
factors that could contribute to the loss of membership include reductions in the number of employers offering health care coverage  reductions in work force by existing customers  increases in premiums or benefit changes  benefit changes or reductions in premiums by our competitors  our exit from a market or the termination of a health plan  and negative publicity and news coverage relating to our company or the managed health care industry generally 
our growth strategy is dependent in part upon our ability to acquire additional health plans and successfully integrate those plans into our operations 
part of our growth strategy is to grow through the acquisition of additional health plans 
during the last several years  we have significantly increased our membership through a number of acquisitions 
we can not assure you that we will be able to continue to locate suitable acquisition candidates  successfully integrate the plans we acquire and realize anticipated operational improvements and cost savings 
the plans we acquire also may not achieve our anticipated levels of profitability 
our future growth rate will be adversely affected if we are not able to successfully complete acquisitions 
competition in our industry may limit our ability to attract new members or to increase or maintain our premium rates  which would adversely affect our results of operations 
we operate in a highly competitive environment that may affect our ability to attract new members and increase premium rates 
we compete with other health plans for members 
we believe the principal factors influencing the choice among health care options are price of benefits offered  location and choice of health care providers  quality of customer service  comprehensiveness of coverage offered  reputation for quality care  financial stability of the plan  and diversity of product offerings 
we face competition from other managed care companies  hospitals  health care facilities and other health care providers that may have broader geographical coverage  more established reputations in our markets  greater market share  lower costs and greater financial and other resources 
we also may theoretically face increased rate competition from certain not for profit health insurance organizations that would potentially be required by state regulation to reduce capital surpluses that have been excessive 
we depend on the services of non exclusive independent agents and brokers to market our products to employers  and we can not assure you that they will continue to market our products in the future 
we depend on the services of independent agents and brokers to market our managed care products and services  particularly to small employer group members 
we do not have long term contracts with independent agents and brokers and they typically are not dedicated exclusively to us and frequently market the health care products of our competitors 
we face intense competition for the services and allegiance of independent agents and brokers  and we can not assure you that agents and brokers will continue to market our products in a fair and consistent manner 
our failure to obtain cost effective agreements with a sufficient number of providers may result in higher medical costs and a decrease in our membership 
our future results largely depend on our ability to enter into cost effective agreements with hospitals  physicians and other health care providers 
the terms of those provider contracts will have a material effect on our medical costs and our ability to control these costs 
in addition  our ability to contract successfully with a sufficiently large number of providers in a particular geographic market will impact the relative attractiveness of our managed care products in those markets 

table of contents in some of our markets  there are large provider systems that have a major presence 
some of these large provider systems have operated their own health plans in the past or may choose to do so in the future 
these provider systems could adversely affect our product offerings and results of operations if they refuse to contract with us  place us at a competitive disadvantage or use their market position to negotiate contracts that are less favorable to us 
provider agreements are subject to periodic renewal and renegotiations 
we can not assure you that these large provider systems will continue to contract with us or that they will contract with us on terms that are favorable to us 
negative publicity regarding the managed health care industry generally or our company in particular could adversely affect our results of operations 
over the last several years  the managed health care industry has been subject to negative publicity 
negative publicity regarding the managed health care industry generally or our company in particular may result in increased regulation and legislative review of industry practices  such as the patients bill of rights legislation in  which may further increase our costs of doing business and adversely affect our results of operations by requiring us to change our products and services  increasing the regulatory burdens under which we operate  or adversely affecting our ability to market our products or services 
negative publicity relating to our company or the managed care industry generally also may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain members 
a failure of our information systems could adversely affect our business 
we depend on our information systems for timely and accurate information 
failure to maintain effective and efficient information systems or disruptions in our information systems could cause disruptions in our business operations  loss of existing customers  difficulty in attracting new customers  disputes with customers and providers  regulatory problems  increases in administrative expenses and other adverse consequences 
compliance with privacy laws could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
the use of patient data by all of our businesses is regulated at the federal  state and local level 
the health insurance portability and accountability act of  for example  imposed significant new requirements relating to maintaining the privacy of medical information 
various agencies of the federal government have issued regulations to implement certain sections of this act 
the law is far reaching and complex and proper interpretation and practice under the law continues to evolve 
consequently  our efforts to measure  monitor and adjust our business practices to comply with the law are ongoing 
because these regulations and other similar federal  state and local laws and regulations continue to evolve  we can not guarantee that the costs of compliance will not adversely affect our results of operations or cause us to change our operations significantly 
we conduct business in a heavily regulated industry and changes in laws or regulations or violations of regulations could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
our business is heavily regulated by federal  state and local authorities 
legislation or other regulatory reform that increases the regulatory requirements imposed on us or that changes the way we currently do business may in the future adversely affect our business and results of operations 
legislative or regulatory changes that could significantly harm us and our subsidiaries include changes that impose increased liability for adverse consequences of medical decisions  limit premium levels  increase minimum capital  reserves and other financial viability requirements  impose fines or other penalties for the failure to pay claims promptly  impose fines or other penalties as a result of market conduct reviews  prohibit or limit rental access to health care provider networks  prohibit or limit provider financial incentives and provider risk sharing arrangements  require health plans to offer expanded or new benefits  limit the ability of health plans to manage care and utilization due to any willing provider and direct access laws that restrict or prohibit product features that encourage members to seek services from contracted providers or through referral by a primary care provider  limit contractual terms with providers  including audit  payment and termination provisions  and implement mandatory third party review processes for coverage denials 

table of contents in addition  we are required to obtain and maintain various regulatory approvals to market many of our products 
delays in obtaining or failure to obtain or maintain these approvals could adversely impact our results of operations 
federal  state and local authorities frequently consider changes to laws and regulations that could adversely affect our business 
we can not predict the changes that government authorities will approve in the future or assure you that those changes will not have an adverse effect on our business or results of operations 
we face periodic reviews  audits and investigations under our contracts with federal and state government agencies  and these audits could have adverse findings that may negatively impact our business 
we contract with various federal and state governmental agencies to provide managed health care services 
pursuant to these contracts  we are subject to various governmental reviews  audits and investigations to verify our compliance with the contracts and applicable laws and regulations 
any adverse review  audit or investigation could result in refunding of amounts we have been paid pursuant to our government contracts  imposition of fines  penalties and other sanctions on us  loss of our right to participate in various federal programs  damage to our reputation in various markets  increased difficulty in selling our products and services  and loss of one or more of our licenses to act as an insurer or hmo or to otherwise provide a service 
we are subject to litigation in the ordinary course of our business  including litigation based on new or evolving legal theories  that could significantly affect our results of operations 
due to the nature of our business  we are subject to a variety of legal actions relating to our business operations including claims relating to our denial of non covered benefits  vicarious liability for our actions or medical malpractice claims  disputes with our providers over alleged violations of rico  disputes with our providers over compensation and termination of provider contracts  disputes related to our non risk business  including actions alleging breach of fiduciary duties  claim administration errors and failure to disclose network rate discounts and other fee and rebate arrangements  disputes over our co payment calculations  customer audits of our compliance with our plan obligations  and disputes over payments for out of network benefits 
in addition  plaintiffs continue to bring new types of purported legal claims against managed care companies 
recent court decisions and legislative activity increase our exposure to these types of claims 
in some cases  plaintiffs may seek class action status and substantial economic  non economic or punitive damages 
the loss of even one of these claims  if it resulted in a significant damage award  could have a significant adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
in the event that a significant damage award does occur it may make reasonable settlements of claims more difficult to obtain 
we can not determine with any certainty what new theories of recovery may evolve or what their impact may be on the managed care industry in general or on us in particular 
we have  and expect to maintain  liability insurance coverage for some of the potential legal liabilities we may incur 
currently  the professional liability and employment practices liability insurance is covered through our captive subsidiary 
potential liabilities that we incur may not  however  be covered by insurance  our insurers may dispute coverage  our insurers may be unable to meet their obligations or the amount of our insurance coverage may be inadequate 
we can not assure you that we will be able to obtain insurance coverage in the future  or that insurance will continue to be available on a cost effective basis  if at all 

table of contents our stock price and trading volume may be volatile 
from time to time  the price and trading volume of our common stock  as well as the stock of other companies in the health care industry may experience periods of significant volatility 
company specific issues and developments generally in the health care industry including the regulatory environment and the capital markets may cause this volatility 
our stock price and trading volume may fluctuate in response to a number of events and factors  including quarterly variations in our operating results  changes in the market s expectations about our future operating results  changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts concerning our company or the health care industry generally  operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors may deem comparable  news reports relating to trends in our markets  changes in the laws and regulations affecting our business  acquisitions and financings by us or others in our industry  and sales of substantial amounts of our common stock by our directors and executive officers or principal stockholders  or the perception that such sales could occur 
our indebtedness will impose restrictions on our business and operations 
the indenture for our senior notes  which were issued on february   imposes restrictions on our business and operations 
these restrictions limit our ability to  among other things incur additional debt  pay dividends or make other restricted payments  create or permit certain liens on our assets  sell assets  create or permit restrictions on the ability of certain of our restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to us  enter into transactions with affiliates  enter into sale and leaseback transactions  and consolidate or merge with or into other companies or sell all or substantially all of our assets 
in addition  we may incur additional indebtedness in the future  which may impose further restrictions on us 
the restrictions in the indenture for our senior notes and in any future debt instruments could limit  among other things  our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs  make acquisitions or pursue available business opportunities 
we may not be able to satisfy our obligations to holders of the senior notes upon a change of control 
in the event of a change of control of our company  we will be required  subject to certain conditions  to offer to purchase all of our outstanding senior notes at a price equal to of the principal amount thereof  plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the date of purchase 
it is possible that we will not have sufficient funds at the time of the change of control to make the required repurchase of the senior notes or that restrictions in any other debt instruments may not allow such repurchases 
our failure to purchase the senior notes would be a default under the indenture governing the senior notes 

table of contents even if we are able to repurchase the senior notes in the event of a change of control  the use of our cash resources to complete the repurchase may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our stockholder rights plan  certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law could delay  discourage or prevent a change in control of our company that our stockholders consider favorable 
we have a stockholder rights plan that may have the effect of discouraging unsolicited takeover proposals 
the rights issued under the stockholder rights plan would cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire us on terms not approved in advance by our board of directors 
in addition  provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law may delay  discourage or prevent a merger  acquisition or change in control involving our company that our stockholders may consider favorable 
these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions 
among other things  these provisions authorize us to issue preferred stock  the terms of which may be determined at the sole discretion of our board of directors and may adversely affect the voting or economic rights of our common stockholders  provide for a classified board of directors with staggered three year terms so that no more than one third of our directors can be replaced at any annual meeting  provide that directors may be removed without cause only by the affirmative vote of the holders of two thirds of our outstanding shares  provide that any amendment or repeal of the provisions of our certificate of incorporation establishing our classified board of directors must be approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of three fourths of our outstanding shares  and establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at a meeting 
these provisions of our stockholder rights plan  certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law may discourage transactions that otherwise could provide for the payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our common stock and also could limit the price that investors are willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
effects of terrorism there can be no assurance that the war on terrorism  the threat of future acts of terrorism or the related concerns of members or providers will not adversely affect our health care costs and our ability to predict and control such costs 
future acts of terrorism and bio terrorism could adversely affect us through  among other things increased utilization of health care services including  without limitation  hospital and physician services  ancillary testing and procedures  vaccinations  prescriptions for drugs  mental health services and other services  loss of membership as the result of lay offs or other in force reductions of employment  adverse effects upon the financial condition or business of employers who sponsor health care coverage for their employees  disruption of our business or operations  and disruption of the financial and insurance markets in general 
general economic conditions changes in economic conditions could affect our business and results of operations 
the state of the economy could affect our employer group renewal prospects and our ability to collect or increase premiums 
the state of the economy has also affected the states budgets  which could result in the states attempting to reduce payments to medicaid plans in those states in which we offer medicaid plans  and increase taxes and assessments on our activities 
although we could attempt to mitigate or cover our exposure from such increased costs through  among other things  increases in premiums  there can be no assurance that we will be able to mitigate or cover all of such costs resulting from any budget cuts in states in which we operate 
although we have attempted to diversify our product offerings to address the changing needs of our membership  there can be no assurance that the effects of economic conditions will not cause our existing membership to seek health coverage alternatives that we do not offer or will not result in significant membership loss  lower average premium yields or decreased margins on continuing membership

we have established policies and procedures to manage our exposure to changes in the fair value of our investments 
our policies include an emphasis on credit quality and the management of our portfolio s duration and mix of securities 
we believe our investment portfolio is diversified and currently expect no material loss to result from the failure to perform by the issuers of the debt securities we hold 
the mortgage backed securities are insured by several associations  including government national mortgage administration  federal national mortgage administration and the federal home loan mortgage corporation 
we invest primarily in fixed income securities and classify all our investments as available for sale 
investments are evaluated at least quarterly to determine if declines in value are other than temporary 
in making that determination  we consider all available evidence relating to the realizable value of a security 
this evidence includes  but is not limited to  the following adverse financial conditions of a specific issuer  segment  industry  region or other variables  the length of the time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  our intent and ability to retain our investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value  elimination or reduction in dividend payments  or scheduled interest and principal  rating agency downgrade of a debt security  and expected cash flows of a debt security 
temporary declines in value of investments classified as available for sale are netted with unrealized gains and reported as a net amount in a separate component of stockholders equity 
a decline in fair value below amortized cost that is judged to be other than temporary is accounted for as a realized loss and the write down is included in earnings 
realized gains and losses on the sale of investments are determined on a specific identification basis
