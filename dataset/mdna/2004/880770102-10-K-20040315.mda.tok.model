the cautionary statements made in this annual report on form k should be read as being applicable to all related forward looking statements whenever they appear in this annual report on form k 
teradyne s actual results could differ materially from the results contemplated by these and any other forward looking statements 
factors that could contribute to such differences include those discussed below as well as those cautionary statements and other factors set forth in certain factors that may affect future results and elsewhere herein 
critical accounting policies and estimates teradyne has identified the policies discussed below as critical to understanding its business and its results of operations 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on its business operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect its reported and expected financial results 
preparation of financial statements and use of estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
on an on going basis  managment evaluates its estimates  including those related to inventories  investments  goodwill  intangible and other long lived assets  bad debts  income taxes  pensions  warranties  contingencies  and litigation 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on appropriate and customary assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition in accordance with the guidance provided by the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  teradyne recognizes revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  title and risk of loss have passed  delivery has occurred or the services have been rendered  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
title and risk of loss generally pass to teradyne s customers upon shipment 
in circumstances where either title or risk of loss pass upon destination  acceptance or cash payment  teradyne defers revenue recognition until such events occur 
for equipment where there is hardware and software that is incidental to the product  revenue is recognized upon shipment provided that customer acceptance criteria can be demonstrated prior to shipment 
certain contracts require teradyne to perform tests of the product to ensure that performance meets the published product specifications or customer requested specifications  which are generally conducted prior to shipment 
where the criteria cannot be demonstrated prior to shipment  or in the case of new products  revenue is deferred until customer acceptance has been received 
for multiple element arrangements  teradyne defers the greater of the fair value of any undelivered elements of the contract or the portion of the sales price which is not payable until the undelivered elements are delivered 
for a delivered item to be considered a separate unit  the delivered item must have value to the customer on a standalone basis  there must be objective and reliable evidence of fair value of the undelivered items in the arrangement and the delivery or performance of the undelivered item must be considered probable and substantially in the control of teradyne 
teradyne also defers the portion of the sales price that is not due until acceptance  which represents deferred profit 
fair value is the price charged when the element is sold separately 
teradyne s post shipment obligations include installation  training services  one year standard warranties  and extended warranties 
installation does not alter the product capabilities  does not require specialized skills or tools and can be performed by the customers or other vendors 
installation is typically provided within five to fifteen days of product shipment and is completed within one to two days thereafter 
training services are optional and do not affect the customer s ability to use the product 
teradyne defers revenue for the fair value of installation and training 
extended warranties constitute warranty obligations beyond one year and teradyne defers revenue in accordance with fasb technical bulletin teradyne s products are generally subject to warranty and related costs are provided for in cost of revenue when product revenue is recognized 
teradyne classifies shipping and handling costs in cost of revenue 
service revenue is recognized over the contractual period or as the services are performed 
connection systems revenue is generally recognized upon shipment according to the shipping terms of the arrangement as there is no installation required and there are no contractual acceptance requirements 
teradyne generally does not provide its customers with contractual rights of return for any of its products 
for transactions involving the sale of software which is not incidental to the product  revenue is recognized in accordance with american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position no 
sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop no 
modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
teradyne recognizes revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
revenue is deferred in instances when vendor specific objective evidence of fair value of undelivered elements is not determinable 
vendor specific evidence of fair value is the price charged when the element is sold separately 
revenue for the separate elements is only recognized where the functionality of the undelivered element is not essential to the delivered element 
for certain contracts eligible for contract accounting under sop no 
accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts  revenue is recognized using the percentage of completion accounting method based upon the percentage of incurred costs to estimated total costs 
these arrangements require significant production  modification or customization 
in all cases  changes to total estimated costs and anticipated losses  if any  are recognized in the period in which they are determined 
with respect to contract change orders  claims or similar items  judgment must be used in estimating related amounts and assessing the potential for realization 
such amounts are only included in the contract value when they can be reliably estimated and realization is reasonably assured  generally upon receipt of a customer approved change order 
inventories inventories which include materials  labor  and manufacturing overhead are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out basis or net realizable value 
on a quarterly basis  teradyne uses consistent methodologies to evaluate all inventory for net realizable value 
teradyne records a provision for excess and obsolete inventory when such a writedown is identified through the quarterly review process 
the inventory valuation is based upon assumptions about future demand  product mix and possible alternative uses 
stock option and stock purchase plans teradyne accounts for its employee stock option and employee stock purchase plans under the recognition and measurement principles of apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb and related interpretations 
teradyne s employee stock purchase plan is a non compensatory plan 
teradyne s stock option plans are accounted for using the intrinsic value method under the provisions of apb there have been no charges for employee or director stock options or employee stock purchase plans 
proceeds from the exercise of stock options and the issuance of the employee stock purchase plan under teradyne s stock plans are credited to common stock at par value and the excess is credited to additional paid in capital 
teradyne makes pro forma footnote disclosures as though the fair value method was followed under statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for stock based compensation fas  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
see note b accounting policies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for pro forma stock option and stock purchase plan information 
income taxes on a quarterly basis  teradyne evaluates the realizability of its deferred tax assets and assesses the need for a valuation allowance 
as a result of its review undertaken at december   teradyne concluded under applicable accounting criteria that it was more likely than not that its deferred tax assets would not be realized and established a valuation allowance 
due to the continued uncertainty of realization  teradyne maintained its valuation allowance at december  teradyne does not expect to significantly reduce its valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence  including profitability  exists that realization is more likely than not 
goodwill  intangible and long lived assets teradyne assesses the impairment of identifiable intangibles  long lived assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors teradyne considers important in the determination of an impairment include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of teradyne s use of the acquired asset and significant negative industry or economic trends 
when teradyne determines that the carrying value of intangibles and long lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  teradyne measures any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate commensurate with the associated risks 
teradyne assesses goodwill for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter  on a reporting unit basis  or more frequently when events and circumstances occur indicating that the recorded goodwill may be impaired 
if the book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the implied fair value of goodwill is compared with the carrying amount of goodwill 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value  an impairment loss is recorded in an amount equal to that excess 
allowance for doubtful accounts the volatility of the industries that teradyne serves can cause certain of its customers to experience shortages of cash flows  which can impact their ability to make required payments 
teradyne maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
estimated allowances for doubtful accounts are reviewed periodically taking into account the customer s current payment history  the customer s current financial statements and other information regarding the customer s credit worthiness 
if the financial condition of teradyne s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required

as a result of the challenging economic conditions  teradyne has taken significant cost structure initiatives to more appropriately size the business 
actions taken include reductions in workforce across all groups which has led to the consolidation and reorganization of certain functions  curtailment of discretionary expenses  shifts of manufacturing and some shared services operations to lower cost regions  reductions in the number of operating facilities and the outsourcing of certain manufacturing and applications development 
in addition  teradyne has eliminated certain product lines to efficiently allocate engineering and development spending to areas that provide a high potential for growth 
recent increases in business activity indicate that the industry is in the midst of a recovery leading to the next growth cycle 
in the fourth quarter of  teradyne s net bookings increased sequentially  and worldwide semiconductor test utilization levels climbed to levels which had not been seen since the past business peak in although sales remained relatively flat throughout the four quarters of  net bookings increased almost from the first to the second half of the year 
bookings teradyne s net orders for its four principal operating segments for  and are as follows percent change percent change in millions except percent change semiconductor test systems connection systems assembly test systems other test systems from to  the growth in orders shifted more heavily to subcons in taiwan  singapore and other parts of asia 
during the last quarter of  teradyne saw a rise in bookings driven primarily by semiconductor testing needs for the wireless and baseband industries  whose chips are sold mainly by european and us semiconductor companies 
these chips are fabricated and tested by foundries and subcons in many parts of asia  but concentrated in taiwan and singapore and increasingly in china 
the economic downturn which prevailed in the past years has pushed companies to lower fixed costs 
as a result  an increasing trend by chip makers has been to outsource their non core competency testing needs to subcons in low cost regions 
as teradyne s total semiconductor test systems bookings have grown  the bookings from subcons have continued to make up a larger percentage of total orders 
bookings from subcons increased from million in to million in and made up of total semiconductor test systems bookings in compared to of total semiconductor test systems bookings in in  excess inventory  slower economic growth and a reduction in end user demand of electronic goods by teradyne s semiconductor test systems customers resulted in a reduction in capital spending as well as cancellations or postponements of previously placed orders 
from to  semiconductor test systems bookings grew primarily as a result of increased demand for soc products by both idms and subcons 
the increase in connection systems bookings from to was due in part to a decrease in cancellations in  as well as an increase in demand in the telecommunications market  driven by wireless network deployments  which increased appreciably for both us and european telecommunications equipment providers in the latter part of the fourth quarter of compared to the first half of teradyne s high speed high density interconnect and backplane solutions  such as vhdm hsd  are well positioned in this market 
bookings were up modestly in the computer server market  and down in the storage market as connection systems exited a lower margin ems product line and repositioned itself to support its core products 
from to  bookings were impacted by significant cancellations along with a decline in demand of over from key communications customers year over year 
the net decrease in assembly test systems orders from to is due primarily to the sale of the manufacturing software and the manual x ray and rework product lines 
this decrease was offset by a increase in orders by government agencies and contractors in the mil aero business  which had a twofold increase in orders from the first half to the second half of the increase in orders from to largely resulted from the full year impact of the genrad acquisition 
the first half of had strong orders from contract manufacturers in the in circuit test business but demand weakened as a result of the sluggish economy in the latter half of and into the increase in other test systems bookings from to was due primarily to the addition of diagnostic solutions in the fourth quarter of as part of the acquisition of genrad  which includes diagnostic systems  which is included in the other test systems segment 
teradyne s cancellations for its four principal operating segments for the last three years are as follows in millions semiconductor test systems connection systems assembly test systems other test systems the semiconductor test systems cancellations were largely due to orders that were booked in late and early by subcons in anticipation of a further increase in their own demand 
cancellations in the connection systems business came from major customers in the telecommunication and information technology infrastructure industries  as their own demand levels dropped 
teradyne s net bookings by region as a percentage of total net bookings are as follows united states europe south east asia singapore taiwan japan rest of the world for the past three years  teradyne s backlog of unfilled orders for its four principal operating segments is as follows in millions semiconductor test systems connection systems assembly test systems other test systems customers may delay delivery of products or cancel orders suddenly and without significant notice  subject to possible cancellation penalties 
in   and there were no significant cancellation penalties received 
due to possible customer changes in delivery schedules and cancellation of orders  teradyne s backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of the actual sales for any succeeding period 
delays in delivery schedules and or cancellations of backlog during any particular period could have a material adverse effect on teradyne s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
revenue teradyne s net revenue for its four principal operating segments for  and is as follows percent change percent change in millions except percent change semiconductor test systems connection systems assembly test systems other test systems more than half of the semiconductor test systems sales increase from to is attributable to growing sales to subcons for use in their asian facilities  primarily singapore  taiwan and malaysia 
the revenue derived from subcons was driven by higher demand from their mixed signal soc customers  led by sales of catalyst and tiger systems 
as is described in the bookings section  semiconductor test systems has seen a recent growth in revenue due to increased need for testing in the wireless and baseband sectors 
to a lesser extent  the semiconductor test systems segment continues to see revenue growth in the optical disk sector  automotive applications testing  and image sensor testing 
included in semiconductor test systems sales is million from the accounting impact of the implementation of staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition in financial statements in the fourth quarter of due to shipments of customer orders in where title was retained by teradyne until customer payment in order to perfect a security interest 
connection systems sales declined from to primarily as a result of the decision to exit the lower margin ems business 
the segment saw downward pricing pressure throughout the past three years 
the increase in assembly test systems revenue from to largely resulted from the full year impact of the genrad acquisition in the fourth quarter of from the second half of through  the commercial business saw decreases in revenue  particularly in the in circuit test business  while the mil aero business has seen steady revenue numbers throughout the past three years 
the increase in other test systems revenue from to was due primarily to the addition of diagnostic solutions in the fourth quarter of as part of the acquisition of genrad  which includes diagnostic solutions  which is included in the other test systems segment 
teradyne s four principal operating segments accounted for the following percentages of consolidated net revenue for each of last three years semiconductor test systems connection systems assembly test systems other test systems teradyne s net revenue by region as a percentage of total revenue is as follows united states europe south east asia singapore taiwan japan rest of the world teradyne s product and service revenue breakout for the past three years is as follows percent change percent change in millions except percent change product revenue service revenue service revenue is derived from the servicing of teradyne s installed base of products and includes maintenance contracts  repairs  extended warranties  parts sales and applications support 
in the past three years  no single customer accounted for more than of consolidated net revenue 
in   and  teradyne s three largest customers in aggregate accounted for  and of consolidated net revenue  respectively 
gross margin point change point change dollars in millions gross margin percent of total revenue teradyne s gross margin improvement from to was impacted by a variety of factors  including manufacturing efficiencies  lower inventory provisions  and volume and product mix 
gross margin improvement of points is attributed to reduced fixed manufacturing costs  including depreciation and facility costs resulting from restructuring actions primarily taken in the second half of  along with increased sales volumes which resulted in higher utilization 
an improvement of points of gross margin is credited to a shift in teradyne s mix of revenues  with a higher percentage in being derived from semiconductor test systems which has higher incremental margins  coupled with a shift in teradyne s supply chain to low cost regions 
inventory provisions decreased from million in to million in  which contributed a point gross margin improvement 
teradyne s gross margin remained relatively flat from to  and was impacted by a variety of factors including lower inventory provisions  offset by pricing pressures and lower utilization of fixed manufacturing costs as sales volumes decreased 
inventory provisions decreased from million in to million in  which contributed a point gross margin improvement 
as sales volumes decreased from to and certain components of cost of revenues remained fixed  gross margin was negatively impacted by points due to the lower utilization of manufacturing overhead 
pricing pressures  net of product mix and cost reduction activities in the second half of resulted in a point decrease in gross margin 
the breakout of product and service gross margin is as follows point change point change dollars in millions product gross margin percent of product revenue point change point change dollars in millions service gross margin percent of service revenue teradyne assesses the carrying value of its inventory on a quarterly basis by estimating future demand and comparing that demand against on hand and on order inventory positions 
forecasted revenue information is obtained from the sales and marketing groups and incorporates factors such as backlog and future revenue demand 
this quarterly process identifies obsolete and excess inventory 
obsolete inventory  which represents items for which there is no demand  is fully reserved 
excess inventory  which represents inventory items that are not expected to be consumed during the next four quarters  is written down to estimated net realizable value 
the activity with respect to the provisions recorded for excess and obsolete inventory for   and is as follows in thousands inventory provisions for inventory scrapped inventory sold balance at december  inventory provisions for inventory scrapped inventory sold balance at december  inventory scrapped inventory sold balance at december  inventory provisions for inventory scrapped inventory sold balance at december  inventory scrapped inventory sold balance at december  inventory scrapped inventory sold balance at december  teradyne has no set timeline for scrapping the remaining inventory 
the yearly provisions consisted of obsolete and excess inventory as follows excess inventory obsolete inventory total provision in millions provision provision provision teradyne s writedowns and write offs consisted of raw material and components 
the provisions were accounted for in the following segments dollars in millions semiconductor test systems connection systems assembly test systems other test systems total of the inventory provision recorded in  million relates to assembly test systems which includes million relating to the discontinuance of manufacturing  distributing and primary support of the aoi product line and million relates to semiconductor test systems soc parts and components 
of the inventory provision recorded in for semiconductor test systems  million was in memory test related to probe one and j product line discontinuances 
the probe one and j inventory has been fully written off as of december  there is no material exposure remaining for the probe one or j products 
the total inventory provision for excess and obsolete inventory was million and was principally due to the sharp decline in incoming semiconductor test systems and connection systems orders 
of the provision for semiconductor test systems  million was related to soc parts and million was for memory product parts and components related to an inventory writedown for the discontinuance of teradyne s flash memory product 
teradyne currently does not believe there is any material remaining exposure for the other products that teradyne continues to actively market  although our estimates of future demand may differ from actual demand which may result in additional provisions 
as of december  and december   teradyne had inventory related reserves for amounts which have been written down or written off of million and million  respectively 
engineering and development change change dollars in millions engineering and development percent of total revenue throughout the downturn  teradyne has maintained its commitment to sustained levels of investment in research through continued engineering and development spending 
more than two thirds of teradyne s total engineering and development expenses are incurred by the semiconductor test systems segment  where a new test platform requires up to three years for development and costs between million 
during the past three years  semiconductor test systems has reduced the number of platforms under major development  which has increased the resources for remaining platforms 
the consolidation of multiple product divisions within semiconductor test systems into one group has enabled more leverage and reuse for application specific integrated circuits development and instrumentation 
semiconductor test systems has consolidated engineering facilities  outsourced certain software engineering development to a low cost region and limited the amount of engineering work done by outside consultants in an effort to reduce overall costs 
the reduction in engineering and development expenses from to resulted primarily from the exiting of product lines within semiconductor test systems and assembly test systems 
the elimination of memory test within the semiconductor test systems segment resulted in a reduction of million and million in engineering expenses from to and to  respectively 
as a result of the sale in assembly test systems of its manufacturing software product line and manual x ray inspection and rework product line as well as the discontinuance of the automated optical inspection products  engineering expenses from to decreased by approximately million 
the decrease from to in engineering and development spending resulting from the discontinuance of product lines and actions taken to reduce costs consists of the following amounts million as a result of a workforce reduction  partially offset by a million increase from the elimination of company wide paycuts and the granting of previously frozen salary increases in the third quarter of  million from a reduction in outsourced contract engineering as a result of the decision to use internal resources  million from a decrease in depreciation as a result of the recent writedown of assets  as well as the trend to rent or lease  rather than purchase  development tools  and million from reduced office and facility costs as a result of recent cost saving actions 
the increase in spending from to in engineering and development was primarily due to million as a result of the additional expense base resulting from teradyne s purchase of genrad in the fourth quarter of  and million from the granting of the prior year s previously frozen salary increases during the third quarter of the additional engineering and development expense in compared to was partially offset by actions taken to reduce costs which consist of the following million as a result of a workforce reduction  million from a reduction in outsourced contract engineering as a result of the decision to use internal resources  million for a reduction in prototype engineering materials  and million from a decrease in depreciation as a result of the writedown of assets 
selling and administrative change change dollars in millions selling and administrative percent of total revenue the decrease in spending from to was principally due to the following approximate amounts million as a result of a workforce reduction  partially offset by a million increase from the elimination of company wide paycuts and the granting of previously frozen salary increases  million in reduced utility costs from the consolidation of facilities  lower promotional spending and travel cutbacks  million from a decrease in consulting spending and legal fees  and million in lower depreciation due to the writedown of assets 
the increase in spending from to in selling and administrative was principally due to the additional expense base resulting from teradyne s purchase of genrad in the fourth quarter of with an additional increase coming from the granting of the prior year s previously frozen salary increases during the third quarter of the additional selling and administrative expense was partially offset by workforce reductions and other actions taken to reduce costs which consisted of the following million from a reduction in promotional spending and travel cutbacks 
million from a reduction in consulting spending  and restructuring and other charges the table below summarizes the liability and activity for the year ended december  relating to restructuring and other charges long lived asset impairment severance and benefits loss on sale of product lines facility related other charges total in thousands balance at december  provision cash payments asset writedowns balance at december  the accrual for severance and benefits is reflected in accrued employees compensation and withholdings 
the accrual for lease payments on vacated facilities is reflected in other accrued liabilities and other long term liabilities and is expected to be paid out over the lease terms  the latest of which expires in teradyne expects to pay out million against the lease accrual over the next twelve months 
teradyne s future lease commitments are net of expected sublease income of million as of december  teradyne has subleased approximately of its unoccupied space as of december  and is actively attempting to sublease the remaining space 
prior to january   teradyne recorded restructuring charges for its unoccupied facilities leased under operating leases at the time teradyne committed to the plan to permanently vacate the facilities 
the restructuring charges were based on the difference between the remaining contractual lease commitment after the facilities were to be vacated net of teradyne s estimated probable sublease income 
for actions initiated after january   the restructuring charges were based on the difference between the remaining contractual lease commitment net of teradyne s estimated probable sublease income once teradyne ceased using the facilities 
during the year ended december   teradyne recorded charges of million primarily for certain long lived assets held for sale that were impaired as the estimated fair value was less than the carrying value of these assets 
the charges include the following million for the reduction in the fair value of properties held for sale  million related primarily to the sale and leaseback of manufacturing assets  and million related primarily to manufacturing assets and equipment 
the charge for reduction in the fair value of the properties held for sale resulted from a deterioration in real estate market conditions 
the carrying value of teradyne s assets  primarily manufacturing equipment  held for sale was million as of december  the carrying value of teradyne s assets held for sale was million as of december  these assets were included in property  plant and equipment 
as of december   all of the properties held for sale had been sold 
teradyne owns approximately  square feet of unoccupied space as of december  at its north reading  ma facility that teradyne expects to utilize for future expansion 
teradyne has not recorded any impairment charges for this temporarily idle facility 
teradyne recorded a charge for severance and related benefits during the year ended december  of million 
there were approximately employees terminated in the year ended december  across all functional groups at teradyne 
all remaining severance benefits payable to these employees are expected to be paid by the end of the fourth quarter of during the year ended december   teradyne recorded a charge of million for the loss on sale of product lines  of which million has been recorded in restructuring and other charges and million has been recorded in cost of revenues 
in the first quarter of  the assembly test systems segment sold its manufacturing software product line and manual x ray inspection and rework product line for total cash proceeds of million 
these transactions resulted in a loss of million for the year ended december  teradyne decided to sell the manufacturing software product line and the manual x ray inspection and rework product line because the product lines were not able to generate sufficient levels of revenue and earnings growth 
during the year ended december   the other test systems segment recorded a charge of million to writedown its net assets relating to the sale of the autodiagnos automotive after market product 
autodiagnos was a part of the diagnostic solutions segment  which is a supplier of automotive manufacturing and service bay test and diagnostic systems 
the autodiagnos product line was selling to the independent repair market 
with changes in legislation and consolidations in the automotive industry it became evident that this may have resulted in autodiagnos being in direct competition with some of diagnostic solution s major customers 
strategically  teradyne decided to sell autodiagnos to negate this conflict and concentrate on its core business 
during the year ended december   teradyne recorded a charge of million consisting primarily of revised estimates of the amount and timing of sublease income on facilities that have been exited prior to the end of the lease term 
during the year ended december   teradyne recorded a charge of million primarily for contractual penalties associated with resizing the connection systems business 
the accrual for contractual penalties is reflected in other accrued liabilities 
the restructuring actions taken during are expected to generate cost savings of approximately million annually across all areas of operations

goodwill impairment unless conditions dictate otherwise  teradyne s annual impairment test is performed in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
teradyne tested both reporting units  assembly test systems and connection systems  for impairment during its annual test and concluded that there was no impairment of goodwill in either reporting unit as of december  and during the quarter ended september   teradyne decreased its forecasted revenue  bookings and profit for the fiscal years through from the previous quarter s forecast for the assembly test systems segment and reduced its workforce by employees to appropriately size the segment given the revised business outlook 
as a result  teradyne performed an interim impairment test for the goodwill related to the assembly test systems segment as of september  teradyne concluded that the carrying value of the assets and liabilities associated with the assembly test systems segment did not exceed its fair value and thus no impairment charge was recorded 
the fair value of the segment was estimated using the expected present value of future cash flows 
during the quarter ended september   as a result of contraction in the assembly test systems market to its lowest level in a decade as evidenced by various market reports available to teradyne  teradyne decreased its forecasted revenue  bookings and profit for fiscal years through from the previous quarter s forecast for the assembly test systems segment and reduced its workforce by employees to appropriately size the segment given the revised business outlook 
as a result  teradyne performed an interim impairment test for the goodwill related to the assembly test systems segment as of september  teradyne concluded that the carrying value of the assets and liabilities associated with the assembly test systems segment exceeded its fair value and recognized a million goodwill impairment charge recorded in goodwill impairment in the consolidated statements of operations 
the impairment charge was measured by comparing the implied fair value of the goodwill associated with the assembly test systems segment to its carrying value 
the fair value of the segment was estimated using the expected present value of future cash flows

the valuation allowance was determined in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
which requires an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when determining whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable 
the evidence that teradyne reviewed during the fourth quarter of included actual revenues and net loss for the fiscal year compared to earlier teradyne forecasts  the inability to get to break even during despite implementing several restructuring programs  and a reduction in revenues and an increase in the loss forecasted for the fiscal year as a result of its review undertaken at december   teradyne concluded under applicable accounting criteria that it was more likely than not that its deferred tax assets would not be realized

the inventory and accounts payable  deferred revenue and accrual balances were partially offset by an increase of million in the accounts receivable balances primarily due to an increase in days sales outstanding  based on annualized fourth quarter net revenues  from days in to days in teradyne plans to contribute million to its us qualified pension plan in changes in operating assets and liabilities provided cash of million in primarily due to a decrease in inventory balances of million across all segments and the receipt of a tax refund of million in march of changes in operating assets and liabilities used cash of million in as accounts payable  deferred revenue and accruals balances decreased as purchases slowed but were offset by decreases in accounts receivable and inventory due to market conditions

on october   teradyne issued million principal amount of convertible senior notes due the notes in a private placement and received net proceeds of million 
the notes are convertible at the option of the holders at a rate which is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately per share  which is equal to a conversion rate of approximately shares of common stock per  principal amount of notes 
teradyne began making annual interest payments of million  paid semi annually  on the notes commencing on april  the notes are senior unsecured obligations of teradyne that rank equally with teradyne s existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness 
in the event of a change in control by which teradyne merges with or sells substantially all of its assets to a third party  the holders of the notes may be able to require teradyne to redeem some or all of the notes either in discounted teradyne common stock or in cash 
on february   the securities and exchange commission declared effective a registration statement on form s covering both the notes and the shares of common stock into which they can be converted 
on or after october   teradyne may redeem the notes in whole or in part at the prices set forth below 
the redemption price  expressed as a percentage of principal amount  is as follows for the designated periods period redemption price beginning on october  and ending on october  beginning on october  and ending on october  and thereafter equal to of the principal amount 
presently  it is management s intent to convert a portion of the notes into equity at or around october   if teradyne s stock price is greater than the conversion price of approximately per share  to avoid the continuation of the annual interest payment of million 
however  there can be no assurance that even if teradyne s stock price is above the conversion price upon the notice of redemption that the notes will convert into equity as teradyne s stock price may drop between the redemption notification date and the actual redemption date 
if this were to occur  teradyne would be forced to redeem the portion of the notes called into cash 
there are a number of factors that will affect the timing and amount that management may elect to redeem including teradyne s stock price  teradyne s available cash and marketable securities and teradyne s anticipated future liquidity needs 
on december   teradyne obtained a loan of approximately million in the form of a mortgage loan on its california properties maturing on january  the mortgage 
teradyne prepaid the mortgage in the third quarter of prior to the prepayment  principal payments were made according to a twenty year amortization schedule through december  with the remaining principal due on january  on october   teradyne completed its acquisition of genrad  inc of westford  ma  a leading manufacturer of electronic automatic test equipment  related software  and diagnostic solutions 
genrad s business has been made part of the assembly test systems operating segment excluding the diagnostic solutions business 
diagnostic solutions has been made part of the other test systems operating segment 
under the terms of the acquisition  each outstanding share of genrad common stock was converted into shares of teradyne common stock 
the total number of teradyne shares exchanged for the shares of genrad  based on the shares of genrad outstanding as of the closing  was approximately million 
teradyne believes its cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balance of million will be sufficient to meet working capital and expenditure needs for at least the next twelve months 
teradyne plans to contribute approximately million in to teradyne s us qualified pension plan which is currently under funded 
inflation has not had a significant long term impact on earnings 
retirement plans teradyne s pension expense  which includes the us qualified pension plan  certain qualified plans for non us subsidiaries and a supplemental executive defined benefit plan  was approximately million for the year ended december   which was of teradyne s total operating expenses 
the largest portion of teradyne s pension expense was million for its us qualified pension plan  which is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions  including an expected return on plan assets for teradyne s us qualified pension plan assets of 
in developing the expected return on plan assets assumption  teradyne evaluated input from its investment manager and pension consultants  including their review of asset class return expectations 
teradyne also considered its historical year compounded return of for the period ending december   which has been in excess of the broad equity and bond benchmark indices 
based on these historical returns  teradyne believes that was an appropriate rate to use for fiscal the current asset allocation for teradyne s us qualified pension plan is invested in equity securities and invested in fixed income securities 
teradyne s actual asset allocation as of december  was virtually identical to its asset allocation model 
teradyne s investment manager regularly reviews teradyne s actual asset allocation and periodically rebalances teradyne s investments to teradyne s targeted allocation when considered appropriate 
teradyne will continue to evaluate its expected return on plan assets at least annually  and will adjust these returns as necessary 
teradyne bases its determination of pension expense or income on a market related valuation of assets  which reduces year to year volatility 
this market related valuation recognizes investment gains or losses over a five year period from the year in which they occur 
investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the market related value of assets and the actual return on assets 
since the market related value of assets recognizes gains or losses over a five year period  the future value of assets will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recognized 
as of december  in the us qualified pension plan teradyne had cumulative losses of approximately million  which remain to be recognized in the calculation of the market related value of assets 
the discount rate that teradyne utilized for determining future pension obligations for the us qualified pension plan is based on the salomon brothers pension liability index  which was at at december   down from at december  as a result  teradyne selected for its december  discount rate  which was the same as from december  each year teradyne considers the salomon brothers pension liability index  along with other indices including the moody s aa rated corporate bond yield and the salomon brothers year aaa aa rate 
teradyne estimates that its pension expense for the us qualified pension plan will be approximately million  million and million in fiscal   and  respectively 
the pension expense estimates are based on a discount rate 
future actual pension expense will depend on future investment performance  changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to the employee population participating in teradyne s pension plans 
teradyne performed a sensitivity analysis  which expresses the estimated us qualified pension plan pension expense that would have resulted for the year ended december   if teradyne changed either the discount rate or the expected return on plan assets 
discount rate return on plan assets in millions teradyne s funding policy is to make contributions to the plans in accordance with local laws and to the extent that such contributions are tax deductible 
the assets of these plans consist primarily of equity and fixed income securities 
the value of teradyne s us qualified pension plan assets has increased from million at december  to million at december  the investment performance returns and teradyne contributions have decreased the deficit of teradyne s us qualified pension plan  net of benefit obligations  from million at december  to million at december  during  teradyne contributed million to the us qualified pension plan 
teradyne plans to contribute approximately million in to this plan in order to meet the erisa minimum funding requirements

certain factors that may affect future results from time to time  information provided by teradyne  statements made by its employees or information included in its filings with the securities and exchange commission including this form k contain statements that are not purely historical  but are forward looking statements  made under section e of the securities exchange act of  which involve risks and uncertainties 
in particular  forward looking statements made herein include projections  plans and objectives for teradyne s business  financial condition  operating results  future operations  or future economic performance  statements relating to the sufficiency of capital to meet working capital requirements  capital expenditures  expectations as to customer orders and demand for teradyne s products and statements relating to backlog  bookings and cancellations  gross margins and pricing considerations 
these statements are neither promises nor guarantees but involve risks and uncertainties  both known and unknown  which could cause teradyne s actual future results to differ materially from those stated in any forward looking statements 
factors that may cause such differences include  but are not limited to  the factors discussed below 
these factors  and others  are discussed from time to time in teradyne s filings with the securities and exchange commission 
teradyne s business is impacted by the slowdown in economies worldwide 
teradyne s business has been negatively impacted by the slowdown in the global economies that began in the second half of the uncertainty regarding the growth rate of the worldwide economies has caused companies to reduce capital investments and may cause a further reduction of such investments 
these reductions have been particularly severe in the electronics and semiconductor industry which teradyne serves and have contributed to teradyne incurring losses 
teradyne cannot predict if or when the growth rate of worldwide economies will rebound  or whether the growth rate of its business will rebound when the worldwide economies begin to grow 
current geopolitical turmoil and the continuing threat of domestic and international terrorist attacks may adversely impact teradyne s revenues 
international turmoil  exacerbated by the war in iraq and tensions in north korea have contributed to an uncertain political and economic climate  both in the united states and globally  which may affect teradyne s ability to generate revenue on a predictable basis 
in addition  terrorist attacks internationally and the threat of future terrorist attacks both domestically and internationally have negatively impacted an already weakened worldwide economy 
as teradyne sells and manufacturers products both in the united states and internationally  the threat of future terrorist attacks could lead to changes in security and operations at those locations which could increase teradyne s operating costs and which may adversely affect teradyne s business 
these conditions make it difficult for teradyne  and its customers  to accurately forecast and plan future business activities and could have a material adverse effect on teradyne s business  financial condition and results of operations 
teradyne s business is dependent on the current and anticipated market for electronics 
teradyne s business and results of operations depend in significant part upon capital expenditures of manufacturers of semiconductors and other electronics  which in turn depend upon the current and anticipated market demand for those products 
the current and anticipated market demand for electronics has been impacted by the economic slowdown that began in the latter portions of and the effects of the hostilities begun in september historically  the electronics and semiconductor industry has been highly cyclical with recurring periods of over supply  which often have had a severe negative effect on demand for test equipment  including systems manufactured and marketed by teradyne 
teradyne believes that the markets for newer generations of electronic products such as those that teradyne manufactures and markets will also be subject to similar fluctuations 
teradyne is dependent on the timing of customer orders and the deferral or cancellation of previous customer orders could have an adverse effect on its results of operations 
teradyne cannot assure that any increase in revenues or new orders for a calendar year will be sustained in subsequent years 
in addition  any factor adversely affecting the electronics industry or particular segments within the electronics industry may adversely affect teradyne s business  financial condition and operating results 
teradyne has taken measures to address the past slowdown in the market for its products which could have long term negative effects on teradyne s business 
teradyne has taken measures to address the slowdown in the market for its products 
in particular  teradyne has reduced its workforce  closed and or sold facilities  discontinued certain of its product lines  implemented material cost reduction programs and reduced its planned capital expenditures and expense budgets 
these measures have reduced expenses in the face of decreased revenues due to decreased or cancelled customer orders 
however  each measure teradyne has taken to contain expenditures could have long term negative effects on teradyne s business by reducing its pool of technical talent  decreasing or slowing improvements in its products  increasing teradyne s debt  and making it more difficult for teradyne to respond to customers or competitors  as the market and customer orders turn around 
teradyne may not be able to adequately address a rapid increase in customer demand because teradyne took measures during the past three years to scale back operations and reduce expenses in response to decreased customer demand for products and services  and because visibility into teradyne s market is limited  teradyne may not be able to satisfy a rapid increase in customer demand  as the market turns around 
teradyne s ability to meet increases in customer demand is  to a certain extent  dependant upon the ability of its suppliers and contractors to meet increased product or delivery requirements  which teradyne has little or no control over 
teradyne s business may be adversely impacted by acquisitions which may affect its ability to manage and maintain its business 
since teradyne s inception  it has acquired a number of businesses 
in the future  teradyne may undertake additional acquisitions of businesses that complement its existing operations 
such past or future acquisitions could involve a number of risks  including the diversion of the attention of management and other key personnel  the inability to effectively integrate an acquired business into teradyne s culture  product and service delivery methodology and other standards  controls  procedures and policies  the inability to retain the management  key personnel and other employees of an acquired business  the inability to retain the customers of an acquired business  the possibility that teradyne s reputation will be adversely affected by customer satisfaction problems of an acquired business  potential known or unknown liabilities associated with an acquired business  including but not limited to regulatory  environmental and tax liabilities  the amortization of acquired identifiable intangibles  which may adversely affect teradyne s reported results of operations  and litigation which has or which may arise in the future in connection with such acquisitions 
for example  in connection with the august acquisition of each of herco technology corp  a california company  and perception laminates  inc  a california company  a complaint was filed on or about september  and is now pending in federal district court  san diego  california  by the former owners of those companies naming as defendants teradyne and two of its executive officers 
this case is further described in part i  item legal proceedings in this form k 
additionally  in  teradyne was designated as a potentially responsible party prp at a clean up site in los angeles  california 
this claim arises out of teradyne s acquisition of perception laminates  inc in august prior to that date  perception laminates had itself acquired certain assets of alco industries inc under an asset purchase agreement dated july  this case is further described in part i  environmental affairs in this form k 
in addition to the foregoing  any acquired business could significantly underperform relative to teradyne s expectations 
teradyne currently faces  and in the future may be the subject of  securities class action litigation due to past or future stock price volatility 
teradyne and two of its executive officers were named as defendants in three purported class action complaints that were filed in federal district court  boston  massachusetts  in october and november the court consolidated the cases and has appointed three lead plaintiffs 
on november   plaintiffs filed and served a consolidated amended class action complaint 
the complaint alleges  among other things  that the defendants violated sections b and a of the securities exchange act of  by making  during the period from july  until october   material misrepresentations and omissions to the investing public regarding teradyne s business operations and future prospects 
the complaint seeks unspecified damages  including compensatory damages and recovery of reasonable attorneys fees and costs 
teradyne filed a motion to dismiss all claims asserted in the complaint on february  on april   the lead plaintiffs filed a memorandum in opposition to teradyne s motion to dismiss 
on may   teradyne filed a reply memorandum in support of its motion to dismiss all claims asserted in the complaint 
oral arguments in connection with teradyne s motion to dismiss were presented to the district court on june  claims asserted in this case are similar to the claims asserted in the case discussed above  which is pending in the federal district court in san diego  california 
on january   the us magistrate judge recommended to the us district court that teradyne s motion to dismiss the consolidated amended class action complaint in its entirety be allowed without prejudice 
on february   the lead plaintiffs filed an objection to the us magistrate judge s recommendation 
teradyne is currently preparing its response to the lead plaintiffs objection 
teradyne believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims and will defend itself vigorously 
management does not believe that the outcomes of these claims will have a material adverse effect on teradyne s financial position or results of operations but there can be no assurance that any such claims would not have a material adverse effect on teradyne s financial position or results of operations 
teradyne s business may be adversely impacted by divestitures of lines of business which may affect its ability to manage and maintain its business 
since teradyne s inception  it has divested itself of certain lines of business 
in the future  teradyne may undertake additional divestitures 
such past or future divestitures could involve a number of risks  including the diversion of the attention of management and other key personnel  disruptions and other effects caused by the divestiture of a line of business on teradyne s culture  product and service delivery methodology and other standards  controls  procedures and policies  customer satisfaction problems caused by the loss of a divested line of business  restructuring  inventory and other charges which may affect teradyne s results of operations  and the decreased diversification of teradyne s product lines caused by the divestiture of a line of business which may make teradyne s operating results subject to increased market fluctuations 
if teradyne is unable to protect its intellectual property  teradyne may lose a valuable asset or may incur costly litigation to protect its rights 
teradyne s products incorporate technology that it protects in several ways  including patents  copyrights and trade secrets ip 
while teradyne believes that its ip has value in the aggregate  no single element of its ip is in itself essential 
if a significant portion of teradyne s ip is invalidated or ineffective  teradyne s business could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  teradyne receives notifications from time to time that it may be in violation of patents held by others 
an assertion of patent infringement against teradyne  if successful  could have a material adverse effect on its ability to sell its products  or could require a lengthy and expensive defense which could adversely affect its operating results 
if teradyne fails to develop new technologies to adapt to its customers needs and if its customers fail to accept its new products  teradyne s revenues will be adversely affected 
teradyne believes that its technological position depends primarily on the technical competence and creative ability of its engineers 
teradyne s development of new technologies  commercialization of those technologies into products and market acceptance and customer demand for those products are critical to teradyne s success 
successful product development and introduction depends upon a number of factors  including new product selection  development of competitive products by competitors  timely and efficient completion of product design  timely and efficient implementation of manufacturing  and assembly processes and product performance at customer locations 
teradyne is subject to intense competition 
teradyne faces significant competition throughout the world in each of its operating segments 
some of teradyne s competitors have substantial financial and other resources to pursue engineering  manufacturing  marketing and distribution of their products 
teradyne also faces competition from internal suppliers at several of its customers 
some of teradyne s competitors have introduced or announced new products with certain performance characteristics which may be considered equal or superior to those teradyne currently offers 
teradyne expects its competitors to continue to improve the performance of their current products and to introduce new products or new technologies that provide improved cost of ownership and performance characteristics 
new product introductions by competitors could cause a decline in revenues or loss of market acceptance of teradyne s products 
moreover  increased competitive pressure could lead to intensified price based competition  which could materially adversely affect teradyne s business  financial condition and results of operations 
teradyne is subject to risks of operating internationally 
teradyne derives a significant portion of its total revenue from customers outside the united states 
the table set out below summarizes total teradyne revenue earned within the united states us and outside the us non us for the last three fiscal years for the year ended december dollars in millions us non us teradyne s international revenues and operations are subject to significant risks and difficulties  including unexpected changes in legal and regulatory requirements and in policy changes affecting international markets  changes in tariffs and exchange rates  social  political and economic instability  acts of terrorism and international conflicts  difficulties in accounts receivable collection  cultural differences in the conduct of business  difficulties in staffing and managing international operations  potentially adverse tax consequences  and compliance with customs regulations 
in addition  an increasing portion of teradyne s products are sourced or manufactured in foreign locations  including china  and a large portion of the devices teradyne s products test are fabricated and tested by foundries and subcontractors in taiwan  singapore  china and other parts of asia 
as a result  teradyne is subject to a number of economic and other risks  particularly during times of political or financial instability in these regions 
disruption of manufacturing or supply sources in these international locations could materially adversely impact teradyne s ability to fill customer orders and potentially result in lost business 
teradyne s business may suffer if it is unable to attract and retain key employees 
competition for employees with skills required by teradyne is intense in the high technology industry 
teradyne s success will depend on its ability to attract and retain key technical employees 
the loss of one or more key or other employees  teradyne s inability to attract additional qualified employees  or the delay in hiring key personnel could each have a material adverse effect on teradyne s business  results of operations or financial condition 
if teradyne s suppliers do not meet teradyne s product or delivery requirements  teradyne could have reduced revenues and earnings 
certain components  including semiconductor chips  may be in short supply from time to time because of high industry demand or the inability of some vendors to consistently meet teradyne s quality or delivery requirements 
approximately of material purchases require some custom work where having multiple suppliers would be cost prohibitive 
if any of teradyne s suppliers were to cancel contracts or commitments with teradyne or fail to meet the quality or delivery requirements needed to satisfy customer orders for teradyne s products  teradyne could lose time sensitive customer orders and have significantly decreased quarterly revenues and earnings  which would have a material adverse effect on teradyne s business  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  teradyne relies upon contract manufacturers for certain subsystems used in its products  and teradyne s ability to meet customer orders for those products depends upon the timeliness and quality of the work performed by these subcontractors  over whom teradyne does not exercise any control 
in addition  teradyne is dependent on the financial strength of its suppliers 
for example  on september   a supplier of teradyne filed a petition for chapter bankruptcy 
while the loss of this supplier has not had a material adverse effect on teradyne s business  results of operations or financial condition  there can be no assurance that the loss of other teradyne suppliers either as a result of bankruptcy or otherwise will not have a material adverse effect on teradyne s business  results of operations or financial condition 
teradyne may incur significant liabilities if it fails to comply with environmental regulations 
teradyne is subject to environmental regulations and statutory strict liability relating to the use  storage  discharge  site cleanup and disposal of hazardous chemicals used in its manufacturing processes 
if teradyne fails to comply with present and future regulations  or is required to perform site remediation  teradyne could be subject to future liabilities or the suspension of production 
present and future regulations may also restrict teradyne s ability to expand its facilities  require teradyne to acquire costly equipment  or require teradyne to incur other significant costs and expenses 
pursuant to present regulations and agreements  teradyne is conducting groundwater and subsurface assessment and monitoring and is implementing remediation and corrective action plans for facilities located in california  massachusetts and new hampshire which are no longer conducting manufacturing operations 
as of december   teradyne has not incurred material costs as result of the monitoring and remediation steps taken at the california  massachusetts and new hampshire sites 
teradyne has substantially increased its indebtedness 
on october   teradyne completed a private placement of million principal amount of convertible senior notes the notes due and received net proceeds of million 
as a result  teradyne has incurred approximately million principal amount of additional indebtedness  substantially increasing its ratio of debt to total capitalization 
the level of teradyne s indebtedness  among other things  could make it difficult for teradyne to make payments on its debt and other obligations  make it difficult for teradyne to obtain any necessary future financing for working capital  capital expenditures  debt service requirements or other purposes  require the dedication of a substantial portion of any cash flow from operations to service indebtedness  thereby reducing the amount of cash flow available for other purposes  including capital expenditures  limit teradyne s flexibility in planning for  or reacting to changes in  its business and the industries in which teradyne competes  place teradyne at a competitive disadvantage with respect to less leveraged competitors and competitors that have better access to capital resources  and make teradyne more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in its business 
there can be no assurance that teradyne will be able to meet its debt service obligations  including its obligations under the notes 
teradyne may not be able to satisfy certain obligations in the event of a change in control 
the indenture governing the notes contains provisions that apply to a change in control of teradyne 
if a change in control occurs  the holders of the notes have the right to require teradyne to repurchase all of the notes not previously called for redemption 
the price that teradyne is required to pay is of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased  together with interest accrued but unpaid to  but excluding  the repurchase date 
at teradyne s option and subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions  instead of paying the repurchase price in cash  it may pay the repurchase price in common stock valued at of the average of the closing prices of common stock for the five trading days immediately preceding and including the third trading day prior to the repurchase date 
if teradyne is required to repurchase the notes  there is no guarantee that it will have enough funds to pay such amounts 
as a result  a change of control of teradyne could have a material adverse effect on its business  results of operations or financial condition 
teradyne may not be able to pay its debt and other obligations 
if teradyne s cash flow is inadequate to meet its obligations  teradyne could face substantial liquidity problems 
if teradyne sustains continued losses or is unable to generate sufficient cash flow or otherwise obtain funds necessary to make required payments on the notes or certain of its other obligations  teradyne would be in default under the terms thereof  which would permit the holders of those obligations to accelerate their maturity and also could cause defaults under future indebtedness teradyne may incur 
any such default could have a material adverse effect on teradyne s business  prospects  financial position and operating results 
in addition  teradyne cannot assure that it would be able to repay amounts due in respect of the notes payment if those obligations were to be accelerated following the occurrence of any other event of default as defined in the instruments creating those obligations 
moreover  teradyne cannot assure that it will have sufficient funds or will be able to arrange for financing to pay the principal amount due on the notes at maturity 
teradyne may need additional financing  which could be difficult to obtain 
teradyne expects that its existing cash and marketable securities and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet teradyne s cash requirements to fund operations and expected capital expenditures for the next twelve months 
however  teradyne has a finite amount of cash and in the event teradyne may need to raise additional funds  due to on going losses or other reasons  teradyne cannot be certain that it will be able to obtain such additional financing on favorable terms  if at all  particularly in light of teradyne s continued quarterly losses 
further  if teradyne issues additional equity securities  stockholders may experience additional dilution or the new equity securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of existing holders of common stock 
future financings may place restrictions on how teradyne operates its business 
if teradyne cannot raise funds on acceptable terms  if and when needed  teradyne may not be able to develop or enhance its products and services  take advantage of future opportunities  grow its business or respond to competitive pressures  which could seriously harm teradyne s business 
if teradyne is required to account for options under its employee stock plans as a compensation expense  teradyne s compensation expense would be increased 
there has been an increasing public debate about the proper accounting treatment for employee stock options 
teradyne currently discloses pro forma compensation expense quarterly and annually by calculating the grants fair value and disclosing the impact on net loss and net loss per share in a footnote to the consolidated financial statements 
if future laws and regulations require teradyne to record the fair value of all stock options as compensation expense in its consolidated statement of operations  its reported operating results will be adversely affected 
note b accounting policies  of the consolidated financial statements reflects the impact that such a change in accounting treatment would have had on teradyne s net loss and net loss per share if it had been in effect during the year ended december  included in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  are additional stock based compensation disclosures 
provisions of teradyne s charter and by laws and massachusetts law make a takeover of teradyne more difficult 
teradyne s basic corporate documents  its stockholder rights plan and massachusetts law contain provisions that could discourage  delay or prevent a change in the control of teradyne  even if a change of control might be regarded as beneficial to some or all of teradyne s stockholders 
teradyne s operating results are likely to fluctuate significantly 
teradyne s annual operating results are affected by a wide variety of factors that could materially adversely affect revenues and profitability 
with respect to the operating results for the year ending december   the following factors materially and adversely affected revenues and profitability competitive pressures on selling prices  provisions for excess and obsolete inventory relating to the lack of demand for and the discontinuance of products  and impairment charges for certain long lived assets  the above factors  in conjunction with the additional factors set out below are expected to impact future operations teradyne s ability to introduce and the market acceptance of new products planned for and beyond  changes in product revenue mix resulting from changes in customer demand  the level of orders received which can be shipped in a quarter resulting from the tendency of customers to wait until late in a quarter to commit to purchase due to capital expenditure approvals and constraints occurring at the end of a quarter  or the hope of obtaining more favorable pricing from a competitor seeking the business  engineering and development investments relating to the new product introductions in  new product introductions planned for and the expansion of manufacturing and engineering operations in asia  and ability of teradyne s suppliers and subcontractors to meet product quality or delivery requirements needed to satisfy customer orders for teradyne products  especially if product demand increases rapidly 
in particular  due to teradyne s introduction of a number of new  complex test systems in and the planned introduction of other systems in  there can be no assurance that teradyne will not experience delays in shipment of its products or that its products will achieve customer acceptance 
as a result of the foregoing and other factors  teradyne has and may continue to experience material fluctuations in future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis which could materially and adversely affect its business  financial condition  operating results and stock price 
teradyne s investor confidence and share value may be adversely impacted if teradyne s independent auditors are unable to provide teradyne with the attestation of the adequacy of teradyne s internal controls over financial reporting as of december   as required by section of the sarbanes oxley act of the securities and exchange commission  as directed by section of the sarbanes oxley act of  adopted rules requiring public companies to include a report of management on teradyne s internal controls over financial reporting in their annual reports on form k that contain an assessment by management of the effectiveness of teradyne s internal controls over financial reporting 
in addition  teradyne s independent auditors must attest to and report on management s assessment of the effectiveness of teradyne s internal controls over financial reporting 
this requirement will first apply to teradyne s annual report on form k for the fiscal year ending december  although teradyne intends to diligently and vigorously review its internal controls over financial reporting in order to ensure compliance with the section requirements  if teradyne s independent auditors are not satisfied with teradyne s internal controls over financial reporting or the level at which these controls are documented  designed  operated or reviewed  or if the independent auditors interpret the requirements  rules and or regulations differently from teradyne  then they may decline to attest to management s assessment or may issue a report that is qualified 
this could result in an adverse reaction in the financial marketplace due to a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of teradyne s financial statements  which ultimately could negatively impact the market price of teradyne s shares 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s concentration of credit risk financial instruments which potentially subject teradyne to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash investments  forward currency contracts and accounts receivable 
teradyne maintains cash investments primarily in us treasury and government agency securities and corporate debt securities  rated aa or higher  which have minimal credit risk 
teradyne places forward currency contracts with high credit quality financial institutions in order to minimize credit risk exposure 
concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of geographically dispersed customers 
teradyne performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers financial condition and does not require collateral to secure accounts receivable 
exchange rate risk management teradyne regularly enters into forward contracts in european and japanese currencies to hedge its overseas net monetary position 
forward currency contracts generally have maturities of less than one year 
these contracts are used to reduce teradyne s risk associated with exchange rate movements  as gains and losses on these contracts are intended to offset exchange losses and gains on underlying exposures 
teradyne does not engage in currency speculation 
at december  and  the face amount of outstanding forward currency contracts to buy us dollars to hedge those currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities denominated in non functional currencies was million and million  respectively 
a fluctuation in exchange rates for and currencies would change the fair value by approximately million and million  respectively 
however  since these contracts hedge non us currency assets and liabilities  any change in the fair value of the contracts would be offset by opposite changes in the underlying value of these assets and liabilities being hedged 
the hypothetical movement was estimated by calculating the fair value of the forward currency contracts at december  and and comparing that with those calculated using hypothetical forward currency exchange rates 
interest rate risk management teradyne is exposed to potential loss due to changes in interest rates 
the principal interest rate exposure is to changes in domestic interest rates 
investments with interest rate risk include short and long term marketable securities 
debt with interest rate risk includes the fixed rate convertible debt and mortgages 
in order to estimate the potential loss due to interest rate risk  a fluctuation in interest rates was assumed 
since the notes were out of the money at year end  they were treated as a fixed rate debt security and the analysis assumes that the entire principal amount is repaid in full at maturity and the exercise of the embedded equity option is ignored 
on this basis  the potential loss on the fair value of debt was not material at december   and was million at december  market risk for the short and long term marketable securities was estimated as the potential change in the fair value resulting from a hypothetical change in interest rates for securities contained in the investment portfolio 
on this basis  the potential change in fair value from changes in interest rates is million and million as of december  and  respectively
