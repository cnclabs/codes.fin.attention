item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general petroquest is an independent oil and gas company engaged in the exploration  development  acquisition and operation of oil and gas properties onshore and offshore in the gulf coast region and the east texas area 
we have been active in the gulf coast area since  which gives us extensive geophysical  technical and operational expertise in this area 
our business strategy is to increase production  cash flow and reserves through exploration  development and acquisition of properties located in the gulf coast region  as well as finding additional opportunities in areas with longer reserve lives 
during  the company completed a million subordinated term credit facility with macquarie americas corp 
macquarie 
the sub debt facility is available for advances at any time until december  subject to restrictive covenants 
macquarie received warrants to purchase  of our common stock at an exercise price of per share 
we also completed an acquisition in the southeast carthage field in east texas during this property increased our proved reserves by approximately bcfe and was funded primarily through our credit facilities 
as a result of this acquisition  we expect an increase in our production rate and revenues  as well as an increase in operating expenses and interest expense 
new accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas  accounting for asset retirement obligations  which requires recording the fair value of an asset retirement obligation associated with tangible long lived assets in the period incurred 
retirement obligations associated with long lived assets included within the scope of sfas are those for which there is a legal obligation to settle under existing or enacted law  statute  written or oral contract or by legal construction under the doctrine of promissory estoppel 
we adopted sfas effective january  the net difference between our previously recorded abandonment liability and the amounts estimated under sfas  after taxes  totaled a gain of  which has been recognized as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
the gain is due to the effect on the historical depletion as a result of the retirement obligation being recorded at fair value 
on a pro forma basis  the impact for the year ended december  would have increased net income by approximately  we have legal obligations to plug  abandon and dismantle existing wells and facilities that we have acquired and constructed during our existence 
as of january   we recognized a  liability for our asset retirement obligations and recorded the related additional assets that will be depreciated using the unit of production method 
in january  the financial accounting standards board issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin  which requires companies to evaluate variable interest entities to determine whether to apply the consolidation provisions of fin to those entities 
the consolidation provisions of fin  if applicable  would apply to variable interest entities created after january  immediately  and to variable interest entities created before february  in our interim period beginning october  we believe that we have no interests in these types of entities 
critical accounting policies full cost method of accounting we use the full cost method of accounting for our investments in oil and gas properties 
under this method  all acquisition  exploration and development costs  including certain related employee costs  incurred for the purpose of exploring for and developing and oil and natural gas are capitalized 
acquisition costs include costs incurred to purchase  lease or otherwise acquire property 
exploration costs include the costs of drilling exploratory wells  including those in progress and geological and geophysical service costs in exploration activities 
development costs include the costs of drilling development wells and costs of completions  platforms  facilities and pipelines 
costs associated with production and general corporate activities are expensed in the period incurred 
sales of oil and gas properties  whether or not being amortized currently  are accounted for as adjustments of capitalized costs  with no gain or loss recognized  unless such adjustments would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves of oil and gas 
the costs associated with unevaluated properties are not initially included in the amortization base and related to unevaluated leasehold acreage and delay rentals  seismic data and capitalized interest 
these costs are either transferred to the amortization base with the costs of drilling the related well or are assessed quarterly for possible impairment or reduction in value 
we compute the provision for depletion of oil and gas properties using the unit of production method based upon production and estimates of proved reserve quantities 
unevaluated costs and related carrying costs are excluded from the amortization base until the properties associated with these costs are evaluated 
in addition to costs associated with evaluated properties  the amortization base includes estimated future development costs and dismantlement  restoration and abandonment costs  net of estimated salvage values 
our depletion expense is affected by the estimates of future development costs  unevaluated costs and proved reserves  and changes in these estimates could have an impact on our future earnings 
we capitalize certain internal costs that are directly identified with the acquisition  exploration and development activities 
the capitalized internal costs include salaries  employee benefits  costs of consulting services and other related expenses and do not include costs related to production  general corporate overhead or similar activities 
we also capitalize a portion of the interest costs incurred on our debt 
capitalized interest is calculated using the amount of our unevaluated property and our effective borrowing rate 
capitalized costs of oil and gas properties  net of accumulated dd a and related deferred taxes  are limited to the estimated future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves  discounted at percent  plus the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties  as adjusted for related income tax effects the full cost ceiling 
if capitalized costs exceed the full cost ceiling  the excess is charged to write down of oil and gas properties in the quarter in which the excess occurs 
declines in prices or reserves could result in a future write down of oil and gas properties 
for purposes of calculating the full cost ceiling test  the liability recognized under sfas is netted against property cost and the future abandonment obligations are included in estimated future net cash flows 
given the volatility of oil and gas prices  it is probable that our estimate of discounted future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves will change in the near term 
if oil or gas prices decline  even for only a short period of time  or if we have downward revisions to our estimated proved reserves  it is possible that write downs of oil and gas properties could occur in the future 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations  which requires the use of the purchase method of accounting for business combinations initiated after june  and eliminates the pooling of interests method 
in july  the fasb also issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which discontinues the practice of amortizing goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets and initiates an annual review of impairment 
the new standard also requires that  at a minimum  all intangible assets be aggregated and presented as a separate line item in the balance sheet 
the adoption of sfas no 
and had no impact on our financial position or results of operations 
a reporting issue has arisen regarding the application of certain provisions of sfas no 
and to companies in the extractive industries  including oil and gas companies 
the issue is whether sfas no 
requires registrants to classify the costs of mineral rights associated with extracting oil and gas as intangible assets in the balance sheet  apart from other capitalized oil and gas property costs  and provide specific footnote disclosures 
historically  we have included the costs of mineral rights associated with extracting oil and gas as a component of oil and gas properties 
these costs include those to acquire contract based drilling and mineral use rights such as delay rentals  lease bonuses  commissions and brokerage fees  and other leasehold costs 
if it is ultimately determined that sfas no 
requires oil and gas companies to classify these costs as a separate item on the balance sheet  we would be required to reclassify approximately million at december  and approximately million at december  our cash flows and results of operations would not be affected since such intangible assets would continue to be depleted and assessed for impairment in accordance with full cost accounting rules  as allowed by sfas no 
further  we believe the classification of the costs of mineral rights associated with extracting oil and gas as intangible assets would have an impact on our compliance with the minimum tangible net worth covenant under our bank credit facility 
petroquest will continue to classify its oil and gas leasehold costs as tangible oil and gas properties until further guidance is provided 
we anticipate there will be no effect on our results of operations or cash flows 
future abandonment costs future abandonment costs include costs to dismantle and relocate or dispose of our production platforms  gathering systems  wells and related structures and restoration costs of land and seabed 
we develop estimates of these costs for each of our properties based upon the type of production structure  depth of water  reservoir characteristics  depth of the reservoir  market demand for equipment  currently available procedures and consultations with construction and engineering consultants 
because these costs typically extend many years into the future  estimating these future costs is difficult and requires management to make estimates and judgments that are subject to future revisions based upon numerous factors  including changing technology and the political and regulatory environment 
the accounting for future abandonment costs changed on january   with the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
see new accounting standards in the notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of this accounting standard 
reserve estimates our estimates of oil and gas reserves are  by necessity  projections based on geologic and engineering data  and there are uncertainties inherent in the interpretation of such data as well as the projection of future rates of production and the timing of development expenditures 
reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and gas that are difficult to measure 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data  engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
estimates of economically recoverable oil and gas reserves and future net cash flows necessarily depend upon a number of variable factors and assumptions  such as historical production from the area compared with production from other producing areas  the assumed effect of regulations by governmental agencies  and assumptions governing future oil and gas prices  future operating costs  severance taxes  development costs and workover costs  all of which may in fact vary considerably from actual results 
the future drilling costs associated with reserves assigned to proved undeveloped locations may ultimately increase to the extent that these reserves may be later determined to be uneconomic 
for these reasons  estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of expected oil and gas attributable to any particular group of properties  classifications of such reserves based on risk of recovery  and estimates of the future net cash flows may vary substantially 
any significant variance in the assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of the reserves  which could affect the carrying value of our oil and gas properties and or the rate of depletion of such oil and gas properties 
actual production  revenues and expenditures with respect to our reserves will likely vary from estimates  and such variance may be material 
derivative instruments the estimated fair values of our commodity derivative instruments are recorded in the consolidated balance sheet 
at inception  all of our commodity derivative instruments represent hedges of the price of future oil and gas production 
the changes in fair value of those derivative instruments that qualify for treatment due to being highly effective are recorded to other comprehensive income until the hedged oil or natural gas quantities are produced 
if a hedge becomes ineffective because the expected event does not occur  the fair value of the derivative is recorded on the income statement 
one of our derivatives was deemed ineffective during because of a decline in production in the specific field to which the derivative was designated 
estimating the fair values of hedging derivatives requires complex calculations incorporating estimates of future prices  discount rates and price movements 
instead  we choose to obtain the fair value of our commodity derivatives from the counter parties to those contracts 
since the counter parties are market makers  they are able to provide us with a literal market value  or what they would be willing to settle such contracts for as of the given date 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain operating information with respect to our oil and gas operations for the years ended december   and year ended december  production oil bbls    gas mcf    total production mcfe    sales total oil sales    total gas sales    average sales prices oil per bbl gas per mcf per mcfe the above sales include income loss related to gas hedges of   and  and oil hedges of   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
comparison of results of operations for the years ended december  and net income totaled  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the results are attributable to the following components production oil production in decreased from the year ended december  natural gas production in decreased from the year ended december  on a mcfe basis  total production for the year ended december  decreased over the same period in the decrease in total production volumes  as compared to  was due to the consistent decline of our gulf coast production and well performance at our bordeaux and berry lake wells  partially offset by the drilling success during the second half of prices average oil prices per bbl during were as compared to for the same period in average gas prices per mcf were during as compared to for the same period in stated on a mcfe basis  unit prices received during were higher than the prices received during revenue oil and gas sales during decreased to  as compared to revenues of  the decrease in production volumes partially offset by the significant increase in realized commodity prices resulted in the decrease in revenue 
interest and other income during increased to  as compared to  during the increase is primarily the result of the settlement of a lawsuit during and the related accounting entries as a result of the settlement 
expenses lease operating expenses for decreased to  from  during on a mcfe basis  lease operating expenses increased from per mcfe in to in the increase during on a mcfe basis is primarily due to an overall decline in production rates and the repairs and maintenance costs at the ship shoal field  which did not increase production rates 
general and administrative expenses during totaled  as compared to expenses of  during  net of amounts capitalized of  and  respectively 
the decreases in general and administrative expenses are primarily due to a decrease in staffing levels during the current year 
we recognized  and  of non cash compensation expense during and  respectively 
depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a expense for decreased to  as compared to  in on a mcfe basis  which reflects the changes in production  the dd a rate for was per mcfe as compared to per mcfe for the increase in as compared to is due primarily to costs in excess of previous estimates during the previous twelve months and unsuccessful exploration drilling results during and interest expense  net of amounts capitalized on unevaluated prospects  increased  during as compared to the increase is the result of an increase in the average debt levels during  the higher interest rates on the new subordinated term credit facility and the previously capitalized costs that were expensed on our prior credit facility 
we capitalized  and  of interest during and  respectively 
derivative expense increased  during as compared to this increase is primarily the result of one of our gas derivatives being recorded on the income statement because of a decline in production in the specific field to which the derivative was designated 
the monthly settlements related to this derivative have been recorded to derivative expense effective during june income tax expense of  was recognized during as compared to  being recorded during the increase is due to an increase in operating profit during the current year 
we provide for income taxes at a statutory rate of adjusted for permanent differences expected to be realized  primarily statutory depletion 
comparison of results of operations for the years ended december  and net income totaled  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the results are attributable to the following components production oil production in increased over the year ended december  natural gas production in decreased over the year ended december  on a mcfe basis  total production for the year ended december  decreased over the same period in the decrease in total production volumes  as compared to  was due to the consistent decline of our gulf coast production partially offset by the drilling success during prices average oil prices per bbl during were as compared to for the same period in average gas prices per mcf were during as compared to for the same period in stated on a mcfe basis  unit prices received during were lower than the prices received during revenue oil and gas sales during decreased to  as compared to revenues of  the slight decrease in production volumes and reduced commodity prices resulted in the decrease in revenue 
expenses lease operating expenses for increased to  from  during on a mcfe basis  lease operating expenses increased from per mcfe in to in the increase during is primarily due to increased insurance costs and an increase in the repairs and maintenance at the ship shoal field 
general and administrative expenses during totaled  as compared to expenses of  during  net of amounts capitalized of  and  respectively 
the increases in general and administrative expenses are primarily due to an increase in staffing levels and rent expense related to the generation of prospects  exploration for oil and gas reserves and operation of properties 
we recognized  and  of non cash compensation expense during and  respectively 
dd a expense for increased to  as compared to  in on a mcfe basis  which reflects the changes in production  the dd a rate for was per mcfe as compared to per mcfe for the increase in as compared to is due primarily to costs in excess of previous estimates during the previous twelve months and unsuccessful exploration drilling results during interest expense  net of amounts capitalized on unevaluated prospects  decreased  during as compared to the decrease is the result of an decrease in the average debt levels and interest rates during we capitalized  and  of interest during and  respectively 
income tax expense of  was recognized during as compared to  being recorded during the decrease is due to a decrease in operating profit during the current year 
we provide for income taxes at a statutory rate of adjusted for permanent differences expected to be realized  primarily statutory depletion 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our exploration and development activities to date principally through cash flow from operations  bank borrowings  private and public offerings of common stock and sales of properties 
source of capital operations net cash flow from operations during the year increased from  in to  in the change resulted primarily from changes in the working capital accounts during the current year as compared to the working capital deficit decreased from million at december  to million at december  this decrease was caused primarily by our effort to utilize cash flow to first reduce our working capital deficit and second to drill prospects 
source of capital debt we entered into a new bank credit facility on may  pursuant to the new credit facility agreement  petroquest and our subsidiary petroquest energy  llc the borrower have a million revolving credit facility which permits us to borrow amounts from time to time based on our available borrowing base as determined in the bank credit facility 
the bank credit facility is secured by a mortgage on substantially all of the borrower s oil and gas properties  a pledge of the membership interest of the borrower and petroquest s corporate guarantee of the indebtedness of the borrower 
the borrowing base under the bank credit facility is based upon the valuation as of april and october of each year of the borrower s mortgaged properties  projected oil and gas prices  and any other factors deemed relevant by the lenders 
we or the lenders may also request additional borrowing base redeterminations 
as of december   the borrowing base under the bank credit facility was million and is subject to monthly reductions of million commencing march  we have recently completed a borrowing base redetermination as of march   and the borrowing base is million and subject to monthly reductions of million commencing on july  the bank will determine future monthly reductions in connection with each borrowing base redetermination 
outstanding balances on the revolving credit facility bear interest at either the bank s prime rate plus a margin based on a sliding scale of to based on borrowing base usage but never less than the federal funds effective rate plus or the eurodollar rate plus a margin based on a sliding scale of to depending on borrowing base usage 
the bank credit facility also allows us to use up to million of the borrowing base for letters of credit for fees equal to the applicable margin rate for eurodollar advances 
at march   we had million of borrowings and no letters of credit issued pursuant to the bank credit facility 
we are subject to certain restrictive financial and non financial covenants under the bank credit facility  including a minimum current ratio of to  all as defined in the credit facility agreement 
the bank credit facility also requires the borrower to establish and maintain commodity hedges covering at least of its proved developed producing reserves on a rolling twelve month basis 
as of december   we were in compliance with all of the covenants in the bank credit facility 
the bank credit facility matures on may  on november   we obtained a million subordinated term credit facility from macquarie 
the sub debt facility carries an interest rate of prime plus  is secured by a second mortgage on substantially all of our oil and gas properties and matures november  the sub debt facility is available for advances at any time until december  subject to the restrictive covenants of the sub debt facility and macquarie approval 
at closing  macquarie received warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share 
when cumulative advances under the sub debt facility exceeded million  million and million  macquarie was to receive warrants to purchase an additional  shares   shares and  shares of our common stock  respectively  at the same exercise price per share 
in conjunction with the december  property acquisition  the sub debt facility was amended and the original warrant was cancelled and reissued at which time all  warrants were issued to macquarie 
the warrants are exercisable at any time through the earlier of months following the repayment in full of the sub debt facility or days after daily volume weighted average price of our common stock as published by nasdaq is equal to or greater than  for a period of days  the exercise price multiplied by three 
in addition  we granted macquarie piggy back registration rights with respect to the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants 
as of december   we had million borrowed under the sub debt facility which was primarily used to fund our acquisition of properties in the southeast carthage field 
the sub debt facility  as amended  contains certain restrictive financial and non financial covenants  including a minimum current ratio of to  a total debt threshold of million and a cumulative minimum production and net operating cash flow threshold  all as defined in the sub debt facility 
the sub debt facility also requires us to establish and maintain commodity hedges covering at least of its proved developed producing reserves through november as of december   we were in compliance with all of the covenants in the sub debt facility 
during january  the sub debt facility  including the note  liens  warrants and all other rights of macquarie thereunder  was assigned to macquarie bank limited  an affiliate of macquarie americas corp 
natural gas and oil prices have a significant impact on our cash flows available for capital expenditures and our ability to borrow and raise additional capital 
the amount we can borrow under our bank credit facility is subject to periodic re determination based in part on changing expectations of future prices 
lower prices may also reduce the amount of natural gas and oil that we can economically produce 
additionally  the production declines of certain producing wells resulted in lower production during the year ended december  lower prices and or lower production may decrease revenues  cash flows and the borrowing base under the bank credit facility  thus reducing the amount of financial resources available to meet our capital requirements 
although we do not anticipate debt covenant violations  our ability to comply with our debt agreements is dependent upon the success of our exploration and development program and upon factors beyond our control  such as natural gas and oil prices 
source of capital issuance of equity securities we have an effective universal shelf registration statement relating to the potential public offer and sale by petroquest of any combination of debt securities  common stock  preferred stock  depositary shares  and warrants from time to time or when financing needs arise 
the registration statement does not provide assurance that we will or could sell any such securities 
during october and november  we completed the offering of  shares of our common stock 
the shares were sold to the public for per share 
after underwriting discounts  we realized proceeds of approximately million 
during february and march  we completed the offering of  shares of our common stock 
the shares were sold to the public for per share 
after underwriting discounts  we realized proceeds of approximately million 
source of capital sales of properties on march   we closed the sale of our interest in valentine field for million 
the transaction had an effective date of january  at december   our independent reservoir engineering firm attributed bcfe of proved reserves net to our interest in this field 
consistent with the full cost method of accounting  we did not recognize any gain or loss as a result of this sale 
the proceeds were treated as a reduction of the full cost pool 
use of capital exploration and development we have an exploration and development program budget for the year which will require significant capital 
our capital budget for new projects in is approximately million of which approximately will be incurred in the gulf coast region and the remaining in other areas 
our management believes the cash flows from operations and available borrowing capacity under our credit facilities  will be sufficient to fund planned exploration and development activities 
in the future  our exploration and development activities could require additional financings  which may include sales of additional equity or debt securities  additional borrowings from banks or other lenders  sales of properties  or joint venture arrangements with industry partners 
we cannot assure you that such additional financings will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain additional financing  we could be forced to delay or even abandon some of our exploration and development opportunities or be forced to sell some of our assets on an untimely or unfavorable basis 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  after bank debt   subordinated debt  operating leases  capital projects    consists primarily of leases for office space and leases for equipment rentals 
consists primarily of future obligations to abandon our leased properties 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk s we experience market risks primarily in two areas interest rates and commodity prices 
we believe that our business operations are not exposed to significant market risks relating to foreign currency exchange risk 
our revenues are derived from the sale of our crude oil and natural gas production 
based on projected annual sales volumes for  a decline in the estimated average prices we receive for our crude oil and natural gas production would have an approximate million impact on our revenues 
in a typical hedge transaction  we will have the right to receive from the counterparts to the hedge  the excess of the fixed price specified in the hedge over a floating price based on a market index  multiplied by the quantity hedged 
if the floating price exceeds the fixed price  we are required to pay the counterparts this difference multiplied by the quantity hedged 
we are required to pay the difference between the floating price and the fixed price when the floating price exceeds the fixed price regardless of whether we have sufficient production to cover the quantities specified in the hedge 
significant reductions in production at times when the floating price exceeds the fixed price could require us to make payments under the hedge agreements even though such payments are not offset by sales of production 
hedging will also prevent us from receiving the full advantage of increases in oil or gas prices above the fixed amount specified in the hedge
