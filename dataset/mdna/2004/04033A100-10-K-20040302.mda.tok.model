item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report 
overview we are engaged in the discovery and development of breakthrough medicines to treat cancer by regulating cell signaling with small molecules 
breakthrough medicines are products  created de novo  that may be used to treat diseases in innovative ways 
we are developing a comprehensive approach to treating patients with aggressive and advanced stage disease for whom current therapies are inadequate 
we have also developed a proprietary portfolio of cell signaling regulation technologies  our argent technology  to control intracellular processes with small molecules  providing versatile tools for use in cell biology  functional genomics  proteomics and drug discovery research and useful in regulated protein and cell therapy 
additionally  we have an exclusive license to pioneering technology and patents related to the discovery  development  and use of drugs to regulate nf b cell signaling activity  which can be used to treat medically important disorders  including inflammation  sepsis  cancer and osteoporosis 
since our inception in  we have devoted substantially all of our resources to our research and development programs 
we receive no revenue from the sale of pharmaceutical products  and most of our revenue to date has been received in connection with our past relationship with aventis pharmaceuticals  inc aventis 
except for the gain on the sale of our fifty percent interest in the hoechst ariad genomics center llc to aventis in december  which resulted in net income for fiscal  we have not been profitable since inception 
we expect to incur substantial operating losses for the foreseeable future  primarily due to costs associated with our pharmaceutical product development programs  clinical trials  and product manufacturing 
we expect that losses will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and that these fluctuations may be substantial 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million and cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million and working capital of million 
general our operating losses are primarily due to the costs of development of our product candidates 
as our product development programs progress  we incur significant costs for toxicology and pharmacology studies  product development  manufacturing  clinical trials and regulatory support 
these costs can vary significantly from quarter to quarter depending on the number of product candidates in development  the 
table of contents stage of development of each product candidate  the number of patients enrolled in and complexity of clinical trials and other factors 
because we currently receive no revenue from the sale of pharmaceutical products and receive only limited license revenue  most recently  we have primarily relied on the capital markets as our source of funding 
we also utilize long term debt to supplement our funding  particularly as a means to fund capital and infrastructure needs 
in addition  we may seek funding from collaborations with pharmaceutical  biotechnology or medical device companies for development and commercialization of our product candidates 
these collaborations may take the form of licensing arrangements  joint venture arrangements or other structures 
at this point in time  we have not provided any rights to any outside parties for the marketing or commercialization of our product candidates 
if funding from these various sources is unavailable at reasonable terms  we may be required to reduce our operating expenses in order to conserve cash and capital by delaying  scaling back or eliminating one or more of our product development programs 
critical accounting policies and estimates our financial position and results of operations are affected by subjective and complex judgments  particularly in the areas of stock based compensation to consultants  deferred compensation benefits for executives and key employees  and the carrying value of intangible assets 
in determining expense related to stock based compensation to consultants and deferred compensation  recorded balances are adjusted at each reporting period to reflect fair value utilizing the black scholes option pricing model that takes into account  among other things  the price and volatility of our common stock or other underlying securities  an interest free discount rate  and an estimate of the life of the option contract 
fluctuations in those factors result in uneven expense charges or credits to our statements of operations 
if  for example  the price and volatility of our common stock were greater as of december   we would have recognized an increase of  in stock based compensation to consultants in similarly  if the market price of the underlying securities in our executive deferred compensation plan was higher at december   we would have recognized an additional  in compensation expense in at december   we reported million of intangible assets consisting of costs related primarily to purchased patents  patent applications and licenses  net of accumulated amortization 
these costs are being amortized over the estimated useful lives of the underlying patents or licenses 
changes in these lives or a decision to discontinue using the technologies could result in material changes to our balance sheet and statements of operations 
for example  during and  we expensed  and  respectively  of unamortized costs related to certain intangible assets which we are not actively developing any longer 
we have concluded that the carrying value of our remaining intangible assets is not currently impaired because they are utilized in our anti cancer programs and or continue to be viable technologies for collaborations or licensing efforts which we continue to pursue 
if we were to abandon the underlying technologies or terminate our efforts to pursue collaborations or license agreements  we may be required to write off a portion of the carrying value of our intangible assets 
results of operations years ended december  and revenue we recognized license revenue of  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  the increase in license revenue was due to license agreements into which we have entered with bristol myers squibb company in the fourth quarter of related to our 
table of contents nf b technology and with gpc biotech ag in the first quarter of and altana pharma ag in the second quarter of related to our argent cell signaling regulation technology 
under these agreements  we will receive an additional million in guaranteed minimum payments through  which amount excludes any milestone payments or royalties that might be earned during that period 
operating expenses research and development expenses decreased by to million in from million in this million decrease was attributable  in part  to our decision to focus our research and development efforts on our cancer small molecule product candidates to conserve cash and capital 
as a result  expenses related to scaled back programs decreased by million in compared to our research and development expenses related to our core cancer product candidates decreased by  in compared to due to the conduct in the third and fourth quarter of of certain pre clinical toxicology and pharmacology studies which were substantially completed by the end of the remaining decrease in research and development expenses in compared to was primarily due to reduced personnel expenses  through a reduction in our workforce in march  and related decreases in laboratory and general expenses  reduced expenses related to equipment leases  due to expiration or buy out of most of such leases  and reduced amortization of leasehold improvements that have become fully amortized 
we expect that our research and development expenses will increase in due to continued progress in development of our small molecule product candidates for cancer 
in particular  we expect that we will expand our clinical trials into phase for our lead product candidate ap and advance two other product candidates through preclinical studies 
in addition to the clinical trials and preclinical studies noted above  we will incur costs related to product and process development and manufacturing in support of such efforts 
general and administrative expenses decreased to million in from million in this  decrease was primarily due to decreases in consulting and other professional fees  and reductions in overhead and other expenses  as a result of efforts to conserve cash and capital  offset in part by increases in personnel costs  related to additions of certain personnel and increased insurance costs  reflective of general increases in premiums by insurance companies 
general and administrative expenses included fees and expenses of outside legal counsel of million in and million in related to securities  employment  real estate  general corporate and litigation matters  more than half of which was incurred each year in connection with our litigation with eli lilly company lilly litigation regarding infringement of certain claims of one of our patents 
excluding legal fees and expenses  we expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase in in support of our research and development activities 
we expect our legal costs will vary depending in large part on developments in our lilly litigation 
interest income expense interest income decreased to  in from  in primarily as a result of declining interest rates during the year and a lower level of funds invested 
interest expense decreased to  in from  in this decrease was primarily due to a lower level of long term debt outstanding and lower interest rates in operating results we reported a loss from operations of million in compared to a loss from operations of million in  a decrease in loss of million  or 
this decrease in loss was attributable to decreased operating expenses as a result of our decision to focus our research and development efforts on our cancer small molecule product candidates 
we expect that our loss from operations will increase in 
table of contents due to the expected increases in research and development expenses and general and administrative expenses described above 
losses may fluctuate depending on the extent to which  if at all  we enter into collaborations or partnerships for one or more of our product candidates or licenses for our technologies 
the extent of operating losses will also depend on our ability to raise funding from other sources  such as the capital markets  which will influence the amount we will spend on research and development and the development timelines for our product candidates 
we reported a net loss of million in or per share basic and diluted as compared to a net loss of million in or per share basic and diluted 
years ended december  and revenue we recognized license revenue of  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  the increase in license revenue was due to license agreements into which we have entered related to our nf b and argent cell signaling regulation technologies 
operating expenses research and development expenses increased to million in from million in this million increase in expenses as compared to those incurred in was primarily due to the costs of advancing our product candidates through preclinical and clinical phases of development 
preclinical costs include product development costs including pharmacology and toxicology studies and manufacturing costs to produce and scale up material for various studies and clinical trials 
our increase in development activity resulted in a higher level of spending on product development million  product manufacturing and external activities in support of clinical development  and increased personnel expenses 
in addition  we wrote off  of capitalized patent and license costs reflecting our evaluation of several technologies in our portfolio which we are not actively developing at this time 
such increases in costs were partially offset by decreased overhead expenses  and decreased consulting costs 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in this million increase in expenses as compared to those incurred in was primarily due to increased professional expenses  resulting principally from our lilly litigation  personnel expenses  resulting from additions to our legal and business development personnel and other general expenses interest income expense interest income decreased by to  in from million in primarily as a result of declining interest rates during the year and a lower level of funds invested 
interest expense increased by to  in from  in this increase was primarily due to a higher level of long term debt outstanding in offset  in part  by lower interest rates for other income tax refund other income for the year ended december  consisted of a one time tax refund of  received in june  due to changes in the tax laws 
as a result of these changes  we were able to carry back a portion of the loss to offset the taxes resulting from the sale of our interest in the hoechst ariad genomics center llc to aventis 
in december  we recognized a gain on the sale of million  net of  in alternative minimum tax  and reported the gain in other income

selected quarterly financial data summarized unaudited quarterly financial data are as follows in thousands  except per share amounts quarters first second third fourth total license revenue net loss net loss per share basic and diluted quarters first second third fourth total license revenue net loss net loss per share basic and diluted liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations primarily through sales of our common stock to institutional investors and  to a lesser extent  through sales of our common stock pursuant to our stock option and employee stock purchase plans  supplemented by the issuance of long term debt 
we sell securities and take on debt when the terms of such transactions are deemed favorable to us and as necessary to fund our current and projected cash needs 
we seek to balance the level of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities on hand with our projected needs and to allow us to withstand periods of uncertainty relative to the availability of funding on favorable terms 
sources of funds during the years ended december   and  we raised funding from the following sources year ended december  in thousands sales of common stock to institutional investors pursuant to stock option and employee stock purchase plans increase decrease in long term debt  net the amount of funding we raise through sales of our common stock depends on many factors  including  but not limited to  the status and progress of our product development programs  projected cash needs  availability of funding from other sources and the status of the capital markets 
during  we raised 
table of contents million in a private placement of our common stock 
in  with additional progress in the development of our product candidates and an increased focus on oncology  we successfully completed three private placements with institutional investors and realized net proceeds of million 
the following table details our sales of common stock to institutional investors in  and number of net cash shares proceeds in thousands may and june average price per share of october per share november per share may per share october per share december per share we have filed shelf registration statements with the united states securities and exchange commission sec  from time to time  to ensure that we have registered shares of our common stock available for sale  giving us the opportunity to raise funding when terms are favorable 
on december   we filed a shelf registration statement with the sec for the issuance of up to  shares of our common stock  which was declared effective on january  these shares remain available for sale at our discretion  subject to certain limitations under federal securities laws and the rules of the nasdaq stock market 
in march  we entered into a term loan agreement with a bank for million  the proceeds of which were used to repay existing long term debt  to pay off our obligations under certain operating leases for equipment and for general working capital purposes 
the loan is secured by all of our assets excluding intellectual property  which we have agreed not to pledge to any other party 
the loan carries interest at the bank s prime rate or libor plus 
we amended the terms of the loan on december  and received another million in loan proceeds 
the amended loan is payable in monthly installments of  plus interest beginning in january with a final payment of  due in march the terms of the loan require us to maintain at least million in unrestricted cash  cash equivalents and investments 
the agreement also contains certain covenants that restrict additional indebtedness  additional liens  and sales of assets  and dividends  distributions or repurchases of common stock 
the balance outstanding as of december  was  uses of funds the primary uses of our cash are to fund our operations and working capital requirements and  to a lesser degree  to invest in intellectual property and to purchase equipment as needed for our business 
our uses of cash during the years ended december   and were as follows year ended december  in thousands net cash used in operating activities investment in intangible assets purchase of equipment 
table of contents the net cash used in operating activities is comprised of our net losses and working capital requirements 
as noted above  our net loss increased in due to the costs of advancing our product candidates through preclinical and clinical phases of development  and decreased in as we reduced our operating expenses to conserve cash and capital 
also as noted above  we expect that our loss from operations will increase in due to continued progress in clinical and preclinical development of our small molecule product candidates for cancer 
as a consequence  we expect that our net cash used in operations will increase to approximately million in we expect that our investment in intangible assets  which primarily consist of patents and licenses that make up our intellectual property portfolio  and in equipment will increase in contractual obligations we have substantial fixed contractual obligations under various research and licensing agreements  consulting and employment agreements  lease agreements and long term debt instruments 
these contractual obligations were comprised of the following as of december  payments due by period in through through after in thousands total long term debt operating leases other long term obligations other long term obligations are comprised primarily of employment agreements and license agreements 
the license agreements generally provide for payment by us of annual license fees  milestone payments and royalties upon successful commercialization of products 
all license agreements are cancelable by us 
the above table reflects remaining license fees for the lives of the agreements but excludes milestone and royalty payments  as such amounts are not probable or estimable at this time 
liquidity at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling million and working capital of million compared to cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling million and working capital of million at december  based on our current operating plans and our known and anticipated contractual obligations and assuming no further funding or potential revenues that may be generated from product partnering or licensing initiatives we are currently pursuing  we believe that our currently available funds will be adequate to satisfy our capital and operating requirements into however  there can be no assurance that changes in our research and development plans or other future events affecting our operating expenses will not result in the depletion of our funds at an earlier time 
we will require substantial additional funding for our research and development programs  for operating expenses  for the pursuit of regulatory approvals and for establishing manufacturing  marketing and sales capabilities 
adequate funds for these purposes  whether obtained through financial markets or other arrangements with collaborative partners  or from other sources  may not be available when needed or on terms acceptable to us 

table of contents recently issued accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of arb no 
fin  which addresses consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin expanded the criteria for consideration in determining whether a variable interest entity should be consolidated by a business entity  and requires existing unconsolidated variable interest entities which include  but are not limited to  special purpose entities  or spes to be consolidated by their primary beneficiaries if the entities do not effectively disperse risks among parties involved 
this interpretation applied immediately to variable interest entities created after january  the adoption of this portion of fin has not had any effect on our financial position or results of operations 
this interpretation applies in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after december   to variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that was acquired before february  we have no investments or arrangements which would be considered variable interest  and believe that the adoption of fin will not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we invest our available funds in accordance with our investment policy to preserve principal  maintain proper liquidity to meet operating needs and maximize yields 
our investment policy specifies credit quality standards for our investments and limits the amount of credit exposure to any single issue  issuer or type of investment 
we invest cash balances in excess of operating requirements first in short term  highly liquid securities  with original maturities of days or less  and money market accounts 
depending on our level of available funds and our expected cash requirements  we may invest a portion of our funds in marketable securities  consisting generally of corporate debt and us government securities with maturities of three years or less  but not longer than the availability of our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities to fund projected needs for such funds 
these securities are classified as available for sale 
available for sale securities are recorded on the balance sheet at fair market value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of stockholders equity accumulated other comprehensive loss 
gains and losses on marketable security transactions are reported on the specific identification method 
interest income is recognized when earned 
a decline in the market value of any available for sale security below cost that is deemed other than temporary results in a charge to earnings and establishes a new cost basis for the security 
our investments are sensitive to interest rate risk 
we believe  however  that the effect  if any  of reasonable possible near term changes in interest rates on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows generally would not be material due to the short term nature of these investments 
in particular  at december   because our available funds are invested solely in cash equivalents and short term marketable securities with maturities less than months  our risk of loss due to changes in interest rates is not material 
we have an executive compensation plan which provides participants  in lieu of a cash bonus  an option to purchase certain designated mutual funds at a discount 
these deferred compensation arrangements are accounted for as derivatives under sfas no 
the fair value of the derivatives is reflected as a liability on our balance sheet 
as of december   in the event of a hypothetical increase decrease in the fair market value of the underlying mutual funds  we would incur approximately  of additional less compensation expense 
at december   we have a bank term note which bears interest at prime or libor 
this note is sensitive to changes in interest rates 
in the event of a hypothetical increase in the prime rate basis points  we would incur approximately  of additional interest expense in
