active components distributed by the company include semiconductor products such as memory chips  microprocessors  digital and linear circuits  microwave  rf and fiber optic components  transistors and diodes 
passive components distributed by nic  principally to oems and other distributors nationally  consist of a high technology line of chip and leaded components  including capacitors  resistors and related networks 
as of august  the company sold the assets of nu visions manufacturing inc nu visions  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  which was a contract assembler of circuit boards and related electromechanical devices for various oem s 
the electronics and the electronics distribution industries suffered one of the most severe downturns in the industries history beginning in and continuing through most of this downturn was marked by an oversupply of components  excess manufacturing capacity and a significant decline in the demand for electronic components 
the second half of calendar appears to have been the break out period the industry has long been expecting 
this was evidenced by industry wide double digit sequential and year over year increases in sales dollar volume  albeit accompanied by continued downward margin pressures 
management believes that this improvement in the components market worldwide should continue 
the company s strategy of maintaining its infrastructure and investing during the electronic industry s severe downturn is now beginning to see positive results 
sales in asia increased almost from fiscal to and the company s book to bill ratio  company wide  remains positive 
year over year and quarter over quarter the company has increased market share with all of its major suppliers for both the semiconductor and passive component businesses 
for the fiscal year ended february   net sales from continuing operations increased to million from million in the comparable period last year 
net loss for fiscal was  or per share  compared with a net loss of million  or 
per share in the year earlier period 
the company has now reported four sequential quarters of sales growth  with the fiscal fourth quarter experiencing a sequential increase in sales over the fiscal year s third quarter 
the company believes that the industry is in full recovery mode and that nu horizons should continue to participate in the benefits of this increased demand 
for an understanding of the significant factors that influenced the company s performance during the past three years  the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and other information appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued critical accounting policies and estimates the company s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make significant estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  income taxes and contingencies and litigation  on an ongoing basis 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  involve the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements the company recognizes revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab 
under sab  revenue is recognized when the title and risk of loss have passed to the customer  there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the sales price is determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
the company recognizes revenues at time of shipment of its products and sales are recorded net of discounts and returns 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated bad debts 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their inability to make payments  additional allowances might be required 
inventories are recorded at the lower of cost or market 
write downs of inventories to market value are based upon product franchise agreements governing price protection  stock rotation and obsolescence  as well as assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if assumptions about future demand or actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional write downs of inventories could be required 
fiscal year versus results of continuing operations net sales for the year ended february  aggregated  as compared to  for the year ended february   an increase of approximately  or 
this increase was comprised of a decline in sales of approximately  in the first six months of the fiscal year as compared to the first six months of the prior fiscal year 
this was followed by an increase in sales of approximately  in the second half of fiscal as compared to the last six months of fiscal given the historically cyclical nature of the company s industry  management attributes this increase in sales performance in the latter part of fiscal as the break out period the electronic component industry has long been expecting 
this was evidenced by the industry wide double digit sequential increases in sales dollar volume in the latter six months of calendar management believes this improvement in the components market worldwide should continue through fiscal  although no assurances can be given in this regard 
gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales was for the year ended february  as compared to for the year ended february  management believes that this continuing gross margin pressure results from a change in the company s product mix which was impacted by larger orders in the computer and liquid crystal categories domestically  coupled with increased sales in the asian market which requires lower selling prices due to volume demand from asian contract manufacturer 
management believes that margin pressures during the first quarter of fiscal have stabilized and should not continue to decline  however  no assurances can be given in this regard 
operating expenses increased to  for the year ended february  from  for the year ended february   an increase of approximately  or 
the dollar increase in operating expenses was entirely due to personnel related costs commissions  salaries  travel and fringe benefits resulting from increased staffing levels in connection with the expansion of the company s asian and us operational capability during the current fiscal year 
management made a strategic decision to invest in expanding page 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued fiscal year versus continued results of continuing operations continued the company s personnel during the recent market downturn  which resulted in increased operating expenses 
management believes that this investment will enable the company to take advantage of the current and future rebound the industry is currently experiencing  although no assurances can be given in this regard 
interest expense increased to  for the year ended february  as compared to  for the year ended february  this increase was primarily due to a return to bank borrowings in the fourth quarter of fiscal due to the increase in the company s inventory and accounts receivable levels which were needed to support increased sales activity in the latter half of the fiscal period 
net loss from continuing operations for the year ended february  was  or 
per share  as compared to a loss of  or 
per share for the year ended february  management attributes the fiscal loss of  to the increase in operating and interest expense exceeding the moderate increase in gross margin dollars 
fiscal year versus results of continuing operations net sales for the year ended february  aggregated  as compared to  for the year ended february   an increase of  or approximately 
management attributes this increase in sales for the period to the core semiconductor and passive component distribution business  which had recently experienced a moderate increase in demand 
gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales was for the year ended february  as compared to for the year ended february  this continuing decrease in gross margin percentage reflects decreasing prices due to increased competitive pressures resulting from the industry wide decline in demand coupled with an oversupply of product in the marketplace 
the aforementioned reduction in margin percentage resulted in a  decrease in total gross margin dollars in fiscal in spite of the or  increase in sales 
operating expenses decreased by  to  for the year ended february  from  for the year ended february   a decrease of approximately 
the dollar decrease in operating expenses was due to an approximately  decrease in personnel related costs commissions  salaries  travel and fringe benefits  partially offset by an increase of approximately  in various other general and administrative expenses 
operating expenses as a percentage of sales decreased to of sales as compared to for the prior year 
interest expense decreased by  from  for the year ended february  to  for the year ended february  this decrease was primarily due to bank borrowings being reduced to zero resulting from the decrease in the company s inventory and accounts receivable levels which had been needed to support sales activity in the fiscal and periods  net of the commitment fees required to maintain the company s revolving line of credit facility 
net loss from continuing operations for the year ended february  was  or 
per share  as compared to a loss of  or 
per share for the year ended february  management attributes the fiscal loss of  to a continued reduction of gross margin dollars exceeding the reduction in operating and interest expense 
the  loss for fiscal is due to reduced sales volume in excess of reductions in operating expenses  resulting in a loss of  and a one time charge for the impairment of the value of goodwill  which had previously been amortized over a fifteen year period  resulting in an additional  loss

the company has contacted its banks to discuss entering into a new loan agreement to address the company s need to increase its available revolving credit line to approximately  and to revise certain financial covenants contained in the current loan agreement 
the company is currently in full compliance with all of the covenants contained in its current agreement 
however  the company believes that  due to increased borrowing requirements resulting from projected substantial overall increases in sales in the electronic components market  the company will need additional availability under its credit line 
in addition  the company believes that commencing november  it is likely to have insufficient twelve month trailing earnings to insure compliance with the covenant related to earnings before interest and depreciation 
several banks have advised the company that they are willing to enter into a new loan agreement that would enable the company to remain in compliance with all covenants  as revised  as well as provide a sufficient increase in the available borrowing limits for the foreseeable future 
there can be no assurances that the company and its lenders will actually enter into such an agreement 
the company anticipates that its resources provided by its cash flow from operations  without entering into the aforementioned new loan agreement  will be insufficient to meet its financing requirements for the next twelve month period 
off balance sheet arrangements as of february   the company had no off balance sheet arrangements to report

forward looking statement disclaimer except for historical information contained herein  the matters set forth above may be forward looking statements 
such forward looking statements are based on the current beliefs of the company s management 
certain risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ from those in the forward looking statements 
potential risks and uncertainties include such factors as those described under risk factors below 
the company does not undertake any obligation to update its forward looking statements 
risk factors the company may not have adequate liquidity or capital resources to finance its operations for the next twelve months 
the company expects that it will require cash beyond the amount currently available under its existing credit agreement and its cash flow from operations in order to enable it to purchase inventory for the projected substantial overall sales increase in the electronics components market 
the company is engaged in discussions with its banks to discuss the entry into a new loan agreement with a revolving credit line of approximately million  however  there is no assurance that the company and its lenders will enter into a revised loan agreement and  if the company fails to do so  it may not have sufficient cash flow from operations to meet its financing requirements for the next twelve months 
a large portion of the company s revenues come from sales of semiconductors  which is a highly cyclical industry  and an industry down cycle could significantly affect the company s operating results 
the semiconductor industry historically has experienced periodic fluctuations in product supply and demand  often associated with changes in technology and manufacturing capacity  and is generally considered to be highly cyclical 
according to the semiconductor industry association  the semiconductor industry experienced its worst annual downturn in history with revenue from worldwide semiconductor sales estimated to have fallen by approximately from calendar to the company s revenues closely follow the strength or weakness of the semiconductor market 
the company s total sales of semiconductors in fiscal years   and were    and  respectively 
although the company s results have recently shown signs of an industry upturn  a technology industry downcycle  particularly in the semiconductor sector  could negatively affect the company s operating results in the future 
page 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the company s revenues and profitability have declined significantly from historical highs and  although revenues have started to increase in recent quarters  the company may be unable to achieve consistent profitability at levels experienced in the past 
the company s operations have been significantly and negatively affected by the recent downturn in the technology industry and the general economy 
from a high of approximately million in sales in the fiscal quarter ended november  the company s sales stabilized in the to million range per quarter for eight quarters 
in the two most recent quarters  the company s revenues have begun to show signs of growth and an industry up cycle  with  of revenues in the quarter ended february  despite this recent growth  the company has not yet been able to achieve consistent profitability at a level deemed acceptable to management 
as a result  the company has continued to implement substantial cost cutting measures designed to align its expenses to provide profitability at current revenue levels 
the success of these cost cutting measures  as well as the timing of any economic recovery  will affect the company s ability to achieve consistent profitability at reasonable levels 
although the company does not anticipate any further restructuring charges in the near term  if the company is not able to maintain an acceptable level of profitability  the company may need to consider expense reductions 
if the company were unable to maintain its relationships with key suppliers  it could adversely affect the company s sales 
in fiscal  sales of products and services from three suppliers exceeded of the company s inventory on a consolidated basis 
as a result  to the extent that those suppliers are not willing to do business with the company in the future on terms acceptable to the company  the loss of these suppliers could materially adversely affect the company s business  results of operations  financial condition or liquidity 
if any of these industry leading suppliers was unwilling to do business with the company  the company s relationships with its customers could be materially adversely affected because the company s customers depend on the company s distribution of electronic components and computer products from the industry s leading suppliers 
declines in the value of the company s inventory could materially adversely affect the company s business  results of operations  financial condition or liquidity 
the electronic components and computer products industry is subject to rapid technological change  new and enhanced products and evolving industry standards  which can contribute to decline in value or obsolescence of inventory 
during an economic downturn it is possible that prices will decline due to an oversupply of product and  therefore  there may be greater risk of declines in inventory value 
although it is the policy of many of the company s suppliers to offer distributors like the company certain protections from the loss in value of inventory such as price protection  limited rights of return and rebates  the company cannot assure you that such return policies and rebates will fully compensate it for the loss in value  or that the vendors will choose to  or be able to  honor such agreements 
the company cannot assure you that unforeseen new product developments or declines in the value of its inventory will not materially adversely affect its business  results of operations  financial condition or liquidity  or that the company will successfully manage its existing and future inventories 
substantial defaults by the company s customers on the company s accounts receivable could have a significant negative impact on the company s business  results of operations  financial condition or liquidity 
a significant portion of the company s working capital consists of accounts receivable from customers 
if customers responsible for a significant amount of accounts receivable were to become insolvent or otherwise unable to pay for products and services  or were to become unwilling or unable to make payments in a timely manner  the company s business  results of operations  financial condition or liquidity could be adversely affected 
if the economic and industry downturn were to continue  it could have an adverse affect on the servicing of these accounts receivable  which could result in longer payment cycles  increased collection costs and defaults in excess of management s expectations 
page 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the electronics component and computer industries are highly competitive and if the company cannot effectively compete  its revenues may decline 
the market for the company s products and services is very competitive and subject to rapid technological advances 
not only does the company compete with other distributors  it also competes for customers with some of its own suppliers 
the company s failure to maintain and enhance its competitive position could adversely affect its business and prospects 
the sizes of the company s competitors vary across market sectors  as do the resources the company has allocated to the sectors in which it does business 
therefore  some of the competitors may have greater financial  personnel  capacity and other resources than the company has in one or more of its market sectors 
as a result  the company s competitors may be in a stronger position to respond quickly to potential acquisitions and other market opportunities  new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements 
the company s non us locations represent a significant and growing portion of its revenue  and consequently  the company is increasingly exposed to risks associated with operating internationally 
in fiscal  approximately of the company s sales came from its operations outside the united states 
during fiscal and approximately and of sales  respectively  were from locations outside the united states 
most notable in this growth of non us sales is the increasing volume of sales activity in the asia region  which accounted for approximately of consolidated sales in fiscal as a result of the company s foreign sales and locations  its operations are subject to a variety of risks that are specific to international operations  including the following potential restrictions on transfers of funds  foreign currency fluctuations  import and export duties and value added taxes  import and export regulation changes that could erode profit margins or restrict exports  changing foreign tax laws and regulations  potential military conflicts  inflexible employee contracts in the event of business downturns  and the burden and cost of compliance with foreign laws 
manufacturing of electronic component and computer products is increasingly shifting to lower cost production facilities in asia  and most notably the people s republic of china 
the company s business and prospects could be materially adversely affected if this shift continues and the company is unable to develop distribution relationships with these or other manufacturers on acceptable terms 
in particular  if the company is unable to develop relationships with manufacturers that provide profit margins comparable to the margins maintained under existing relationships  the company s operating results may be negatively affected 
in addition  the company has operations in several locations in emerging or developing economies that have a potential for higher risk 
the risks associated with these economies include currency volatility and other economic or political risks 
while the company has and will continue to adopt measures to reduce the impact of losses resulting from volatile currencies and other risks of doing business abroad  the company cannot ensure that such measures will be adequate 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s credit facility bears interest based on interest rates tied to the prime or libor rate  either of which may fluctuate over time based on economic conditions 
as a result  the company is subject to market risk for changes in interest rates and could be subjected to increased or decreased interest payments if market rates fluctuate and the company has borrowings outstanding under its line of credit 
the company has several foreign subsidiaries and acquires certain inventory from foreign suppliers and as such  faces risk due to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates  primarily the singapore dollar and the british pound 
these risks could have a material impact on the company s financial results in future periods 
the electronic component industry is cyclical which can cause significant fluctuations in sales  gross margins and profits  from year to year 
for example  during calendar  the industry experienced a severe decline in the demand for electronic components  which caused sales to decrease by 
the prior year reflected a increase in net sales 
it is difficult to predict the timing of the changing cycles in the electronic component industry
