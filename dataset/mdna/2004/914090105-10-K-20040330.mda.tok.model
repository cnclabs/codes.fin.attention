item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the purpose of the following discussion and analysis is to assist the reader in understanding and evaluating the changes in financial position and results of operations over the past several years 
investors should refer to the consolidated financial statements  the related notes thereto  and statistical information presented elsewhere in this report when reading this section of the report 
the cautionary statements described below are for the purpose of qualifying for the safe harbor provisions of section e of the securities exchange act of critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the related disclosures 
on an on going basis  we evaluate these estimates  including those related to the allowance for loan losses  servicing rights  other real estate owned and deferred tax assets 
estimates are based on historical experience  information received from third parties and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is determined based on management estimates of the amount required for losses inherent in the portfolio 
these estimates are based on past loan loss experience  known and inherent risks in the portfolio  information about specific borrower situations and estimated collateral values  economic conditions  and other factors 
allocations of the allowance may be made for specific loans  but the entire allowance is available for any loan that  in managements judgment  should be charged off 
servicing rights servicing rights are evaluated quarterly for possible impairment is evaluated based on the fair value of the rights  using independent appraisals and grouping of the underlying loans as to type  term and interest rates 
assumptions as to prepayment speeds and retention rates may change and thereby impact the valuation 
any impairment of a grouping is reported as a valuation allowance 
other real estate owned real estate properties acquired in collection of a loan are recorded at fair value upon acquisition based on appraisals 
any reduction to fair value from the carrying value of the related loan at the time of foreclosure is accounted for as a loan loss 
subsequent reductions in the value of the real estate owned are charged to earnings when known 
changes in real estate value in the future may impact the carrying value 
deferred tax assets deferred tax assets are recorded based on estimates of future taxable income and utilization of existing net operating loss carryforwards 
a valuation allowance adjusts deferred tax assets to the net amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
actual results will impact the estimates of these deferred tax assets 
risk factors our business involves a high degree of risk 
you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below and the other information in this report before deciding whether to invest in shares of our common stock 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
this could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline  with the loss of all or part of an investment in our common stock 
described below  are the material risks of investing in university bancorps common stock 
investors should carefully consider these prior to purchasing any shares 
university bank has incurred significant losses and may never achieve sustained profitability university bank s operations were relocated to ann arbor in university bank has a history of losses and prior to incurred substantial operating losses 
the banks future profitability is not assured 
management of the bank believes that as the size of loan portfolio and retail deposits increase that the bank should become more profitable  but there is no assurance that expenses will not rise at a faster rate than expected as the bank grows 
there is no assurance that university bank will grow to a size that will enable it to sustain profitability 
university bancorp had an accumulated deficit from operations of  at december  the companys stock is controlled by insiders of the company  which may not provide you with the best possible return on your investment insiders hold a majority of the shares outstanding of the company 
the ranzini group mr 
stephen lange ranzini  dr 
joseph lange ranzini  mr 
paul lange ranzini  orpheus capital  lp and the ranzini family trust dated beneficially owns  or of the issued and outstanding shares at march  these individuals are able to exert a significant measure of control over university bancorps affairs and policies 
this control could be used  for example  to help prevent an acquisition of university bancorp  precluding shareholders from possibly realizing any possible premium that may be offered for the common stock by a potential acquirer 
your ownership of the company may be further diluted if the bank requires additional capital there can be no assurance that the bank will not need additional capital in the future to support the bank s growth or to counter operating losses 
funds necessary to meet the banks working capital needs and to finance its expansion might not be available 
if additional equity securities are needed to finance future expansion  such sale could result in significant dilution to the existing shareholders 
the small size of university bank limits its ability to compete with larger financial institutions university bank faces strong competition for deposits  loans and other financial services from numerous michigan and out of state banks  thrifts  credit unions and other financial institutions 
some of the financial institutions with which university bank competes with are not subject to the same degree of regulation as university bank is 
many of these financial institutions aggressively compete for business in the ann arbor area 
most of the banks competitors have been in business for many years  have established customer bases  have numerous branches  have substantially higher lending limits  and offer certain services that we do not provide 
the dominant competitors in the ann arbor area are tcf national bank  national city bank  comerica bank  bank one and key bank 
there can be no assurance that university bank will be able to compete effectively with these competitors unless it can continue to grow its operations 
the year ended december  compared to the years ended december  and summary of results of operations the companys net income was  versus  in and a net loss of  in basic and diluted earnings loss per share from continuing operations for  and were  and  respectively 
the net income in includes an income tax benefit of  this benefit represents a portion of the net operating loss carry forward benefit that management reasonably expects to utilize in against future taxable income 
overall  the company has a net deferred tax asset of  however a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of  has been established  leaving a net deferred tax asset of  community banking incurred a pre tax loss of  during the current year as opposed to pre tax income of  from the year before 
a drop in the net interest margin and an increase in the provision for loan losses accounted for the most of this variance 
in contrast  pre tax income at midwest loan services increased to  in from a  last year 
income at midwest loan services increased with rapidly increasing mortgage originations and an increase in mortgage loans sub serviced 
the operations of the company showed significant progress in as compared to as a result of an aggressive cost cutting program at the bank as well as efforts to increase income 
net income increased over the results 
fourth quarter net income established a new record of  or per share compared to a loss of  or per share for the comparable quarter in return on average shareholders equity was for the year ended december  compared to a negative for the year ended december  return on average assets for the same comparable years were and  respectively

during and short term interest rates remained at year lows while long term interest rates showed a decline 
net interest income for declined from the previous period because the average yield on earning assets declined at a higher rate than the average yield on interest bearing deposits 
the yield on average earning assets dropped from in to in the cost of interest bearing liabilities decreased from for the period to for the year ended december  the net yield on interest earning assets decreased from to 
management is actively addressing the decline in the net yield and is implementing action to mitigate and reverse the trend by attracting lower cost deposits 
during the fourth quarter of  net interest income was  slightly higher than any quarter during the year and higher than the fourth quarter net interest income of  this positive trend has continued into the first quarter of for  net interest income improved year over year  rising to million for the year ended december  compared to million the prior year

while community banking experienced a decline in interest on loans during the record low interest rate environment of the past year  it enjoyed a increase in interest on securities and a savings in interest expense

the average yield on interest rate liabilities declined to in from in the average yield on interest bearing assets decreased to from in the spread between the average yield on rate sensitive assets and liabilities rose from in to in additionally  the net interest income was positively affected in by higher volume of earning assets

provision for loan losses the bank charges to operations a provision for loan losses which is intended to create an allowance for future loan losses inherent in the bank s portfolio 
each year s provision reflects management s analysis of the amount necessary to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level adequate to absorb anticipated losses 
in its evaluation  management considers factors like historical loan loss experience  specifically identified problem loans  composition and growth of the loan portfolio  current and projected economic conditions  and other pertinent factors 
a loan is charged off by management as a loss when deemed uncollectible  although collection efforts continue and future recoveries may occur 
non performing loans are defined as loans which have been placed on non accrual status and loans over days past due as to principal or interest and still in an accrual status 
where serious doubt exists as to the collectibility of a loan  the accrual of interest is discontinued 
see note of the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding impaired and past due loans 
non performing loans amounted to  and  at december  and  respectively 
the provision for loan losses in was  compared to  in and  in the provision in was increased over prior years to due to an increase in non accrual loans 
loans charged off  net of recoveries  were   and  in  and  respectively 
the decrease in net loans charged off from to resulted primarily to two loans charged off in late that relate to long standing problem loan relationships that were specifically reserved  but not charged off  in prior year periods 
the allowance for possible loan losses totaled   and  at the end of  and  respectively 
the following table summarizes the loan loss expense for the bank for the years ended december   and analysis of the allowance for loan losses amounts in thousands balance at beginning of the period charge offs domestic commercial loans real estate mortgages installment loans subtotal recoveries domestic commercial loans real estate mortgages installment loans subtotal net charge offs provision for loan losses balance at end of period ratio of net charge offs during period to average loans outstanding during period analysis of the allowance for loan losses amounts in thousands allocated portion of percentage of loans in each category to allowance at december total loans loan category domestic commercial loans real estate mortgages installment loans unallocated n a n a at at december  december  total loans   reserve for loan losses   reserve loans excludes loans held for sale 
the bank s overall loan portfolio is geographically concentrated in ann arbor and the future performance of these loans is dependent upon the performance of relatively limited geographical areas 
as a result of the ongoing business depression  the banks future loss ratios may exceed historical loss ratios 
management believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate to absorb losses inherent in the loan portfolio  although the ultimate adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is dependent upon future economic factors beyond our control 
a downturn in the general nationwide economy will tend to aggravate  for example  the problems of local loan customers currently facing some difficulties 
a general nationwide business expansion could result in fewer loan customers being unable to repay their loans 
non interest income and non interest expense non interest income 
non interest income was million in compared to million in income generated in this category is principally from midwest loan services 
during  the mortgage re financing market was stimulated by record low long term interest rates 
midwest and the bank significantly increased income from loan origination  loan sub servicing fee income  and gain on the sale of mortgage loans originated for sale into the secondary market

mortgage banking  servicing and origination fees  and gain on the sale of loans increased to  in from  in in  midwest originated mortgage loans  an increase of over last year 
during the year  midwest increased its credit union partners so that at year end it had credit union partners with a total of  active members   potential members and aggregate assets of billion 
mortgage banking  servicing and origination fees increased to  in from  in during the year  midwest grew its mortgages sub serviced by from  to  and to over billion of mortgages sub serviced 
in  midwest originated  mortgage loans  an increase of 
growth was consistent in each month throughout the year 
in the fourth quarter of  a new record of mortgages was originated by midwest 
securities 
proceeds from sales of marketable equity securities included in proceeds from sales of investment securities was  for the year ended december  gross losses of  were realized in this period 
proceeds from sales of available for sale debt securities were   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively  excluding sales associated with the bank s mortgage banking operation 
there were gross gains of   and  on  and sales  respectively and a gross loss of  on sales 
at december  gross unrealized losses in our available for sale securities were  and gross unrealized gains were at december  gross unrealized losses in our available for sale securities were  and gross unrealized gains were non interest expense 
non interest expenses increased by million in or to million from million in all but  of the increase was due to increased non interest expenses at midwest  as midwests origination and sub servicing activity increased 
as the volume expanded midwest increased its workforce to perform the required tasks 
other servicing and sub servicing related expenses  such as occupancy  supplies and postage increased also 
non interest expense was also impacted by an increase in the amortization of the mortgage servicing rights due to the low long term interest rate environment 
personnel expenses at community banking were higher due to higher commissions paid to mortgage and deposit origination personnel 
subsequent to year end  community banking made several changes in its non interest expenses which are targeted to reduce expenses in by approximately  non interest expenses increased to million in from million in non interest expenses during the fourth quarter increased as midwests mortgage origination function expanded 
during the th quarter midwest reached a new level of mortgages originated and succeeded in retaining over of all refinanced mortgages in its servicing rights portfolio that paid off 
non interest expense for the quarter ended december  was million compared to million for the fourth quarter in the prior year 
year end employee performance bonuses increased the fourth quarter non operating expenses as well 
the increase was primarily the result of increased operational expenses at midwest loan services  and an increase in state small business tax and the start up of the business manager product at community banking  which more than offset cost control efforts in other areas at community banking 
during the year community bankings non interest expenses increased by  or to  from  and all of the increase was caused by the two categories mentioned above 
midwests operations were expanded in due to a substantial increase in mortgage sub servicing and origination activity 
non interest expense was also impacted by an increase in the amortization of the mortgage servicing rights due to the low interest rate environment after september liquidity and capital resources liquidity 
our total assets at december  amounted to million compared to million at december  loans receivable  net of reserves and including loans held for sale  increased to million from million

at year end  the bank had an unused line of credit from the federal home loan bank of indianapolis of million  and an unused line of credit from the federal reserve bank of chicago of million 
university bank  as an fdic insured bank  is subject to certain regulations that require the maintenance of minimum liquidity levels of cash and eligible investments 
the bank has historically exceeded this minimum as a result of its investments in federal funds sold  us government and us agency securities and cash 
in addition  university bancorp had  in cash and equity securities at the end of to meet cash needs  primarily operating expenses and interest and principal reductions on the university bancorp s note payable 
the balance of the loan was  and  at year end and the note is a fully amortizing loan maturing in early subsequent to year end  university bancorp received  in cash from the exercise of stock options

fin requires a guarantor to recognize  at the commencement of a guarantee  a liability in the amount equal to the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee  and requires disclosure about the maximum potential payments that might be required  as well as the collateral or other recourse obtainable 
the recognition and measurement provisions of fin were effective on a prospective basis after december   and its adoption by the company on january  has not had a material impact on the companys consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no

however  in december  the fasb issued interpretation no 
r fin r  which amends fin and is intended to clarify some of the provisions of fin and to exempt certain entities from its requirements 
fin r requires the deconsolidation of trust preferred security subsidiaries 
fin r grants the companies the option to adopt its provisions as of the end of the first period ending after december  or elect to defer until the first period ending after march  as of december   the company has decided to defer the application of fin r until march  management believes the adoption of fin r in the first quarter of will not have a material impact on the financial statements

sfas requires that those instruments be classified as liabilities or assets in some circumstances 
the adoption of this rule had no impact on the companys results of operations or financial condition 
item a 
market risk impact of inflation the primary impact of inflation on our operations is reflected in increased operating costs 
since our assets and liabilities are primarily monetary in nature  changes in interest rates have a more significant impact on our performance than the general effects of inflation 
however  to the extent that inflation affects interest rates  it also affects our net income 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk all financial institutions are significantly affected by fluctuations in interest rates commonly referred to as interest rate risk 
the principal exposure of a financial institution s earnings to interest rate risk is the difference in time between interest rate adjustments or maturities on interest earning assets compared to the time between interest rate adjustments or maturities on interest bearing liabilities 
this difference is commonly referred to as a financial institution s gap position 
in periods when interest rates are increasing  a negative gap position will result in generally lower earnings as long term assets are repricing upward slower than short term liabilities 
however during a declining rate environment  the opposite effect on earnings is true  with earnings rising due to long term assets repricing downward slower than short term liabilities 
rising long term and short term interest rates tend to increase the value of midwest loan services investment in mortgage servicing rights and improve midwest loan services current return on these rights by lowering required amortization rates on the rights and decreasing the opportunity for customers to refinance those loans 
rising interest rates tend to decrease new mortgage origination activity  negatively impacting current income from the bank s retail mortgage banking operations and midwests mortgage banking operations 
rising interest rates also slow midwest loan services rate of growth  but increases the duration of its existing mortgages being sub serviced under contract 
the bank s securities portfolio is designed to offset a portion of the market value risk associated with the servicing rights 
during period of declining interest rates  the estimated duration period for the banks fnma cmo tends to shorten  thus accelerating the income from the accretion of the bonds discount 
this income mitigates the rapid amortization of the servicing rights 
in a rising rate environment  the accretion of income on the bond tends to lessen 
the table on the following page details our interest sensitivity gap between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at december  certain items in the table are based upon various assumptions that may not necessarily reflect future experience  and therefore  certain assets and liabilities may in fact mature or re price differently from what is illustrated
