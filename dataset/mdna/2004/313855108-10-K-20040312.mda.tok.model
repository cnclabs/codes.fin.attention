results of operations orders increased in to billion as the benefit of the refuse truck body businesses acquired in late and foreign currency translation effects on non us sales more than offset order declines in other businesses 
excluding the newly acquired refuse businesses  orders declined in  reflecting weak municipal and industrial markets present throughout the year 
sales increased to billion in largely as a result of the refuse truck body business acquisitions and increased fire rescue deliveries 
the sales increase included from acquisitions  from foreign currency translation effects  from price increases and from volume 
despite the significant increase in sales  income from continuing operations declined in cyclically weak us municipal and industrial markets adversely affected sales of high margin products in the safety products and tool groups and depressed earnings in the refuse truck body businesses 
in addition  production facility shutdown charges and higher pension and health care costs adversely affected results 
partially offsetting were lower interest expense and income taxes 
as a result  diluted earnings per share from continuing operations declined to 
in compared to in in  diluted income per share from continuing operations totaled on sales of billion 
this compares to earnings per share of in on sales of billion 
sales declined in the fire rescue and tool groups  the environmental products and safety products groups both saw increases 
the overall sales decline reflected essentially flat selling prices in on continued weak industrial market conditions  the refuse body acquisitions in the fourth quarter of increased sales approximately 
sales to customers in the united states declined in and sales to non us customers increased net of currency effects 
orders increased in to billion due to the addition of the refuse truck body orders in the fourth quarter and strength in safety products markets  particularly the million initial installment on the dallas fort worth international airport parking revenue control system award received in the third quarter 
net income in included a 
million after tax charge  or 
per diluted share  relating to the loss on sale of the discontinued sign group operations completed in the second quarter 
net income in included an million after tax charge relating to the cumulative effect of a change in accounting for goodwill required by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no

the following table summarizes the company s results of operations for the three year period ended december  in millions amount percent amount percent amount percent net sales    cost of sales gross profit operating expenses operating income interest expense and other income taxes income from continuing operations discontinued operations and change in accounting principle net income operating income decreased to million in from million in this percentage point decline in operating margin from in to in reflects continued weakness in us municipal and industrial markets  costs incurred to shut down production facilities in the uk and new york and increased employee pension and health care costs partly offset by material costs savings from new supplier alliances 
the effects of weak markets were particularly evident in the results of the environmental products  safety products and tool groups  fire rescue enjoyed sales and earnings increases  resulting in part from high backlogs at the beginning of in  operating income declined from million in resulting in a 
percentage point decrease in operating margin from in the margin decline was essentially due to a very slow industrial economy that reduced sales of the company s higher margin industrial products  reduced throughput and higher production costs that adversely affected fire rescue group profitability and flat pricing 
interest expense declined to million in from million in this was as a result of slightly lower debt levels  favorable interest rate swap agreements and amortization of deferred gains on previously terminated interest rate swaps  these factors were partially offset by higher borrowing costs as standard and poor s reduced their short term debt rating of the company to a the company replaced commercial paper borrowings with higher cost committed bank lines 
the impact on s operations as a result of the debt rating reduction totaled approximately million 
in  interest expense declined million  or  from largely as a result of a much lower short term interest rate environment in the lower interest rates were partially offset by increased borrowings in the fourth quarter of related to the acquisitions of the refuse truck body businesses 
weighted average interest rates on short term borrowings were in  in and in the company s effective tax rate of in was significantly below the rate in and the rate in the lower tax rate in reflects the effect of a one time benefit associated with the closure of a production facility in the uk and the higher relative impact of tax credits and tax exempt municipal income 
the reduction in the effective tax rate in from reflects the increased mix of tax exempt revenues earned by the company s environmental products and fire rescue groups  lower tax rates of the company s foreign operations  eliminating the amortization of non deductible goodwill for financial reporting purposes due to the adoption of sfas no 
and reduction in reserve needs for now closed tax issues 
the company changed its assumptions for discount rates used in determining the actuarial present values of accumulated and projected benefit obligations for its postretirement plans 
the company reduced the discount rate to as of december  from and as of december  and  respectively  for its us plans because of lower prevailing interest rates 
the changes in the assumptions resulted in additional pension expense of million in and an additional increase of million in in january  the company also established its other significant cost assumptions for its us pension plans as follows expected long term rate of return on plan assets  rate of increase in compensation levels 
the company expects that the change in these assumptions will further increase pension costs by approximately million  or 
per share  compared to in  the company incurred approximately 
million in nonrecurring pension costs as a result of the company s fourth quarter restructuring 
the company also recorded an after tax charge of 
million in and million in to other comprehensive income representing the effect of an additional minimum pension liability 
like many companies  the company s pension plan performance was adversely affected by low asset returns and lower interest rates 
certain of the company s businesses are susceptible to the influences of seasonal buying or delivery patterns 
the company s businesses which tend to have lower sales in the first calendar quarter compared to other quarters as a result of these influences are street sweeping  fire rescue products  outdoor warning  municipal emergency signal products and parking systems 
environmental products operations the following chart presents the environmental products group s results of operations for the three year period ending december  in millions line graph orders increased in due to the full year effect of the refuse truck body acquisitions 
excluding the effects of the acquisitions  orders declined reflecting weak us municipal demand 
orders increased in due mainly to the refuse acquisitions 
global sweeper orders declined in  as increased international business was more than offset by a reduction in us orders in light of deteriorating municipal government budgets 
net sales increased to million in from million in due to the full year effect of the refuse body truck acquisitions  net sales of non refuse operations declined reflecting weak us municipal demand and a reduction in finance revenues reflecting the runoff of the industrial leasing portfolio following the company s decision in to curtail this lending activity 
net sales increased in from million in largely as a result of the refuse truck body acquisitions in late operating income declined to million in from million in resulting in a corresponding decrease in operating margin to from 
this decline is in large part due to the low profitability of the refuse businesses  the continued weakening of the us municipal markets  lower finance revenues and earnings from industrial customer financings and one time costs incurred to consolidate us sweeper production facilities and convert european sweepers to new eu standards 
in  operating income increased from million in principally due to improved operating results for sweepers  more than offsetting the effects of lower volumes and adverse product mix in other product lines in the group 
fire rescue operations the following graph presents the fire rescue group s results of operations for the three year period ended december  in millions line graph the group s orders decreased in reflecting the weaker us municipal and government markets primarily in the second and third quarters  and lower export orders which tend to be somewhat volatile 
orders increased in as strong orders at european businesses more than offset a modest decline elsewhere 
net sales increased to million in from million in high backlogs at the beginning of and improvements in productivity and delivery drove the sales increase 
the group s sales increased largely as a result of increased productivity in its us production facilities and the beneficial translation effects of stronger euro and canadian currencies 
in  net sales declined from million in as reduced throughput and deliveries in the us production facilities resulted from more complex units and prototypes 
operating income increased to million in from million in resulting in a slight operating margin improvement to 
improved productivity of the us operations more than offset higher costs incurred to improve the group s selling and manufacturing processes 
in  operating income declined from million and an operating margin of in  income and margin declined due to the lower sales levels coupled with higher production costs 
safety products operations the following chart presents the safety product group s results of operations for the three year period ended december  in millions line graph orders declined in essentially due to the group booking a million order for the dallas fort worth parking project in  excluding this project  the group s orders were flat 
orders increased in largely due to the large airport parking project and success in increasing market share for european police products 
net sales increased in to million from million in reflecting progress on the dallas fort worth international airport parking project and the strength of the euro against the us dollar offset by a weak municipal police products market and the shutdown of a production facility in the uk sales increased in from million in due to increased deliveries of outdoor warning systems and european police products 
despite the growth in sales  operating income declined from million in to million in the operating margin decrease from to reflects a pre tax charge of million for costs associated with the shutdown of a production facility in the uk  weaker sales of high margin municipal products coupled with higher sales of lower margin parking products  and higher pension and health care costs 
in  operating income increased and margins strengthened due to higher net sales  partly offset by increased pension expense 
tool operations the following graph presents the tool group s results of operations for the three year period ended december  in millions line graph net sales increased to million in from million in  the increase was principally a result of growth in the international precision tooling markets  largely attributable to the strong european currency 
partially offsetting was a weak us cutting tool market  as automotive customers continued their low capital investment despite strong production 
in  net sales declined from million in  a reflection of lower cutting tool sales  which represented about one quarter of the group s sales 
operating income declined to million in from million in the decline in operating income and a reduction in operating margin from in to in was largely due to cutting tool pricing pressures  costs and operating inefficiencies associated with the closure of a new york production facility  increased sales of third party resale products and significantly higher pension and medical costs 
in  operating income declined from million in due to lower sales volumes  cutting tool pricing pressures and the effect of lower fixed cost absorption caused by inventory reductions made possible by successful lean enterprise initiatives 
corporate expense corporate expenses totaled million in  million in and million in the increase in reflects an increased bad debt provision and higher pension expense 
the company has been sued by over  firefighters in separate cases alleging that exposure to the company s sirens impaired their hearing 
the company has successfully defended itself in over similar cases and contests the allegations 
the discovery phase of the litigation begins in  the company intends to aggressively defend the matter and expects to incur approximately million in legal fees in for further details  refer to note l in the financial statements included in item of this form k 
financial services activities the company maintains a large investment million and million at december  and  respectively in lease financing and other receivables that are generated by its environmental products and fire rescue operations 
the increase in assets resulted from fire rescue s strong deliveries and subsequent lease financing offset by the company s decision to cease lending to customers in certain commercial and industrial markets 
financial services assets have repayment terms ranging from one to ten years 
these assets are leveraged due to their overall quality  financial services debt was million and million at december  and  respectively 
financial revenues totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the decline in is primarily due to the company s decision to cease financing new industrial product sales and lower lending rates due to the declining interest rate environment 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources during the three year period ended december   the company utilized its strong cash flows from operations to fund sustaining and cost reduction capital needs of its operations  to fund in whole or in part strategic acquisitions of companies operating in markets related to those already served by the company  and to pay increasing amounts in cash dividends to shareholders 
beyond these uses  remaining cash was used to pay down debt and to repurchase shares of common stock 
the company s cash and cash equivalents totaled million  million and million as of december   and  respectively 
the following table summarizes the company s cash flows for the three year period ended december  in millions operating cash flow capital expenditures dispositions and acquisitions financial services activities  net borrowing activity  net purchases of treasury stock 
dividends other increase decrease in cash operating cash flow declined to million in from million in  in large part reflecting lower earnings  timing of customer advances  the disproportionate increase in foreign sales with longer payment terms and multi year contracts 
cash flows benefited from favorable settlements of interest rate swaps and foreign currency hedges as well as continued improvements in inventory productivity as evidenced by inventory turns rising to at december  operating cash flow decreased in from million in due to lower earnings and a discretionary million pension contribution made in view of the company s strong cash position and weak pension asset performance 
the company also experienced reductions in working capital driven by improved collections  lower inventory levels due to lean enterprise initiatives and the receipt of more advance payments from customers 
the company s operating cash flows fluctuate on a quarterly basis due to sales seasonality and associated working capital requirements 
the company completed the sale of the sign group in april for cash of million and a million note receivable 
the company acquired the refuse businesses in for million  funded with cash of million and stock valued at million plus the assumption of million of debt 
the company paid million in to acquire athey products corporation  plastisol holdings bv and two small tool group companies including the assumption of debt 
in order to show the distinct characteristics of the company s investment in its manufacturing and financial service activities  the company has presented separately these investments and their related liabilities 
different ratios of debt and equity support each of these two types of activities 
in april  standard and poor s lowered the company s debt rating from a to a making short term borrowing in the commercial paper market no longer viable 
after drawing on the million back up credit facility to pay off the commercial paper holders  the company replaced it with a new million unsecured revolving credit facility maturing in bearing interest at a variable rate of libor plus 
at december   million was outstanding under this agreement 
the company also secured million in private placement financing with increments maturing in  and bearing interest at a variable rate of libor plus 
the rating downgrade resulted in the company incurring an additional million in borrowing costs in the incremental cost was partially offset by favorable interest rate swap agreements 
the company paid down million of borrowings in during the fourth quarter of  the company issued long term debt of million at an average interest rate of with terms ranging from six to ten years 
the company issued the debt to replace million of short term debt incurred to fund the refuse business acquisitions and to replace other existing short term debt 
the company s debt facilities contain covenants relating to a maximum debt to capitalization ratio  minimum interest coverage and minimum net worth 
as of december   the company was in compliance with the financial covenants of its debt agreements 
at december   total manufacturing debt was million  representing of capitalization  down from million as of december  the manufacturing debt to capitalization ratio is subject to variations based on seasonal working capital requirements 
the company believes that its financial services assets  due to their overall quality  are capable of sustaining a leverage ratio of 
at both december  and  the company s debt to capitalization ratio for its financial services activities was for its continuing operations 
cash dividends increased by million from million in to million in due to the additional shares issued in late for the refuse acquisitions  the company paid dividends of 
per share in in october  the company announced a reduction in the quarterly dividend to improve its long term position in view of the further weakening of the us state and municipal markets and the lack of a conclusive rebound in the industrial economy 
the reduction is expected to improve the company s future financial flexibility 
management focuses substantial effort on improving the utilization of the company s working capital 
the company s primary working capital as a percent of net sales was and as of december  and  respectively 
the company anticipates that its financial resources and major sources of liquidity  including cash flow from operations and borrowing capacity  will continue to be adequate to meet its operating and capital needs in addition to its financial commitments 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table presents a summary of the company s contractual obligations and payments due by period as of december  in millions payments due by period less than more than total year years years years long term debt capital lease obligations operating lease obligations fair value of interest rate swaps fair value of foreign currency forward contracts total contractual obligations the company is party to various interest rate swap agreements in conjunction with the management of borrowing costs 
as of december   the fair value of the company s net position would result in cash proceeds of million 
future changes in the us interest rate environment would correspondingly affect the fair value and ultimate settlement of the contracts 
the company also enters into foreign currency forward contracts to protect against the variability in exchange rates on cash flows of its foreign subsidiaries 
as of december   the unrealized gain on the company s foreign currency forward contracts totaled million 
volatility in the future exchange rates between the us dollar and euro and canadian dollar will impact final settlement 
the following table presents a summary of the company s commercial commitments and the notional amount expiration by period in millions notional amount expiration by period less than more than total year years years years security bonds for casualty insurance policies financial standby letters of credit 
guaranteed residual value obligations 


guarantees of the indebtedness of others 


total commercial commitments 

the security bonds for casualty insurance policies relate to the company s worker s compensation  automobile  general liability and product liability policies 
the outstanding financial standby letters of credit represent guarantees of performance by foreign subsidiaries that engage in cross border transactions with foreign governments 
in limited circumstances  the company guarantees the residual value on vehicles in order to facilitate a sale 
the company also guaranteed the debt of an independent dealer that sells the company s vehicles 
the company believes its risk of loss is low  no losses have been incurred to date 
the inability of the company to enter into these types of arrangements in the future due to unforeseen circumstances is not expected to have a material impact on its financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the company considers the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact the company s financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers 
the company s policy is to establish  on a quarterly basis  an allowance for doubtful accounts based on factors such as historical loss trends  credit quality of the present portfolio  collateral value and general economic conditions 
if the historical loss trend increased or decreased in  the company s operating income would have decreased or increased by 
million  respectively 
though management considers the valuation of the allowance proper and adequate  changes in the economy and or deterioration of the financial condition of the company s customers could affect the reserve balances required 
warranty reserve the company s products generally carry express warranties that provide repairs at no cost to the customer or the issuance of credit 
the length of the warranty term depends on the product sold  but generally extends from six months to five years based on the terms that are generally accepted in the company s marketplaces 
certain components necessary to manufacture the company s vehicles including chassis  engines and transmissions are covered under an original manufacturers warranty 
such manufacturers warranties are extended directly to end customers 
the company accrues its estimated exposure to warranty claims at the time of sale based upon historical warranty claim costs as a percentage of sales 
management reviews these estimates on a quarterly basis and adjusts the warranty provisions as actual experience differs from historical estimates 
infrequently  a material warranty issue can arise which is outside the norm of the company s historical experience  costs related to such issues  if any  are provided for when they become probable and estimable 
the company s warranty cost as a percentage of net sales totaled in  in and in the increase in the rate in is primarily due to the acquisitions of the refuse truck body businesses in late which experience higher warranty claims due to their usage pattern and the introduction of new custom fire rescue vehicles that incurred higher warranty costs when used for the first time 
although management believes the current liability is appropriate  a increase or decrease in the estimated warranty costs in would have decreased or increased operating income by million  respectively 
worker s compensation and product liability reserves the company is partially self insured for worker s compensation claims with various stop loss thresholds 
when a worker s compensation claim is filed  a liability is estimated  if any is expected  to settle the claim 
the establishment of a liability for unpaid claims  including claims incurred but not reported  is based on the assessment by the company s claim administrator of each claim  management s estimate of the nature and severity of total claims and an independent actuarial valuation 
the company utilizes a third party administrator to track and evaluate actual claims experience for consistency in the data used in the actuarial valuation 
while management believes the current reserve is adequate  a increase or decrease in the average cost per claim in would have decreased or increased operating income by 
million  respectively 
due to the nature of the products manufactured  the company is subject to product liability claims in the ordinary course of business 
the company is partially self insured for its product liability exposures  it records a liability when a potential loss associated with an asserted claim is probable and reasonably estimable 
the liability is based on an assessment of each claim by the company s third party administrator  management s current knowledge of the matter and consultation with counsel 
management believes that the liability established appropriately reflects the company s risk exposure 
goodwill impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  the company ceased amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets effective january  sfas no 
also requires the company to test these assets annually for impairment  the company performs this test at the beginning of the fourth quarter unless impairment indicators arise earlier 
the company continues to amortize definite lived intangible assets over their useful life 
a review for impairment requires judgment in estimated cash flows based upon estimates of future sales  operating income  working capital improvements and capital expenditures 
management utilizes a discounted cash flow approach to determine the fair value of the company s reporting units 
if the sum of the expected discounted cash flows of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value  an impairment loss is required against the unit s goodwill 
in accordance with sfas no 
s transition rules  the company performed an assessment as of january   the date of the statement s adoption 
this evaluation resulted in an million impairment charge in related to a niche tool group business 
the annual testing conducted in and did not result in any impairment 
although management believes that the assumptions and estimates used were reasonable  a sensitivity analysis for each reporting unit is performed along with the impairment test 
the analysis indicated that a change in the sales growth  operating margin or working capital percentage assumptions would not result in any goodwill impairment 
market risk management the company is subject to market risk associated with changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
to mitigate this risk  the company utilizes interest rate swaps and foreign currency forward contracts 
the company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes and is not party to leverage derivatives 
interest rate risk the company manages its exposure to interest rate movements by maintaining a proportionate relationship between fixed rate debt to total debt within established percentages 
the company uses funded fixed rate borrowings as well as interest rate swap agreements to balance its overall fixed floating interest rate mix 
of the company s debt at december   was used to support financial services assets  the average remaining life of those assets is typically under three years and the debt is match funded to the financing assets 
the company is currently comfortable with a sizeable portion of floating rate debt to support these financial services assets  since a rise in borrowing rates would normally correspond with a rise in lending rates within a reasonable period 
the following table summarizes the company s financial instruments held at december  that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  including debt obligations and interest rate swaps dollars in millions expected maturity date thereafter total fair value long term debt fixed rate principal average interest rate variable rate principal average interest rate short term debt variable rate principal average interest rate interest rate swaps pay fixed  receive variable notional amount average pay rate average receive rate interest rate swaps receive fixed  pay variable notional amount average pay rate average receive rate for interest rate swaps  the table presents notional amounts and weighted average interest rates by expected contractual maturity dates

at december  and  the company was party to interest rate swap agreements with aggregate notional amounts of million and million  respectively 
see note h to the consolidated financial statements for a description of these agreements 
all of the interest rate swap agreements qualify for hedge accounting treatment 
foreign exchange rate risk the company has foreign currency exposures related to buying and selling in currencies other than the local currency in which it operates 
the company utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to manage risks associated with sales and purchase commitments as well as forecast transactions denominated in foreign currencies
