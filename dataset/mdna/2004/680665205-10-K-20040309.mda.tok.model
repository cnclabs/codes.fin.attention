item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
additional factors that may affect future results in addition to the other information in this form k  the following factors should be considered in evaluating olin and our business 
all of our forward looking statements should be considered in light of these factors 
additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of or that we currently deem immaterial also may become important factors that affect us 
sensitivity to global economic conditions and cyclicality our operating results could be negatively affected during economic downturns 
the business of most of our customers  particularly our automotive  coinage  electrical connectors  telecommunications and housing customers  are  to varying degrees  cyclical and have historically experienced periodic downturns 
these economic and industry downturns have been characterized by diminished product demand  excess manufacturing capacity and  in some cases  lower average selling prices 
therefore  any significant downturn in our customers businesses or in global economic conditions could result in a reduction in demand for our products and could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 
as a result of the depressed economic conditions beginning in the fourth quarter of and continuing through the first half of  our vinyls  urethanes and pulp and paper customers had lower demand for our chlor alkali products 
our coinage  electronic and telecommunications customers had lower demand for our metals products beginning in the fourth quarter of and continuing through lower demand in our metals segment adversely affected our business and results of operations in   and  compared to and lower demand in our chlor alkali products segment adversely affected our business and results of operations in and  compared to the rod industry has been negatively affected by continued reductions in capital spending in the industrial machinery segment and reduced demand for building and household products as a result of declines in commercial construction 
although we do not generally sell a large percentage of our products directly to customers abroad  a large part of our financial performance is dependent upon a healthy economy beyond the united states 
our customers sell their products abroad 
as a result  our business is affected by general economic conditions and other factors in western europe and most of east asia  particularly china and japan  including fluctuations in interest rates  customer demand  labor costs and other factors beyond our control 
the demand for our customers products  and therefore  our products  is directly affected by such fluctuations 
our joint venture  yamaha olin metal corporation  located in japan  is particularly susceptible to these fluctuations 
we cannot assure you that events having an adverse effect on the industries in which we operate will not occur or continue  such as a further downturn in the western european  asian or world economies  increases in interest rates  unfavorable currency fluctuations or a prolonged slowdown in the coinage  electronic or telecommunications industries 
the terrorist attacks of september th created many economic and political uncertainties and have had a negative impact on the global economy 
the long term effects of these attacks on our future operating results and financial condition are unknown 
the national and international responses to terrorist attacks and the potential for additional terrorist attacks or similar events could have further material adverse effects on the economy in general  on our industry and on our operations 
for example  war with one or more countries could have numerous consequences for us and our customers  one of which may be sustained high energy prices 
cyclical pricing pressure our profitability could be reduced by declines in average selling prices of our products  particularly declines in the ecu netback gross price less freight and discounts 
our historical operating results reflect the cyclical and sometimes volatile nature of the chemical  metals and ammunition industries 
we experience cycles of fluctuating supply and demand in each of our business segments  particularly in chlor alkali products which results in changes in selling prices 
periods of high demand  tight supply and increasing operating margins tend to result in increased capacity and production until supply exceeds demand  generally followed by periods of oversupply and declining prices 
the industry build cycle  and its impact on industry pricing  has been most pronounced in our chlor alkali products segment 
for example  in and  the chlor alkali industry was very profitable due to a tight supply demand balance  which resulted in both higher operating rates and higher ecu prices 
higher profits led to reinvestment to expand capacity 
this new capacity became operational in and  resulting in industry over capacity 
this imbalance was exacerbated by falling demand as a result of the asian financial crisis 
the supply demand imbalance resulted in both lower operating rates and lower ecu prices  and in  many chlor alkali producers had operating losses 
the supply demand balance improved due to improved economic conditions in compared to  and ecu prices increased in compared to as the us and world economies deteriorated in and through the first half of  the chlor alkali industry again experienced a period of oversupply because of lower industry demand for both chlorine and caustic 
another factor impacting demand for chlorine and caustic soda is the price of natural gas 
higher natural gas prices  which recently have exceeded per million british thermal units  increase our customers manufacturing costs  make them less competitive in world markets and  therefore  may result in reduced demand for our products 
price in the chlor alkali industry is a major supplier selection criterion 
we have little or no ability to influence prices in this large commodity market 
decreases in the average selling prices of our products could have a material adverse effect on our profitability 
for example  assuming all other costs remain constant  a change in our ecu netback causes a corresponding million increase or decrease in our annual revenues and pre tax profits  when we are operating at full capacity 
while we strive to maintain or increase our profitability by reducing costs through improving production efficiency  emphasizing higher margin products  and by controlling selling and administration expenses  we cannot assure you that these efforts will be sufficient to offset fully the effect of changes in pricing on operating results 
because of the cyclical nature of our businesses  we cannot assure you that pricing or profitability in the future will be comparable to any particular historical period  including the most recent period shown in our operating results 
we cannot assure you that the chlor alkali industry will not experience adverse trends in the future  or that our operating results and or financial condition will not be adversely affected by them 
our metals and winchester segments are also subject to changes in operating results as a result of cyclical pricing pressures  but to a lesser extent than the chlor alkali products segment 
we generally pass changes in prices for copper and other metals along to our customers as part of the negotiated price of the finished product in most of our metals segment product lines 
however  our metals segment experiences manufacturing or pricing pressure with respect to its conversion charges  and we cannot assure you that adverse trends in pricing and margins will not affect operating results in the future 
changes in global supply demand for copper and copper alloys may affect our ability to obtain raw materials under reasonable terms and conditions which may materially adversely affect our operating results 
similarly  selling prices of ammunition are affected by changes in raw material costs and availability and customer demand  and declines in average selling prices of our winchester segment could adversely affect our profitability 
indebtedness our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition  limit our ability to grow and compete and prevent us from fulfilling our obligation under our indebtedness 
as of december   we had approximately million of indebtedness outstanding  excluding our guarantee of million of indebtedness of our sunbelt joint venture 
this does not include our million senior credit facility on which we had million available on that date 
as of december   our indebtedness represented of our total capitalization 
our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition  limit our ability to grow and compete and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our indebtedness 
despite our level of indebtedness  our senior credit facility and our existing indentures permit us to borrow additional money 
if we borrow more money  the risks related to our indebtedness could be increased significantly 
debt service we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our debt  which may require us to refinance our indebtedness or default on our scheduled debt payments 
our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to make scheduled payments on our debt depends on a range of economic  competitive and business factors  many of which are outside our control 
we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations 
if we are unable to meet our expenses and debt obligations  we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity  sell assets or raise equity 
we cannot assure you that we would be able to refinance any of our indebtedness  sell assets or raise equity on commercially reasonable terms or at all  which could cause us to default on our obligations and impair our liquidity 
our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt obligations  or to refinance our obligations on commercially reasonable terms  would have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations  as well as on our ability to satisfy our debt obligations 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
after taking into consideration our interest rate swaps which convert our fixed rate debt to a variable rate  at december   approximately of our indebtedness bears interest at variable rates that are linked to short term interest rates 
if interest rates rise  our costs relative to those obligations would also rise 
imbalance in demand for our chlor alkali products a loss of a substantial customer for our chlorine or caustic soda could cause an imbalance in demand for these products  which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
chlorine and caustic soda are produced simultaneously and in a fixed ratio of ton of chlorine to tons of caustic soda 
the loss of a substantial chlorine or caustic soda customer could cause an imbalance in demand for our chlorine and caustic soda products 
an imbalance in demand may require us to reduce production of both chlorine and caustic soda or take other steps to correct the imbalance 
since we cannot store chlorine  we may not be able to respond to an imbalance in demand for these products as quickly or efficiently as some of our competitors 
if a substantial imbalance occurred  we would need to reduce prices or take other actions that could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
competition we face competition from other chemical  metals and ammunition companies  including the migration by united states customers to low cost foreign locations  which could adversely affect our revenues and financial condition 
we are in active competition with companies producing the same or similar products  as well as  in some instances  with companies producing different products designed for the same uses 
with respect to certain product groups  such as ammunition  copper alloys and brass rod  and with respect to certain chlor alkali products  we are among the largest manufacturers or distributors in the united states 
we encounter competition in price  delivery  service  securing and maintaining customers  performance  technology  product innovation  and product recognition and quality  depending on the product involved 
our customers could decide to move some or all of their production to lower cost  offshore locations and this could reduce demand in the united states for our products 
with respect to certain products  some of our competitors are larger  have greater financial resources and have less debt than we do 
as a result  these competitors may be better able to withstand a change in conditions within the industries in which we operate and throughout the economy as a whole 
if we do not compete successfully  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
environmental costs we have ongoing environmental costs  which could materially adversely affect our financial position or results of operations 
the nature of our operations and products  including the raw materials we handle  exposes us to the risk of liabilities or claims with respect to environmental matters 
we have incurred  and will continue to incur  significant costs and capital expenditures in complying with environmental laws and regulations 
the ultimate costs and timing of environmental liabilities are difficult to predict 
liability under environmental laws relating to contaminated sites can be imposed retroactively and on a joint and several basis 
one liable party could be held responsible for all costs at a site  regardless of fault  percentage of contribution to the site or the legality of the original disposal 
we could incur significant costs  including cleanup costs  natural resources damages  civil or criminal fines and sanctions and third party lawsuits claiming  for example  personal injury and or property damage  as a result of past or future violations of  or liabilities under  environmental or other laws 
in addition  future events  such as changes to or more rigorous enforcement of environmental laws  could require us to make additional expenditures  modify or curtail our operations and or install pollution control equipment 
accordingly  it is possible that some of the matters in which we are involved or may become involved may be resolved unfavorably to us  which could materially adversely affect our financial position or results of operations 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations environmental matters 
cost control our profitability could be reduced if we experience higher than expected raw material  utility  transportation or logistics costs  or if we fail to achieve our targeted cost reductions 
our operating results and profitability are dependent upon our continued ability to control  and in some cases further reduce  our costs 
if we are unable to do so  or if costs outside of our control  particularly our costs of raw materials  utilities  transportation and similar costs increase beyond anticipated levels  our profitability will decline 
production hazards our facilities are subject to operating hazards  which may disrupt our business 
we are dependent upon the continued safe operation of our production facilities 
our production facilities are subject to hazards associated with the manufacture  handling  storage and transportation of chemical materials and products and ammunition  including leaks and ruptures  explosions  fires  inclement weather and natural disasters  unexpected utility disruptions or outages  unscheduled downtime and environmental hazards 
from time to time in the past  we have had incidents that have temporarily shut down or otherwise disrupted our manufacturing  causing production delays and resulting in liability for workplace injuries and fatalities 
some of our products involve the manufacture and or handling of a variety of explosive and flammable materials 
use of these products by our customers could also result in liability if an explosion  fire  spill or other accident were to occur 
we cannot assure you that we will not experience these types of incidents in the future or that these incidents will not result in production delays or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
labor matters we cannot assure you that we can conclude future labor contracts or any other labor agreements without work stoppages 
various labor unions represent a majority of our hourly paid employees for collective bargaining purposes 
although some labor contracts extend for as long as six years  others are for shorter periods 
a labor contract for approximately employees at the chlor alkali products facility in mcintosh  alabama expires in april and a labor contract for approximately employees at the metals facility in montpelier  ohio expires in june while we believe our relations with our employees and their various representatives are generally satisfactory  we cannot assure you that we can conclude future labor contracts or any other labor agreements without work stoppages 
tax audits we are currently subject to ongoing tax audits  which may result in additional tax payments 
we are currently subject to ongoing audits by the internal revenue service in connection with our federal tax returns for the years from to  however  we have closed all tax years through depending on the outcome of these audits  we may be required to pay additional taxes  and any additional taxes and related interest could be substantial 
we have reserved amounts which we believe will be sufficient for any adverse outcome 
the timing of any such payments is uncertain 
pension plans declines in global equity markets on asset values and any declines in interest rates used to value the liabilities in our pension plan may result in higher pension costs and the need to fund the pension plan in future years  earlier than expected 
under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 we recorded a million after tax charge million pretax to shareholders equity as of december   reflecting an accumulated benefit obligation in excess of the year end market value of assets of our pension plan 
in  the decline in interest rates more than offset a significant rebound in the value of the plan s assets  which necessitated the recording of an additional after tax charge to shareholders equity of million million pretax 
this is a non cash charge and does not affect our ability to borrow under our revolving credit agreement 
based on our assumptions and estimates  including historical plan experience and assumptions regarding the future and the million voluntary contribution from the proceeds of our offering of million shares of common stock  we may be required to make additional contributions to the pension fund 
for  we estimate that our non cash pension pretax expense will be approximately million higher than million per quarter versus million higher had we not made the million voluntary contribution  and that pension expense will continue to increase by about million per year over the next few years 
security and chemicals transportation new regulations on the transportation of hazardous chemicals and or the security of chemical manufacturing facilities in response to the increased terrorist threat post september th could result in significantly higher operating costs 
the chemical industry  including the chlor alkali industry  has proactively responded to the issues surrounding the events of september  by starting new initiatives relating to the security of chemicals industry facilities and the transportation of hazardous chemicals in the united states 
simultaneously  government at the local  state and federal levels has begun the regulatory process which could lead to new regulations that would impact the security of chemical plant locations and the transportation of hazardous chemicals 
our chlor alkali business could be adversely impacted because of either an incident or the cost of complying with new regulations 
the extent of the impact would depend on the consequences of an incident and the nature and direction of future regulations  which are unknown at this time 
litigation and claims we are subject to litigation and other claims  which could cause us to incur significant expenses 
we are a defendant in a number of pending legal proceedings relating to our present and former operations 
these include proceedings alleging injurious exposure of plaintiffs to various chemicals and other substances including proceedings based on alleged exposures to asbestos  perchlorate and vinyl chloride 
frequently  such proceedings involve claims made by numerous plaintiffs against many defendants 
we believe we have valid defenses to these proceedings and are defending them vigorously 
however  because of the inherent uncertainties of litigation  we are unable to predict the outcome of these proceedings and therefore cannot determine whether the financial impact  if any  will be material to our financial position or results of operations 
changes in laws and regulations we are subject to a variety of existing laws and regulations that affect our business 
we are unable to determine what effect  if any  the impact of changes in existing or new laws and regulations and the associated compliance costs may have on our operating results 
item properties we have manufacturing sites at separate locations in states and puerto rico and two manufacturing sites and a distribution facility in three foreign countries 
in addition  a metals service center in china is expected to be operational in the first quarter of most manufacturing sites are owned although a number of small sites are leased 
we listed the locations at or from which our products and services are manufactured  distributed or marketed in the tables set forth under the caption products and services 
we lease warehouses  terminals and distribution offices and space for executive and branch sales offices and service departments throughout the world 
item legal proceedings a we completed the work of covering certain former waste ponds in in connection with remediation of mercury contamination at the site of our former mercury cell chlor alkali plant in saltville  virginia  and have now completed all remediation work required to date 
we have met with the site s natural resources trustees at the trustees request regarding past releases from the saltville site and the nearby north fork of the holston river 
in mid  the trustees for natural resources in the north fork of the holston river  the main stem holston river  and associated floodplains  located in smyth and washington counties in virginia  and in sullivan and hawkins counties in tennessee notified us of  and invited our participation in  an assessment of alleged injuries to natural resources resulting from the release of mercury 
the trustees also notified us that they have made a preliminary determination that we are potentially liable for natural resource damages in said rivers and floodplains 
in light of the early stage  and inherent uncertainties  of the assessment  we cannot at this time determine whether the financial impact  if any  of this matter will be material to our financial position or results of operations 
see environmental matters contained in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
b as part of the continuing environmental investigation by federal  state and local governments of waste disposal sites  we have entered into a number of settlement agreements requiring us to contribute to the cost of the investigation and cleanup of a number of sites 
we expect this process of investigation and cleanup to continue 
see environmental matters contained in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
c as a result of an internal audit of our east alton  illinois facility  we questioned whether recent upgrades to certain operations were completed in full compliance with certain usepa air emissions regulations 
although our facility received a modification to its air emissions permit from the illinois environmental protection agency  or iepa  for the upgrades  the permit modification may not have addressed or completely addressed all applicable regulations 
on february   we disclosed to usepa and iepa that the upgrades may not have been in compliance with all aspects of usepa regulations 
upon further review  we submitted a report to iepa in june  discussing our analysis of the regulations applicable to the upgrades 
we have offered to work with usepa and iepa to determine the nature and extent of the issues and to correct them  if necessary 
as part of the resolution of this issue  we may need to enhance pollution control equipment at our east alton facility and pay some penalty 
we do not expect that the ultimate resolution of this matter will have a material impact on our financial position  or on our results of operations 
d we and our subsidiaries are defendants in various other legal actions including proceedings based on alleged exposures to asbestos  perchlorate and vinyl chloride incidental to our past and current business activities 
while we believe that none of these legal actions will materially impact our financial position  in light of the inherent uncertainties of the litigation concerning alleged exposures  we cannot at this time determine whether the financial impact  if any  of these matters will be material to our results of operations 
in particular  we have been named as defendant in a number of similar legal actions including several proposed class actions filed in and in federal and state court in san jose  california relating to alleged groundwater contamination arising from perchlorate use between and by olin and another  unrelated  defendant at an olin facility in morgan hill  california 
we are working with california state regulatory authorities to determine the scope of potential contamination 
we are vigorously defending these suits and opposing any class certification

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business background our manufacturing operations are concentrated in three segments chlor alkali products  metals and winchester 
all three are capital intensive manufacturing businesses with growth rates closely tied to the general economy 
each segment has a commodity element to it  and therefore  our ability to influence pricing is quite limited on the portion of the segment s business that is strictly commodity 
our chlor alkali products business is a commodity business where all supplier products are similar and price is the major supplier selection criterion 
we have little or no ability to influence prices in this large  global commodity market 
cyclical price swings  driven by changes in supply demand  can be abrupt and significant and  given capacity in our chlor alkali products business  can lead to very significant changes in our overall profitability 
while a majority of metals sales are of a commodity nature  this business has a significant volume of specialty engineered products targeted for specific end uses 
in these applications  technical capability and performance differentiate the product and play a significant role in product selection and thus price is not the only selection criterion 
winchester also has a commodity element to its business  but a majority of winchester ammunition is sold as a branded consumer product where there are opportunities to differentiate certain offerings through innovative new product development and enhanced product performance 
while competitive pricing versus other branded ammunition products is important  it is not the only factor in product selection 
recent developments and highlights and years in the first quarter of  we made a decision to close our manufacturing plant in indianapolis  indiana 
the indianapolis facility ceased operations on february  the plant manufactured copper and copper alloy sheet and strip products and employed approximately people 
production at the indianapolis strip mill has been consolidated within our east alton  illinois facility 
while the indianapolis strip mill had been an important part of the metals segment since its acquisition in  reduced domestic consumption of strip products combined with capacity additions at east alton have lessened the need to maintain the indianapolis production base 
as a result of this closure and certain other actions  we recorded in the first quarter of a pretax restructuring charge of million 
in addition  we recorded in the fourth quarter of  a pretax restructuring charge of million primarily for the write down of certain non us assets  netted with a reduction of a previously established reserve related to our indianapolis restructuring 
the major portion of the first and fourth quarter charges was a non cash charge million related to the loss on disposal or write off of equipment and facilities and goodwill 
the balance of the restructuring charges related to severance and job related benefit costs 
at the indianapolis facility  approximately employees were terminated  while nine employees were transferred to the east alton facility 
in addition to the closing of the indianapolis facility  the metals segment had determined that further cost reductions were necessary due to continuing depressed economic conditions 
approximately employees were terminated to reduce headcount through a combination of a reduction in force program in metals and the relocation of the segment s new haven  connecticut metals research laboratory activities to two existing manufacturing locations 
we continue to estimate that the annual pretax savings from the indianapolis shutdown will more than offset the one time cash costs and that the savings will be higher in when the full year effect of this shutdown will be realized 
in the first quarter of  we recorded an after tax charge of million in connection with the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
we adopted this standard on january  and the charge is for estimated closure costs related to our former operating facilities  certain hazardous waste units at our operating plant sites  and our indianapolis facility which was shut down in the first quarter of  as described above 
the after tax charge was recorded as the cumulative effect of an accounting change 
in the first quarter of  we were accepted to participate in the internal revenue service s irs settlement initiative pertaining to tax issues relating to our benefits liability management company 
assuming a settlement is reached pursuant to the initiative  we expect to eventually pay approximately million which had been recorded as a liability prior to  representing the final settlement  net of tax benefits on the operating results of our benefits liability management company 
in addition  we reached a settlement with the irs relative to our company owned life insurance coli program 
the settlement with the irs contemplates a tax payment of approximately million in the first half of with the remainder of approximately million to be paid in future years 
these payments had been recorded as a liability prior to under sfas no 
 we recorded a million after tax charge million pretax to shareholders equity as of december   reflecting an accumulated benefit obligation in excess of the year end market value of assets of our pension plan 
in  the decline in interest rates more than offset a significant rebound in the value of the plan s assets  which necessitated the recording of an additional after tax charge of million million pretax 
this is a non cash charge and does not affect our ability to borrow under our revolving credit agreement 
on february   we made a voluntary contribution of million to the pension plan with the proceeds from the issuance of common stock described below 
we expect that the voluntary contribution will have a beneficial effect on the pension expense of approximately million pretax million after tax 
therefore  it is expected that the non cash pension pretax expense in will be approximately million higher than million per quarter versus million higher had we not made the million voluntary contribution and that pension expense will continue to increase by about million per year over the next few years 
the voluntary contribution will improve the funded status of the pension plan 
based on revised assumptions and estimates taking into account the voluntary contribution  we now believe that only minimal contributions will be required until on february   we issued and sold million shares of our common stock at a public offering price of 
net proceeds from the sale were approximately million and were used to make a voluntary contribution of million to our pension plan 
the balance of the proceeds of million is available to retire maturing debt or for other corporate purposes 
in january  we announced that our board of directors approved plans to move our corporate headquarters to the east alton  illinois area 
the decision to relocate was driven by the organizational  strategic and economic advantages to locating our corporate headquarters in the east alton area 
the relocation of corporate headquarters will be accompanied by a downsized corporate structure more appropriate for us in today s competitive business environment 
we expect the headquarters relocation to be completed by the end of currently  people are employed on the corporate staff  including in norwalk 
when completed  the efficiencies of being substantially co located with the brass and winchester businesses will result in corporate personnel being reduced by more than forty percent  with total projected savings of approximately million per year 
as a result of the relocation  we expect to incur one time costs of approximately million which will be disclosed as expensed primarily throughout we expect to provide job transition benefits and outplacement services to all affected employees 
the transition is expected to begin in the second quarter of year on september   we completed our acquisition of chase with the issuance of approximately million shares of our common stock for of the outstanding stock of chase 
our metals segment s operating results include the sales and profits from chase for the fourth quarter of in march  we issued and sold  shares of common stock at a public offering price of 
the net proceeds from the sale were approximately million 
in june  we repaid the million notes from the proceeds from the sale of million notes in december in march  we refinanced our variable rate tax exempt debt issues  totaling million 
in november  we announced that our metals segment had entered into an agreement with luoyang copper to jointly construct and operate a metals service center in guangzhou  guangdong province  china 
the joint venture named olin luotang metals gz ltd  co  will process and distribute both our and luoyang s copper alloy products to the growing chinese marketplace 
the joint venture will allow us to supply specialty alloys targeted at the electronics  automotive and telecommunications industries  at competitive prices 
this joint venture is expected to be operational in the first quarter of year in june  we acquired the stock of monarch for approximately million 
monarch was a privately held  specialty copper alloy manufacturer headquartered in waterbury  ct 
it produces and distributes an array of high performance copper alloys and other materials used for applications in electronics  telecommunications  automotive products and building products 
in the third quarter of  we recorded a pretax charge for restructuring and unusual items of million primarily for costs associated with a salaried workforce reduction through an early retirement incentive program 
cost of goods sold and other income included million and million  respectively  of unusual items 
cost of goods sold included the write off of inventory associated with cancelled customer orders 
other income included the write off of an investment in an e commerce company because the company declared bankruptcy and was dissolved and therefore had no future value 
the third quarter restructuring charge of million related to the employees retiring in connection with the retirement program and represented primarily pension and postretirement benefit curtailment losses and severance 
as of december   all employees had retired 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a restructuring charge of million pretax primarily for costs associated with idling our indianapolis brass mill  consolidating distribution operations of monarch with the aj oster metals service center business  and reducing staffing levels in chlor alkali products 
a significant portion of the charge relating to the idling of the indianapolis facility represented pension and postretirement curtailment losses and severance for employees 
another portion of the charge related to chlor alkali employees who accepted our offer of a voluntary special separation program whereby employees accept a voluntary lay off and receive full separation benefits and also receive their accrued pension benefits at the same time 
the balance of the restructuring charge relates to costs associated with the consolidation of certain monarch facilities in order to optimize distribution operations 
in  we were notified that we would receive shares of prudential insurance company as a result of its decision to demutualize from a mutual company to a stock company 
we recorded a gain of million in other income in we received the shares and immediately sold them in january consolidated results of operations in millions  except per share data sales gross margin selling and administration restructuring charge interest expense  net other income income loss before taxes and cumulative effect of accounting change income loss before cumulative effect of accounting change cumulative effect of accounting change  net net loss diluted net loss per common share income loss before cumulative effect of accounting change accounting change  net net loss compared to sales increased primarily due to the inclusion of the sales of chase  an increase in selling prices  higher metal sales and higher volumes 
the price increases were primarily related to higher ecu prices in the chlor alkali products segment because of the turnaround in the chlor alkali market 
gross margin percentage increased from in to in primarily due to higher ecu selling prices for chlor alkali products 
selling and administration expenses as a percentage of sales were in and in selling and administration expenses in were million higher than in primarily due to higher pension costs million  the inclusion of chase s selling and administration expenses million  and other administration expenses such as consulting expenses million and various legal expenses million 
the earnings of non consolidated affiliates were million for  up million from  primarily due to higher ecu pricing at the sunbelt joint venture million income  million loss 
interest expense  net of interest income decreased from due to lower average debt levels in million and lower interest rates on our debt portfolio million  offset in part by lower interest income resulting from lower interest income rates million 
in june  we repaid the million notes 
in  we recorded a tax provision of million on a pretax income of million 
the effective tax rate is higher than the percent us federal statutory tax rate primarily due to our inability to utilize state and foreign net operating losses in certain jurisdictions and income in other foreign jurisdictions being taxed at higher rates 
in addition  the restructuring charge included the write off of goodwill  which is not deductible for tax purposes 
the tax benefits recorded on the losses in were less than the statutory rate because we recorded a tax provision of million in connection with the surrender of life insurance policies purchased by us under the coli program and were accruing interest on taxes which may become payable in the future 
compared to sales increased primarily due to sales associated with our acquisition of both chase and monarch and increased volumes  offset in part by lower selling prices and metal sales 
chase was acquired in late september  while monarch was acquired in early june the increase in sales volumes was across all segments  in particular strip shipments to the ammunition  automotive and electronics segments 
the price decreases were primarily related to lower ecu netbacks in the chlor alkali products segment 
gross margin percentage decreased from in to in primarily due to lower ecu prices 
selling and administration as a percentage of sales were in and selling and administration expenses were comparable to reduced salaries resulting from the early retirement incentive program and the voluntary separation program implemented in late and lower consumer promotional expenses offset lower pension income and higher legal expenses 
interest expense  net of interest income  increased from due to higher average outstanding debt million relating primarily to the million that we borrowed in december and higher interest rates on our debt million  partially offset by higher interest income million in other income decreased from primarily due to the gains on the demutualization of prudential insurance million and the sale of excess real estate million and a non recurring fee payment million  all of which were received in the effective tax rate decreased in to a negative from in the tax benefit recorded on the loss in was less than the statutory rate because we recorded a tax provision of million in connection with the surrender of life insurance policies purchased by us under the coli program and were accruing interest on taxes which may be payable in the future 
segment operating results historically  our external reporting of segment operating results included an allocation of all corporate costs to three operating segments 
in the past  senior management and the board of directors have reviewed the results of the businesses both on an externally reported basis including the allocation of all corporate costs and on a divisional basis excluding the allocation of corporate costs 
during it became apparent that the most effective way to review the results of our businesses was without the corporate allocation 
therefore  all of the monthly operations reviews focused on the division pretax results earnings before interest and tax and excluding corporate and the corporate other costs 
consistent with the guidance in sfas no 
 disclosures and segments of an enterprise and related information  we have determined it would be more appropriate to create a separate corporate other segment for external reporting purposes to capture those corporate costs  which are not readily allocable back to the segments such as environmental remediation costs  pension income and expense  and other purely corporate items 
this is consistent with the manner in which the results are accumulated in the consolidation process and the manner in which they are viewed by senior management and the board of directors 
we believe that by isolating these corporate costs in a separate segment we will provide more transparent and understandable disclosure about the operating results of our segments and that is consistent with how we assess the performance of our businesses 
we define segment operating income as earnings loss before interest expense  interest income  other income  restructuring charge and unusual items and income taxes and include the operating results of non consolidated affiliates 
segment operating results exclude in the restructuring charge million  pretax and in the restructuring charge and unusual items million  pretax 
management monitors segment operating results and earnings per share excluding unusual items such as restructuring charges  unusual charges credits and accounting changes 
management believes that these items are unique and are not part of the ongoing business results 
management believes that providing this information to investors will better enable them to understand our historical and future earnings trends by excluding these items

the change in net sales reflects the pricing improvements since the netback low point in the second quarter of these sales results reflect a tremendous turnaround year over year as the chlor alkali industry pricing rebounded from the depressed levels of a year ago 
the year started out with aggressive price increases as the economy started to gain momentum 
the pricing improvement continued until late in the third quarter when industry wide caustic inventory and production exceeded demand 
excess caustic inventory and imports of off shore material forced u 
s 
producers to reduce pricing 
chlorine pricing remained steady during the year due to strong demand  primarily in the vinyls segment 
our ecu netbacks  excluding our sunbelt joint venture  were approximately in  compared with approximately in  reflecting the impact of improved pricing 
this pricing improvement was due to improving economic conditions and industry capacity rationalization 
our operating rates for the full year were approximately compared to in our operating results were higher in compared to primarily due to higher selling prices million and improved operating results from the sunbelt joint venture million because of higher selling prices 
these two factors  along with the segment s cost reduction programs  more than offset higher manufacturing costs which resulted from increases in steam cost natural gas price  increases in electricity cost and normal escalation 
the operating results from the sunbelt joint venture included interest expense of million in and  on the sunbelt notes 
also  in the second quarter of  the sunbelt joint venture completed a debottlenecking project 
the impact of this project  in terms of capacity  was  ecu s on an annualized basis or  ecu increase for each partner 
compared to sales decreased from primarily due to lower selling prices  but offset in part by higher volumes 
average ecu netbacks in were approximately  compared to in the chlor alkali industry suffered through a difficult first half of and some high cost manufacturers decided to shut down capacity 
during the third quarter of  demand started to pick up and the industry was able to pass through several price increases 
improved demand and less overall capacity continued to support price increases through the rest of the year 
our operating rates improved until late in the year when seasonal slow downs and a sluggish economy forced us and other manufacturers to reduce production 
our operating rates for the full year were approximately compared with in chlorine and caustic volumes were both higher in compared to operating results were significantly lower in primarily due to lower prices million  offset in part by higher volumes million and improved results from our sunbelt joint venture million and lower costs million 
losses from the sunbelt joint venture were million in and million in the losses from the sunbelt joint venture include interest expense of million in and on the sunbelt notes 
profit improvement activities  lower steam cost  overall cost management and the voluntary separation program implemented at the end of contributed to these cost reductions 
metals compared to sales for were million and include sales of million from chase 
excluding chase  sales were million 
sales for excluding fourth quarter chase sales of million were million 
shipment volumes excluding chase were down from  mainly due to softer demand in the automotive and coinage segments with other segments being flat to slightly weaker  except for ammunition  which was stronger 
however  reported sales excluding chase increased because of higher copper prices and a product mix containing a higher metal component 
shipments to the automotive segment decreased in by as automotive production declined versus levels 
coinage shipments were down from last year due to reduced demand from the us mint primarily related to decreased demand for the state quarter program and the continued general softness in the overall economy 
shipments to the ammunition segment in increased from by due to strong demand from the military 
metals had an operating profit of million which included million of chase profits in and an operating profit of million which included million of fourth quarter profits at chase in the metals segment operating results in excluding chase decreased million and were adversely impacted by a decline in shipments  reduced product margins  higher natural gas costs of million  and cost escalations in wages and fringe benefit costs approximating million 
the shutdown of the indianapolis facility in the first quarter of increased profits over the period 
although the decline did not affect our results compared to results  as we acquired chase in september  chase sales and profits for were lower than as a result of softer demand and lower margins 
compared to sales increased mainly as a result of the two acquisitions over the past two years 
sales from monarch increased sales by while chase increased sales by in overall strip shipment volume increased by from due to increased demand in the automotive  ammunition and electronic segments  offset in part by reduced demand from coinage 
however  overall sales increased only 
the difference was the result of a shift in the mix of sales to lower metal value alloys  lower average metal selling prices and reduced conversion prices charged to customers 
the decrease in the average metal selling price was mainly due to a decrease in the average comex price for copper in from shipments to the automotive and ammunition segments each increased by compared to last year 
shipments to the automotive segment increased in as we increased our penetration into this end use category and an increase in automotive production in shipments to the ammunition segment increased as a result of increased domestic military demand 
shipments to the electronics segment increased by in compared with but were still down about from the to average demand 
coinage shipments were down from last year due to reduced demand from the us mint primarily related to decreased demand for the state quarter program  the lack of public acceptance of the sacagawea coin and the continued general softness in the overall economy 
in summary  although strip shipments were up in the automotive and electronics segments  this was offset by lower coinage shipments and by sales to the electronics segment that continued to be well below their historical norms 
metals operating income was million higher in compared with operating income benefited by the increase over the previous year in strip volumes  as mentioned above  however  this benefit was partially offset by lower unit margins 
operating income was also favorably impacted by the inclusion of million of chase profits and various cost reduction initiatives including the early retirement program and the consolidation of monarch s distribution operations with aj oster which  on a combined basis  amounted to about million in cost savings year over year 
partially offsetting the cost reduction initiatives and higher volumes in were increased employee related benefit costs of about million 
also  the results included a million last in  first out lifo inventory liquidation benefit offset by the negative impact of the east alton work stoppage in winchester compared to sales for were up compared to  primarily due to higher volumes 
the increase in sales was primarily driven by higher domestic military demand 
operating income in increased to million  from million in this increase was primarily due to the higher sales resulting from increased domestic military demand  which more than offset higher wages and fringe benefit costs 
compared to sales in were higher than primarily due to higher volumes and prices in the military and domestic commercial ammunition businesses 
winchester posted operating income of million in compared with million in the increase in sales accounted for most of the increase in operating income 
the cost benefit realized in associated with the early retirement incentive program and the absence of the effect of the strike were offset in part by the absence of the non recurring income from the settlement of a claim 
corporate other compared to in we recorded total pension expense of million and in pension income of million thereby resulting in an million increase in total pension costs 
the service cost and prior service cost components of pension expense  which are included in the operating segments and in other corporate and unallocated costs  were essentially equal in both years 
the resulting decrease in the pension credit million in  million in recorded in corporate other was due to the poor market returns on the pension assets in previous years and  to a lesser extent  the decline in interest rates 
after making the voluntary contribution of million in february  it is now expected that the total pension pretax expense in will be approximately million higher than million per quarter versus million higher had we not made the million voluntary contribution and that pension expense will continue to increase by about million per year over the next few years 
the voluntary contribution will improve the funded status of the pension plan 
based on updated assumptions and estimates  taking into account the voluntary contribution  we now believe that only minimal contributions to the pension plan will be required until we discuss our assumptions with respect to pension estimates under critical accounting policies and estimates 
in  charges to income for environmental investigatory and remedial activities were million compared to million in these charges relate primarily to remedial and investigatory activities associated with past manufacturing operations and former waste disposal sites 
other corporate and unallocated costs increased from million in to million in the increase relates primarily to an insurance gain of million recorded in  and higher expenses in related to consulting fees million  various legal expenses million  higher incentive and deferred compensation costs million  and accretion expense million associated with our asset retirement obligations recorded in accordance with financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  which we adopted on january compared to in  we recorded total pension income of million compared to pension expense of million in the service cost and prior year service cost components of pension expense  which are included in the operating segments and in other corporate and unallocated costs increased by million from the pension expenses included a million curtailment loss associated with the salaried workforce reduction through an early retirement incentive program at the metals and winchester operations in east alton  il and the idling of the indianapolis brass mill 
excluding the curtailment charge  pension income decreased million in over the decrease in pension income was due to the decline in interest rates and the poor market returns on the pension assets over the past several years 
other corporate and unallocated expenses decreased from million in to million in the primary contributor to this decrease was the insurance gain of million in outlook for the first quarter of  the metals segment is expecting improved results over the first quarter of because of higher volumes as a result of the improving economy 
winchester s profits are expected to be about equal to the first quarter last year 
chlor alkali profits are expected to be somewhat below the first quarter of with projected increased volumes partially offsetting lower pricing 
compared to the fourth quarter of  the metals segment is expecting improved results in the first quarter of because of higher volumes as a result of the improving economy and normal seasonal factors 
winchester s profits are expected to be improved over the fourth quarter of primarily because of seasonal factors 
chlor alkali profits are expected to approximate those of the fourth quarter as increased volumes are expected to offset lower pricing 
in the early part of the first quarter of in the metals segment  business continues to improve in our strip operations 
the level of booking activity in our strip operations and comments we hear from metals customers are more encouraging than three months ago 
in our rod business  we anticipate an increase in the level of booking activity as the year unfolds 
however  visibility is still limited 
clad coinage demand from the us mint is up from first quarter to  indicative of a stronger economy 
the new lewis clark commemorative nickel program for is also increasing demand 
brass strip used to manufacture ammunition continues at s second half levels and is up over s first quarter 
with defense budgets still strong  we expect these levels to continue for all of sales to the automotive electrical segment  which were strong in the fourth quarter of  continue to be strong in the first quarter of  which supports our high performance alloy sales 
although winchester s profits are expected to be about equal to the first quarter last year  its profits are expected to improve over the fourth quarter of primarily due to seasonal factors 
winchester was the winner of a five year contract to provide ammunition for the department of homeland security that will commence shipments in the second quarter of also  the army has awarded winchester a one year contract to produce million rounds of mm rifle ammunition beginning in june to supplement production at the army s arsenal 
in addition  there are several military emergency procurements that are pending that could favorably affect winchester later this year 
in chlor alkali  we are expecting our ecu prices to decrease from the fourth quarter of to the first quarter of as our contracts reflect the impact of fourth quarter market price declines 
according to reports in the trade press  caustic prices declined about per ton from the end of the third to the end of the fourth quarter in and there has been some additional downward pressure in january 
the caustic soda market has not recovered at the same rate as the chlorine market  resulting in some excess industry caustic supply 
contract chlorine prices have held relatively steady since the end of the third quarter 
however  in the latter part of january a chlorine price increase of per ton has been announced by several major producers effective immediately or as contracts allow 
operating rates have increased in the early part of the first quarter with a corresponding reduction in chlorine inventories 
the chlorine supply demand situation is very tight due to increased demand from vinyls and other sectors 
in  we expect that charges to income for environmental investigatory and remedial activities associated with past manufacturing operations and former waste disposal sites could be in the million range compared to million in the estimate is based on expectations regarding the potential resolution of investigations or remedial actions at known sites 
the actual amounts could differ from our estimate for numerous reasons  including the identification of new sites  developments at sites resulting from investigatory studies  advances in technology  changes in environmental laws and regulations and their application 
for we expect that capital spending will be in the million range and depreciation and amortization will be in the million range 
environmental matters in millions cash outlays remedial and investigatory spending charged to reserve capital spending plant operations charged to cost of goods sold total cash outlays reserve for environmental liabilities beginning balance charges to income businesses acquired remedial and investigatory spending ending balance the establishment and implementation of federal  state and local standards to regulate air  water and land quality has affected and will continue to affect substantially all of our manufacturing locations 
federal legislation providing for regulation of the manufacture  transportation  use and disposal of hazardous and toxic substances  and remediation of contaminated sites  has imposed additional regulatory requirements on industry  particularly the chemicals industry 
in addition  implementation of environmental laws  such as the resource conservation and recovery act and the clean air act  has required and will continue to require new capital expenditures and will increase plant operating costs 
we employ waste minimization and pollution prevention programs at our manufacturing sites 
we are party to various governmental and private environmental actions associated with past manufacturing facilities and former waste disposal sites 
associated costs of investigatory and remedial activities are provided for in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles governing probability and the ability to reasonably estimate future costs 
charges to income for investigatory and remedial efforts were material to operating results in   and and may be material to net income in future years 
such pretax charges to income were million  million and million in   and respectively 
these charges relate primarily to remedial and investigatory activities associated with past manufacturing operations and former waste disposal sites 
the increase in environmental charges to income was primarily attributable to additional liabilities relating to alleged groundwater contamination at a former plant site and the cleanup of potential contaminants in the soil at an offsite disposal area 
cash outlays for remedial and investigatory activities associated with former waste sites and past operations were not charged to income but instead were charged to reserves established for such costs identified and expensed to income in prior years 
cash outlays for normal plant operations for the disposal of waste and the operation and maintenance of pollution control equipment and facilities to ensure compliance with mandated and voluntarily imposed environmental quality standards were charged to income 
total environmental related cash outlays for are estimated to be million  of which million is expected to be spent on investigatory and remedial efforts  million on capital projects and million on normal plant operations 
historically  we have funded our environmental capital expenditures through cash flow from operations and expect to do so in the future 
our estimated environmental liability at the end of was attributable to sites  of which were usepa national priority list npl sites 
ten sites accounted for approximately of such liability and  of the remaining sites  no one site accounted for more than of our environmental liability 
one of these ten sites is in the investigatory stage of the remediation process 
in this stage  remedial investigation and feasibility studies are being conducted by us and a record of decision rod or its equivalent has not been issued 
at one of the ten sites  a rod or its equivalent has been issued by a responsible state agency and we are engaged in performing the remedial measures required by that rod and part of that site is subject to a remedial investigation 
at four of the ten sites  part of the site is subject to a remedial investigation and another part is in the long term operation  maintenance and monitoring om m stage 
the four remaining sites are in long term om m 
all ten sites are either associated with past manufacturing operations or former waste disposal sites 
our consolidated balance sheets included liabilities for future environmental expenditures to investigate and remediate known sites amounting to million at december   and million at december   of which million and million were classified as other noncurrent liabilities  respectively 
the environmental liabilities included million from the chase acquisition 
those amounts did not take into account any discounting of future expenditures or any consideration of insurance recoveries or advances in technology 
those liabilities are reassessed periodically to determine if environmental circumstances have changed and or remediation efforts and our estimate of related costs have changed 
as a result of these reassessments  future charges to income may be made for additional liabilities 
annual environmental related cash outlays for site investigation and remediation  capital projects  and normal plant operations are expected to range between approximately million to million over the next several years  million to million of which is for investigatory and remedial efforts  which are expected to be charged against reserves recorded on our balance sheet 
while we do not anticipate a material increase in the projected annual level of our environmental related costs  there is always the possibility that such increases may occur in the future in view of the uncertainties associated with environmental exposures 
environmental exposures are difficult to assess for numerous reasons  including the identification of new sites  developments at sites resulting from investigatory studies  advances in technology  changes in environmental laws and regulations and their application  the scarcity of reliable data pertaining to identified sites  the difficulty in assessing the involvement and financial capability of other potentially responsible parties prps and our ability to obtain contributions from other parties and the lengthy time periods over which site remediation occurs 
it is possible that some of these matters the outcomes of which are subject to various uncertainties may be resolved unfavorably to us  which could materially adversely affect our financial position or results of operations 
at december   we estimate we may have additional contingent environmental liabilities of million in addition to the amounts for which we have already taken a reserve 
legal matters we and our subsidiaries are defendants in various legal actions including proceedings based on alleged exposures to asbestos  perchlorate and vinyl chloride incidental to our past and current business activities 
we describe some of these matters in item legal proceedings 
while we believe that none of these legal actions will materially adversely impact our financial position  in light of the inherent uncertainties of the litigation concerning alleged exposures  we cannot at this time determine whether the financial impact  if any  of these matters will be material to our results of operations 
liquidity  investment activity and other financial data cash flow data provided by used for in millions net operating activities capital expenditures net investing activities net financing activities in  income exclusive of non cash charges  proceeds from the sale of short term investments and cash equivalents on hand were used to finance our working capital requirements  capital and investment projects and dividends 
operating activities in  the increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to higher profits from operations and a lower investment in working capital  particularly in inventories  offset in part by higher accounts receivables 
our investment in inventories in was lower than primarily due to our efforts to reduce inventories in our metal businesses consistent with market demand 
the investment in accounts receivable was higher in due to higher sales in chlor alkali higher ecu prices and metals higher metal prices 
in  the decrease in cash provided by operating activities as compared to was primarily attributable to lower operating results and a higher investment in working capital 
the higher investment in working capital was attributable to the metals segment where we are now selling more on a metal price pass through basis rather than on a toll basis and therefore have to inventory more metal 
capital expenditures capital spending of million in was million higher than in  as we returned to a more normalized level of spending in in  we curtailed all non essential capital spending in response to the weak operating results 
capital spending in of million was lower than the capital spending decrease also related to completion of projects that were begun in  primarily to expand production capacity in metals higher value added product categories  in particular high performance alloys 
this expansion was completed in the second half of with the majority of the spending occurring in capital spending in was approximately of depreciation compared to in in  we plan to manage our capital spending at a level approximating of depreciation  or about million  an increase of approximately over the amount 
investing activities proceeds from the sale of short term investments of million represented the equity value of the coli program which we discontinued in the first quarter of we surrendered the life insurance policies that we purchased under this program  and received these proceeds in march on september   we acquired of the stock of chase with the issuance of approximately million shares of our common stock 
the total consideration was approximately million  which represented the fair value of olin common stock issued 
chase  with full year sales of million  is a leading manufacturer and supplier of brass rod in the us and canada 
the purchase price exceeded the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired by million 
the acquisition has been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
our operating results include the sales and profits for the fourth quarter of from chase 
in january  we received million for the sale of the stock of prudential insurance company 
we were awarded these shares of stock in as a result of prudential s conversion from a mutual company to a stock company 
in our efforts to dispose of non strategic  unproductive assets during a period of a soft economy and weak operating results  we sold the company owned airplane 
the disposition of property  plant and equipment in represents primarily the sale of the airplane at approximately book value 
the decrease in investments and advances in affiliated companies  at equity  represents increased cash distributions in excess of sunbelt s improved operating results which more than offset our share of sunbelt s repayment of its series o notes and related interest expense 
the increase in for investments and advances in affiliated companies  at equity  represents primarily our share of sunbelt s repayment of debt and related interest obligations 
in addition  we funded a portion of sunbelt s operating losses in in june  we acquired the stock of monarch for approximately million 
monarch was a privately held  specialty copper alloy manufacturer headquartered in waterbury  ct  with revenues of approximately million in it produces and distributes an array of high performance copper alloys and other materials used for applications in electronics  telecommunications  automotive products and building products 
as part of this acquisition  we acquired us patents 
we financed the purchase price through our credit facilities 
the purchase price exceeded the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired by million 
the acquisition has been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
the operating results of monarch  which have been included in the accompanying financial statements since the date of acquisition  were not material 
financing activities on january   we entered into a three year senior revolving credit facility of million  including a sublimit for letters of credit  which will expire on january  at december   we had million available under this senior revolving credit facility 
we issued million of letters of credit under a subfacility for the purpose of supporting certain long term debt  self insurance  and plant closure and post closure obligations 
under the facility  we may select various floating rate borrowing options 
it includes various customary restrictive covenants  including restrictions related to the ratio of debt to earnings before interest expense  taxes  depreciation and amortization leverage ratio and the ratio of earnings before interest expense  taxes  depreciation and amortization to interest expense coverage ratio 
in december  we sold million of senior notes with a maturity date of december  we used million from the proceeds of the offering to repay the million notes in june in march  we also refinanced million of tax exempt debt to create additional capacity under our revolving credit facility by eliminating the need for an equivalent amount of letters of credit 
in january  we renegotiated our million note due the maturity date was extended to and the interest rate was reduced from to  effective january  during and  we used million and million to repurchase million and million shares of our stock  respectively 
under programs previously approved by our board of directors  approximately  shares remained to be repurchased as of december  in march  we issued and sold  shares of common stock at a public offering price of 
net proceeds from this sale were approximately million 
during and  we issued  and  shares of common stock with a total value of million and million  respectively  to the contributing employee ownership plan 
these shares were issued to satisfy the investment in our common stock resulting from employee contributions  our matching contributions and re invested dividends 
the percent of total debt to total capitalization increased to at december   from at year end and was at year end the increase from year end was due primarily to the lower shareholders equity resulting from the restructuring charge and the accounting change under sfas no 
the decrease in from was due to the repayment of the million notes offset in part by the effect of the lower shareholders equity at december  dividends per common share were in  and total dividends paid on common stock amounted to million in  million in and million in the payment of cash dividends is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and will be determined in light of then current conditions  including our earnings  our operations  our financial conditions  our capital requirements and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors 
in the future  our board of directors may change our dividend policy  including the frequency or amount of any dividend  in light of then existing conditions 
liquidity and other financing arrangements our principal sources of liquidity are from cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  cash flow from operations and short term borrowings under our senior revolving credit facility 
we also have access to the debt and equity markets 
cash flow from operations is subject to change as a result of the cyclical nature of our operating results  which have been affected recently by economic cycles and resulting downturn in many of the industries we serve  such as automotive  electronics and the telecommunications sectors 
in addition  cash flow from operations is affected by changes in ecu selling prices caused by the changes in the supply demand balance of chlorine and caustic  resulting in the chlor alkali business having significant leverage on our earnings 
a per ecu selling price change equates to a million pretax profit change when we are operating at full capacity 
our current debt structure is used to fund our business operations and commitments from banks under our revolving credit facility are a source of liquidity 
as of december   we had long term borrowings  including the current installment  of million of which million was at variable rates 
we have entered into interest rate swaps on approximately million of our underlying debt obligations whereby we agree to pay variable rates to a counterparty who  in turn  pays us fixed rates 
annual maturities of long term debt are million in  million in  million in  million in  million in and a total of million thereafter 
we use operating leases for certain properties  such as railroad cars  distribution  warehousing and office space  data processing and office equipment 
leases covering these properties generally contain escalation clauses except for railroad cars based on increased costs of the lessor  for primarily property taxes  maintenance and insurance and have renewal or purchase options 
future minimum rent payments under operating leases having initial or remaining non cancelable lease terms in excess of one year at december  are as follows million in  million in  million in  million in  million in and a total of million thereafter 
assets under capital leases are not significant 
on december   we entered into a long term  sulfur dioxide supply agreement with alliance specialty chemicals  inc alliance  formerly known as rfc so  inc alliance has the obligation to deliver annually  tons of sulfur dioxide 
alliance owns the sulfur dioxide plant  which is located at our charleston  tn facility and is operated by us 
the price for the sulfur dioxide is fixed over the life of the contract and  under the terms of the contract  we are obligated to make a monthly payment of approximately million regardless of the amount of sulfur dioxide purchased 
commitments related to this agreement are approximately million per year for each year of through and a total of million thereafter 
we utilize a credit facility and standby letters of credit 
in january  we entered into a senior revolving credit facility with a group of banks 
this credit facility is described above under the caption  financing activities 
as of december   we did not have any outstanding borrowings under this credit facility 
at december   we had outstanding standby letters of credit of million 
these letters of credit were used to support certain long term debt  self insurance  and plant closure and post closure obligations 
in december  we registered million of securities with the securities and exchange commission whereby from time to time  we may issue debt securities  preferred stock and or common stock and associated warrants 
at december   the entire million was available for issuance 
on february   we issued and sold million shares of our common stock at a public offering price of 
net proceeds from the sale were approximately million and were used to make a million voluntary contribution to our pension plan 
the balance of the proceeds of million is available to retire maturing debt or for other corporate purposes 
the amount available under the million registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission was reduced by the proceeds from this issuance of securities 
we and our partner  polyone corporation polyone own equally the sunbelt chlor alkali partnership sunbelt joint venture 
we market all of the caustic soda production for the venture  while thousand tons of the chlorine production is required to be purchased by oxy vinyls a joint venture between oxychem and polyone based on a formula related to the market price of chlorine 
the construction of this plant and equipment was financed by the issuance of million of guaranteed senior secured notes due the sunbelt joint venture sold million of guaranteed senior secured notes due  series o  and million of guaranteed senior secured notes due  series g 
we refer to these notes as the sunbelt notes 
the sunbelt notes bear interest at a rate of per annum payable semiannually in arrears on each june and december we have guaranteed the series o notes  and polyone has guaranteed the series g notes  in both cases pursuant to customary guaranty agreements 
our guarantee and polyone s guarantee are several  rather than joint 
therefore  we are not required to make any payments to satisfy the series g notes guaranteed by polyone 
an insolvency or bankruptcy of polyone will not automatically trigger acceleration of the sunbelt notes or cause us to be required to make payments under our guarantee  even if polyone is required to make payments under its guarantee 
however  if the sunbelt joint venture does not make timely payments on the sunbelt notes  whether as a result of a failure to pay on a guarantee or otherwise  the holders of the sunbelt notes may proceed against the assets of the sunbelt joint venture for repayment 
if we were to make debt service payments under our guarantee  we would have a right to recover such payments from polyone 
beginning on december  and each year thereafter until maturity of the sunbelt notes in  our sunbelt joint venture is required to repay approximately million of the notes  of which approximately million is attributable to the series o notes 
after the payment of million on the series o notes in december  our guarantee of these notes was million at december  in the event our sunbelt joint venture cannot make any of these payments  we would be required to fund our half of such payment 
in certain other circumstances  we may also be required to repay the sunbelt notes prior to their maturity 
we and polyone have agreed that  if we or polyone intend to transfer our respective interests in the sunbelt joint venture and the transferring party is unable to obtain consent from holders of of the aggregate principal amount of the indebtedness related to the guarantee being transferred after good faith negotiations  then we and polyone will be required to repay our respective portions of the sunbelt notes 
in such event  any make whole or similar penalties or costs will be paid by the transferring party 
excluding our guarantee of the sunbelt notes described above  our long term contractual commitments  including the on and off balance sheet arrangements  consisted of the following payments due by year long term contractual commitments total less than year years years more than years in millions long term debt obligations a off balance sheet commitments noncancelable operating leases support agreement purchasing commitments raw materials utilities operating supplies total a excludes current maturities of long term debt of million which are classified within current liabilities 
the long term contractual commitments  shown above  except for our long term debt obligations  are not recorded on our consolidated balance sheet 
non cancelable operating leases and purchasing commitments are utilized in our normal course of business for our projected needs 
for losses that we believe are probable and which are estimable we have accrued for such amounts in our consolidated balance sheets 
in addition to the table above  we have various commitments and contingencies including defined benefit and postretirement health care plans as described below  environmental matters see environmental matters included in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  tax exposures see item additional factors that may affect future results tax audits  and litigation claims see item legal proceedings 
we have several defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans  as described in the pension and other postretirement benefit plans note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we fund these plans based on the minimum amounts required by law plus such amounts we deem appropriate 
on february   we made a voluntary contribution of million to the pension plan 
we now believe that only minimal contributions will be required until we have postretirement health care plans that provide health and life insurance benefits to certain retired and active employees and their beneficiaries  as described in the pension and other postretirement benefit plans note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
these plans are generally not pre funded and expenses are paid by us as incurred 
approximately million was paid in estimated payments are million for and million for these estimates are based on a growth rate of approximately due to the estimated impact of health care cost inflation and demographic changes 
we also have standby letters of credit with various financial institutions 
at december   we had million available under our senior revolving credit facility 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  sales and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
significant estimates in our consolidated financial statements include goodwill recoverability  environmental  restructuring and other unusual items  litigation  income tax reserves including deferred tax asset valuation allowance  pension  postretirement and other benefits and allowance for doubtful accounts 
we base our estimates on prior experience  facts and circumstances and other assumptions 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements 
goodwill effective january   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives be tested for impairment at least annually 
goodwill and other intangibles are reviewed annually in the fourth quarter and or when circumstances or other events indicate that impairment may have occurred 
the annual impairment test involves the comparison of the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount 
the fair value is determined based on a variety of assumptions including estimated future cash flows of the reporting unit  discount rates  and comparable company trading multiples 
based on our evaluation prepared in the fourth quarter of  no impairment charge was recorded 
environmental accruals for environmental matters are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated  based upon current law and existing technologies 
these amounts  which are not discounted and are exclusive of claims against third parties  are adjusted periodically as assessments and remediation efforts progress or additional technical or legal information becomes available 
environmental exposures are difficult to assess for numerous reasons  including the identification of new sites  developments at sites resulting from investigatory studies  advances in technology  changes in environmental laws and regulations and their application  the scarcity of reliable data pertaining to identified sites  the difficulty in assessing the involvement and financial capability of other potentially responsible parties and our ability to obtain contributions from other parties and the lengthy time periods over which site remediation occurs 
it is possible that some of these matters the outcomes of which are subject to various uncertainties may be resolved unfavorably to us  which could materially adversely affect our financial position or results of operations 
pension and postretirement plans we account for our defined benefit pension plans and non pension postretirement benefit plans using actuarial models required by sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  and sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  respectively 
these models use an attribution approach that generally spreads the financial impact of changes to the plan and actuarial assumptions over the service lives of the employees in the plan 
changes in liability due to changes in actuarial assumptions such as discount rate  rate of compensation increases and mortality  as well as annual deviations between what was assumed and what was experienced by the plan are treated as gains or losses 
gains and losses are amortized over the group s service lifetime  to the extent they fall outside of a corridor designed to dampen annual volatility 
the principle underlying the required attribution approach is that employees render service over their service lives on a relatively smooth basis and  therefore  the operations statement effects of pension or non pension postretirement benefit plans are earned in  and should follow  the same pattern 
one of the key assumptions for the net periodic pension calculation is the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  used to determine the market related value of assets 
the market related value of assets recognizes differences between the plan s actual return and expected return over a five year period 
the required use of an expected long term rate of return on the market related value of plan assets may result in a recognized pension income that is greater or less than the actual returns of those plan assets in any given year 
over time  however  the expected long term returns are designed to approximate the actual long term returns and  therefore  result in a pattern of income and expense recognition that more closely matches the pattern of the services provided by the employees 
as differences between actual and expected returns are recognized over five years  they generate gains and losses that are subject to amortization over the service life of the group  as described in the preceding paragraph 
we use long term historical actual return information  the mix of investments that comprise plan assets  and future estimates of long term investment returns by reference to external sources to develop the expected return on plan assets 
the discount rate assumptions used for pension and non pension postretirement benefit plan accounting reflect the rates available on high quality fixed income debt instruments on december of each year 
the rate of compensation increase is another significant assumption used in the actuarial model for pension accounting which we determine based upon our long term plans for such increases 
for retiree medical plan accounting  we review external data and our own historical trends for health care costs to determine the health care cost trend rates 
changes in pension costs may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions resulting from economic events 
for example  holding all other assumptions constant  a one hundred basis point decrease or increase in the assumed rate of return on plan assets would have increased or decreased  respectively  the pension cost by approximately million 
holding all other assumptions constant  a basis point decrease in the discount rate used to calculate pension costs for and the accumulated benefit obligation as of december  would have increased pension costs by million and the accumulated benefit obligation by million 
a basis point increase in the discount rate would have decreased pension costs by million and the accumulated benefit obligation by million 
new accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which became effective and was adopted by us on january  sfas no 
requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of this statement 
sfas no 
also requires that intangible assets with estimable useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values  and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
accordingly  we ceased amortizing goodwill totaling million as of january  we completed an initial impairment review of our goodwill balance during the second quarter of and determined an impairment charge was not required 
a subsequent impairment review was completed in the fourth quarter of this review determined that an impairment charge was not required 
if sfas no 
had been in effect for the year ended december   a net loss of million would have been million  representing the elimination of goodwill amortization 
for the year ended december  reported basic and diluted net loss per share of would have been in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
the associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  effective january   we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  which addresses financial accounting requirements for retirement obligations associated with tangible long lived assets 
on january   we recorded an after tax charge of million cents per share for estimated closure costs related to our former operating facilities million  pretax  certain hazardous waste units at operating plant sites million  pretax  and our indianapolis facility million  pretax which was shutdown in the first quarter of the after tax charge was recorded as the cumulative effect of an accounting change 
certain other asset retirement obligations associated with production technology and building materials have not been recorded because these retirement obligations have an indeterminate life  and accordingly  the retirement obligation cannot be reasonably estimated 
the ongoing annual incremental expense resulting from the adoption of sfas no 
amounted to million for at december   the change in fair value of the liability for asset retirements compared to the original value of the liability recorded at the date of adoption of sfas no 
was immaterial 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
addresses the financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement requires that one accounting model be used for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale whether previously held and used or newly acquired 
in addition  it broadened the presentation of discontinued operations to include more disposal transactions 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
at the time of adoption on january   this statement did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
addresses the accounting and reporting for costs associated with restructuring activities 
this new standard changes the timing of the recognition of restructuring charges 
liabilities for restructuring costs will be required to be recognized when the liability is incurred rather than when we commit to the plan 
sfas no 
is effective for restructuring activity initiated after december  we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
on january  see the description of our restructuring charge under the caption recent developments 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
this statement provides alternative methods of transition for an entity that voluntarily changes to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
it also amends the disclosure about the effects on reported net income of an entity s accounting policy decisions with respect to stock based employee compensation 
we continue to account for the cost of stock compensation in accordance with accounting principles board opinion apbo no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
we adopted the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
on january  in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement is effective for contracts entered into or modified after june  and for hedging relationships designated after june  this statement did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas no 
establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
it requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability 
many of those instruments were previously classified as equity 
the statement revises the definition of a liability to encompass certain obligations that a reporting entity can or must settle by issuing its own equity shares  depending on the nature of the relationship established between the holder and the issuer 
this statement is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may  and was effective for financial reporting in the third quarter of this statement did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
in december  the fasb revised sfas no 
 employers disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits an amendment of fasb statements no 
  and it revises employers disclosures about pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans required by sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  no 
 employers accounting for settlements and curtailments of defined benefit pension plans and for termination benefits  and no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions 
it retains the disclosure requirements contained in sfas no 
 employers disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits  which it replaces 
it requires additional disclosures to those in the original statement about the assets  obligations  cash flows  and net periodic benefit cost of defined benefit pension plans and other defined benefit postretirement plans 
the required information should be provided separately for pension plans and for other postretirement benefit plans 
this statement is effective for financial statements with fiscal years ending after december  the interim period disclosures required by this statement are effective for interim periods beginning after december  the disclosures required by this statement are included in the pension plans and retirement benefits note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
derivative financial instruments in  the fasb issued statement no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
it requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
the implementation date of this statement is effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after june  we adopted fasb no 
on january   and use hedge accounting treatment for substantially all of our business transactions whose risks are covered using derivative instruments 
sfas no 
requires that all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value 
the accounting treatment of changes in fair value is dependent upon whether or not a derivative instrument is designated as a hedge and  if so  the type of hedge 
for derivatives designated as a fair value hedge  the changes in the fair value of both the derivative and the hedged item are recognized in earnings 
for derivatives designated as a cash flow hedge  the change in fair value of the derivative is recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
ineffective portions are recognized currently in earnings 
unrealized gains and losses on derivatives not qualifying for hedge accounting are recognized currently in earnings 
we account for forward contracts to buy and sell foreign currencies under sfas no 
 foreign currency translation and futures contracts to reduce the impact of metal price fluctuations under sfas no 
 accounting for futures contracts 
we enter into forward sales and purchase contracts to manage currency risk resulting from purchase and sale commitments denominated in foreign currencies principally australian dollar and canadian dollar 
all of the currency derivatives expire within one year and are for united states dollar equivalents 
at december  and we had forward contracts to buy foreign currencies with face value of million and million  respectively  and no forward contracts to sell foreign currencies 
the fair market value of the forward contracts to buy at december  and approximated the carrying value 
the counterparty to the forward contracts is a major financial institution 
the risk of loss to us in the event of nonperformance by a counterparty would not be significant to our financial position or results of operations 
foreign currency exchange gains losses  net of taxes  were less than million in and less than million in and at december   we had open positions in futures contracts totaling million million 
if the futures contracts had been settled on december   we would have recognized a gain of million 
gains losses on futures contracts  net of taxes  were million in  million in  and million in we use cash flow hedges of certain raw materials and energy costs such as copper  zinc  lead and natural gas to provide a measure of stability in managing our exposure to price fluctuations 
we use interest rate swaps as a means of managing interest rates on our outstanding debt obligations 
these interest rate swaps are treated as fair value hedges 
at december  and  accumulated other comprehensive loss included a pretax gain decline in fair value of million and million  respectively 
in addition  the unfavorable ineffective portion of changes in fair value resulted in a million  million and million charge to earnings for the years ended december   and  respectively 
offsetting the above  there were assets totaling million million and liabilities of million million 
our foreign currency forward contracts and certain commodity derivatives did not meet the criteria of sfas no 
to qualify for hedge accounting 
the cumulative effect of items not qualifying for hedge accounting for was not material to earnings 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk in the normal course of our business operations due to our operations in different foreign currencies  our purchases of certain commodities  and our ongoing investing and financing activities 
the risk of loss can be assessed from the perspective of adverse changes in fair values  cash flows and future earnings 
we have established policies and procedures governing our management of market risks and the use of financial instruments to manage exposure to such risks 
certain raw materials and energy costs  namely copper  lead  zinc and natural gas used primarily in our metals and winchester segments products are subject to price volatility 
depending on market conditions  we may enter into futures contracts and put and call option contracts in order to reduce the impact of metal price fluctuations 
as of december   we maintained open positions on futures contracts totaling million million at december  
assuming a hypothetical increase in commodity prices  which are currently hedged  we would experience a million million at december  increase in our cost of inventory purchased  which would be offset by a corresponding increase in the value of related hedging instruments 
we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of our investing and financing activities 
investing activity is not material to our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flow 
our current debt structure is used to fund business operations and commitments from banks under our revolving credit facility are a source of liquidity 
as of december   we had long term borrowings of million million at december  of which million million at december  was issued at variable rates 
as a result of our fixed rate financings  we entered into floating interest rate swaps in order to manage interest expense and floating interest rate exposure to optimal levels 
we have entered into approximately million of such swaps  whereby we agree to pay variable rates to a counterparty who  in turn  pays us fixed rates 
in all cases the underlying index for the variable rates is six month london interbank offered rate libor 
accordingly  payments are settled every six months and the term of the swap is the same as the underlying debt instrument 
in december  we swapped interest payments on million principal amount of our senior notes to a floating rate at december  
in february and march  we swapped interest payments on million and million principal amount  respectively  of our senior notes to floating rates 
terms of these swaps set the floating rate at the end of each six month reset period 
therefore  the interest rates for the current period will be set on june  we estimate that the rates will be between and 
in march  we refinanced four variable rate tax exempt debt issues totalling million 
the purpose of the refinancings was to eliminate the need for letter of credit support that used our liquidity 
in order to manage interest expense and floating interest rate exposure to optimal levels  we swapped the fixed rate debt of the newly refinanced bonds back to variable rate debt through interest rate swaps 
the interest rate on the swap of million will be set on april  and is expected to be between and  while at december  interest rates on the swaps of million and million were and  respectively 
these interest rate swaps reduced interest expense  resulting in an increase in pretax profit of million in and a decrease in pretax loss of million and million in and  respectively 
if the actual change in interest or commodities pricing is substantially different than expected  the net impact of interest rate risk or commodity risk on our cash flow may be materially different than that disclosed above 
we do not enter into any derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes
