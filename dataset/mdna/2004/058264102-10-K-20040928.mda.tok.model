during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended june   the company recorded an impairment charge of  related to the goodwill associated with this business as the recorded value of this goodwill exceeded the assessment of its fair value made by the company 
for a further discussion  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the effects of this transaction on the consolidated financial statements are discussed below where significant 
for all periods presented  bka is reported as a discontinued operation and therefore is not included in the continuing operations of the company 
on september   the company sold substantially all of the assets of its roll handling group rhg 
the company recorded a loss of  and  on the sale of rhg in the fiscal years ended june  and  respectively 
additionally  during the fiscal year ended june   the company also exited the print on demand business pod 
as a result  the revenues and corresponding expenses attributable to rhg and the pod business are included in these consolidated financial statements only for the periods their operations were owned by the company 
the company recorded a loss of  on the sale of the pod business in the fiscal year ended june  the effects of these transactions on the consolidated financial statements are discussed below where significant 
net sales and operating loss of rhg and pod as included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements  were as follows for the fiscal years ended june net sales  operating loss   the company does not consider its business to be seasonal 
for two of the last five fiscal years  sales in the first six months were greater than the last six months 
during fiscal year ended june   sales during the first half of the year were impacted by a continued economic slowdown in the global printing and publishing industry 
during the second half of the year  a slow to gradual industry upturn coupled with successful sales and marketing initiatives increased second half sales 
the decline in net sales in the second half of the fiscal year ended june  was primarily due to the global printing and publishing industry economic slowdown 
the decline in net sales in the second half of the fiscal year ended june  was primarily due to the global printing and publishing industry economic slowdown following the events of september   and the disposition of the rhg 
the following schedule shows the company s net sales for such six month periods  adjusted for the treatment of bka as a discontinued operation over the last five fiscal years to reflect the comparison 
first six second six fiscal year months months forward looking statements except for the historical information contained herein  the following statements and certain other statements contained herein are based on current expectations 
similarly  the press releases issued by the company and other public statements made by the company from time to time may contain language that is forward looking 
these forward looking statements may be identified by the use of forward looking words or phrases such as forecast  believe  expect  intend  anticipate  should  plan  estimate  and potential  among others 
such statements are forward looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
the company cautions investors that any such forward looking statements made by the company are not guarantees of future performance and that actual results may differ materially from those in the forward looking statements 
some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are set forth in exhibit to this annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended june  critical accounting policies and estimates baldwin s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based on the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires baldwin to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  baldwin evaluates its estimates  including those related to product returns  bad debts  inventories  investments  asset impairments  intangible assets  income taxes  financing operations  warranty obligations  restructuring  pensions and other post retirement benefits  contingencies and litigation 
baldwin bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements 
baldwin maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of baldwin s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances could be required 
baldwin provides for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
while baldwin engages in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component suppliers  baldwin s warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from baldwin s estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
baldwin writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
baldwin records a valuation allowance to reduce its net deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
baldwin has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
in the event baldwin were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination is made 
likewise  should baldwin determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance would be recorded through a charged to income in the period such determination is made 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined using enacted tax rates for temporary differences between book and tax bases of assets and liabilities  as well as the effects of net operating losses carried forward in certain tax jurisdictions in which the company operates that may be utilized to offset future taxable income and similar tax credits carried forward that may be utilized to reduce future taxes payable 
the company records valuation allowances on deferred tax assets when appropriate to reflect the expected future tax benefits to be realized 
in determining the appropriate valuation allowances  certain judgments are made by management relating to recoverability of deferred tax assets  use of tax loss and tax credit carryforwards  levels of expected future taxable income and available tax planning strategies 
the assumptions in making these judgments are updated periodically by management based on current business conditions that affect the company and overall economic conditions 
these management judgments are therefore subject to change based on factors that include  but are not limited to changes in the profitability of the company s subsidiaries as well as for the company as a whole  the ability of the company to successfully execute its tax planning strategies and the accuracy of the company s estimate of the potential effect that changes in tax legislation  in the jurisdictions where the company operates  may have on the company s future taxable profits 
failure by the company to achieve forecasted taxable income or to execute its tax planning strategies may affect the ultimate realization of certain deferred tax assets 
factors that may affect the company s ability to achieve sufficient forecasted taxable income or successfully execute its tax planning strategies include  but are not limited to  increased competition  general economic conditions  a decline in sales or earnings  loss of market share  delays in product availability or changes in tax legislation 
in addition  baldwin recognizes reserves for contingencies when it becomes probable that such a contingency exists 
effective july   baldwin adopted financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
accordingly  baldwin no longer amortizes goodwill but instead tests goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level  at least annually  by determining the fair value of the reporting unit based on a discounted cash flow model  and comparing it with its book value 
if  during the annual impairment review  the book value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill is compared with the carrying amount of the unit s goodwill 
if the carrying amount exceeds the implied fair value  goodwill is written down to its implied fair value 
sfas requires management to estimate the fair value of each reporting unit  as well as the fair value of the assets and liabilities of each reporting unit  other than goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined as the difference between the fair value of a reporting unit  taken as a whole  and the fair value of the assets and liabilities of such reporting unit 
other long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
events which could trigger an impairment review include  among others  a decrease in the market value of an asset  the asset s inability to generate income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods  a decision to change the manner in which an asset is used  a physical change to the asset or a change in business climate 
baldwin calculates estimated future undiscounted cash flows  before interest and taxes  of the related operation and compares it to the carrying value of the asset in determining whether impairment potentially exists 
if a potential impairment exists  a calculation is performed to determine the fair value of the long lived asset 
this calculation is based upon a valuation model and discount rate commensurate with the risks involved 
third party appraised values may also be used in determining whether impairment potentially exits 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of a related reporting unit may require the company to record an impairment charge in the future 
the impairment review process requires management to make significant estimates and judgments regarding the future cash flows expected to result from the use and  if applicable  the eventual disposition of the respective assets 
the key variables that management must estimate in determining these expected future cash flows include sales volumes  sales prices  sales growth  production and operating costs  capital expenditures  working capital requirements  market conditions and other economic factors 
significant management judgment is involved in estimating these variables  and such estimates are inherently uncertain  however  the assumptions used are reasonable and consistent with the company s internal planning 
management periodically evaluates and updates the estimates based on conditions that influence these variables 
the assumptions and conditions for determining impairments of property  plant and equipment  goodwill and other intangible assets reflect management s best assumptions and estimates  but these items involve inherent uncertainties as described above  many of which are not under management s control 
as a result  the accounting for such items could result in different estimates or amounts if management used different assumptions or if different conditions occur in future accounting periods

management does not anticipate that such an event will occur  however  there can be no assurance that such an event will not occur

the march plan was expanded during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended june  the company recorded restructuring charges in the amounts of  and  for the fiscal years ended june  and  respectively related to the march plan 
the march plan reduced the company s worldwide cost base and strengthened its competitive position as a leading global supplier of auxiliary equipment to the printing and publishing industry 
prior to initiating the march plan  the company was managed in a decentralized manner through geographically dispersed autonomous business units 
given that many of the company s significant customers have reorganized on a global basis  management decided to restructure the company along functional lines on a global basis 
rather than have sales  product development and production activities at each decentralized business unit  the restructuring plan included the centralization of these activities 
product lines that were previously being produced in the emporia  kansas  usa  shelton  connecticut  usa  malmo  sweden  augsburg  germany  and lombard  illinois usa facilities  were consolidated with the production facilities located in augsburg  germany  emporia  kansas usa and malmo  sweden 
roll handling products previously produced in the rockford  illinois usa facility were to be consolidated with similar products designed and manufactured in the company s facilities in shanghai  china and amal  sweden 
these roll handling businesses were sold on september  the corporate headquarters was vacated and relocated to the shelton  connecticut usa facility in order to take advantage of the space created by the downsizing at that facility previously noted 
at june   the march plan is substantially completed with only  of facility lease termination costs to be paid through april the estimated total cash cost of the march plan is expected to be approximately  the march plan was expected to save the company approximately  annually following full implementation  however  approximately  of this savings was related to the divested rhg  which due to the sale of rhg  will not be realized under the march plan 
in august  in response to weak market conditions  the company announced additional restructuring activities the august plan  which reduced total worldwide employment by approximately accordingly  the company recorded an additional restructuring charge of approximately  during the fiscal year ended june  related to the august plan 
these reductions are expected to reduce operating costs by approximately  annually after the august plan is fully implemented 
in august  the company expanded the august plan and announced additional employment reductions of in the united states and in the united kingdom 
in addition  the company closed one of its offices in the united kingdom and is currently running its two separate business operations from one location in an effort to reduce certain redundancy costs 
the additional costs associated with the expansion of the august plan amounted to approximately net  at june   the august plan is substantially complete with approximately  of severance and lease payments remaining to be paid through the first half of during the company s fiscal year ended june   the german tax authority revised its position regarding the taxability of certain intercompany dividends 
the german federal court ruled on june   in a case with facts similar to the company s  that these dividends were in fact tax exempt 
as a result  several companies  including baldwin  which were assessed additional tax on dividends paid from through are no longer subject to the additional assessment
