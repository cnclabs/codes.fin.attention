item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to implement critical accounting policies and to make estimates that could significantly influence the results of operations and financial position 
the accounting policies and estimates  which significantly influence the results of the company s operations and its financial position  include revenue recognition policies  the valuation allowance for inventories and accounts receivable  evaluation of the impairment of and estimated useful lives of intangible assets  estimates for future losses on product warranties  and policies on accounting for stock based compensation 
revenue recognition the company derives revenues from three sources system sales  part sales  and services 
for system sales and parts sales  revenue is generally recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the contract price is fixed or determinable  title and risk of loss has passed to the customer  and collection is reasonably assured 
the company s sales are typically not subject to rights of return  and historically  sales returns have not been significant 
system sales that do not involve unique customer acceptance terms or new specifications or technology with customer acceptance provisions  and that involve installation services are accounted for as multiple element arrangements  where the larger of the contractual billing hold back or the fair value of the installation service is deferred when the product is delivered and recognized when the installation is complete 
in all cases  the fair value of undelivered elements  such as accessories ordered by customers  is deferred until the related items are delivered to the customer 
for certain other system sales that do involve unique customer acceptance terms or new specifications or technology with customer acceptance provisions  all revenue is generally deferred until customer acceptance 
revenue related to part sales is recognized when the parts have been shipped and title and risk of loss have passed to the customer 
deferred revenue is presented as unearned revenues in accrued liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 

table of contents products generally carry one year of warranty 
once the warranty period has expired  the customer may purchase an extended product warranty typically covering an additional period of one year 
extended warranty billings are generally invoiced to the customer at the beginning of the contract term 
revenue from extended warranties is deferred and recognized ratably over the duration of the contracts 
unearned maintenance and extended warranty revenue is included in deferred revenues in accrued liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
revenues from bill and hold sales are recognized in accordance with the criteria specified in sab in addition to the criteria above  the customer must request that the transaction be on a bill and hold basis and have a substantial business purpose for ordering the goods on that basis  there must be a reasonable  fixed schedule for delivery consistent with the business purpose  the company must no longer retain any performance obligations and the earnings process must be substantially complete  and the items sold must be segregated from the rest of the company s inventory and must be ready for final shipment to the customer 
accounts receivable the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the failure of its customers to make required payments and for estimated sales returns 
customers may not make payments or return products due to a variety of reasons including deterioration of their financial condition or dissatisfaction with the company s products 
management makes regular assessments of doubtful accounts and uses the best information available including correspondence with customers and credit reports 
if the company determines that there is impairment in the ability to collect payments from customers  additional allowances may be required 
however  the company does not believe that there is significant likelihood of this risk from a single customer  since the company does not have a significant credit consideration risk with any one single customer 
historically  the company has not experienced significant bad debt losses  but the company could experience increased losses if general economic conditions were to deteriorate  resulting in the impairment of a number of its customers ability to meet their obligations  or if management made different judgements or utilized different estimates for sales returns and allowances for doubtful accounts 
inventories inventories consist of electronic equipment and various components 
the company operates in an industry where technological advances or new product introductions are a frequent occurrence 
either one of these occurrences can make obsolete or significantly impair customer demand for a portion of the company s inventory on hand 
the company regularly evaluates its inventory and maintains a reserve for inventory obsolescence and excess inventory 
as a policy  the company provides a reserve for products with no movement in six months or more and which management determines  based on available market information  are no longer saleable 
the company also applies subjective judgment in the evaluation of the recoverability of the rest of its inventory based upon known and expected market conditions and company plans 
if the company s competitors were to introduce a new technology or product that renders a product sold by the company obsolete or unnecessary  it could have a significant adverse effect on the company s future operating results and financial position 
the company had changes in required reserves in recent periods due to discontinuation of certain product lines and obsolescence related to new product introductions  as well as declining market conditions 
as a result  the company incurred net inventory charges of approximately  during fiscal and approximately  during fiscal intangible assets the company s intangible assets primarily include product patents  trade names and trademarks 
the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards fas no 
 on january   as required 
accordingly  the company annually reviews the recoverability and estimated useful lives of other intangible assets for impairment 
during the quarter ended september   the company completed an evaluation of the future prospects of certain products and determined to discontinue manufacturing  sales  service  and support for certain sample preparation  gas chromatography  and ion analyzer products 
the company came to these decisions because purchase components are no longer available for support of those products  and sales volume for those products no longer represent a viable business opportunity for the company 
as a result of these decisions  the company has determined that certain intangible assets amounting to approximately  were impaired and written off by a charge to expense for the period ending december  the impaired intangible assets are from prior acquisitions and consist primarily of acquired trade names and patents that are no longer used  resulting from the discontinuation of products 
product warranties products are sold with warranties ranging from days to one year  and extended warranties may be purchased for some products 
estimated expenses associated with these warranties are provided for in the accompanying financial statements at the time of revenue recognition 
the company makes estimates of these costs based on historical experience and on various other assumptions including historical and expected product failure rates  material usage  and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage  or service delivery costs differ from estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
stock based compensation the company elected to account for fixed award stock options and non employee directors options under the provisions of apb opinion no 
accounting for stock issued to employees 
as such  no compensation cost has been recorded in the financial statements relative to these options 
the company utilizes the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of these options for disclosure purposes 

table of contents stock granted to non employee directors are accounted for in accordance with fas no 
accounting for stock based compensation 
accordingly  directors stock is recorded as compensation expense at estimated fair value on the date the stock is earned by the director 
results of operations overview net income increased  or  during to  compared to  in  primarily due to increases in revenues from gc components and systems  minicams air monitoring systems  and the introduction of new products combined with decreases in impairment charges and other costs 
the company continued to pursue its strategy of maintaining a presence in the environmental testing market  while seeking out opportunities in other markets  such as the pharmaceutical  petrochemical  semiconductor  refrigerant  and food and beverage markets 
the company continued to face intense competition for its products  and the markets for the company s products have not fundamentally improved as uncertainty about the us economy continues 
nevertheless  the company maintained its commitment to its plan to increase its research and development activities to develop potential new products to take advantage of opportunities in the homeland defense and security market 
net income decreased  or during to  compared to  in  primarily due to lower revenues  lower sales of higher gross margin products  and increased spending on research and development 
expenses from impairments of intangible assets increased in  due to impairments of intangible assets relating to past acquisitions and the discontinuation of manufacturing and support for certain products 
the following table summarizes the results of the company s operations for each of the past three years 
all percentage amounts were calculated using the underlying data in thousands 
for the years ended december  percentage percentage increase increase decrease decrease total net revenues total cost of revenues gross profit selling  general  and administrative expenses research and development expenses impairment of intangible assets operating income other income income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income diluted earnings per share net revenues compared to total net revenues for the year ended december  increased or  to  compared to  for the same period of  primarily due to increases in revenues from gc components and systems  minicams air monitoring systems  and the introduction of new products 
revenues from gas chromatography gc components and systems increased in  compared to  due to the introduction of a new purge and trap sample concentrator  the eclipse  during the third quarter of  increases in sales of selective detectors sold along with minicams air monitoring systems  and an increase in sales of the company s custom configured gc systems 
the company continues to face intense competition from manufacturers of mass spectrometers  gc systems  and other components 
effective december   the 
table of contents company entered a one year original equipment manufacturers oem supply agreement with agilent technologies  inc formerly hewlett packard company  previously a value added reseller var agreement  which provided for sales and marketing cooperation 
the company now competes directly with agilent and others for sales of gc components and systems in the environmental testing and other markets 
revenues from minicams air monitoring systems increased in  compared to  as sales for systems used to detect chemical warfare agents in demilitarization programs increased  and as export sales increased 
also  during  approximately  of  in purchase orders granted to the company during and by parsons infrastructure technology group  inc parsons  for minicams was cancelled due to changes in the scope of the equipment needed 
parsons and the company negotiated a cancellation fee of approximately  total revenues recognized since the beginning of this order were approximately  through the quarter ended june   including the cancellation fee 
the company considers the order completed 
revenues from total organic carbon toc analyzers were flat in  compared to  due to competition from products with nitrogen detecting capabilities  which the company s product does not possess 
revenues from continuous flow analyzers declined in due to increased competition internationally and the continued emergence of a competitive technology called discrete analyzers 
discrete analyzers do not perform all analyses as do continuous flow analyzers  but they impact the demand for continuous flow analyzers 
discrete analyzers are becoming the preferred technique for those applications it will perform 
revenues from gel permeation chromatography gpc products decreased in  compared to  primarily due to the discontinuation of the soxtherm product 
revenues from microwave digestion products were flat in  compared to revenues from beverage analyzers increased in  compared to  due to shipment of the new lan  which began in the third quarter 
the company s success in penetrating the beverage analyzer market will be dependent upon the company becoming a qualified supplier to major domestic soft drink producers 
since the company s purchase of gac  sales of the lan have been disappointing 
revenues from refrigerant air monitor products  a product line obtained in the purchase of gac  increased in compared to however  sales levels continue to fall short of our expectations 
the company is considering alternatives to improve the product s performance 
net revenues from customer services  including rentals of the company s products  decreased in  compared to  due to a decrease in new product installations and factory repair services performed  partially offset by an increase in customer training and on site repair services performed 
export revenues increased in to  compared to  in sales of air monitoring systems  gc systems and components  toc analyzers and beverage analyzers all increased  primarily due to increased demand for organic volatile and inorganic nutrient monitoring solutions within the environmental and industrial client base  although difficult local economic conditions and competition continue to affect export sales 
despite the increase in net revenues for the year ended december   compared to  improvement in the performance of some products is still offset by the below expectations performance of certain other products 
the company continues to encounter strong competition and continues to seek improved distribution strategies for certain products in some channels and markets 
furthermore  the company has not seen or experienced a fundamental improvement in the purchasing and capital spending activity in many of the markets that the company serves 
uncertainty about the direction of the us and other global economies has resulted in prolonged purchasing decisions  and has suppressed purchasing and capital spending activity in many of the markets that the company serves  in particular  industrial and government customers 
in addition  the environmental instruments market in which the company competes has been flat or declining over the past several years 
the company has identified a number of strategies it believes will allow it to grow its business despite this decline  including the acquisition of complementary businesses or product lines  developing new products  developing new applications for its technologies  and strengthening its presence in selected geographic markets 
no assurance can be given that the 
table of contents company will be able to successfully implement these strategies  or if successfully implemented  that these strategies will result in growth of the company s business 
compared to total net revenues for the year ended december  decreased to  compared to  in  due to lower sales of minicams  toc analyzers  ion analyzers  sample preparation products  beverage analyzers and refrigerant monitors  offset by higher revenues from gc components and systems  service and rentals 
revenues from gas chromatography gc components and systems increased in due to an increase in gc sample introduction products and gc systems  which more than offset a decrease in gc detectors 
also contributing to the increase in revenues was a customer deciding to purchase products that were under an operating lease 
revenues from shipments of minicams decreased in  compared to  as shipments were higher in under a contract with bechtel national  inc bechtel 
under the parson s purchase order  revenues from shipments were approximately  in parsons granted a series of purchase orders totaling approximately  for minicams  and subsequently approximately  of the remaining order was cancelled due to changes in the scope of the equipment needed 
revenues from minicams increased in due to deliveries under a contract with bechtel 
during  the company announced it received a purchase order amounting to approximately  later revised to  from bechtel 
the company recognized revenues from deliveries under this contract in of approximately  and completed deliveries under this contract in recognizing revenues of approximately  in revenues from total organic carbon toc analyzers decreased in  compared to  due to lower sales domestically  which more than offset an increase in international sales 
revenues from ion analyzers decreased in  compared to  due to competition internationally and the emergence of a competitive technology domestically 
the competitive technology referred to as discrete analyzers does not perform all analyses as does ion analyzers  and it is too early to know to what extent it will impact the demand for ion analyzers 
revenues from gel permeation chromatography gpc products decreased in  compared to  due to the narrowing of the products offered to increase focus on new higher margin products 
revenues from microwave digestion products decreased in  compared to  due to a decline in sales to both domestic and international markets 
revenues from beverage analyzers decreased in  compared to  due to delays in the completion of a new product design 
revenues from refrigerant air monitor products decreased in  compared to  due to lower market demand 
net revenues from providing customer services  including rentals of the company s products  decreased in  compared to the decrease is primarily attributable to improvements in the management of the company s service resources and efforts to increase the company s service coverage area 
revenues derived from rentals decreased due to a customer choosing to make early payment on operating leases and to negotiate the purchase of the equipment  effectively negotiating the purchase of a significant portion of the company s rental inventory 
the company still maintains a rental inventory and offers it for rent to customers who need substitute equipment while their equipment is being serviced or who wish to temporarily use the company s equipment 
export revenues increased in to  due to increased demand for organic volatile and inorganic nutrient monitoring solutions within the environmental and industrial client base  although difficult local economic conditions and competition continue to affect sales in those regions 
sales to latin america decreased in  compared to  due to continuing adverse local economic conditions and incomplete sales coverage in that region

the company s plan to increase product development activities most likely will result in an increase in r d expenses in dollar terms and as a percentage of revenues during the next months 
increases in r d efforts may include outsourcing and funding certain developments outside the company  such as the arrangement with iii 
the company expects that such expenses will fluctuate quarterly based on the specific activity during the quarter but cannot be certain that such fluctuating expenditures  together with fluctuating revenues  will not result in a quarterly or annual operating loss 
impairment of intangible assets there were no charges for impairments of intangible assets in compared to  in  and none in during the quarter ended september   the company completed an evaluation of the future prospects of certain products and determined to discontinue manufacturing  sales  service  and support for certain sample preparation  gas chromatography  and ion analyzer products 
the company came to these decisions because purchase components were no longer available for support of those products  and sales volume for those products no longer represented a viable business opportunity for the company 
as a result of these decisions  the company determined that certain intangible assets amounting to approximately  were impaired 
the impaired intangible assets were from prior acquisitions and consisted primarily of acquired trade names and patents that were no longer used 
in  the company evaluated its remaining intangible assets  consisting only of patents  and determined that no impairment charge was necessary  as all of its patents were used in products that were currently generating revenues

the increase in operating cash flows in was primarily due to an increase in accrued liabilities 
cash flow used in investing activities in of  an increase of  compared to  in  was primarily due to the investment in iii and the purchase of other investments 
the company has a policy of investing surplus cash in low risk  short term investments of varying maturities or investment grade preferred stock to maximize return while maintaining investment risk at a minimum 
the company invested a portion of its available cash in those investments during and to maintain its liquidity 
in december  the company invested  in a series a preferred share offering by iii 
the investment was part of an arrangement to develop and gain access to technology for use in potential new products and not as an income earning asset  such as the company s other investment grade preferred stocks 
iii is a development stage company whose shares are not traded on a national exchange  and the preferred share offering in which the company participated was part of iii s second stage financing 
iii s current operations primarily consist of research and development activities in the field of mass spectrometry  and as such do not generate income from operations 
accordingly  the company expects its investment in iii preferred shares to lose some of its value in the short run as iii incurs operating losses until it begins generating income from operations 
in addition to the investment in iii preferred shares  the company will provide up to an additional  for the completion by iii of certain product developments according to agreed upon milestones over the next months 
the company is entitled to recover such funding through product purchase or license fee credits from iii in the future once iii begins production of a product 
the investment in iii preferred stock is not recoverable through product purchase or license fee credits  and the company considers to be a permanent investment in iii 
although it might be riskier than internal development  the company believes that the investment in iii is consistent with its strategy to significantly increase investment in new product development 
the company believes that it has the financial resources to maintain its investment in iii and expects to fund its commitment to iii achieving product development milestones from cash provided by operations or other liquid investments that it owns 
cash flow used in investing activities in of  a increase over  was primarily due to the purchase of investments for the company s excess cash

any further decline in our customers markets or in general economic conditions would likely result in a further reduction in demand for our products and services and could harm our results of operations and  therefore  harm the primary source of our cash flows 
the company invests excess funds generated from operations in money market funds and investment grade securities rated by moody s or standard poor s 
excess funds generated from operations may be used to acquire other businesses or new products  invest in product r d activities  or to develop markets for the company s products 
the company may engage in discussions with third parties to acquire new products or businesses or to form strategic alliances and joint ventures 
these types of transactions may require additional funds from sources other than the company s current operations to complete them 
the company believes that such funds would come from traditional institutional debt financing or other third party financing 

table of contents in the second quarter of  the company announced a plan to undertake a more extensive research  development  and engineering effort with the intent of developing products with innovative technologies  which we believe will stimulate demand in a market demonstrating slow or no growth 
the major goals in our efforts are to position the company to serve new markets  including homeland defense  increase our position in the beverage market  and broaden our product offering in the process analytical instruments market 
the company s plan to increase research and development will increase r d expenses in dollar terms and as a percentage of revenues during the next months 
such expenses will include hiring additional personnel  purchase of supplies and component products for experimental use  outsourcing certain work  and using consulting services 
we expect that such expenses will fluctuate quarterly based on the specific activity during the quarter 
increases in r d efforts may also result in investments in the external development of other third parties in which whose funding the company may participate 
such fluctuating expenditures  together with fluctuating revenues  may result in a quarterly or annual operating loss 
we believe we have sufficient cash on hand and funds from operations to maintain our commitment to this plan 
since  the company has repurchased an aggregate of  shares at an average purchase price of per share  pursuant to the company s stock repurchase program 
repurchases in the amount of  shares were made during  and the company may purchase up to an additional  shares under the current stock repurchase program 
management may seek approval from the company s board of directors to expand this program in the future if it believes repurchases continue to be in the best interests of the company 
expansion of this program would also be funded from cash from operations 
the company does not expect to declare a dividend in the foreseeable future

all statements  other than statements of historical facts  included in this form k that address activities  events  or developments that the company expects  believes  or anticipates will or may occur in the future  are forward looking statements 
these statements are based on certain assumptions and analyses made by the company in light of its experience and its perception of historical trends  current conditions  expected future developments  and other factors it believes are appropriate in the circumstances 
such statements are subject to a number of assumptions  risks  and uncertainties  many of which are beyond the control of the company 
investors are cautioned that any such statements are not guarantees of future performance and that actual results or developments may differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
in connection with the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of  the company wishes to caution readers that the following important factors  among others  in some cases have affected  and in the future could affect  the company s actual results and could cause its actual results in and beyond to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by  or on behalf of  the company 
the actions taken in response to the recent slowdown in demand for some of the company s products and services could have long term adverse effects on the company s business 
certain of the company s analytical instruments have been experiencing lower revenues due to cancelled customer orders or increased competition 
to scale back the company s operations and decrease its expenses in response to this decrease in demand for certain products and services and decrease in its revenue  it has reduced its workforce  cut back on the use of temporary workers  and reduced discretionary spending 
there are several risks inherent in the company s efforts to transition to a new cost structure 
these include the risk that the company will not be able to reduce expenditures quickly enough to restore profitability and may have to 
table of contents undertake further restructuring initiatives 
in addition  there is the risk that cost cutting initiatives will impair the company s ability to effectively develop and market products and remain competitive in the industries in which it competes 
each of the above measures could have long term effects on the company s business by reducing its pool of technical talent  decreasing or slowing improvements in its products  making more difficult for it to respond to customers  limiting its ability to increase production quickly if and when the demand for its products increases and limiting its ability to hire and retain key personnel 
these circumstances could cause the company s earnings to be lower than they otherwise might be 
the company s investment in intelligent ion  inc iii may lose some or all of its value if iii does not generate income from operations or if iii s research development is not successful 
the company entered into a strategic alliance with intelligent ion  inc iii to better position the company with technology it needs to provide leading edge products for use in homeland defense and security and other markets 
the alliance includes an investment of  in a series a preferred share offering by iii and in addition to the investment in iii preferred shares  the company will provide up to an additional  for the completion by iii of certain product developments according to agreed upon milestones over the next months 
iii is a development stage company whose shares are not traded on a national exchange  and the preferred share offering in which the company participated was part of iii s second stage financing 
iii s current operations primarily consist of research and development activities in the field of mass spectrometry  and as such do not generate income from operations 
accordingly  the company expects its investment in iii preferred shares to lose some of its value in the short run as iii incurs operating losses until it begins generating income from operations 
iii s research and development involves experimental technology in the field of mass spectrometry and there is a risk that iii s efforts might not result in a commercially viable product 
the company recognizes this investment might represent higher risk than an internal development  but we believe the risk is appropriate  considering it provides access to intellectual property and development skills that we do not possess 
the company s increased r d efforts may not result in products that are successful in the marketplace 
during  the company announced its plan to increase spending on r d for potential new products 
the company feels that to maintain its market share for existing products and to gain market share in new markets such as homeland defense and security that it must increase its r d spending 
the company expects its r d expense to be higher than its historical average 
such r d spending may involve new technology or updates of existing technology 
there is no assurance such r d efforts to develop new technology will be successful  or that if r d efforts do yield new products  that once introduced such products will be successful in the marketplace 
the company s operating results and financial condition could be harmed if the industries  into which it sells its products  continue to demand fewer products similar to products sold by the company 
the current economic downturn has resulted in reduced purchasing and capital spending in many of the markets that we serve worldwide 
in particular  industrial and government customers are currently in a downward cycle characterized by diminished product demand  excess manufacturing capacity and the erosion of average selling prices 
we are uncertain how long the current downturn will last 
the terrorist attacks on september  may have exacerbated this downturn or caused it to linger 
any further decline in our customers markets or in general economic conditions would likely result in a further reduction in demand for our products and services and could harm our consolidated financial position  results of operations  cash flows  and stock price 
in addition  the environmental instrument markets in which the company competes have been flat or declining over the past several years 
the company has identified a number of strategies it believes will allow it to grow its business despite this decline  including acquiring complementary businesses  developing new applications for its technologies  and strengthening its presence in selected geographic markets 
no assurance can be given that the company will be able to successfully implement these strategies  or if successfully implemented  that these strategies will result in growth of the company s business 

table of contents the company s success is highly dependent upon implementation of its acquisition strategy 
certain businesses acquired by the company within the past five years have produced net operating losses or low levels of profitability 
businesses the company may seek to acquire in the future may also be marginally profitable or unprofitable 
in order for any acquired business to achieve the level of profitability desired by the company  the company must successfully change the acquired companies operations and improve their market penetration 
no assurance can be given that the company will be successful in this regard 
in addition  promising acquisitions are difficult to identify and complete for a number of reasons  including competition among prospective buyers and the need for regulatory approvals  including antitrust approvals 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to complete pending or future acquisitions 
in order to finance such acquisitions  it may be necessary for the company to raise additional funds either through public or private financing 
debt financing  if available  may be on terms that are unfavorable to the company and equity financing may result in significant dilution to the company s shareholders 
the company s acquisitions may result in financial results that are different than expected 
in the normal course of business  the company engages in discussions with third parties relating to possible acquisitions  strategic alliances  joint ventures  and divestitures 
as a result of such transactions  the company s financial results may differ from the investment community s expectations in a given quarter 
in addition  acquisitions and strategic alliances may require the company to integrate a different company culture  management team  and business infrastructure 
the company may have difficulty developing  manufacturing  and marketing the products of a newly acquired company in a way that enhances the performance of its combined businesses or product lines to realize the value from expected synergies 
depending on the size and complexity of an acquisition  the company s successful integration of the entity depends on a variety of factors including the retention of key employees  the management of facilities and employees in separate geographic areas  the retention of key customers  and the integration or coordination of different research and development  product manufacturing and sales programs  and facilities 
all of these efforts require varying levels of management resources that may divert the company s attention from other business operations 
if the company does not realize the expected benefits or synergies of such transactions  its consolidated financial position  results of operations  and stock price could be negatively impacted 
technological change could cause the company s products to become non competitive or obsolete 
the market for the company s products and services is characterized by rapid and significant technological change and evolving industry standards 
new product introductions responsive to these factors require significant planning  design  development  and testing at the technological  product  and manufacturing process levels  and may render existing products and technologies noncompetitive or obsolete 
there can be no assurance that the company s products will not become noncompetitive or obsolete 
in addition  industry acceptance of new technologies developed by the company may be slow to develop due to  among other things  existing regulations that apply specifically to older technologies and the general unfamiliarity of users with new technologies 
consolidation in the environmental instrument market and changes in environmental regulations could adversely affect the company s business 
one of the important markets for the company s products is environmental analysis 
during the past five years  there has been a contraction in the market for analytical instruments used for environmental analysis 
this contraction has caused consolidation in the companies serving this market 
such consolidation may have an adverse impact on certain businesses of the company 
in addition  most air  water  and soil analyses are conducted to comply with federal  state  local  and foreign environmental regulations 
these regulations are frequently specific as to the type of technology required for a particular analysis and the level of detection required for that analysis 
the company develops  configures  and markets its products to meet customer needs created by existing and anticipated environmental regulations 
these regulations may be amended or eliminated in response to new scientific evidence or political or economic considerations 
any significant change in environmental regulations could result in a reduction in demand for the company s products 
reduced capital spending of the company s customers could harm its business 
the company s customers include various government agencies and public and private research institutions  which accounted for of the company s sales in  as well as pharmaceutical and chemical companies and laboratories 
the capital spending of these entities can have a significant effect on the demand for the company s products 
such spending is based on a wide variety of factors  including the resources available to make purchases  the spending priorities among various types of equipment  public policy  political trends  and the effects of different economic cycles 
any decrease in capital spending by any of the customer groups  which account for a significant portion of the company s sales  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 

table of contents the company s results of operations are dependent on its relationship with agilent technologies  inc agilent 
on september   agilent notified the company that the value added reseller var agreement between the company and agilent would not be renewed upon its expiration on november  company sales under the var agreement  which include both agilent and company components  are estimated to have been approximately and of total company revenues for the years and  respectively 
agilent cited the increasing competitive nature of the company s products with their products as the reason for not renewing the var agreement 
the var agreement provided for sales and marketing cooperation  whereas the original equipment manufacturers oem agreement does not provide for marketing cooperation  and therefore  the company and agilent will compete for the same business 
on december   the company entered into an oem agreement with agilent  subsequently renewed in december  and no assurances can be made that agilent will renew the oem agreement  nor that the company will sustain sales levels in the future under the agilent oem agreement 
as the company continues to evaluate its alternatives  it may be determined that continuing the oem agreement is not its best strategy 
the company anticipates that sales under its oem agreement with agilent will not be consistent with the company s sales in prior years under its previous var agreement 
the oem agreement is renewable on an annual basis  and there is no assurance that it will be renewed in future years 
failure to renew the agreement would place at risk a substantial part of the company s sales of gc systems and would have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations 
compliance with governmental regulations could subject the company to significant expense 
the company has agreements relating to the sale of products to government entities and is subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government 
the company is also subject to investigation for compliance with the terms of government contracts and non compliance although inadvertently may result in legal proceedings or liability  which may be significant 
several of the company s product lines are subject to significant international  federal  state  local  health  safety  packaging  product content  and labor regulations 
in addition  many of the company s products are regulated or sold into regulated industries  requiring compliance with additional regulations in marketing these products 
significant expenses may be incurred to comply with these regulations or remedy past violations of these regulations 
any failure to comply with applicable government regulations could also result in cessation of portions or all of the company s operations  impositions of fines  and restrictions on the ability to carry on or expand operations 
environmental contamination caused by ongoing operations could subject the company to substantial liabilities in the future 
some of the company s manufacturing processes involve the use of substances regulated under various international  federal  state  and local laws governing the environment 
the company could be subject to liabilities for environmental contamination  and these liabilities may be substantial 
although the company s policy is to apply strict standards for environmental protection at its sites inside and outside the united states  even if not subject to regulations imposed by foreign governments  the company may not be aware of all conditions that could subject it to liability 
compliance with governmental regulations may cause the company to incur significant expenses  and failure to maintain compliance with certain governmental regulations may have a negative impact on the company s business and results of operations 
the company s business is subject to various significant international  federal  state  and local  health and safety  packaging  product content  and labor regulations 
these regulations are complex  change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time 
for example  the company s chemical analysis products are used in the drug design and production processes to test compliance with the toxic substances control act  the food  drug  and cosmetic act  and similar regulations 
therefore  the company must continually adapt its chemical analysis products to changing regulations 
the company may be required to incur significant expenses to comply with these regulations or to remedy violations of these regulations 
any failure by the company to comply with applicable government regulations could also result in cessation of its operations or portions of its operations  product recalls or impositions of fines and restrictions on its ability to carry on or expand its operations 
in addition  because many of the company s products are regulated or sold into regulated industries  it must comply with additional regulations in marketing its products 
the company s products and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies  like the international standards organization  as well as regulation of other agencies such as the u 
s 
federal communications commission 
the company also must comply with work safety rules 
if the company fails to adequately address any of these regulations  its business will be harmed 

table of contents economic  political  and other risks associated with international sales could adversely affect the company s results of operations 
sales outside the u 
s 
accounted for approximately of the company s revenues in the company expects that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of the company s revenues in the future 
sales to the company s international customers are subject to a number of risks including interruption to transportation flows for delivery of finished goods to its customers  changes in foreign currency exchange rates  changes in political or economic conditions in a specific country or region  trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements  negative consequences from changes in tax laws  differing protection of intellectual property  and unexpected changes in regulatory requirements 
there can be no assurance that any of these factors will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
the company faces competition from third parties in the sale of its products 
the company encounters and expects to continue to encounter intense competition in the sale of its products 
the company believes that the principal competitive factors affecting the market for its products include product performance  price  reliability  and customer service 
the company s competitors include large multinational corporations and operating units of such corporations 
most of the company s competitors have substantially greater financial  marketing  and other resources than those of the company 
therefore  they may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements  or to devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products than the company 
in addition  competition could increase if new companies enter the market or if existing competitors expand their product lines or intensify efforts within existing product lines 
there can be no assurance that the company s current products  products under development or ability to discover new technologies will be sufficient to enable it to compete effectively with its competitors 
the company could incur substantial costs in protecting and defending its intellectual property  and loss of patent rights could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
the company holds patents relating to various aspects of its products and believes that proprietary technical know how is critical to many of its products 
proprietary rights relating to the company s products are protected from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that they are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are maintained in confidence as trade secrets 
there can be no assurance that patents will issue from any pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to the company or that the claims allowed under any issued patents will be sufficiently broad to protect the company s technology 
in the absence of patent protection  the company may be vulnerable to competitors who attempt to copy the company s products or gain access to its trade secrets and technical know how 
proceedings initiated by the company to protect its proprietary rights could result in substantial costs to the company 
there can be no assurance that competitors of the company will not initiate litigation to challenge the validity of the company s patents  or that they will not use their resources to design comparable products that do not infringe upon the company s patents 
there may also be pending or issued patents held by parties not affiliated with the company that relate to the company s products or technologies 
the company may need to acquire licenses to  or contest the validity of  any such patents 
there can be no assurance that any license required under any such patent would be made available on acceptable terms or that the company would prevail in any such contest 
the company could incur substantial costs in defending itself in suits brought against it or in suits in which the company may assert its patent rights against others 
if the outcome of any such litigation is unfavorable to the company  the company s business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
in addition  the company relies on trade secrets and proprietary technical know how that it seeks to protect  in part  by confidentiality agreements with its collaborators  employees  and consultants 
there can be no assurance that these agreements will not be breached  that the company would have adequate remedies for any breach  or that the company s trade secrets will not otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors 
the company s fluctuating quarterly operating results may negatively impact stock price 
the company cannot reliably predict future revenue and profitability  and unexpected changes may cause adjustments to the company s operations 
since a high proportion of the company s costs are fixed  due in part to significant cost to maintain customer support  research and development and manufacturing costs  relatively small declines in revenues could disproportionately affect the company s quarterly operating results  and in turn  cause declines in the company s stock price 
other factors that could affect quarterly operating results include lower demand for and market acceptance of products due to adverse changes in economic activity or conditions in the company s major markets  lower selling prices due to competitive pressures  unanticipated delays  problems  or increased costs in the introduction of new products or manufacture of existing products  changes in the relative portion of revenue represented by the company s various products and customers  and competitors announcements of new products  
table of contents services or technological innovations 
any one of these factors  individually or any combination  could cause the stock price of the company to fluctuate greatly 
although inflation has not had a material impact on the company s operations  there is no assurance that inflation will not adversely affect its operations in the future 
the company believes that competition based on price is a significant factor affecting its customers buying decisions 
there is no assurance that the company can pass along cost increases in the form of price increases or sustain profit margins that have been achieved in prior years 
the prices of some components purchased by the company have increased in the past several years due in part to decreased volume 
certain other material and labor costs have also increased  but the company believes that these increases are approximately consistent with overall inflation rates 
competing companies are larger  better trained  and they cover larger areas geographically 
failure of suppliers to deliver sufficient quantities of parts in a timely manner could cause the company to lose sales and  in turn  adversely affect the company s results of operations 
the company may be materially and adversely impacted if sufficient parts are not received in time to meet manufacturing requirements 
factors that may result in manufacturing delays include certain parts may be available only from a single supplier or a limited number of suppliers  key components may become unavailable and may be difficult to replace without significant reengineering of the company s products  suppliers may extend lead times  limit supplies  or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors 
should the company reduce purchase orders to its suppliers and its sales increase rapidly  its suppliers may not react quickly enough or may refuse to expedite shipments of parts to use because of the company s previous reduction in requirements 
if sufficient parts are not received in time to meet manufacturing requirements  then the company will not be able to meet its obligations to deliver goods to its customers and may cause the company to lose sales 
the company s inability to adjust its orders for parts or adapt its manufacturing capacity in response to changing market conditions could adversely affect the company s earnings 
the company s earnings could be harmed if it is unable to adjust its orders for parts to respond to market fluctuations 
in order to secure components for the production of products  the company may enter into non cancelable purchase commitments with vendors  or at times make advance payments to suppliers  which could impact its ability to adjust its inventory to declining market demands 
prior commitments of this type have resulted in an excess of parts as demand for certain of the company s products has decreased 
if the demand for the company s products continues to decrease  it may experience an excess of parts and be forced to incur additional charges 
certain parts may be available only from a single supplier or a limited number of suppliers 
in addition  suppliers may cease manufacturing certain components that are difficult to substitute without significant reengineering of the company s products 
suppliers may also extend lead times  limit supplies  or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors 
additionally  because the company cannot immediately adapt its production capacity and related cost structures to rapidly changing market conditions  when demand does not meet the company s expectations  its manufacturing capacity will likely exceed its production requirements 
if the company suffers loss to our facilities or distribution system due to catastrophe  our operations could be seriously harmed 
our facilities and distribution system are subject to catastrophic loss due to fire  flood  terrorism  or other natural or man made disasters 
our production facilities and corporate headquarters are located in college station  texas  and our production facilities in alabama 
if any of these facilities were to experience a catastrophic loss  it could disrupt our operations  delay production  shipments  and revenue and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility 
although we carry insurance for property damage and business interruption  we do not carry insurance or financial reserves for interruptions or potential losses arising from earthquakes or terrorism 
if we are required to account for options under our employee stock plans as a compensation expense  our net income and earnings per share would be significantly reduced 
there has been an increasing public debate about the proper accounting treatment for employee stock options 
currently we record compensation expense only in connection with option grants that have an exercise price below fair market value 
for option grants that have an exercise price at or in excess of fair market value  we calculate compensation expense and disclose the impact on net loss earnings and net loss earnings per share in a footnote to the consolidated financial statements 
it is possible that future laws and regulations will require us to record the fair market value of all stock options as compensation expense in our consolidated statement of operations 
note  organization and summary of significant accounting policies  of the consolidated financial statements included in this report reflects the impact that such a change in 
table of contents accounting treatment would have had on our net income and earnings per share if it had been in effect during the past three years 
if our operating results do not improve in the long term  we may be required to establish a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets 
we evaluate whether our deferred tax assets can be realized and assess the need for a valuation allowance on an ongoing basis 
realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income 
a valuation allowance would be recorded if it was more likely than not that some or all of our deferred tax assets would not be realized before they expire 
if we establish a valuation allowance  we might record a tax expense in our statements of income  which would have an adverse impact on our net income
