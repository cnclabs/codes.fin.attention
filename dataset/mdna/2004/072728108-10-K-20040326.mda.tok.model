until november   baycorp s principal wholesale electricity generation and trading assets were its equity interests in great bay and little bay 
the business of great bay and little bay consisted of managing their joint ownership interests in the seabrook project and the sale in the wholesale power market of their share of electricity produced by the seabrook project 
neither great bay nor little bay had operational responsibility for the seabrook project 
great bay was a party to one long term power contract for approximately mws of great bay s share of the seabrook project capacity 
during the period that it owned interests in seabrook  great bay s business strategy was to utilize unit contingent and firm forward sales contracts to maximize the value of its mw power supply 
in october  baycorp created two new subsidiaries  great bay power marketing  inc and baycorp ventures  llc 
gbpm was created to hold the purchased power agreement that great bay had with unitil and arrange for the power supply to satisfy the agreement 
effective january   gbpm assumed great bay s obligations under that contract which was amended  effective november  to provide for mw of firm non unit specific power and holds the letter of credit established to secure gbpm s obligations under the unitil contract 
see item pre november and current business purchased power agreements 
baycorp created bcv to serve as a vehicle through which the company can make investments following the seabrook sale and the expiration of the company s tender offer 
in december  baycorp formally dissolved great bay and little bay 
in september  baycorp created a third subsidiary  great bay hydro corporation  which has entered into a purchase and sale agreement  dated as of october   with citizens communications company to acquire the generating facilities in vermont owned by the vermont electric division of citizens 
the generating facilities include an operating hydroelectric facility of approximately mws located in newport  vermont  diesel engine generators totaling approximately mws located in newport  vermont and non operating hydroelectric facilities in troy  vermont and west charleston  vermont 
under the terms of the purchase and sale agreement  great bay hydro will pay a nominal purchase price and citizens will transfer the hydroelectric facilities and related acres of real property to great bay hydro and has agreed to indemnify great bay hydro for the reasonably anticipated costs of complying with the requirements of the new operating license issued by ferc on november  these plants will provide a physical hedge for meeting a portion of baycorp s supply obligations under the long term contract to supply megawatts to unitil 
great bay hydro has received ferc approvals for the transfer of the facilities and has applied for and is awaiting approval from the state of vermont for the transfer of the facilities and the designation of great bay hydro as an ewg 
great bay hydro must also seek approval for ewg status from ferc

forward power prices increased during primarily due to increases in the forward price of natural gas 
power generating plants that use natural gas as a fuel source are increasingly on the margin and therefore setting the forward price of power in nepool 
accordingly  the price of power in nepool is highly dependent on the price of natural gas 
other non cash charges included compensation expense of approximately  for the variable accounting of certain employee stock options and an accrual of approximately  for estimated payments to mr 
getman and mr 
callendrello see expenses 
a decrease of approximately  in prepaids and other assets was primarily attributable to a partial settlement of post seabrook closing adjustments of approximately  and was offset in part by an increase in prepayments and other assets of approximately  to set up a deposit at nepool to meet its financial assurance policy 
an increase in accounts payable and accruals of approximately  was primarily attributable to the payable for purchased power of approximately  and the additional accrual for executive incentive payments referred to above 
accrued taxes decreased approximately  primarily due to the payment of  made in march for the estimated new hampshire tax liability 
the company filed its tax return in september and is requesting a refund of approximately  from the state of new hampshire for overpayment of state income taxes 
the state of new hampshire department of revenue administration nhdra began an examination of the company s  and tax returns in december the review has not been completed  and the requested refund has not been paid to the company 
the nhdra has not proposed any adjustments to the returns 
the company believes that positions taken with respect to tax matters are valid and supportable 
however  given the current uncertainty as to the outcome of the audit  the company has not recorded the expected refund as of december  miscellaneous and other liabilities decreased approximately  primarily due to a  reduction in certain post closing seabrook liabilities that were estimated at the time of the seabrook closing 
less than more than contractual obligations total one year years years years office space lease   seabrook liability   total   following the sale of seabrook and the completion of the company s tender offer  the company has evaluated and pursued a number of energy related investment opportunities 
the company continues to focus on the acquisition of electric generating assets  an area where it feels that it has a solid understanding of the market and the value of and risks related to those assets 
baycorp is interested in acquiring either complete or partial ownership of generating facilities 
there are a large number of generating assets currently offered for sale 
these plants consist of both merchant and contracted facilities using a variety of fuels and located both domestically and internationally 
there is also growing competition for the acquisition of these assets  with a number of new participants entering the market  including private equity funds  hedge funds  insurance companies and investment banks 
the company is focused on pursuing opportunities and assets that it believes will provide a return to stockholders commensurate with the risks 
generally  the company has targeted the following assets merchant plants in regions with developed wholesale power markets such as new england  new york  pjm and texas that are fueled by means other than natural gas eg hydro  coal  nuclear  international assets that have long term off take contracts with sovereign governments or sovereign backed utilities  and either merchant or contracted renewable assets that qualify for renewable energy credits 
the company believes that renewable energy will become an increasingly important part of our national energy policy and is seeking to position itself to take advantage of this major national and global trend 
baycorp is also considering other energy related investments and the further development of houstonstreet 
baycorp s first acquisition in the post seabrook period will be the acquisition of the generating plants owned by citizens communications through baycorp s wholly owned subsidiary  great bay hydro see part recent developments great bay hydro corporation 
great bay hydro has entered into a purchase and sale agreement  dated as of october   with citizens to acquire all of the generating facilities in vermont owned by the vermont electric division of citizens 
the generating facilities include an operating hydroelectric facility of approximately mws located in newport  vermont  diesel engine generators totaling approximately mws located in newport  vermont and non operating hydroelectric facilities in troy  vermont and west charleston  vermont 
under the terms of the purchase and sale agreement  great bay hydro will pay a nominal purchase price and citizens will transfer the hydroelectric facilities and related acres of real property to great bay hydro 
citizens has agreed to indemnify great bay hydro for the reasonably anticipated costs of complying with the requirements of the new operating license issued by the ferc on november  these plants will provide a physical hedge for meeting a portion of baycorp s supply obligation under the long term contract to supply mws to unitil 
great bay hydro has received ferc approvals for the transfer of the facilities and has applied for and is awaiting approval from the state of vermont for the transfer of the facilities and the designation of great bay hydro as an ewg 
great bay hydro must also seek approval for ewg status from ferc 
it is anticipated that the closing of this transaction will occur in the second quarter of the company may pursue investments that would require additional equity or debt financing 
the company believes that such financing is available  but there can be no assurance that the company would be successful in obtaining such financing 
if the company is not successful in obtaining additional financing  the company may not be able to pursue certain investment alternatives 
in such case  the company may be limited to opportunities that it can pursue given its current resources 
the income from the company s current and near term expected operating businesses the unitil ppa and great bay hydro acquisition is insufficient to pay current operating expenses 
if the company is unsuccessful in identifying and making additional investments  the company may seek alternative strategies  including liquidation 
if the company decides to liquidate  cash may be reserved to pay for the expected expenses of liquidation and other liabilities of the company  including potential runoff insurance policies and severance obligations that would be triggered 
the company reduced the number of employees from eleven as of december  to nine as of december  and to an equivalent of six full time employees as of december  as a cost savings measure  the company relocated in march to smaller office space in portsmouth  new hampshire and reduced the salaries of mr

certain factors that may affect future results this annual report contains forward looking statements 
for this purpose  any statements contained in this report that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward looking statements 
without limiting the foregoing  the words believes  anticipates  plans  expects  intends and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
there are a number of important factors that could cause the results of baycorp and or its subsidiaries to differ materially from those indicated by such forward looking statements 
these factors include  without limitation  those set forth below and elsewhere in this report 
business opportunities and development 
as described in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources  the company has evaluated and pursued energy related investment opportunities  has focused on the acquisition of electric generating assets and is considering other energy related investments and the further development of houstonstreet 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to identify business opportunities that it believes to be attractive  or that it will be successful in pursuing any such opportunities  in view of factors that include competition for the acquisition of assets  the fact that many energy related activities are subject to government regulatory requirements  the company s limited resources and the probable need to obtain debt or equity financing in order to pursue certain opportunities 
moreover  the acquisition of generating facilities owned by citizens communications described in this annual report cannot be assured  and the closing of that transaction is dependent upon the satisfaction of numerous conditions  including obtaining all required regulatory approvals 
history of losses 
baycorp reported an operating loss in and reported operating income for and prior to  baycorp had never reported an operating profit for any year since its incorporation 
liquidity need 
as of december   baycorp had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents  restricted cash and short term investments 
the company believes that such cash  together with the anticipated proceeds from the sale of electricity by gbpm will be sufficient to enable the company and its wholly owned subsidiaries to meet their cash requirements in the direction of the company s business and circumstances  foreseen or unforeseen  may cause cash requirements to be materially higher than anticipated and the company or its wholly owned subsidiaries may be required to raise additional capital  either through a debt financing or an equity financing  to meet ongoing cash requirements 
there is no assurance that the company or its subsidiaries would be able to raise such capital or that the terms on which any additional capital is available would be acceptable 
moreover  the company s need to raise additional capital in order to pursue certain opportunities may affect the company s competitive position with respect to such opportunities 
if additional funds are raised by issuing equity securities  dilution to then existing stockholders will result 
primary reliance on a single asset 
baycorp s principal source of revenue is gbpm s contract to sell power to unitil 
accordingly  baycorp s results of operations significantly depend on the successful and continued performance under the unitil contract 
risks associated with post closing obligations from the seabrook sale 
on november   great bay and little bay sold their interests in the seabrook project 
in the purchase and sale agreement for the seabrook project  the buyer  fpl energy seabrook agreed to indemnify great bay and little bay against certain claims specified in the agreement 
great bay and little bay also agreed to indemnify fpl energy seabrook against certain claims specified in the purchase and sale agreement 
if a claim is brought against great bay and little bay for which fpl energy seabrook is required to indemnify great bay and little bay but fpl energy seabrook fails to provide such indemnity  or if great bay is required to indemnify fpl energy seabrook pursuant to the agreement  then the company s results of operations could be materially different 
in addition  great bay and little bay have deposited funds into an escrow account for the payment of seabrook expenses incurred prior to closing 
the amount escrowed was based on an estimate of those expenses 
a final reconciliation of and termination of all such escrow accounts is scheduled to occur in the second quarter of in accordance with the terms of the escrow agreements among the selling owners 
although the company expects the amounts accrued for final closing adjustments as of december  to be adequate  should actual expenses be greater than the amount escrowed  additional funds will be required 
extensive government regulation 
the electric energy industry is subject to extensive regulation by federal and state agencies 
gbpm is subject to the jurisdiction of the ferc and  as a result  is required to file with ferc all contracts for the sale of electricity 
ferc s jurisdiction also includes  among other things  the sale  lease  merger  consolidation or other disposition of facilities  interconnection of certain facilities  accounts  service and property records 
risks related to houstonstreet 
houstonstreet s revenues depend on continued and expanded use of internet based wholesale energy trading platforms 
electronic trading of wholesale energy is new and evolving  and thus may not achieve widespread market acceptance or emerge as a sustainable business 
in addition  houstonstreet will need to enhance trading liquidity in order to increase and sustain revenues 
as a technology dependent business  houstonstreet s business could suffer due to computer or communications systems interruptions or failures  technological change or adverse competitive developments 
further  as electronic commerce evolves  federal  state and foreign agencies could adopt regulations covering issues such as user privacy  content and taxation of products and services 
if enacted  government regulations could materially adversely affect houstonstreet s business 
although houstonstreet currently is not aware that it infringes any other patents  it is possible that houstonstreet s technology infringes patents held by third parties 
if houstonstreet were to be found infringing  the owner of the patent could sue houstonstreet for damages  prevent houstonstreet from making  selling or using the owner s patented technology or could impose substantial royalty fees for those privileges 
if any of the foregoing risks materialize  or other risks develop that adversely affect houstonstreet  or if houstonstreet fails to grow its revenues and net income  baycorp could lose all of the value of its investment in houstonstreet 
critical accounting policies preparation of the company s financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities and revenues and expenses 
note to the consolidated financial statements is a summary of the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the company s financial statements 
the following is a discussion of the most critical accounting policies used historically by the company 
decommissioning great bay and little bay recognized a liability based on the present value of the estimated future cash outflows required to satisfy their obligations using a risk free rate 
as of december   the estimated undiscounted cash outflows for great bay and little bay  for decommissioning  based on the november ndfc study  with decommissioning expenditures starting in and being completed in  was million  which discounted at an average rate of  over the funding period  to december   represented a liability of million 
as of december  and  the decommissioning liability was as a result of the sale of seabrook and fpl energy seabrook s assumption of all decommissioning liability on november  great bay and little bay accreted their share of the seabrook project s decommissioning liability 
the accretion was a non cash charge and recognized their liability related to the closure and decommissioning of the nuclear plant in current year dollars over the licensing period of the plant 
the non cash accretion charge recorded in the accompanied consolidated statements of income was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
stock options the company accounts for its stock option plans under accounting principles board opinion no 
and related interpretations for options issued prior to  and as such no compensation cost had been recognized for options granted at fair market value that had not been modified 
in prior years  the company repriced certain options  accelerated the vesting of others  made limited recourse loans for certain individuals to exercise options and issued contingent options 
the company recorded compensation expense related to these options 
on august  the company announced that it would expense the fair value of all stock options granted beginning january  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
awards under the company s plans vest over periods ranging from one to three years 
therefore  the cost related to stock based employee compensation included in the determination of net income for and differs from that which would have been recognized if the fair value based method had been applied to all awards since the original effective date of statement in october  the company issued  non qualified options pursuant to the non statutory stock option plan 
these options have an exercise price of and vested upon the closing of the sale of the seabrook project 
the company recorded compensation expense related to contingent and repriced options of   and  for  and  respectively 
in april and july  the company issued  and  options  respectively  pursuant to the stock option plan and the non statutory stock option plan 
these options have an exercise price of 
the company accounts for these options using the fair value method and recorded compensation expense in of  for these options 
seabrook outage costs the company s historical operating results and the comparability of these results on an interim and annual basis have been directly impacted by the operations of the seabrook project  including the cyclical refueling outages generally months apart as well as unscheduled outages 
during outage periods at the seabrook project  great bay and little bay had no electricity for resale from the seabrook project and consequently no related revenues 
therefore the impact of outages on the company s and great bay s and little bay s results of operations and financial position were  at times  materially adverse 
great bay and little bay accrued for the incremental costs of the seabrook project s scheduled outages over the periods between those outages 
however  great bay and little bay continued to expense the normal seabrook operating and maintenance expenses as incurred 
therefore  the company incurred losses during scheduled outage periods as a result of the combination of the lack of revenue and the recognition of normal recurring operation and maintenance costs as well as the continuing depreciation of the utility plant 
principles of consolidation baycorp s consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company and all its subsidiaries 
the company had a joint ownership interest in seabrook  a  megawatt nuclear generating unit 
the company recorded in its financial statements its proportional share of seabrook s assets  liabilities and expenses 
the company consolidates all majority owned and controlled subsidiaries and applies the equity method of accounting for investments between and 
all significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated 
all sales of subsidiary stock are accounted for as capital transactions in the consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of arb no 
 as amended by fin r 
the interpretation requires that a company consolidate the financial statements of an entity that cannot finance its activities without outside financial support  and for which that company provides the majority of support 
the company has deemed that its investment  houstonstreet  is not a variable interest entity 
therefore  the company will not consolidate houstonstreet

the company currently utilizes forward and spot market purchases to maximize the value of the unitil ppa 
forward purchase contracts and the unitil ppa are recorded at fair value 
the initial fair value gain of the unitil ppa has been deferred and is being amortized over the life of the agreement
