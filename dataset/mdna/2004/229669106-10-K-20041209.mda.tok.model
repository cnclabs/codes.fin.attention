consolidated overview fiscal sales grew to million from million in  an increase of  and the third consecutive year of double digit sales growth 
the sales represented a increase over sales of million 
all of the sales growth in came from the defense segment  while transportation systems sales were at the same level in as in despite an expected million decrease in revenues from the prestige contract in london 
nearly million of the growth in fiscal defense sales came from the training systems business we acquired at the end of see the segment discussions following for further analysis of segment sales 
operating income grew to million in compared to million in  an increase of 
operating income in had increased by over operating income of million 
the increase in operating income came from both segments  with the larger increase coming from defense 
transportation operating income was boosted million in the fourth quarter by the settlement of a dispute with a subcontractor on the prestige contract  but this had virtually no impact on operating income for the full year  due to costs incurred in the first three quarters 
operating income was also impacted in the fourth quarter by a million provision for a legal matter that arose from a contract with the government of iran in while we are continuing to dispute the validity of the claim  an october court decision in a related case casts doubt on the likelihood we will ultimately prevail 
see note to the financial statements for further details 
while the original contract to which this matter relates was a defense systems contract  we have classified this loss provision separately in our segment reporting due to the remote connection of this matter to our current defense operations since the events in question occurred more than years ago 
see the segment discussions following for further details of segment operating results 
net income was nearly the same in as in  at million per share compared to million per share 
net income in had grown by over net income of million per share 
however  there are important differences in how the net income was generated between the three years 
approximately million  after taxes  of the net income was from a gain on the sale of a life insurance policy in the third quarter 
the loss provision for the iran legal matter described above reduced net income in the fourth quarter by approximately million after taxes 
as discussed more fully under transportation systems segment below  we settled a dispute with a former subcontractor  resulting in the former subcontractor agreeing to pay us damages  the impact of which was to approximately offset the costs of pursuing our claim 
approximately million  after taxes  of the net income was from gains on the sale of two parcels of real estate in the second and third quarters  which were no longer used in the business 
net income in had included a fourth quarter tax benefit of million 
the following table summarizes the effects on our net income of these items and provides additional insight into our results of operations in millions earnings before certain identified items gains on sale of assets provision for litigation iran claim settlement prestige claim settlement costs prestige tax benefit facility closing costs net income as reported without the items described above  net income would have grown by in compared to and by about from to these increases were the result of increased sales volume from the defense segment and improved operating performance from both segments  with the biggest increases coming from the defense business 
gross margins improved to in compared to in and in this improvement resulted primarily from the settlement reached with a subcontractor on the prestige contract  the impact of which is described more fully in the transportation segment section following 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses were of sales compared to in and in higher sg a expenses in the defense segment came primarily from the business acquired in september and due to an increase in selling expenses incurred in pursuit of new business opportunities 
in the transportation systems segment the sg a expense increase came primarily from legal  consulting and engineering support costs incurred related to a contractual dispute with a former subcontractor  which has now been settled 
fiscal sg a spending decreased as a percentage of sales due to an increase in sales volume without a significant increase in sg a spending 
research and development r d costs continued to be incurred primarily in connection with customer funded activities in  while company sponsored r d spending remained at about the same level as in we do not rely heavily on company sponsored r d  as most of our new product development occurs in conjunction with the performance of work on our contracts 
the amount of contract required product development activity increased in to million  compared to million in and million in  however  these costs are included in cost of sales as they are directly related to contract performance 
as mentioned above  we realized a gain from the sale of a split dollar life insurance policy in of million after applicable income taxes of approximately million 
the gain from the sale of the policy was primarily realized in the third quarter  with a minor amount realized in the fourth quarter 
interest and dividend income decreased in both and  because of lower interest rates  and due to lower cash balances available for investment 
other income increased in primarily due to a gain on the sale of marketable securities after having decreased in due to lower rental income 
our effective tax rate for was of pretax income compared to in and in the overall effective rate increased from to due to a higher tax gain on the sale of the life insurance policy and reduced tax credits 
income tax expense in was unusually low due to a million tax benefit realized during the fourth quarter 
our effective tax rate could be affected in future years by  among other factors  the mix of business between the us and foreign jurisdictions  our ability to take advantage of available tax credits  and audits of our records by taxing authorities 
in light of recent tax legislation that provides incentives for repatriation of capital to the us  we are currently evaluating the amount of capital we will require in europe in the future and whether we might be able to take advantage of the provisions of the legislation by reinvesting some amount of capital in the united states 
this decision will depend  in part  on the outcome of contract proposals we have submitted in europe that is not yet known 
our policy is to not provide for us taxes on earnings from foreign operations because our intention is to grow our business in those foreign locations and we  therefore  consider the earnings to be indefinitely reinvested 
however  if we were to decide to reinvest a portion of this capital in the u 
s  we believe the related tax liability would not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
defense segment years ended september  in millions defense segment sales communications and electronics training systems government services defense segment operating income communications and electronics training systems government services defense sales in grew to million from million in  a increase 
growth in defense sales was from to of the increase in sales  nearly million came from the simulation systems division ssd acquired in september  which is included with training systems in the foregoing table 
not including ssd  overall defense sales increased from to this growth came despite a decrease of nearly million in training systems sales  other than from ssd  due primarily to a decline in air combat training sales from the level 
activity on the major new air combat training contract we won in was still in the early stages in  while several previous air combat training contracts were substantially completed in the first quarter of miles sales also decreased in  but this decrease was more than offset by higher sales from ground combat training systems 
training systems sales increased in because of new orders for miles products and air combat training systems 
communications and electronics business unit sales were also higher in because of a contract we won in to develop a common data link subsystem cdls for the us navy 
communications and electronics sales decreased by in from the level 
government services sales increased by million in  a increase 
more than half of this increase came from a service contract at the joint readiness training center in louisiana  due to a high level of activity related to the conflict in iraq 
future sales volume from this contract will depend on customer requirements which are yet to be determined 
even without this one contract  government services sales grew by in  after having increased by in operating income in the defense segment was up by in  following an increase of in higher operating income came from all three business units  with the most significant increase in coming from government services 
operating income in communications and electronics improved in over primarily because was impacted by a loss provision of million related to our investment in new communications technology for the navy cdls contract 
in addition  communications and electronics operating income was bolstered in by performance on another data link contract with a foreign customer which has now been substantially completed 
avionics products  such as personnel locator systems  generated higher operating income in  however  this was offset by operating losses from the surveillance receiver product line 
operating income in communications and electronics improved in over the level because of improved performance from the surveillance receiver product line 
the newly acquired ssd added million to training systems operating income in without ssd  training systems operating income would have been up slightly from the level despite lower sales volume 
higher operating income from ground combat training systems in more than offset the profit impact of lower sales volume from air combat training systems and miles products 
operating income in from training systems increased substantially over the level due to increased sales and higher profit margins from both air combat training systems and miles products 
training systems operating income was also impacted in by cost growth of nearly million on a contract which included the development of new ground combat training technology  however  this was offset by the reversal of a reserve related to the miles contract that was no longer required due to the settlement of remaining contractual and financial issues 
government services operating income improved in compared to primarily because of higher sales volume but also because of improved performance from operations and maintenance o m contracts 
the o m business recorded a loss in on one particular contract which experienced cost growth in  but was completed early in operating income as a percentage of sales in returned to the level it had been in transportation systems segment transportation systems sales remained at the same level in as at million  after having increased by in transportation systems sales in north america and australia and transportation service sales in europe were considerably higher in  however  these increases were offset by an expected million decrease in revenues from the prestige contract between and we view this decrease in reliance on a single customer as a positive trend for the transportation segment and anticipate further growth of the transportation business outside of the uk 
in addition  we anticipate additional orders in the uk for the next several years related to the rollout of the oyster tm card and other system enhancement opportunities 
the long term prospects for growth in the uk market remain very strong as well as for the european continent  north america and the far east 
the sales increase in over was the result of new contracts awarded in recent years in north america  as well as sales growth from the prestige contract 
transportation systems operating income increased  from million in to million in after having increased in from the level of million 
the increased operating income in resulted from higher sales and operating income on service contracts in europe and from a contract in the far east 
profit margins on certain contracts in north america were unfavorably affected by our investment in the development of new software technologies for common fare collection solutions and the difficulties inherent in the integration of these new technologies into actual fare collection systems 
this integration effort is continuing and  although no significant further growth in these costs is anticipated  profit margins on these contracts will continue to be low through fiscal in october  we reached a settlement agreement with a former subcontractor on the prestige contract  whereby the subcontractor paid us million approximately million for unspecified damages  but which we view as partial reimbursement of costs we had incurred due to their failure to perform 
the former subcontractor had previously filed a claim against us alleging wrongful termination  but these charges were dropped as a part of the settlement agreement 
although this payment did not cover all of the additional costs we incurred  we believe that it was in our best interests to avoid a protracted legal battle which could cost more than any additional amount we might eventually have recovered 
although this payment was not received until october  after the end of our fiscal year  accounting principles related to long term contract accounting require that this type of subsequent event be accounted for in the previous period if the event is known prior to the issuance of the financial statements 
therefore  we recorded a receivable from the former subcontractor as of september   which is included in trade and other receivables on the consolidated balance sheet  and reduced cost of sales for this project  thereby increasing the overall profit margin 
the result of recording this settlement was to increase operating income in the fourth quarter by approximately million  based on the percentage completion of the project as of september  the remaining profit improvement from this settlement will be realized throughout the remaining year life of the contract as the percentage completion increases 
in pursuing this claim settlement  we incurred approximately million during fiscal for legal and consulting fees and for our own employees time diverted to this effort 
therefore  the net effect on operating income in from this settlement and the associated costs was minimal  although operating income in the fourth quarter was increased by approximately million 
backlog funded backlog increased in to billion from the level of billion  while total backlog remained at billion 
the biggest increase in defense funded backlog was in training systems  due to contracts we won for ground combat training systems in the far east and middle east and a simulator contract with the us government 
in transportation systems we reclassified backlog related to the final five years of the seventeen year prestige contract to the funded category due to the completion of the initial system in we believe the system completion substantially reduces any risk that the customer might cancel the last five years of the contract  which they would have been entitled to do if they were not satisfied with our performance 
although transportation systems total backlog decreased somewhat in  we continue to pursue several large transportation system opportunities which we anticipate being awarded to us  thereby increasing backlog in fiscal not reflected in the backlog amounts below  because they are idiq contracts  are two significant defense contracts with the us government that were awarded during one is a year contract with a ceiling value of million to develop and deliver the next generation of rangeless air to air and air to ground combat training systems 
we have received some small orders under this contract and expect that the customer will order most of the systems specified by this contract from us over the next nine years 
the second major idiq contract awarded during is one where cubic and four other companies are performing research and development services for the us government aimed at reducing threats to national defense and homeland security from weapons of mass destruction 
the five companies will share a total of up to billion in task orders and to date we have received some small orders 
the initial term of this contract is five years  with an option for a five year extension 
september  in millions total backlog transportation systems defense communications and electronics training systems government services total defense total funded backlog transportation systems defense communications and electronics training systems government services total defense total the difference between total backlog and funded backlog represents options under multiyear service contracts 
funding for these contracts comes from annual operating budgets of the us government and the options are normally exercised annually 
options for the purchase of additional systems or equipment are not included in backlog until exercised  nor are idiq contracts until an order is received 
business acquisition in late september  we acquired all the shares of orlando  florida based ecc international corporation ecc for million 
most of the purchase price was paid in fiscal  however  approximately million was not paid until october and is included in our cash flows for fiscal in august  we acquired a small automated parking systems company in montreal  canada  called traf park  for million in cash 
this is a strategic acquisition which we believe will augment our product offerings to large regional transit customers 
new accounting standards revised fasb interpretation no 
fin r  consolidation of variable interest entities  was issued in december and became effective in the quarter ended march  to date  we have not invested in any variable interest entities for which we are the primary beneficiary and  therefore  we have concluded that the adoption of fin r had no impact on our financial position or results of operations 
liquidity and capital resources growth in unbilled accounts receivable resulted in negative cash flows from operations in both and of million and million  respectively  compared to positive cash flows from operations of million in operating cash flows from the defense segment were positive in all three years  while transportation systems operating cash flows have been negative the past two years 
defense operating cash flows in were only slightly positive despite the growth in operating income  due to an increase in working capital in support of the sales increase 
although the sales growth caused accounts receivable to grow by million in  the level of working capital utilized in our defense business compares favorably to benchmark data from similar defense companies and we consider the level of receivables in defense to be within the normal range 
conversely  growth in unbilled accounts receivable over the past two years in the transportation business has resulted in the negative cash flows from operations 
in fiscal  million of the million increase in accounts receivable was from the prestige project 
however  not including the receivable related to the claim settlement  accounts receivable from the prestige project decreased nearly million in in addition to the million received subsequent to september  from the claim settlement  we expect cash flows from this contract to be positive for the remaining life of the contract 
other than the prestige project  four contracts in north america account for the majority of the increase in accounts receivable and the negative cash flows in and milestone payments on all of these contracts have been delayed due to the difficulties we have had with the integration of new software technologies into these fare collection systems 
we had previously expected to be past these difficulties by this time and continue to anticipate completion of the remaining tasks and collection of the delayed milestone payments in fiscal the collectibility of these amounts is not in question and the additional costs associated with the delay have been taken into account in the calculation of the percentage completion of these contracts 
we have classified certain unbilled accounts receivable balances as noncurrent because we do not expect to receive payment within one year from the balance sheet date 
of this balance  million and million at september  and  respectively  related to the prestige project 
in addition to the million increase in accounts receivable reflected on the consolidated statement of cash flows for  current and long term accounts receivable increased by another million from september  to september  this is principally due to an increase from foreign currency translation 
as described in the acquisitions section above  cash in the amount of million was used in for the remaining amount due from the acquisition of ecc in september and for a small acquisition made in august cash flows from other investing activities in included a million cash receipt from the sale of the split dollar life insurance policy described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in  investing activities included million in proceeds from two sales of real estate which were no longer used in the business 
in addition  a net amount of million was used to purchase marketable securities  which were available for sale as of september   and million was invested in property  plant and equipment 
during  we obtained a mortgage on our newly refurbished facility in the uk and used the proceeds to repay million of short term borrowings made in fiscal in the uk 
we borrowed million in new zealand in on a short term basis to fund working capital growth in our defense subsidiary in that country and borrowed million in the us on a short term basis to fund domestic working capital requirements 
other financing activities included scheduled debt payments of million and the payment of million in dividends to shareholders cents per share 
accumulated other comprehensive income improved by million in primarily because of favorable foreign currency translation adjustments of million  but also due to a reduction in the minimum liability for our pension plan of million 
this leaves a positive balance of million in accumulated other comprehensive income as of september  compared to a negative balance of million at september  our pension plan under funded balance improved slightly from the september  balance of million to a september  balance of million 
the plan assets generated a healthy return again this year and  together with increased employer contributions  more than offset growth in the net benefit obligation 
pension expense increased from million in to million in  and is expected to remain at approximately the same level in we contributed million to the plans in and expect to make contributions of about million during fiscal our net deferred tax asset was million at september  compared to million at september  of these amounts  million and million at september  and  respectively  resulted from the tax effect of recording an additional minimum pension liability 
we expect to generate sufficient taxable income in the future such that the net deferred tax asset will be realized 
our financial condition remains strong with working capital of million and a current ratio of at september  we expect that cash on hand and our ability to access the debt markets will be adequate to meet our working capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
in addition to the short term borrowing arrangements we have in the uk and new zealand  we have a committed short term credit facility for working capital needs from a group of financial institutions in the us  aggregating million 
as of september   million of this amount was used  leaving million available 
the short term credit facility in the us expires in february we are discussing our ongoing financing needs with the financial institutions and expect that this line of credit will be renewed or replaced before it expires 
the following is a schedule of our contractual obligations outstanding as of september  total less than year years years after years in millions long term debt interest payments operating leases deferred compensation critical accounting policies  estimates and judgments our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles that are generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we continually evaluate our estimates and judgments  the most critical of which are those related to revenue recognition  income taxes  valuation of goodwill and pension costs 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and other factors that we believe to be r easonable under the circumstances 
materially different results can occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known 
besides the estimates identified above that are considered critical  we make many other accounting estimates in preparing our financial statements and related disclosures 
all estimates  whether or not deemed critical  affect reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  as well as disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
these estimates and judgments are also based on historical experience and other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
materially different results can occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known  even for estimates and judgments that are not deemed c ritical 
this discussion of critical accounting policies  estimates and judgments should be read in conjunction with other disclosures included in this discussion  and the notes to the consolidated financial statements related to estimates  contingencies and new accounting standards 
significant accounting policies are identified in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we have discussed each of the critical accounting policies and the related estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors 
revenue recognition most of our business is derived from long term development  production and system integration contracts which we account for consistent with the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa audit and accounting guide  audits of federal government contractors  and the aicpa s statement of position no 
 accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
we consider the nature of these contracts  and the types of products and services provided when we determine the proper accounting for a particular contract 
generally we record long term fixed price contracts on a percentage of completion basis using the cost to cost method to measure progress toward completion 
most of our long term fixed price contracts require us to deliver minimal quantities over a long period of time or to perform a substantial level of development effort in relation to the total value of the contract 
under the cost to cost method of accounting  we recognize revenue based on a ratio of the costs incurred to the estimated total costs at completion 
amounts representing contract change orders  claims or other items are included in the contract value only when they can be reliably estimated and realization is considered probable 
provisions are made on a current basis to fully recognize any anticipated losses on contracts 
we record sales under cost reimbursement type contracts as we incur the costs 
incentives or penalties and awards applicable to performance on contracts are considered in estimating sales and profits  and are recorded when there is sufficient information to assess anticipated contract performance 
incentive provisions that increase or decrease earnings based solely on a single significant event are not recognized until the event occurs 
we have accounting policies in place to address these and other complex issues in accounting for long term contracts 
sales of products are recorded when a firm sales agreement is in place  delivery has occurred and collectibility of the fixed or determinable sales price is reasonably assured 
sales of services are recorded when performed in accordance with contracts or service agreements 
sales and profits on contracts that specify multiple deliverables are allocated to separate units of accounting when there is objective evidence that each accounting unit has value to the customer on a stand alone basis 
income taxes significant judgment is required in determining our income tax provisions and in evaluating our tax return positions 
we establish reserves when  despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable  we believe that certain positions are likely to be challenged and that we may not prevail 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the progress of a tax audit 
ta x regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements and are referred to as timing differences 
in addition  some expenses are not deductible on our tax return and are referred to as permanent differences 
timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in future years for which we have already recorded the benefit in our income statement 
we establish valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets when the amount of expected future taxable income is not likely to support the use of the deduction or credit 
deferred tax liabilities generally represent deductions we have taken on our tax return but have not yet recognized as expense in our financial statements 
we have not recognized any united states tax expense on undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries since we intend to reinvest the earnings outside the united states for the foreseeable future 
these undistributed earnings totaled approximately million at september  valuation of goodwill we evaluate our recorded goodwill balances for potential impairment annually by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value  including recorded goodwill 
we have not yet had a case where the carrying value exceeded the fair value  however  if it did  impairment would be measured by comparing the derived fair value of goodwill to its carrying value  and any impairment determined would be recorded in the current period 
to date there has been no impairment of our recorded goodwill 
goodwill balances by reporting unit are as follows september  in millions defense systems and products defense services transportation systems total goodwill determining the fair value of a reporting unit for purposes of the goodwill impairment test is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and also the magnitude of any such charge 
we currently perform internal valuation analysis and consider other market information that is publicly available 
estimates of fair value are primarily determined using discounted cash flows and comparisons with recent transactions 
these approaches use significant estimates and assumptions including projected future cash flows  discount rate reflecting the inherent risk in future cash flows  perpetual growth rate and determination of appropriate market comparables 
pension costs the measurement of our pension obligations and costs is dependent on a variety of assumptions used by our actuaries 
these assumptions include estimates of the present value of projected future pension payments to plan participants  taking into consideration the likelihood of potential future events such as salary increases and demographic experience 
these assumptions may have an effect on the amount and timing of future contributions 
the assumptions used in developing the required estimates include the following key factors discount rates inflation salary growth expected return on plan assets retirement rates mortality rates we base the discount rate assumption on investment yields available at year end on high quality corporate long term bonds 
our inflation assumption is based on an evaluation of external market indicators 
the salary growth assumptions reflect our long term actual experience in relation to the inflation assumption 
the expected return on plan assets reflects asset allocations  our historical experience  our investment strategy and the vi ews of investment managers and large pension sponsors 
retirement and mortality rates are based primarily on actual plan experience 
the effects of actual results differing from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods  and therefore  generally affect our recognized expense in such future periods 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate risk we invest in money market instruments and short term marketable debt and equity securities that are tied to floating interest rates being offered at the time the investment is made 
we maintain short term borrowing arrangements in the us  uk  and new zealand  which are also tied to floating interest rates the us prime rate and the uk and new zealand base rates 
we also have senior unsecured notes payable to insurance companies that are due in annual installments 
these notes have fixed coupon interest rates 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information 
interest income earned on our short term investments is affected by changes in the general level of us and uk interest rates 
these income streams are generally not hedged 
interest expense incurred under the short term borrowing arrangements is affected by changes in the general level of interest rates in the us  uk  and new zealand 
the expense related to these cost streams is usually not hedged since it is either revolving  payable within three months and or immediately callable by the lender at any time 
interest expense incurred under the long term notes payable is not affected by changes in any interest rate because it is fixed 
however  we have in the past  and may in the future  use an interest rate swap to essentially convert this fixed rate into a floating rate for some or all of the long term debt outstanding 
the purpose of a swap is to tie the interest expense risk related to these borrowings to the interest income risk on our short term investments  thereby mitigating our net interest rate risk 
we believe that we are not significantly exposed to interest rate risk at this point in time 
there was no interest rate swap outstanding at september  foreign currency exchange risk in the ordinary course of business  we enter into firm sale and purchase commitments denominated in many foreign currencies 
we have a policy to hedge those commitments greater than  by using foreign currency exchange forward and option contracts that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiary responsible for the commitment  typically the british pound  canadian dollar  euro  new zealand dollar and australian dollar 
these contracts are designed to be effective hedges regardless of the direction or magnitude of any foreign currency exchange rate change  because they result in an equal and opposite income or cost stream that offsets the change in the value of the underlying commitment 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information on our foreign currency translation and transaction accounting policies 
we also use balance sheet hedges to mitigate foreign exchange risk 
this strategy involves incurring british pound denominated debt see interest rate risk above and having the option of paying off the debt using us dollar or british pound funds 
we do not believe that we are significantly exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk at this point in time 
investments in our foreign subsidiaries in the uk  australia  new zealand  and canada are not hedged because we consider them to be invested indefinitely 
in addition  we generally have control over the timing and amount of earnings repatriation and expect to use this control to mitigate foreign currency exchange risk
