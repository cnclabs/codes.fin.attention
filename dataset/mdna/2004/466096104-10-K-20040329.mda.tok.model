item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations overview j 
alexander s corporation the company owns and operates high volume  upscale casual dining restaurants which offer a contemporary american menu 
at december   the company owned and operated j 
alexander s restaurants in states 
j 
alexander s restaurants compete by placing a special emphasis on high food quality and high levels of professional service offered in an attractive environment 
j 
alexander s typically does no advertising and relies on building sales through establishing its reputation as an outstanding restaurant 
the company has generally been successful in achieving same store sales increases over time using this strategy 
management was generally very pleased with the company s same store sales increases and financial performance for comparative same store sales trends strengthened during each quarter of and have continued favorable during early however  while restaurant operating margins net sales minus total restaurant operating expenses divided by net sales improved for compared to  the company s cost of sales as a percentage of sales increased by 
for the year and increased sequentially by quarter during the year as a result of increases in food costs experienced by the company 
in addition  the company s cost of beef increased significantly in march of the company did not increase menu prices significantly during or however  in order to offset at least a portion of the cost of sales increases the company is experiencing  and which do not appear likely to abate in the near future  menu prices were increased by approximately in march of management will closely monitor the effect of the march price increase and may consider additional menu price increases during the year in order to maintain cost of sales at acceptable levels 
management believes that through maintaining excellent restaurant operations  the company will be able to continue to increase guest counts in further  sales trends in the casual dining segment of the restaurant industry have generally been favorable in recent months as trends in the national economy and consumer confidence levels have improved  and the outlook for continued improvement in sales remains generally favorable for management believes that through the combination of continued same store sales gains and menu price increases  the company will be able to offset the effect of higher cost of sales in however  there can be no assurance this will be the case or that guest counts will not be negatively affected by menu price increases or other factors 
the opening of new restaurants by the company can and does have a significant impact on the company s financial performance 
because pre opening costs for new restaurants are significant and most new restaurants incur start up losses during their early months of operation  the number of restaurants opened in a particular year can have a significant impact on the company s operating results 
sales at two of the company s restaurants opened in have not met management s expectations to date 
both of these restaurants were opened in the fourth quarter of  so they are relatively new and forecasting their performance is difficult 
however  management currently expects that these two restaurants will experience operating losses for management believes that over time sales in these restaurants will increase to acceptable levels  as has generally been the case with certain of the company s other restaurants 

table of contents because large capital investments are required for j 
alexander s restaurants and because a high degree of operating leverage ie  a significant portion of labor cost and other operating expenses are fixed or semi fixed in nature is employed  the sales required for an individual restaurant to break even are high compared to many other casual dining concepts and it is necessary for the company to achieve relatively high sales volumes in its restaurants in order to achieve the desired financial returns 
the company s criteria for new restaurant development target locations with high population densities and high household incomes which management believes provide the best prospects for achieving outstanding financial returns on the company s investments in new restaurants 
management intends to maintain a conservative new restaurant development rate of generally one to two new restaurants per year  although no restaurants are currently expected to open in  to allow management to focus intently on improving sales and profits in its existing restaurants  while maintaining its pursuit of operational excellence 
in reviewing the results of the company  it should be noted that the company s income tax provision can vary significantly from year to year as a result of adjustments to the company s valuation allowance for deferred taxes as discussed below 
also  because a valuation allowance is maintained for the company s deferred tax assets  the effect of both permanent and timing differences in book income versus taxable income directly affect the company s current tax provision and along with the application of the federal alternative minimum tax regulations to the company s taxable income can cause volatility in the company s effective tax rate  particularly at the company s current pre tax income levels 
summary of results during fiscal  the company posted income before income taxes and the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of  up slightly from  reported during operating income for  while improving by  or  compared to  was significantly affected by pre opening costs associated with the opening of three new restaurants  as well as operating losses totaling approximately  incurred in two of those restaurants which opened in the fourth quarter of the year 
an increase in interest expense of  offset most of the operating profit improvement achieved 
net income increased to  in from  in the results included a favorable adjustment of  to the income tax provision for the year as the result of a reduction of the company s valuation allowance recorded against its deferred income tax assets 
a similar adjustment in the amount of  was included in the income tax provision for the company s income before income taxes and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle increased to  for from  in this increase was due primarily to an increase of  in operating income during resulting from higher restaurant operating income and lower pre opening expenses  with these items being partially offset by increased general and administrative expenses 
also  in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  the company incurred an impairment charge of  in related to goodwill recorded in connection with the company s acquisition of its original casual dining restaurant in this charge was recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle as of the beginning of the year

restaurants open at end of year weighted average weekly sales per restaurant net sales net sales increased by approximately million  or  to million in fiscal year from million in the million of sales recorded in represented an increase of million  or  over million of sales reported in the sales increase in was primarily due to three new restaurants which opened during the year and to sales increases within the company s same store base 
the increase was likewise due primarily to the opening of new restaurants  in september and december of  and increases in same store sales 
same store sales increased by to an average of  per week in from  per week in on a base of restaurants 
same store sales averaged  per week in  an increase of from  on a base of restaurants 
the company computes weighted average weekly sales per restaurant by dividing total restaurant sales for the period by the total number of days all restaurants were open for the period to obtain a daily sales average  with the daily sales average then multiplied by seven to arrive at weekly average sales per restaurant 
days on which restaurants are closed for business for any reason other than the scheduled closure of all j 
alexander s restaurants on thanksgiving day and christmas day are excluded from this calculation 
weighted average weekly same store sales per restaurant are computed in the same manner as described above except that sales and sales days used in the calculation include only those for restaurants open for more than months 

table of contents management believes that same store sales and guest count trends are important measures of comparative performance in the restaurant industry and for the company 
included in the same store sales increases above were a guest count increase of approximately in and a decrease of an estimated in after experiencing declining guest counts in the first three quarters of  the company s guest counts flattened out in the fourth quarter of and increased on a comparative basis each quarter in management believes the increases in were due to improved service levels in the company s restaurants  limited menu price increases during and  and significant sales improvements in certain of the company s restaurants located in small and mid sized markets 
increased wine sales  which management believes are due to additional emphasis placed on the company s wine feature program  also contributed to the same store sales increases in and management estimates the average check per guest  excluding alcoholic beverage sales  was for  compared to in and in menu prices for increased an estimated compared to primarily due to modest price increases implemented by the company in the last half of on selected menu items in order to increase sales and improve profitability 
management believes its long term emphasis on providing professional service combined with effective menu management will continue to build sales and increase customer traffic over time 
average weekly same store sales increased by for the first eight weeks of compared to the same period of restaurant costs and expenses total restaurant operating expenses  as a percentage of sales  declined to in from and in restaurant operating margins net sales minus total restaurant operating expenses  divided by net sales improved to in from in  and in the most significant factor affecting the changes in restaurant operating expenses as a percentage of sales in both and was cost of sales 
cost of sales  as a percentage of sales  increased by 
in compared to due primarily to increases in input costs in a number of categories including poultry  produce and dairy 
the company s cost of salmon also increased as did the cost of shortening and cooking oil 
beef costs increased due to the effect of upgrading selected beef products to higher quality and more expensive certified angus beef  and the company also experienced a shift toward more sales of beef products  which generally have a higher cost of sales 
beef purchases represent the largest component of the company s cost of sales and comprise approximately of this category 
the company typically enters into an annual pricing agreement covering most of its beef purchases 
the twelve month pricing agreement effective in march included significant price decreases from the previous annual agreement 
the company was also able to renew the agreement for an additional twelve month period beginning in march at the same prices 
management believes this resulted in very favorable beef prices for the company for most of due to higher prices in the beef market during and early  prices under the company s most recent beef pricing agreement which was effective in march of increased by an estimated to and are expected to increase the company s cost of sales by approximately million during the twelve month term of the new agreement 
in response to the higher beef input costs as well as continuing upward pressure on the cost of a number of other food items  the company increased menu prices by approximately in march of even with higher menu prices  management estimates that the company s cost of sales  as a percentage of sales  will increase in compared to the decrease in cost of sales in was due to the impact of higher menu prices and favorable costs associated with beef  pork and poultry  which more than offset increased produce costs incurred during the year 
restaurant labor and related costs decreased as a percentage of sales in both and these decreases were due largely to the effect of higher tip share contributions by restaurant servers to each restaurant s tip pool  which resulted in reductions in the hourly wage rates paid by the company to the employees receiving larger distributions under the tip pool program 
in the favorable effects of the higher tip share contributions combined with labor efficiencies gained at higher sales volumes more than offset the effects of higher labor costs in new restaurants and increases in workers compensation insurance premiums 
in the favorable effects of the tip share contributions more than offset the impact of increased wages associated with kitchen staff  higher bonus payouts to restaurant management  and increases in workers compensation insurance premiums and payroll tax expense 
depreciation and amortization of restaurant property and equipment decreased to of sales in from in and in these decreases were due primarily to assets which became fully depreciated 

table of contents other operating expenses decreased to of sales in from in  following an increase in from in the decrease in was primarily related to operating efficiencies gained at higher sales volumes and management s emphasis on controlling costs in this area 
the increase in was primarily related to increases in premiums for property and casualty insurance  additional rent expense  and higher repair and maintenance expenditures 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses  which include all supervisory costs and expenses  management training and relocation costs  and all other costs above the restaurant level  totaled  in   in and  in the most significant factor contributing to the decrease in general and administrative expenses in was a decrease of  in the accrual for bonuses paid to the corporate staff for the year 
the lower bonus accrual combined with a reduction in salary expenses more than offset increases in group health insurance costs and higher travel expenses resulting from the opening of three new restaurants 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales decreased for compared to due to the reduction in general and administrative expenses combined with growth in sales 
the increase in general and administrative expenses for was primarily due to the inclusion of an accrual for bonuses earned by the corporate staff for the year and increases in other employee benefit obligations 
these increases more than offset decreases in travel costs and employee relocation and procurement expenses 
no bonuses for the corporate staff were accrued or paid for as a percentage of sales  general and administrative expenses decreased slightly in from due to growth of the company s sales base 
pre opening expense pre opening costs  which are expensed as incurred  totaled  in  representing a significant increase over the  incurred in this increase was due to the opening of three new restaurants in  while no new restaurants were opened in pre opening expenses for included primarily management training expenses incurred in connection with a new restaurant opened in the first quarter of because two restaurants were opened in  pre opening expenses were also higher in that year than in interest expense net interest expense increased by  in compared to this increase was due to increased borrowings and to higher interest rates associated with  of mortgage financing completed by the company during the fourth quarter of  which has a fixed effective annual interest rate of 
net interest expense did not change significantly in compared to  as the effect of lower interest rates on the company s line of credit balances outstanding for the first ten months of the year offset the effects of higher outstanding credit line balances and additional interest expense on the mortgage financing completed in income taxes under the provisions of sfas no 
accounting for income taxes  the company had gross deferred tax assets of  and  and gross deferred tax liabilities of  and  at december  and december   respectively 
the deferred tax assets at december  relate primarily to  of tax credit carryforwards available to reduce future federal income taxes 
realization of the company s deferred tax assets is dependent principally on future earnings of the company and the recognition of these assets depends on the company s assessment of the likelihood of taxable income in future periods in amounts sufficient to realize the assets 
the deferred tax assets have been reduced through use of a valuation allowance to the extent future income is not considered more likely than not to be generated in such amounts 
based on management s assessment of the likelihood of the future realization of the company s deferred tax assets  the beginning of the year valuation allowance was reduced by  and  in the fourth quarters of and  respectively  with corresponding credits to the income tax provisions for those years 
these credits  while reducing income tax expense  are not a current source of cash for the company 
see additional discussion under critical accounting policies income taxes 

table of contents the company s annual income tax provisions also include estimated federal alternative minimum tax amt and state income taxes payable  with the federal amt computed by applying the amt rate to the company s pre tax accounting income after adding back certain tax preference items  as well as certain permanent differences and timing differences in book and tax income 
because the company maintains a partial valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets  no direct benefit is recognized in the income tax provisions with respect to the amt credit carryforwards or other tax assets generated 
during  the company reversed previously accrued federal income taxes payable of  resulting in a reduction in the current federal provision 
liquidity and capital resources the company s capital needs are primarily for the development and construction of new j 
alexander s restaurants  for maintenance of its existing restaurants  and for meeting required debt service obligations 
the company has met its needs and maintained liquidity for the past three years primarily by use of cash flow from operations  use of bank lines of credit and  beginning in october  through proceeds from a mortgage loan 
the company s capital expenditures can vary significantly from year to year depending on the number  timing and form of ownership of new restaurants 
cash expenditures for capital assets totaled   and  for  and  respectively  and were primarily for the development of new j 
alexander s restaurants 
cash provided by operating activities represented and of capital expenditures for and  respectively  and exceeded capital expenditures in the remaining capital expenditures for and were funded primarily by use of the company s then existing lines of credit and  in  proceeds from long term mortgage financing completed in lines of credit were also used to meet other obligations  including annual sinking fund requirements for a convertible debenture issue which was retired in  and working capital needs during and a portion of outstanding borrowings under the line of credit which was in effect during and increased from  at the beginning of to  when it was paid off in october in october  the company obtained  of long term financing through completion of a mortgage loan transaction 
the mortgage loan has an effective annual interest rate  including the effect of the amortization of deferred issue costs  of and is payable in equal monthly installments of principal and interest of approximately  through november net proceeds from the mortgage loan  after deducting fees and expenses associated with the transaction  were approximately  a portion of these funds were used to pay off the outstanding balance of  on the company s bank line of credit as of october   terminating that facility 
remaining funds were invested in short term money market funds and used along with cash flow from operations primarily for retiring the company s  of convertible subordinated debentures which matured in  to fund capital costs associated with new and existing restaurants  and for repurchases of the company s common stock 
provisions of the mortgage loan and related agreements require that a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio be maintained for the restaurants securing the loan and that the company s leverage ratio not exceed a specified level 
the loan is pre payable without penalty after october   with a yield maintenance penalty in effect prior to that time 
the mortgage loan is secured by the real estate  equipment and other personal property of nine of the company s restaurant locations with an aggregate book value of  at december  the real property at these locations is owned by jax real estate  llc  the borrower under the loan agreement  which leases them to a wholly owned subsidiary of the company as lessee 
the company has guaranteed the obligations of the lessee subsidiary to pay rents under the lease 
jax real estate  llc  is an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the company which is included in the company s consolidated financial statements 
however  jax real estate  llc was established as a special purpose  bankruptcy remote entity and maintains its own legal existence  ownership of its assets and responsibility for its liabilities separate from the company and its other affiliates 

table of contents on may   the company entered into a secured bank line of credit agreement which will provide up to  for financing capital expenditures related to the development of new restaurants and for general operating purposes 
credit available under the line is currently approximately million and is based on a percentage of the appraised value of the collateral securing the line 
provisions of the line of credit agreement require that a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio be maintained and that the company s leverage ratio not exceed a specified level 
the company s ability to incur additional debt outside of the line of credit is also restricted 
the line of credit is secured by the real estate of two of the company s restaurant locations with an aggregate book value of  at december  and bears interest on the outstanding borrowings at the rate of libor plus a spread of two to four percent  depending on the company s leverage ratio 
the credit line expires on april   unless converted to a term loan prior to march  under the provisions of the agreement 
borrowings outstanding under this credit line were  at december  there were no borrowings under the line as of march  management believes that cash flow from operations combined with the credit available under its bank line of credit will be adequate to meet its financing needs for and that its conservative long term growth plan of one to two restaurants per year will not be constrained due to lack of capital resources 
however  to supplement these sources of capital and provide additional funds for future growth  the company completed  of five year equipment financing in january management believes that  if needed  additional financing would be available for future growth through an increase in bank credit  additional mortgage or equipment financing  or sale and leaseback of some or all of the company s unencumbered restaurant properties 
there can be no assurance  however  that  if needed  such financing could be obtained or that it would be on terms satisfactory to the company 
the company currently does not plan to open any new restaurants in however  management is continually seeking locations for new j 
alexander s restaurants and would consider quickly taking advantage of any attractive opportunities which might arise 
management estimates that capital expenditures for existing restaurants will be approximately million for  net of the landlord s contribution of approximately  for tenant improvements for a new restaurant opened in the fourth quarter of capital expenditures in for the development of new restaurants are dependent upon the timing and success of management s efforts to locate acceptable sites and would be in addition to the amounts above 
the company has periodically made purchases of its common stock under a repurchase program authorized by the company s board of directors 
the total authorized purchases under this program are  from june through may   the company repurchased approximately  shares at a cost of approximately  an average cost of per share 
the company generally does not repurchase shares following the end of a fiscal quarter until after results for the quarter have been publicly announced 
while a working capital deficit of  was present as of december   the company does not believe this deficit impairs the overall financial condition of the company because certain of the company s expenses  particularly depreciation and amortization  do not require current outlays of cash 
also  requirements for funding accounts receivable and inventories are relatively insignificant  so that virtually all cash generated by operations is available to meet current obligations 
further  the company s current obligations for repayment of long term debt are now significantly less than in previous years due to the replacement of previous debt agreements with year fixed rate financing 
as of march   the company had no financing transactions  arrangements or other relationships with any unconsolidated affiliated entities or related parties 
additionally  the company is not a party to any financing arrangements involving synthetic leases or trading activities involving commodity contracts 
operating lease commitments for leased restaurants and office space are disclosed in note e  leases and note j  commitments and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents contractual obligations the following table sets forth significant contractual obligations of the company at december  payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt capitalized lease obligations operating leases purchase obligations other long term obligations total long term debt and capitalized lease obligations include the interest expense component 
includes renewal option periods 
in determining purchase obligations for this table  the company used its interpretation of the definition set forth in the related rule which states  a purchase obligation is defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding on the registrant and that specifies all significant terms  including fixed minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
in applying this definition  the company has only included purchase obligations to the extent the failure to perform would result in formal recourse to j 
alexander s corporation 
from through  the company operated restaurants in the quick service restaurant industry 
the discontinuation of these quick service restaurant operations included disposals of restaurants that were subject to lease agreements which typically contained initial lease terms of years plus two additional option periods of five years each 
in connection with certain of these dispositions  the company remains secondarily liable for ensuring financial performance as set forth in the original lease agreements 
the company can only estimate its contingent liability relative to these leases  as any changes to the contractual arrangements between the current tenant and the landlord subsequent to the assignment are not required to be disclosed to the company 
a summary of the company s estimated contingent liability as of december   is as follows wendy s restaurants leases mrs 
winner s chicken biscuits restaurants leases total contingent liability related to assigned leases there have been no payments by the company of such contingent liabilities in the history of the company 
critical accounting policies the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to its accounting for income taxes  property and equipment  impairment of long lived assets  contingencies and litigation 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies are those which involve the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements 

table of contents income taxes the company had  of gross deferred tax assets at december   consisting principally of  of tax credit carryforwards 
generally accepted accounting principles require that the company record a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets unless it is more likely than not that such assets will ultimately be realized 
due to losses incurred by the company from through and because the company operates with a high degree of financial and operating leverage  with a significant portion of its costs being fixed or semi fixed in nature  management was unable to conclude from through that it was more likely than not that its existing deferred tax assets would be realized  therefore  the company maintained a valuation allowance for of its deferred tax assets  net of deferred tax liabilities  for those years 
in  the company completed its third consecutive profitable year  with pre tax income increasing significantly over the previous year 
in addition the company had recorded significant increases in operating income in four of the previous five years and had reached a size and experience level which management believed made it less likely that an unsuccessful new restaurant would have a significant effect on consolidated operating results 
because of these factors  management further assessed the likelihood of realization of its deferred tax assets  using as its principal basis its forecast of future taxable income adjusted by applying varying probability factors to the achievement of this forecast 
as the result of this assessment  the beginning of the year valuation allowance was reduced by  in the fourth quarter of  with a corresponding credit to deferred income tax expense 
management completed a similar assessment in and concluded that the valuation allowance should be reduced by an additional  as a result  the beginning of the year valuation allowance was reduced by that amount in the fourth quarter of  with a corresponding credit to deferred income tax expense 
failure to achieve taxable income in the future  as so assessed  could affect the ultimate realization of the net deferred tax assets 
because of the uncertainties discussed above  there can be no assurance that management s assessment of taxable income will be achieved and that there could not be an increase in the valuation allowance in the future 
it is also possible that the company could generate profitability and taxable income levels in the future which would cause management to conclude that it is more likely than not that the company will realize all  or an additional portion of  its net deferred tax assets 
the company will continue to evaluate the likelihood of realization of its net deferred tax assets and upon reaching any different conclusion as to the appropriate carrying value of these assets  management will adjust them to their estimated net realizable value 
any such revisions to the estimated net realizable value of the net deferred tax assets could cause the company s provision for income taxes to vary significantly from period to period  although its cash tax payments would remain unaffected until the benefits of the various carryforwards were fully utilized 
in addition  certain other components of the company s provision for income taxes must be estimated 
these items include  but are not limited to  effective state income tax rates  allowable tax credits for items such as fica taxes paid on reported tip income  and estimates related to depreciation expense allowable for tax purposes 
these estimates are made based on the best available information at the time the tax provision is prepared 
income tax returns are generally not filed  however  until several months after year end 
all tax returns are subject to audit by federal and state governments  usually years after the returns are filed  and could be subject to differing interpretations of the tax laws 
property and equipment property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the asset s estimated useful life or the expected lease term  generally including renewal options 
improvements are capitalized while repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred 
because significant judgments are required in estimating useful lives  which are not ultimately known until the passage of time and may be dependent on proper asset maintenance  and in the determination of what constitutes a capitalized cost versus a repair or maintenance expense  changes in circumstances or use of different assumptions could result in materially different results from those determined based on the company s estimates 

table of contents impairment of long lived assets when events and circumstances indicate that long lived assets most typically assets associated with a specific restaurant might be impaired  management compares the carrying value of such assets to the undiscounted cash flows it expects that restaurant to generate over its remaining useful life 
in calculating its estimate of such undiscounted cash flows  management is required to make assumptions  which are subject to a high degree of judgment  relative to the restaurant s future period of operation  sales performance  cost of sales  labor and operating expenses 
the resulting forecast of undiscounted cash flows represents management s estimate based on both historical results and management s expectation of future operations for that particular restaurant 
to date  all of the company s long lived assets have been determined to be recoverable based on management s estimates of future cash flows 
the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive listing of all of the company s accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result

the provisions of sfas no 
are generally effective for all financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise became effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  the company has adopted sfas no 
and it had no impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
impact of inflation and other factors virtually all of the company s costs and expenses are subject to normal inflationary pressures and the company continually seeks ways to cope with their impact 
by owning a number of its properties  the company avoids certain increases in occupancy costs 
new and replacement assets will likely be acquired at higher costs  but this will take place over many years 
in general  the company tries to offset increased costs and expenses through additional improvements in operating efficiencies and by increasing menu prices over time  as permitted by competition and market conditions 
seasonality and quarterly results the company s revenues and net income have historically been subject to seasonal fluctuations 
revenues and operating income typically reach their highest levels during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year due to holiday business and the first quarter of the fiscal year due to the redemption of gift cards sold during the holiday season 
in addition  certain of the company s restaurants  particularly those located in southern florida  typically experience an increase in customer traffic during the period between thanksgiving and easter due to an increase in population in these markets during that portion of the year 
quarterly results have been and are expected to continue to be significantly impacted by the timing of new restaurant openings and their associated pre opening costs 
as a result of these and other factors  the company s financial results for any given quarter may not be indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year 
a summary of the company s quarterly results for and appears in this report immediately following the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk disclosure about interest rate risk 
the company is subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based on its financing and cash management activities 
while substantially all of the company s debt outstanding as of december  was at fixed rates  the company has historically utilized a mix of both fixed rate and variable rate debt to manage its exposures to changes in interest rates 
see notes d and e to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere herein 
the company does not expect changes in market interest rates to have a material affect on income or cash flows in fiscal  although there can be no assurances that interest rates will not significantly change 
commodity price risk 
many of the food products purchased by the company are affected by commodity pricing and are  therefore  subject to price volatility caused by weather  production problems  delivery difficulties and other factors which are outside the control of the company 
essential supplies and raw materials are available from several sources and the company is not dependent upon any single source of supplies or raw materials 
the company s ability to maintain consistent quality throughout its restaurant system depends in part upon its ability to acquire food products and related items from reliable sources
