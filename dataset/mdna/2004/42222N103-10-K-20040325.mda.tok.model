item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of the financial condition and results of operations of healthstream should be read in conjunction with selected financial data and healthstream s consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
healthstream s actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed and those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of many factors  including but not limited to  those described under risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
the following discussion provides an overview of our history together with a summary of our critical accounting policies and estimates 
our critical accounting policies and estimates include revenue recognition  product development costs and related capitalization  impairment of goodwill  intangible and other long lived assets and the allowance for doubtful accounts 
overview healthstream was incorporated in and began marketing its internet based solutions in march the company focuses on being a facilitator of training tools for entities in the healthcare industry 
revenues from the healthcare organizations business unit hco are derived from the following categories provision of services through our internet based learning products  courseware subscriptions  maintenance and support of installed learning management products and a variety of online products 
revenues from the pharmaceutical and medical device company business unit pmd are derived from live event development  content development  web cast events  and other educational and training services 
to date  we have incurred substantial costs to develop our technologies  create  license and acquire our content  build brand awareness  develop our infrastructure and expand our business  and have yet to achieve sufficient revenues to generate a net profit or positive operating cash flows 
as a result  we have incurred operating losses in each fiscal quarter since we expect operating losses to continue through as we continue to expand our business and develop and sell new products and services 
these costs could have a 
table of contents material adverse effect on our future financial condition or operating results 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our financial results prior to january  are not necessarily meaningful  and you should not rely upon them as an indication of our future performance 
critical accounting policies and estimates revenue recognition we recognize revenues from our internet based learning products and courseware subscriptions to healthcare workers through healthcare organizations based on a per person subscription basis  with fees ranging from less than to more than per month 
these fees are based on the size of the facilities employee user population and the service offerings to which they subscribe 
contracts for our internet based learning products generally range from  to approximately  based on the number of users  products and services included and the duration of the contract 
revenue is recognized ratably over the service period of the underlying contract 
the company offers training services for clients to facilitate integration of this technology 
fees for training are based on the time and efforts of the personnel involved 
training revenues are generally recognized upon completion of training services 
we also have arrangements that provide for commercial support of online courseware 
such revenue is recognized based on an estimate of usage ratably over the term unless usage varies from this estimate 
revenues from installed learning management products are primarily associated with ongoing maintenance and technical support services  typically based on a percentage of the original contract amount and recognized as revenue over the term of the service period  generally one year 
until early  we also had revenues related to sales of installed learning management products  which were recognized based upon shipment or installation of the software 
these sales typically ranged from  to  based on the number of users 
we have and expect to continue to transition customers from our existing installed learning management products to our internet based learning products 
we expect that revenues resulting from these transition customers will remain comparable or increase when compared to the annual maintenance and technical support services fees due to sales of additional services and online courseware 
we recognize revenue from live event development services and content development services based on the percentage of completion method using labor hours or similar event milestones 
this methodology requires ongoing estimates regarding the total expenses or significant milestones associated with the project as well as periodic estimates of the progress with respect to completion of such projects 
event registration services revenue is based on the contracted services including the expected registrant attendance 
revenues for these services are recognized upon completion of the related events 
sales of products and services to pharmaceutical and medical device companies can be subject to seasonal factors as a result of drug and product introductions  meeting and conference dates and budget cycles for such companies 
revenues associated with online training are recognized over the term of the subscription period or over the historical usage period  if usage typically differs from the subscription period 
all other service revenues  including web cast events  are recognized as the related services are performed or products are delivered 
we expect to continue to generate revenues by marketing our internet based products and services to healthcare workers through healthcare organizations 
we expect that the portion of our revenues related to services provided via our internet based learning products will increase 
specifically  we will seek to generate revenues from healthcare workers by marketing to their employers or sponsoring organizations 
the transaction fees for courseware resulting from this marketing is typically paid by either the employer or sponsoring organization 
product development costs product development costs primarily include our internal costs to maintain and internally develop features and convert content for our internet based learning and installed learning management products 
once technological feasibility is achieved  we capitalize the cost of features or content developed by third parties where the life expectancy is greater than one year and the anticipated cash flows from such content is expected to exceed the related cost of the content 
during and  we capitalized approximately  and  respectively  related to third party content development 
such amounts are included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets under the caption prepaid development fees 
we amortize content and feature development over the expected life  which is generally one to three years 
product development and content development costs that have been capitalized are subject to a periodic impairment review in accordance with our policy 
product development costs also include our systems team  which manages our efforts associated with product development and maintenance  database management  quality assurance and security 
this team is responsible for new internal product development 
table of contents such as hospitaldirect  integration of external new products such as competency compass and continued enhancements and regularly scheduled maintenance called servicepacks to our platform 
we account for web site development costs in accordance with eitf issue no 
accounting for web site development costs  which provides guidance on when to capitalize versus expense costs incurred to develop a web site 
we capitalize costs incurred between the point of establishing technological feasibility and general release when such costs are material 
in connection with product development  our significant estimates involve the assessment of technological feasibility for new products  as well as the expected useful life of costs associated with new products and content 
once capitalized  product and content development costs are subject to the policies and estimates described below regarding goodwill  intangible and other long lived assets 
goodwill  intangibles and other long lived assets we account for goodwill and intangibles and other long lived assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets  and sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we measure for impairment at the reporting unit level using a discounted cash flow model to determine the estimated fair value of the reporting units 
our discounted cash flow model contains significant assumptions and accounting estimates about discount rates  future cash flows and terminal values that could materially affect our operating results or financial position if they were to change significantly in the future 
we perform our goodwill impairment test whenever events or changes in facts or circumstances indicate that impairment may exist and also during the fourth quarter each year 
through december   we accounted for goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 intangible assets and other long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  statement 
in accordance with statement  we reviewed internal and external factors to determine whether events or changes in facts and circumstances were present and indicative of an impairment of long lived assets 
this review included estimates of future cash flows related to such long lived assets 
allowance for doubtful accounts we estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts using a specific identification method 
management s evaluation includes reviewing past due accounts on a case by case basis  and determining whether an account should be reserved  based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each potentially uncollectible account 
an allowance is also maintained for accounts not specifically identified that may become uncollectible in the future 
uncollectible accounts are written off in the period management believes it has exhausted every opportunity to collect payment from the customer 
bad debt expense is recorded when events or circumstances indicate an additional allowance is necessary based on our specific identification approach

the internet based hlc subscriber base increased approximately during  from approximately  fully implemented subscribers at the end of  to approximately  fully implemented subscribers at the end this increase contributed to a million increase in hco revenues  while courseware subscription revenues increased million during  primarily associated with the health insurance portability and accountability act of hipaa 
revenues from maintenance and support fees associated with our installed learning management products declined  as expected  by  this decline is consistent with our planned transition of these customers to our internet based learning platform 
we expect revenues from our installed learning management products to continue to decline during  as we continue to focus on transitioning the customers using these products to our internet based learning platform 
we expect revenues from our internet based hlc  our competency compass product and add on courseware to increase during the pmd unit experienced moderate revenue growth during revenues from the sales of our content development services increased during this revenue growth was partially offset by moderate declines in live event revenues  in part related to the pharmaceutical and medical device industry s cautious response to compliance guidelines issued by the oig in april  that relate to the funding of educational programs

during the second and fourth quarters of  we recorded office consolidation charges for the closure of our raleigh  nc office 
liquidity and capital resources since our inception  we have financed our operations largely through proceeds from our ipo  private placements of equity securities  loans from related parties and  to an increasing extent  from revenues generated from the sale of our products and services 
net cash used in operating activities was approximately million during  compared to million during the improvement in cash consumption primarily resulted from the decline in net loss  before the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in  of million

we have no bank credit facility or other indebtedness other than capital lease obligations 
as of february   we had cash and cash equivalents  restricted cash  investments and related interest receivable of approximately million 
from january  through february   we had capital expenditures of approximately  primarily related to hardware and software additions 
we believe that our cash and cash equivalents  restricted cash  investments in marketable securities and related interest receivable will be sufficient to meet anticipated cash needs for working capital  new product development  capital expenditures and acquisitions for at least the next months 
our growth strategy may also include acquiring companies that complement our products and services 
we anticipate that these acquisitions  if any  will be effected through a combination of stock and cash consideration 
the issuance of stock as consideration for an acquisition could have a dilutive effect on our stock price 
failure to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or raise additional capital when required during or following that period in sufficient amounts and on terms acceptable to us could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
commitments and contingencies we expect that our capital expenditures will be approximately million in our strategic alliances have typically provided for payments to content partners based on revenues and development partners and other parties based on services rendered 
we expect to continue similar arrangements in the future 
in addition to these commitments  we have capital lease obligations and operating lease commitments for our operating facilities in nashville  tn and denver  co  and closed facilities in dallas  tx and raleigh  nc 
a summary of future anticipated payments for commitments and other contractual obligations are outlined below payments due by period more than less than year years years years total capital lease obligations operating leases purchase commitments other contractual obligations total purchase commitments include the acquisition of computer hardware and software for an additional hosting facility in nashville  tn

off balance sheet arrangements none 
recent accounting pronouncements in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  to expand upon and strengthen existing accounting guidance that addresses when a company should include in its financial statements the assets  liabilities and activities of another entity 
prior to the effective date of fin  a company generally had included another entity in its consolidated financial statements only if it controlled the entity through voting interests 
fin changed that guidance by requiring a variable interest entity  as defined  to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or is entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns or both 
fin also requires disclosure about variable interest entities that the company is not required to consolidate but in which it has a significant variable interest
