on march   marriott sold its senior living division  msls  to sunrise 
effective on that date  sunrise became the manager of the properties leased to five star and the tenant and manager of the properties leased to msls 
marriott continues to guarantee the lease for the properties 
all tenant operating statistics presented are based upon the operating results provided by our tenants for the indicated periods ending december or the most recent prior period tenant operating results available to us from our tenants 
rent coverage is calculated as operating cash flow from our tenants facility operations  before subordinated charges and capital expenditure reserves  divided by rent payable to us 
we have not independently verified our tenants operating data 
rent coverage is after non subordinated management fees of million and million for the year ended december  and  respectively 
includes data for periods prior to our ownership of these properties 
we acquired these properties on december  in march  healthsouth issued a press release stating that its historical financial information should not be relied upon 
because we have reason to doubt the financial information we have from healthsouth  we do not disclose any operating statistics for this tenant 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued results of operations year ended december   compared to year ended december  rental income for the year ended december   was million compared to rental income of million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
this increase results from our acquisition and lease of properties during and properties during ff e reserve income for the year ended december   was zero compared to million for the year ended december  one of our leases with five star required a percentage of gross revenues be paid to us as additional rent  which was escrowed for future capital expenditures at the leased facilities 
this lease was amended on october  as a result of this amendment  the ff e reserve escrow deposits are not paid to us as additional rent  but are paid into accounts owned by five star 
we have security and remainder interests in these accounts and in property purchased with funding from these accounts 
accordingly  we no longer record ff e reserve income 
interest and other income for the year ended december  and  each include  of dividend income from one million shares of hrpt that we own 
also included in interest and other income for the year ended december   is  of proceeds from the sale of a mortgage note 
in connection with one of our acquisitions  we were assigned the rights under this mortgage note from an unrelated third party 
the mortgage note was assigned zero value at the time of the assignment 
however  in march  we sold the note to an affiliate of the note obligor for  the year ended december   also includes  of mortgage interest income from mortgage financing we provided in february to alterra  and a net operating loss of  from the property we repossessed from a tenant which defaulted its lease obligations to us in march interest expense for the year ended december   was million compared to interest expense for the year ended december   of million  an increase of million  or 
the increase was caused by our issuance of million of senior unsecured notes in april  partially offset by less interest expense on reduced amounts outstanding under our revolving bank credit facility during depreciation expense for the year ended december   was million compared to depreciation expense for the year ended december   of million  an increase of million  or 
general and administrative expense for the year ended december   was million compared to general and administrative expense for the year ended december   of million  an increase of million  or 
these increases were primarily due to the full impact in of our investment in properties during  our investment in properties in and costs of million in connection with our litigations with marriott and healthsouth 
in january  we settled our litigation with marriott 
during the year ended december   we experienced a loss of million on the sale of one property 
in the year ended december   we recorded a loss from discontinued operations of million at a facility leased to five star which was closed and subsequently sold during we had no discontinued operations in net income was million  or per share  for the year ended december   compared to million  or per share  for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or per share 
these changes reflect the changes described above in revenues and expenses and the more than million share increase in the weighted average number of shares outstanding between the and periods resulting from our issuance of our common shares during item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued year ended december   compared to year ended december  total revenues for the year ended december   were million  compared to total revenues of million for the year ended december  included in total revenues for the year ended december   are revenues from facilities operations of million 
during  five star  one of our wholly owned subsidiaries  operated facilities for our account 
on december   we distributed substantially all of our ownership of five star to our shareholders and five star became a separate public company 
in connection with the five star spin off  five star leased the facilities from us which it previously operated for our account  and  as a result  after the five star spin off  we do not have facilities operations revenues or expenses 
rental income for the year ended december   was million compared to rental income of million for the year ended december   an increase of million 
this increase was due to our acquisition and lease of properties on january   for annual rent of million  our lease to five star of facilities which had been previously operated for our account for annual rent of million and our lease to five star which commenced in october for annual rent of million 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in annual rent from healthsouth of million to million resulting from a lease modification related to a non monetary exchange of properties  effective january  the primary reasons which we entered into this exchange transaction were as follows healthsouth advised us that it was not interested to continue operating the five nursing homes which it leased from us  but it was interested to operate on a long term basis the two hospitals which it delivered to us  historically the two hospitals which we received had produced financial performance which was equal to or better than the financial performance of the five nursing homes we delivered to healthsouth  and although the amount of annual rent which we would receive was less than we previously received  we obtained a longer term lease commitment from a tenant that represented itself to be  and that we believed to be  an investment grade quality company 
ff e reserve income for the year ended december   was million compared to zero for the year ended december  the lease with five star for certain properties acquired in january required a percentage of gross revenues be paid to us as additional rent  which was escrowed for future capital expenditures at the leased facilities 
this lease was amended on october  as a result of this amendment  the ff e reserve escrow deposits are not paid to us as additional rent  but are paid into accounts owned by five star 
we have security and remainder interests in these accounts and in property purchased with funding from these accounts 
as a result  we no longer receive ff e reserve income 
interest and other income for the years ended december  and  each include  of dividend income from the one million shares of hrpt that we own 
total expenses for the year ended december   were million  compared to total expenses of million for the year ended december   a decrease of million 
total expenses for the year ended december   include expenses from facilities operations of million 
subsequent to the five star spin off  we no longer have any facilities operations expenses 
interest expense for the year ended december   was million compared to interest expense for the year ended december   of million  an increase of million 
this increase was primarily due to our issuance of million of senior unsecured notes in december and our assumption of debt in connection with our purchase of properties in january these increases were partially offset by a decrease in the weighted average interest rate on our revolving bank credit facility 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued depreciation expense for the year ended december   was million compared to depreciation expense for the year ended december   of million  an increase of million 
recurring general and administrative expense for the year ended december   was million compared to recurring general and administrative expense for the year ended december   of million  an increase of million 
these increases were primarily due to our acquisition of properties in january and october and increased legal fees in connection with our litigation with marriott 
during the year ended december   we incurred nonrecurring general and administrative costs totaling approximately million 
these costs were incurred in connection with the establishment of operating systems for foreclosed and repossessed properties  which systems were distributed to shareholders in the five star spin off 
in addition  we incurred million of non recurring costs in connection with the five star spin off 
distributions on trust preferred securities for the year ended december   were million compared to million for the year ended december  the increase is due to our issuance of trust preferred securities in june and july during the year ended december   we recorded a loss from discontinued operations of million related to a facility leased to five star which was closed during the second quarter of and sold during the fourth quarter of the loss includes historical depreciation expense as well as an impairment write down of the real estate associated with this property  offset by the sales proceeds received by us 
for the period  amounts were reclassified from depreciation expense and facilities operations revenues and expenses to the loss from discontinued operations 
net income was million  or per share  for the year ended december   compared to million  or per share  for the year ended december   an increase of million  or per share 
this increase is primarily the result of the changes in revenues and expenses resulting from our january and october acquisitions  the five star spin off and the issuance of senior notes and trust preferred securities as described above  and the increase in weighted average number of shares outstanding between the and periods 
recent developments in february  we purchased from alterra assisted living properties for million and leased them to a subsidiary of alterra for an initial term through  plus renewal options 
in addition  we provided million of mortgage financing to alterra for six assisted living properties 
our investment in properties leased and mortgaged by alterra was part of alterra s bankruptcy reorganization financing 
the alterra bankruptcy court approved the terms of our investment and that approval included an order that payments due to us under the lease and mortgage were accorded administrative priority status under the bankruptcy code 
in october  alterra filed a plan of reorganization that we believed failed to meet certain conditions that we agreed to when we made our investment 
accordingly  we objected to alterra s plan 
in november  we reached a compromise with alterra regarding the revised plan pursuant to which alterra prepaid our mortgage note in full and paid us an additional million 
this million  net of  of costs we incurred related to our objection  is being amortized into our income during the remaining term of the alterra lease 
in december  we purchased assisted living properties with resident capacity of  for million from newseasons 
we funded this acquisition by borrowing under our revolving bank credit facility and with cash on hand 
simultaneously  newseasons leased these facilities from us for an initial term ending in  plus renewal options for up to an additional years 
the rent payable to us will average approximately million per year during the initial lease term  although it will commence at a lower rent of approximately million per year and then increase at agreed times during the lease term 
substantially all of the revenues at these properties are paid by residents from their private resources 
newseasons is a subsidiary of item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued ibc 
ibc is a large regional health insurance company based in philadelphia  pennsylvania  with reported revenues of approximately billion in ibc has guaranteed newseasons rent to us 
in addition  we  newseasons and ibc have entered into an agreement for the possible expansion of our business relationships by adding up to four assisted living properties with resident capacity of these four properties are currently encumbered by mortgage debts 
we intend to purchase these properties if and when these mortgage debts are prepaid or assumed on terms mutually acceptable to us  newseasons  ibc and the lenders 
if we purchase all four of these properties  our purchase price for these additional properties will be million  any that we purchase will be added to the lease for the currently leased properties and rent payable to us will increase 
subsequent to december   we have entered into several transactions with five star  which are discussed below under the heading  related party transactions 
in january  we issued  common shares of beneficial interest  raising net proceeds of million 
these net proceeds were used to repay borrowings outstanding under our revolving bank credit facility 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued liquidity and capital resources our operating liquidity and resources our principal sources of funds for current expenses and distributions to shareholders are rents from our properties 
minimum rents are generally received monthly or quarterly from our tenants and percentage rents are received monthly  quarterly or annually 
this flow of funds has historically been sufficient for us to pay our operating expenses  debt service and distributions 
we believe that our operating cash flow will be sufficient to meet our operating expenses  debt service and distribution payments for the foreseeable future 
our investment and financing liquidity and resources in order to fund acquisitions and to accommodate cash needs that may result from timing differences between our receipt of rents and the need to make distributions or pay operating expenses  we maintain a revolving bank credit facility with a group of commercial banks 
our revolving bank credit facility matures in november and may be extended at our option to november upon payment of an extension fee 
borrowings under the revolving bank credit facility can be up to million and the revolving bank credit facility includes a feature under which the maximum borrowing may be expanded to million  in certain circumstances 
borrowings under our revolving bank credit facility are unsecured 
funds may be borrowed  repaid and reborrowed until maturity  and no principal repayment is due until maturity 
interest on borrowings under the revolving bank credit facility is payable at a spread above libor 
in february  we acquired assisted living facilities and provided mortgage financing for six other assisted living facilities for a total investment of million 
the funding for this transaction was provided by borrowings under our revolving bank credit facility 
in november  the mortgage financing of million was fully repaid 
in april  we issued million of senior unsecured notes due  raising net proceeds  after a discount and costs of issuance  of million 
the net proceeds from this issuance were used to repay amounts outstanding under our revolving bank credit facility and for general business purposes 
in may  we purchased three assisted living facilities for million 
during  in accordance with several of our leases  we funded million of expenditures related to the repair  maintenance or renovation of our properties 
in september  we purchased one independent living property for million 
in december  we purchased assisted living facilities for million 
in march  we purchased one independent and assisted living facility for million 
the funding for these transactions was provided by borrowings under our revolving bank credit facility and cash on hand 
during  we agreed to sell two nursing homes for million  subject to various conditions 
proceeds from the sale of these properties will be used to repay borrowings outstanding under our revolving bank credit facility and for general business purposes 
in january  we issued million of our common shares in a public offering 
the net proceeds of million were used to repay borrowings outstanding on our revolving bank credit facility 
in connection with our december acquisition of assisted living facilities  we agreed to purchase up to an additional four assisted living facilities 
these four properties are currently encumbered by mortgage debts 
we intend to purchase these properties if and when these mortgage debts are prepaid or assumed on terms mutually acceptable to us  the seller and the lenders 
if we purchase all four of these properties  our purchase price for these additional properties will be million 
funding required to complete this transaction is expected to be provided by borrowing under our revolving bank credit facility and cash on hand 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued at december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents and million available under our revolving bank credit facility 
as of march   we had million outstanding and million available under our revolving bank credit facility 
we expect to use cash balances  borrowings under our revolving bank credit facility and net proceeds of offerings of equity or debt securities to fund future property acquisitions  including the future funding for expenditures related to the repair  maintenance or renovation of our properties 
when amounts are outstanding on our revolving bank credit facility and as the maturity dates of our revolving bank credit facility and term debts approach over the longer term  we will explore alternatives for the repayment of amounts due 
such alternatives may include incurring additional long term debt and issuing new equity securities 
as of march   we had billion available on an effective shelf registration statement 
an effective shelf registration statement allows us to issue public securities on an expedited basis  but it does not assure that there will be buyers for such securities 
although there can be no assurance that we will consummate any debt or equity offerings or other financings  we believe we will have access to various types of financing  including debt or equity offerings  with which to finance future acquisitions and to pay our debts and other obligations 
on january   a distribution of per common share was declared with respect to our fourth quarter results 
this distribution was paid to shareholders on february   using cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving bank credit facility 
as of december   our contractual obligations were as follows dollars in thousands payment due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations capital lease obligations ground lease obligations purchase obligations total our term debt maturities are as follows million in  million in  million in  and million in in addition to the long term debt obligations included in the table above  we had million of trust preferred securities outstanding 
as discussed in note of the accompanying financial statements  our subsidiary that has issued these trust preferred securities also holds million of debentures that have been issued by us and which are due in as discussed in note of the accompanying financial statements  the accounting treatment of these trust preferred securities and the related debentures may change in the first quarter of this amount represents the four additional properties we agreed to purchase in connection with our december acquisition 
debt and trust preferred securities covenants our principal debt obligations at december   were our unsecured revolving bank credit facility and our million of unsecured senior notes 
our senior notes are governed by an indenture 
this indenture and related supplements and our revolving bank credit facility contain a number of financial ratio covenants which generally restrict our ability to incur debts  including debts secured by mortgages on our properties in excess of calculated amounts  require us to maintain a minimum net worth  restrict our ability to make distributions under certain circumstances and require us to maintain other ratios 
our trust preferred securities are governed by an indenture which is generally less restrictive than the indenture governing our senior notes and the item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued terms of our revolving bank credit facility 
as of december   we were in compliance with all of the covenants under our indentures and related supplements and our revolving bank credit facility 
none of our indentures and related supplements  our revolving bank credit facility or our other debt obligations contain provisions for acceleration which could be triggered by our debt ratings 
however  under the revolving bank credit facility  our senior debt rating is used to determine the fees and the interest rate payable 
our public debt indenture and related supplements contain cross default provisions to any other debts of million or more 
similarly  a default on our public debt or trust preferred securities indenture would be a default under our revolving bank credit facility 
as of march   we have no commercial paper  derivatives  swaps  hedges  joint ventures or partnerships 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued related party transactions in  hrpt distributed a majority of our shares to its shareholders of record on october  in order to effect this spin off and to govern relations after the spin off  we entered into a transaction agreement with hrpt  pursuant to which it was agreed that so long as hrpt owns more than of our shares  we and hrpt engage the same investment manager  or we and hrpt have one or more common managing trustees  then we will not invest in office buildings  including medical office buildings and clinical laboratory buildings  without the prior consent of hrpt s independent trustees  and hrpt will not invest in properties involving senior housing without the prior consent of our independent trustees 
if an investment involves both office and senior housing components  the character of the investment will be determined by building area  excluding common areas  unless our board and hrpt s board otherwise agree at the time 
these provisions do not apply to any investments hrpt held at the time of the spin off 
also as part of the transaction agreement  we agreed to subject our ability to waive ownership restrictions contained in our charter to the consent of hrpt s trustees so long as hrpt owns more than of our outstanding voting or equity interest 
on december   we distributed substantially all of our shares of five star to our shareholders of record on december  in order to effect this spin off and to govern relations after the spin off  we entered into agreements with five star  pursuant to which it was agreed that so long as we remain a real estate investment trust  five star may not waive the share ownership restrictions in its charter on the ability of any person or group to acquire more than of any class of its equity shares without  among other requirements  our consent and five star s determination that the exception to the ownership limitations would not cause a default under any of its leases  so long as five star is our tenant  five star will neither permit any person or group to acquire more than of any class of five star s voting stock or permit the occurrence of other change in control events  as defined  nor will five star take any action that  in the reasonable judgment of us or hrpt  might jeopardize the tax status of us or hrpt as a real estate investment trust  we have the option  upon the acquisition by a person or group of more than of five star s voting stock and upon other change in control events of five star  as defined  to cancel all of five star s rights under its leases with us  and so long as five star maintains its shared service agreement with rmr or is a tenant under a lease with us  five star will not acquire or finance any real estate without first giving us  hrpt  hospitality properties trust  or hpt  or any other publicly owned real estate investment trust or other entity managed by rmr the opportunity to acquire or finance real estate investments of the type in which we  hrpt  hpt or any other publicly owned real estate investment trust or other entity managed by rmr  respectively  invest 
at the time five star was spun off from us  all of the persons serving as directors of five star were also our trustees 
two of our trustees  messrs 
martin and portnoy  are current directors of five star 
as of december   we leased senior living communities to five star for total annual minimum rent of million 
during  we and five star were jointly involved in litigation with marriott and msls  the operator of of the senior living communities which we leased to five star 
we and five star equally shared the costs of this litigation 
this litigation was settled in january item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued since january   we have entered or agreed to enter into several transactions with five star  including the following during  pursuant to the terms of our leases with five star  we purchased million of improvements to our properties leased by five star  and the annual rent payable to us by five star was increased by of the amounts invested  or million 
in march  one of our private company tenants defaulted its lease for a nursing home in missouri 
we terminated this lease and engaged five star to manage this property for our account 
currently  this property is listed for sale or lease 
five star is paid a management fee of of the gross revenues at this nursing home  totaling  through december  in may  we purchased from an unrelated third party three assisted living properties with living units located in virginia for million 
in september  we purchased from five star one independent living property with units in california for million  its appraised value 
these four properties were added to our existing lease with five star for nine other independent and assisted living properties 
the annual minimum rent for the properties included in this lease increased by million 
all other terms of the lease remained unchanged 
in july  we agreed to sell to five star two nursing homes in michigan that we leased to five star 
the purchase price is million  the appraised value of the properties 
these two properties are leased on a combined basis with other nursing home properties 
under the terms of our lease with five star  upon consummation of the sale  the annual rent payable under the combined lease will be reduced by of the net proceeds that we received from the sale 
we expect the sale of these properties to occur during the first half of however  this sale is contingent upon five star s obtaining department of housing and urban development insured financing for its purchase  and this sale may not close because of a failure of this condition or for some other reason 
on march   we purchased from five star one independent and assisted living facility with units located in maryland 
the purchase price was million  the appraised value of the property 
simultaneous with this purchase  our existing leases with five star were modified as follows the lease for nursing homes and the lease for independent and assisted living facilities were combined into one lease and the property acquired on march  was added to this combined lease  the combined lease maturity date was changed to december  from december  and for the separate leases  the minimum rent for the combined lease of nursing homes and independent living facilities was increased by million  and for all of our leases with five star  the amount of additional rent to be paid to us was changed to of the increase in revenues at the leased properties beginning in all other lease terms remained substantially unchanged 
in october  we entered into an agreement between us and hrpt  pursuant to which we agreed to file a registration statement with respect to our shares held by hrpt and use reasonable efforts to effect the registration of those shares 
hrpt paid the expenses of this registration 
the registration statement became effective october  in january and february  we completed a public offering of million of our common shares 
in a simultaneous offering  hrpt sold  of our shares which it owned 
we and hrpt were parties to a joint underwriting agreement in connection with this offering 
we did not receive any proceeds from the sale of our shares by hrpt  but hrpt paid its pro rata share of the expenses of this offering 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued rmr provides investment  management and administrative services to us under an advisory agreement which is renewed annually if the renewal is approved by a majority of our independent trustees 
rmr is compensated at an annual rate equal to a percentage of our average real estate investments  as defined 
the percentage applied to our investments at the time we were spun off from hrpt is 
the annual compensation percentage for the first million of investments made since our spin off from hrpt is and thereafter is 
rmr may also earn an incentive fee based upon increases in our funds from operations per share  as defined 
the incentive fee payable to rmr is paid in common shares 
aggregate fees earned by rmr for services during were million  including  as an incentive fee which will be paid in common shares in april rmr is owned by messrs 
martin and portnoy who are our managing trustees 
messrs 
martin and portnoy each have material interests in the transactions between us and rmr described above 
all transactions between us and rmr are approved by our independent trustees 
our independent trustees have approved the renewal of the advisory agreement for its term which will end december  critical accounting policies our critical accounting policies are those that have the most impact on the reporting of our financial condition and results of operations and those requiring significant judgments and estimates 
we believe that our judgments and assessments are consistently applied and produce financial information that fairly presents our results of operations 
our three most critical accounting policies concern our investments in real property and are allocation of purchase price and recognition of depreciation expense 
the acquisition cost of each real property investment is allocated to various property components such as land  buildings and improvements  and each component generally has a different useful life 
acquisition cost allocations and the determination of the useful lives are based on our management s estimates or  under some circumstances  studies commissioned from independent real estate appraisal firms 
for real estate acquired subsequent to june   the effective date of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations  we allocate the value of real estate acquired among building  land  furniture  fixtures and equipment  the value of in place leases and the fair market value of above or below market leases and customer relationships 
we compute related depreciation expense using the straight line method over estimated useful lives of up to years for buildings and improvements  and up to years for personal property 
the value of intangible assets is amortized over the term of the respective lease 
the allocated cost of land is not depreciated 
inappropriate allocation of acquisition costs or incorrect estimates of useful lives could result in depreciation and amortization expenses which do not appropriately reflect the allocation of our capital expenditures over future periods required by generally accepted accounting principles 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued impairment of assets 
we periodically evaluate our real property investments for impairment indicators 
these indicators may include weak or declining tenant profitability  cash flow or liquidity  our decision to dispose of an asset before the end of its estimated useful life and market or industry changes that could permanently reduce the value of our investments 
if indicators of impairment are present  we evaluate the carrying value of the related real property investment by comparing it to the expected future undiscounted cash flows to be generated from that property 
if the sum of these expected future cash flows is less than the carrying value  we reduce the net carrying value of the property to the present value of these expected future cash flows 
this analysis requires us to judge whether indicators of impairment exist and to estimate likely future cash flows 
if we misjudge or estimate incorrectly or if future tenant profitability  market or industry factors differ from our expectations we may record an impairment charge which is inappropriate or fail to record a charge when we should have done so  or the amount of such charges may be inaccurate 
classification of leases 
our real property investments are generally leased on a triple net basis  pursuant to non cancelable  fixed term  operating leases 
each time we enter a new lease or materially modify an existing lease we evaluate its classification as either a capital lease or operating lease 
the classification of a lease as capital or operating affects the carrying value of a property  as well as our recognition of rental payments as revenue 
these evaluations require us to make estimates of  among other things  the remaining useful life and market value of a leased property  discount rates and future cash flows 
incorrect assumptions or estimates may result in misclassification of our leases 
these policies involve significant judgments based upon our experience  including judgments about current valuations  ultimate realizable value  estimated useful lives  salvage or residual values  the ability of our tenants and operators to perform their obligations to us  and the current and likely future operating and competitive environments in which our properties are operated 
in the future we may need to revise our assessments to incorporate information which is not now known  and such revisions could increase or decrease our depreciation expense related to properties we own  result in the classification of our leases as other than operating leases or decrease the carrying values of our assets 
during  we assumed the operations of nursing homes from bankrupt former tenants  pursuant to negotiated settlement agreements 
during the first quarter of  we obtained substantially all of the healthcare regulatory licenses and medicare and medicaid provider agreements necessary for these nursing home operations  and we consolidated the nursing home operations effective january  with respect to the consolidated facilities operations  our most critical accounting policies in involved revenue recognition and our assessment of the net realizable value of the facilities accounts receivable 
these policies involved significant judgments based upon our experience  including judgments about changes in governmental payment methodology  contract modifications and economic conditions that affect the collectibility of the facilities accounts receivable 
as a result of the five star spin off on december   we no longer operate any facilities 
also  the accounts receivable related to facilities operations were transferred to five star as part of the initial capitalization of five star 
impact of inflation inflation might have both positive and negative impacts upon us 
inflation might cause the value of our real estate investments to increase 
in an inflationary environment  the percentage rents which we receive based upon a percentage of our tenants revenues should increase 
offsetting these benefits  inflation might cause our costs of equity and debt capital and other operating costs to increase 
an increase in our capital costs or in our operating costs will result in decreased earnings unless it is offset by increased revenues 
in periods of rapid inflation  our tenants operating costs may increase faster than revenues and this fact may have an adverse impact upon us if our tenants operating income from our properties becomes insufficient to pay our rent 
to mitigate the adverse impact of increased operating costs at our leased properties  we generally require our tenants to guarantee our rent 
to mitigate the adverse impact of increased costs of debt capital in the event of material inflation  we item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued previously have purchased interest rate cap agreements and we may enter into similar interest rate hedge arrangements in the future 
the decision to enter into these agreements was and will be based on the amount of floating rate debt outstanding  our belief that material interest rate increases are likely to occur and upon requirements of our borrowing arrangements 
impact of government reimbursement approximately of our current annual rents come from properties where approximately or more of the operating revenues are derived from residents who pay from their own private resources 
of the remaining of our rents which come from properties where the revenues are heavily dependent upon medicare and medicaid programs  the operations of these properties currently produce sufficient cash flow to support our rent 
however  as discussed above in business government regulation and reimbursement  we expect that medicare and medicaid rates paid to our tenants may not increase in amounts sufficient to pay our tenants increased operating costs  or that they may even decline 
also  the hospitals we lease to healthsouth are heavily dependent upon medicare revenues 
as discussed in item  reports of erroneous financial statements by healthsouth have called into question whether those hospitals in fact produce sufficient revenues to pay our rent 
we cannot predict whether our tenants which are affected by medicare and medicaid rates will be able to continue to pay their rent obligations if these expected circumstances occur and persist for an extended time 
seasonality nursing home and assisted living operations have historically reflected modest seasonality 
during calendar fourth quarter holiday periods  residents at such facilities are sometimes discharged to join in family celebrations and admission decisions are often deferred 
the first quarter of each calendar year usually coincides with increased illness among residents which can result in increased costs or discharges to hospitals 
as a result of these factors and others  these operations sometimes produce greater earnings in the second and third quarters of each calendar year and lesser earnings in the fourth and first calendar quarters 
we do not expect these seasonal differences to have a material impact upon the ability of our tenants to pay our rent 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to risks associated with market changes in interest rates 
we manage our exposure to this market risk by monitoring available financing alternatives 
our strategy to manage exposure to changes in interest rates is unchanged from december  other than as described below  we do not foresee any significant changes in our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates or in how we plan to manage this exposure in the near future 
at december   our outstanding debt included million of senior unsecured notes due in and million of senior unsecured notes due in the interest on these notes is payable semi annually 
no principal payments are due under these notes until maturity 
because these notes bear interest at a fixed rate  changes in market interest rates during the term of this debt will not affect our operating results 
if at maturity these notes are refinanced at interest rates which are higher than the current rate  our per annum interest cost would increase by approximately million 
we are allowed to make prepayments of these senior notes  in whole or in part  at par plus a premium  as defined 
prior to april   we may redeem up to of the senior notes with the net cash proceeds of qualified equity offerings  as defined 
these prepayment rights may afford us the opportunity to mitigate the risk of refinancing at maturity 
changes in market interest rates also affect the fair value of our debt obligations  increases in market interest rates decrease the fair value of our fixed rate debt  while decreases in market interest rates increase the fair value of our fixed rate debt 
our total fixed rate debt obligations outstanding at december   was million  including the million of notes due in  million of notes due in and mortgage notes totaling million due in based on the balances outstanding at december   and discounted cash flow analysis through the maturity date of our fixed rated debt obligations  a hypothetical immediate change in interest rates would change the fair value of those obligations by approximately million 
at december   we had million of trust preferred securities outstanding  the dividends on which are dependent upon our making required payments on our junior subordinated debentures due no principal repayments are due on the debentures until maturity 
if the debentures were to be refinanced at interest rates which are higher than the current rate  our per annum interest cost would increase  our trust preferred securities are listed on the nyse and their market value is principally determined by supply and demand factors 
the market price of our debentures may be sensitive to changes in interest rates  similar to our unsecured senior notes discussed above 
based on the balance outstanding at december   and discounted cash flow analysis through the maturity date of the trust preferred securities  a hypothetical immediate change in interest rates would change the fair value of our fixed rate debentures by approximately million 
our debentures have provisions that allow us to make repayments earlier than the stated maturity date 
these prepayment rights may afford us the opportunity to mitigate the risk of refinancing at maturity at higher rates by refinancing at lower rates prior to maturity 
our ability to prepay the debentures at par  beginning june   will also effect the change in the fair value of the debentures which would result from a change in interest rates 
for example  using discounted cash flow analysis  a change in interest rates calculated from december  to the first par prepayment option date for our trust preferred securities would change the value of those securities by approximately item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk continued our unsecured revolving bank credit facility bears interest at floating rates and matures in november as of december   we had million outstanding and million available for borrowing under our revolving bank credit facility 
repayments under our revolving bank credit facility may be made at any time without penalty 
we borrow in us dollars and borrowings under our revolving bank credit facility require interest at libor plus a premium 
accordingly  we are vulnerable to changes in us dollar based short term rates  specifically libor 
a change in interest rates would not affect the value of this floating rate debt but would affect our operating results 
for example  the interest rate payable on our outstanding indebtedness of million at december   was per annum 
the following table presents the impact a change in interest rates would have on our floating rate interest expense as of december  dollars in thousands impact of changes in interest rates interest rate per year outstanding debt total interest expense per year at december  reduction increase the foregoing table shows the impact of an immediate change in floating interest rates 
if interest rates were to change gradually over time  the impact would be spread over time 
our exposure to fluctuations in floating interest rates will increase or decrease in the future with increases or decreases in the outstanding amount under our revolving bank credit facility or other floating rate obligations
