item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
accounting for the allowances for loan losses involves significant judgments and assumptions by management which have a material impact on the carrying value of net loans receivable 
management considers the accounting for loan valuation allowances to be a critical accounting policy 
the judgments and assumptions used by management are based on historical experience and other factors  which are believed reasonable under the circumstances as described in the business loan loss allowance section 
risks and uncertainties in the normal course of business  the company encounters two significant types of risk economic risk and regulatory risk 
economic risk there are three main components of economic risk credit risk  collateral risk and market risk which includes interest rate risk 
credit risk credit risk is the risk of default in the company s loan portfolio that results from a borrower s inability to make contractually required payments 
see loss provision and non performing assets 
the determination of the allowance for loan losses and the valuation of real estate collateral are based on estimates that are susceptible to changes in the economic environment and market conditions 
no loan loss provision was recorded during a downward turn in the current economic climate could increase the likelihood of losses due to credit risks 
this could create the need for additional loan loss provisions 
collateral risk collateral risk is the risk that the collateral securing the bank s loans  primarily real estate  declines in value 
a downward turn in the real estate market could increase the likelihood of losses if the loan exceeds the value of the collateral 
this could create the need for additional loan loss provisions 
market risk market risk is the risk of loss from unfavorable changes in market prices and interest rates 
the bank s market risk arises primarily from the interest rate risk inherent in its lending and deposit taking activities 
should there be an economic or market downturn or if market interest rates increase significantly  the bank could experience a material increase in the level of loan defaults and charge offs 
see asset liability management in quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for additional information relating to market risk 
regulatory risk regulatory risk is the risk that the regulators will reach different conclusions than management regarding the financial position of the company 
the ots examines the bank s financial results annually 
the ots reviews the allowance for loan losses and may require the bank to adjust the allowance based on information available at the time of their examination 
other risks inflation inflation substantially impacts the financial position and operations of financial intermediaries  such as banks and savings institutions 
these entities primarily hold monetary assets and liabilities and  as such  can experience significant purchasing power gains and losses over relatively short periods of time 
in addition  interest rate changes during inflationary periods change the amounts and composition of assets and liabilities held by financial intermediaries and could result in regulatory pressure for increasing the bank s capital 
pending lawsuits the bank has been named as a defendant in various lawsuits  none of which is expected to have a materially adverse effect on the company 
overview the company s results of operations are primarily affected by its levels of net interest income  provisions for loan losses  non interest income  non interest expense and income taxes 
the company s results are strongly influenced by the southern california economy in which it operates and the direction and level of general market interest rates 
net earnings of million or per diluted share were recorded in  compared to net earnings of million or per diluted share in and net earnings of million or per diluted share in net earnings increased from to due to higher net interest income  higher prepayment fees and reduced operating expenses 
in addition  there was a million reduction in net tax provision resulting from a change in the california tax law relating to bad debts 
the increase in net earnings from to was primarily due to higher net interest income and gain on sale of loans of million from a revised estimate of the bank s repurchase liability for loans sold with recourse 
consolidated assets at the end of were billion  representing a increase from billion at the end of and a increase from billion at the end of the increase in assets during is attributable to increased loan origination activity

the bank met the regulatory capital standards necessary to be deemed well capitalized at december  see capital requirements 
components of earnings net interest income net interest income is the primary component of the company s earnings 
the chief determinants of net interest income are the dollar amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the interest rates earned or paid thereon 
the greater the excess of average interest earning assets over average interest bearing liabilities  the more beneficial the impact on net interest income 
the excess of average interest earning assets over average interest bearing liabilities was million in  million in and million in the increase over the last three years was due to accumulated earnings 
the company s net interest income is impacted by a time lag before changes in the cost of funds can be passed along to monthly adjustable rate loan customers 
savings and borrowing costs adjust to market rates quickly while it takes several months for loan yields to adjust 
this time lag decreases the company s net interest income during periods of rising interest rates 
the reverse is true during periods of declining interest rates 
see asset liability management in quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for further discussion

non performing assets decreased to million in from million in and million in due to improvement in the economy and real estate markets in which the bank operates 
the bank has a policy of providing for general valuation allowances  unallocated to any specific loan  but available to offset any loan losses 
the allowance is maintained at an amount that management believes adequate to cover estimable and probable loan losses 
the company also maintains valuation allowances for impaired loans and loans sold with recourse 
see business loan loss allowance 
management performs regular risk assessments of the bank s loan portfolio to maintain appropriate valuation allowances 
additional loan loss provisions may be required to the extent that charge offs are recorded against the valuation allowance for impaired loans  the general valuation allowance  or the repurchase liability for loans sold with recourse 
the company recorded net loan recoveries of thousand during  thousand during and thousand during the recoveries resulted from cash payments by borrowers on loans that had been previously charged off 
non interest income loan servicing and other fees were million in compared to million in and million in the increase in fees during was due to an increase in loan prepayments fees 
fees earned during and include reductions of thousand and thousand  respectively  to provide for impairment of the bank s servicing asset due to accelerated payoffs and prepayments of loans serviced for others 
there were no such reductions during banking service fees were million in compared to million in and million in the increase in these fees is due to an increase in fee generating deposit accounts 
gain on sale of loans was million in  million in and thousand in loan sales were million  million and million during  and  respectively 
the gain realized on cash loan sales was thousand  million and thousand in  and  respectively 
cash gains fluctuate due to changes in market pricing based on interest rate trends 
also  the dollar amount of loans originated for sale varies based on the availability of attractive fixed rate loan programs to borrowers compared to the bank s adjustable rate loan programs 
in addition to cash gains  gain on sale of loans includes adjustments from prior years sales 
during  the bank revised its current estimate of the required repurchase liability for loans sold with recourse from million to million 
during  the bank revised its current estimate of the required repurchase liability for loans sold with recourse from million to million 
this reduced liability amount reflects the fact that the total portfolio of loans sold with recourse has been experiencing significant pay offs  and has had better credit experience than previously estimated 
as a result  included in gain on sale of loans for is a million adjustment to the bank s repurchase liability for loans sold with recourse 
included in gain on sale of loans for is a million adjustment to the bank s repurchase liability for loans sold with recourse 
the company s repurchase liability for loans sold with recourse represents the total losses that are estimated to occur over the remaining life of the portfolio of loans sold with recourse  discounted to present value 
real estate operations resulted in a net gain of thousand in  thousand in and thousand in real estate operations include gain on sale of foreclosed properties  operational income and expense during the holding period  and recoveries of prior losses on real estate sold 
non interest expense the ratio of non interest expense to average total assets was for  for and for the decrease during compared to is primarily the result of a reduction in legal and advertising costs 
the higher ratio during is the result of increased compensation and legal costs and a decrease in average total assets

as part of its asset liability management strategy  the bank has maintained a high level of adjustable loans in its portfolio for several years 
during  the bank focused on marketing adjustable loans based on the codi 
at december   codi loans comprised of the loan portfolio 
management believes that the high level of adjustable rate mortgages will help insulate the bank from fluctuations in interest rates  notwithstanding the several month time lag between a change in its monthly cost of funds and a corresponding change in its loan yields 
see asset liability management 
the bank also originates adjustable rate loans with initial fixed interest rates with periods ranging from to years 
by policy  the bank will either match the fixed rate period of these loans with borrowings for the same term or will hold unmatched fixed rate loans in its portfolio up to of total assets 
management believes that the limited origination of these hybrid fixed rate loans will enhance the company s overall return on assets 
loans originated under the hybrid programs totaled million in  million in and billion in the following table summarizes loan originations and purchases by loan type for the periods indicated december  in thousands fixed   hybrid   adjustable mat   codi   cofi   libor   prime   total   in  and  the bank placed thousand  million and million  respectively  in mortgages with other lenders under fee arrangements

any interest not fully paid by such lower first year payments is added to the principal balance of the loan 
this  as well as shortfalls resulting from a annual payment cap  causes negative amortization until payments increase to cover interest and principal repayment shortfalls 
due to negative amortization  loan to value ratios may increase above those calculated at the inception of the loan 
the bank does not normally lend in excess of of the appraised collateral value on adjustable mortgage loans amls 
where the bank does lend in excess of of the appraised value  additional fees and rates are charged 
mortgage insurance is required on loans in excess of or premium rates and or fees are charged if the mortgage insurance requirement is waived

loans sold with recourse the bank has loss exposure on certain loans sold with recourse 
these loans are substantially all secured by multi family properties 
loans sold with recourse totaled million as of december   million as of december  and million as of december  although no longer owned by the bank  these loans are evaluated for the purposes of computing the repurchase liability and measuring risk exposure for regulatory capital

non performing assets non performing assets  as defined by the bank  include loans delinquent over days or in foreclosure  real estate acquired in settlement of loans  and other loans less than days delinquent but for which collectibility is questionable 
the table below details the amounts of non performing assets by type of collateral

total real estate owned     non performing loans single family      multi family   commercial and industrial other less valuation allowance total non performing loans      total      ratio of non performing assets to total assets the decrease in non performing loans over the last several years is due to reductions in delinquent loans and non performing loans due to continued strength in the southern california real estate markets 
single family non performing loans are primarily due to factors such as unemployment and declining personal income 
multi family and commercial non performing loans are attributable primarily to factors such as declines in occupancy rates  employment rates and rental rates 
the bank actively monitors the status of all non performing loans 
impaired loans totaled million  million and million  net of related allowances of thousand  thousand and million as of december   and  respectively 
see business non accrual  past due  impaired and restructured loans for further discussion of impaired loans 
the bank s modified loans result primarily from temporary modifications of principal and interest payments or an extension of maturity dates 
under these arrangements  loan terms are typically reduced to no less than a required monthly interest payment 
any loss of revenues under the modified terms would be immaterial to the bank 
if the borrower is unable to return to scheduled principal and interest payments at the end of the modification period  foreclosure procedures are initiated  or  in certain circumstances  the modification period is extended 
as of december   the bank had modified loans totaling million  net of loan loss allowances of thousand 
this compares with million and million  net of allowances  as of december  and december  respectively 
modified loans included as impaired loans totaled million  million and million  net of valuation allowances  as of december   and  respectively 
no modified loans were days or more delinquent as of december   or capital resources and liquidity liquidity requirements in july  the ots removed the regulation that required a savings institution to maintain an average daily balance of liquid assets of at least four percent of its liquidity base  and retained a provision requiring a savings institution to maintain sufficient liquidity to ensure its safe and sound operation 
the determination of what constitutes safe and sound operation was left to the discretion of management 
the bank s strategy is to keep cash and liquid investments at a modest level due to the availability of credit lines 
after the repeal of the liquidity regulation  the bank s liquidity policy was modified to include unused borrowing capacity in the definition of available liquidity 
the bank s current liquidity policy requires that cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and unused borrowing capacity be maintained at a minimum level of of the bank s liquidity base defined as deposits and borrowings due within one year 
as of december   liquidity qualifying balances were of the bank s liquidity base 
external sources of funds external sources of funds include deposits  loan sales  advances from the fhlb and reverse repurchase agreements reverse repos 
for purposes of funding asset growth  the source or sources of funds with the lowest total cost for the desired term are generally selected 
the incremental source of funds used most often during the last three years were advances from the fhlb 
deposits are accepted from full service banking branches  national deposit brokers brokered deposits and telemarketing sources 
the cost of funds  operating margins and net earnings of the bank associated with brokered and telemarketing deposits are generally comparable to the cost of funds  operating margins and net earnings of the bank associated with deposits  fhlb borrowings and repurchase agreements 
as the cost of each source of funds fluctuates from time to time  based on market rates of interest offered by the bank and other depository institutions  the bank selects funds from the lowest cost source until the relative costs change 
as the cost of funds  operating margins and net earnings of the bank associated with each source of funds are generally comparable  the bank does not deem the impact of its use of any one of the specific sources of funds at a given time to be material 
deposits at full service banking branches were billion at december   billion as of december  and billion at december management attributes the increase in deposits over the last two years to increased deposits from stock market investors wanting more security for their investments due to price volatility in the stock market 
deposits obtained from national brokerage firms brokered deposits are considered a source of funds similar to a borrowing 
in evaluating brokered deposits as a source of funds  the cost of these deposits  including commission fees  is compared to other funding sources 
the bank had no brokered deposits at december  this compares to million at december  and million at december  utilization of brokered deposits decreased during due to the availability of cash from loan payoffs and growth in full service branch deposits 
telemarketing deposits decreased by million to million at the end of this compares with million at the end of and million at the end of these deposits are normally large deposits from pension plans  managed trusts and other financial institutions 
the level of telemarketing deposits varies based on the activity of investors  who are typically professional money managers 
the availability of telemarketing deposits also varies based on the investors perception of the bank s creditworthiness 
during  the balance of telemarketing deposits decreased as a result of cash flows from loan payoffs and growth in full service branch deposits 
loan sales were million in this compares to million during and million during loan sales increased during and due to the increased demand by clients for year and year fixed rate mortgages which are originated by the bank for sale to other financial institutions 
fhlb advances were billion at the end of  billion at the end of and billion at the end of borrowings from the fhlb increased during in order to fund loan originations which grew to billion during compared to billion during these funds were the most cost effective in when compared to deposit broker and telemarketing funds 
reverse repurchase agreements are short term borrowings secured by mortgage backed and investment securities 
these borrowings decreased to million at the end of from million at the end of and million at the end of borrowings under reverse repurchase agreements have decreased over the last three years due to prepayments of the underlying mortgage collateral 
the bank has not securitized any mortgage loans for use in collateralized borrowings for several years 
internal sources of funds internal sources of funds include loan principal payments  loan payoffs  and positive cash flows from operations 
principal payments were billion in compared to billion in and billion in principal payments include both scheduled principal paydowns and prepayments which are a function of real estate activity and the general level of interest rates 
the increase in prepayments has been attributable to the low level of interest rates available on year and year fixed rate loans available to customers 
the company anticipates that it will have sufficient funds available to fund current loan origination activity 
at december   the company has a credit facility with the fhlb in the form of advances and lines of credit which allow borrowings of up to of the bank s assets as computed for regulatory purposes 
at december   this amounted to approximately billion 
at december  the company had billion in advances from the fhlb 
certificates of deposits which have contractual maturities of one year or less from december   totaled million 
if a significant portion of the maturing certificates are not renewed at maturity  the company s other sources of liquidity include principal and interest payments on loans  proceeds from loan sales and other borrowings  such as reverse repurchase transactions 
the company could also choose to pay higher rates to maintain maturing deposits  which could result in an increased cost of funds 
historically  the company has retained a significant portion of maturing deposits 
while management anticipates that there may be some outflow of these deposits upon maturity due to the current competitive rate environment  these are not expected to have a material impact on the long term liquidity position of the company 
the table below details the amounts of the company s contractual obligations by maturity at december  payments due by period less than more than total year years years years in thousands fixed rate term certificates     fhlb advances      reverse repurchase agreements   operating lease obligations      total      capital requirements current ots regulatory capital standards require that the bank maintain tangible capital of at least of total assets  core capital of of total assets  and risk based capital of of total risk weighted assets 
among other things  failure to comply with these capital standards will result in restrictions on asset growth and necessitate the preparation of a capital plan  subject to regulatory approval 
generally  any institution with a risk based capital ratio in excess of and a core capital ratio greater than is considered well capitalized for regulatory purposes 
institutions who maintain this capital level can utilize brokered deposits at their discretion 
additionally  if they achieve a sufficient ranking on their regulatory examination  they may be assessed lower deposit insurance premiums 
management presently intends to maintain its capital position at levels above those required by regulators to ensure operating flexibility and growth capacity for the bank 
the bank s capital position is actively monitored by management 
the bank met the regulatory capital standards to be deemed well capitalized for purposes of the various regulatory measures of capital including the prompt corrective action regulations 
the following table summarizes the capital ratios of the well capitalized category and the bank s regulatory capital position at december  as compared to such ratios 
as indicated in the table  the bank s capital levels exceeded the three minimum capital ratios of the well capitalized category december  amount dollars in thousands core capital requirement  bank s core capital  excess core capital  tier risk based capital requirement  bank s tier risk based capital  excess tier risk based capital  risk based capital requirement  bank s risk based capital  excess risk based capital  item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk asset liability management the bank s primary objective in managing interest rate risk is to minimize the adverse impact of changes in interest rates on the bank s net interest income and capital  while  at the same time  adjusting the bank s asset liability mix to achieve the most favorable impact on earnings 
the bank s asset liability management policy is designed to improve the balance between the maturities and repricings of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities in order to better insulate net earnings from interest rate fluctuations 
under this program  the bank emphasizes the funding of monthly adjustable mortgages with short term savings and borrowings and matching the maturities of these assets and liabilities 
the bank also originates adjustable rate loans with initial fixed interest rates for periods ranging from to years 
by policy  the bank will either match the fixed rate period of these loans with borrowings for the same term or will hold unmatched fixed rate loans in its portfolio up to of total assets 
at the end of  of the bank s loans had adjustable interest rates based on monthly changes in the cofi  were based on the mat index and were based on the codi 
comparisons over the last several years show that changes in the bank s cost of funds generally correlate with changes in these indices 
the bank does not use any futures  options or swaps in its asset liability strategy 
assets and liabilities that are subject to repricing are considered rate sensitive 
the mis match in the repricing of rate sensitive assets and liabilities is referred to as a company s gap 
the gap is positive if rate sensitive assets exceed rate sensitive liabilities for any specified repricing term 
generally  a positive gap benefits a company during periods of increasing interest rates 
the reverse is true during periods of decreasing interest rates 
the indices used by the bank s real estate loans lag changes in interest rates from to days while prime based business loans re price immediately 
however  the bank s short term savings and borrowing costs adjust quickly causing net interest income to initially decrease during periods of rising interest rates and increase during periods of declining interest rates 
the movement of interest rates  whether up or down  cannot be accurately predicted and could have a negative impact on the earnings of the bank 
the following table shows the interest sensitivity of the bank s assets and liabilities by repricing period at december  and the consolidated gap position as a percentage of total assets at that time interest sensitivity gap balances balances balances balances repricing repricing repricing total balance repricing within within after within year years years years dollars in thousands interest earning assets fhlb and other interest earning deposits   investment securities  at fair value      mortgage backed securities  at fair value   loans receivable      total interest earning assets      interest bearing liabilities demand accounts   fixed rate term certificates     fhlb advances     reverse repurchase agreements   total interest bearing liabilities     interest sensitivity gap      interest sensitivity gap as a percentage of total assets cumulative interest sensitivity gap     cumulative interest sensitivity gap as a percentage of total assets in order to minimize the impact of rate fluctuations on earnings  management s goal is to keep the one year gap at less than of total assets positive or negative 
at december   the bank s one year gap ratio was a positive million or of total assets 
this compares with a positive gap ratio of of total assets at december  and a negative gap ratio of of total assets at december  the increase in the positive one year gap at december  from the gap at december  is due to an increase in the bank s origination of monthly adjustable rate loans and the early repayment of hybrid loans 
the change to a positive one year gap at december  from a negative gap at december  was due to the bank extending the maturities of its fhlb advances in order to match the fixed rate period of its hybrid loans 
another measure of interest rate risk  that is required to be performed by ots regulated institutions  is an analysis specified by ots thrift bulletin tb a  management of interest rate risk  investment securities  and derivatives activities 
under this regulation institutions are required to establish limits on the sensitivity of their net interest income and net portfolio value to changes in interest rates 
such changes in interest rates are defined as instantaneous and sustained movements in interest rates in basis point increments 
the following table shows the estimated impact of a parallel shift in interest rates on the bank s net portfolio value at december  and december  percentage change in interest rates change in net portfolio value in basis points the percentage change represents the projected change in the net portfolio value of the bank in a stable interest rate environment versus the net portfolio value in the various rate scenarios 
the ots defines net portfolio value as the present value of expected cash flows from existing assets minus the present value of expected cash flows from existing liabilities 
a downward shift in interest rates of basis points or basis points for both december  and december  levels would result in negative interest rates in many cases
