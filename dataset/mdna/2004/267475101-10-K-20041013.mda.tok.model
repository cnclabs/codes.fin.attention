item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading provider of specialty contracting services 
these services are provided throughout the united states and include engineering  construction  installation and maintenance services to telecommunications providers  underground locating services to various utilities  and electrical and other construction and maintenance services to electric utilities and others 
due to the nature of the services we provide  our revenues may fluctuate as a result of changes in the capital expenditure and maintenance budgets of our customers  as well as the general level of construction activity 
factors impacting the capital expenditure and maintenance budgets of our customers include consumer demands on telecom providers  actions of the federal communications commission and general economic conditions 
for the fiscal year ended july   specialty contracting services related to the telecommunications industry  underground utility locating and electrical and other utilities contributed approximately  and  respectively  to our total contract revenues 
in december  we acquired utiliquest for approximately million 
in fiscal  we borrowed million under our credit agreement in connection with the acquisition of utiliquest 
we repaid this debt during the third quarter of fiscal utiliquest is a provider of utility locating services 
in november  we acquired substantially all of the assets of first south and assumed certain liabilities associated with these assets for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million  including the issuance of approximately  shares of our common stock 
in conjunction with the acquisition  we also paid approximately million for excess working capital consisting primarily of accounts receivable and unbilled revenue 
we paid the purchase price of first south from cash on hand 
first south provides specialty contracting services to telecommunications customers 
in february  we acquired all of the outstanding stock of arguss for approximately million shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million before various transaction costs 
all of these acquisitions were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and the company s results include the results of these entities from their respective acquisition dates 
as part of our growth strategy  we may acquire companies that expand  complement  or diversify our business 
we regularly review various strategic opportunities and periodically engage in discussions regarding such possible acquisitions 
our ability to sustain growth and maintain our competitive position may be affected by our ability to achieve our acquisition strategy and successfully integrate any businesses acquired 
we provide a significant portion of our services pursuant to multi year master service agreements 
master service agreements generally have the following characteristics contract periods of one or more years  exclusivity and customer specified service requirements 
in addition  master service agreements typically provide that we will furnish a specified unit of service for a specified unit price ie fiber optic cable will be installed underground for a specified rate of dollars per foot 
in some cases  a customer may terminate these agreements for convenience with at least days prior written notice 
although historically master service agreements have been awarded through a competitive bidding process  recent trends have been toward securing or extending such contracts on negotiated terms 
we are currently a party to approximately master service agreements  including approximately of these contracts from our utiliquest acquisition 
the remainder of our services are provided pursuant to contracts for particular jobs 
long term contracts relate to specific projects with terms in excess of one year from the contract date 
short term contracts are generally from three to four months in duration  depending upon the size of the project 
a portion of our contracts include retainage provisions under which to of the contract invoicing is withheld subject to project completion and acceptance by the customer 
contract revenues from multi year master service agreements represented and of total contract revenues in fiscal and  respectively  and contract revenues from long term contracts  including multi year master service agreements  represented and of total contract revenues  respectively 
the increase is primarily due to agreements in place at utiliquest which was acquired in december 
table of contents we derive a significant amount of our revenue from telecommunications companies 
during fiscal and into fiscal  certain segments of the telecommunications industry suffered a severe downturn that has resulted in certain of our customers experiencing financial difficulties 
several of our customers filed for bankruptcy protection  including adelphia and worldcom  inc worldcom 
at july   we had pre petition outstanding receivables from adelphia of approximately million after a write down of million 
in fiscal  we sold the adelphia accounts receivables and recorded an million gain on the sale 
during fiscal  management determined that the likelihood of payment from worldcom was low and we fully wrote off the receivable amount of million 
in fiscal  we had a recovery of approximately million on the worldcom receivables 
the downturn in the telecommunications industry in fiscal and adversely affected capital expenditures for infrastructure projects even among customers that were not experiencing financial difficulties 
generally  capital expenditures by telecommunications customers increased in fiscal  including one of our significant customers that was engaged in a major upgrade project 
although the company does not believe that any of its significant customers are experiencing significant financial difficulty as of july   additional bankruptcies of companies in the telecommunications sector could adversely impact our liquidity  results of operations and financial condition 
a significant portion of our revenue comes from several large customers 
the following table reflects the percentage of total contract revenue from customers contributing at least of our total contract revenue for either fiscal or for the year ended july  july  comcast bellsouth sprint qwest adelphia verizon charter directv alltel cost of earned revenues includes all direct costs of providing services under our contracts  including all costs of construction personnel  subcontractor costs  all costs associated with operation of equipment excluding depreciation  and insurance 
generally the customer provides the materials that are to be used for their job 
to the extent the customer does not supply their own materials  these costs are also included as cost of earned revenues 
because we retain the risk for automobile  general liability including damage claims  worker s compensation  and employee group health claims subject to certain limits  a change in experience or actuarial assumptions could materially affect results of operations in a particular period 
general and administrative costs include all our costs at the parent company level  as well as subsidiary management personnel and administrative overhead 
our management personnel  including subsidiary management  perform substantially all sales and marketing functions as part of their management responsibilities and  accordingly  we have not incurred material selling expenses 
outlook the statements in this section are based on our current expectations 
these statements are forward looking  and actual results may differ materially 
please refer to special note concerning forward looking statements included elsewhere in this form k for more information on what may cause our actual results to differ 

table of contents we use a fiscal year ending on the saturday closest to july fiscal consisted of weeks while fiscal and consisted of weeks 
fiscal will consist of weeks 
we are subject to market cycles for the specialty contracting services we provide that can affect our results of operations 
we continue to focus on the elements of our business that we can control  including projects selected for bid  close monitoring of costs  safety performance  active claims management and prudent maintenance of and targeted capital expenditures for our fleet of capital equipment 
although other factors may impact us  including some we do not foresee  we believe the market trends and opportunities during and beyond  as described below  will have a more significant impact on our business 
the impact of these and other trends are also discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
during fiscal  we believe a growing overall economy and increased telephone company expenditures will provide us with increased market opportunities 
however  we believe there will be a decline in spending by comcast  which contributed of our revenue during fiscal  as it substantially completes an upgrade of its broadband network 
during fiscal  we began to perform work related to fiber to the premises fttp initiatives of a telephone company 
this activity is the next phase for the telecom providers expanding fiber optic deployment further into their networks and we believe it will result in increased capital spending by our customers 
we have been an active supplier of services to telephone companies and we believe the strength of our relationships with our customers will provide increased fiber related opportunities in the market 
in part due to our expectations of the fttp initiatives  we expect our capital expenditures  net of disposals  to range from million to million for fiscal  which could vary depending on the expected timing of contract performance  overall economic growth  customer demand for our services and the replacement cycle we select for our equipment 
we intend to fund these expenditures from operating cash flows  availability under our credit agreement and existing cash on hand 
on september   we acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of rje telecom  inc rje for approximately million in cash  subject to a working capital adjustment 
rje provides specialty contracting services primarily to telephone companies 
the acquisition will be accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
we expect that the purchase price will be allocated primarily to the tangible working capital assets and approximately million to intangible assets 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate these estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  bad debts  self insured claims liability  income taxes  intangible assets  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on current information  historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the recognition of revenue that are not readily apparent from other sources 
we cannot assure you that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
we have identified the accounting policies below as critical to the accounting for our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations because they involve more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the impact of these policies on our operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
we have discussed the development  selection and application of our critical accounting policies with the audit 
table of contents committee of our board of directors  and our audit committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to our critical accounting policies in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
other significant accounting policies  primarily those with lower levels of uncertainty than those discussed below  are also critical to understanding our consolidated financial statements 
the notes to our consolidated financial statements contain additional information related to our accounting policies and should be read in conjunction with this discussion 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue using the units of delivery or cost to cost measures of the percentage of completion method of accounting 
revenues from services provided to customers are reported as earned and are recognized when services are performed 
the majority of our contracts are unit based 
revenue on these contracts is recognized as the unit is completed 
revenue on non unit based contracts is recognized based primarily on the ratio of contract costs incurred to date to total estimated contract costs 
application of the percentage of completion method of accounting requires the use of estimates of costs to be incurred for the performance of the contract 
contract costs include all direct material and labor costs and those indirect costs related to contract performance  such as indirect labor  supplies  tools  repairs and all costs associated with operation of equipment excluding depreciation 
the cost estimation process is based upon the professional knowledge and experience of the company s engineers  project managers  and financial professionals 
factors that are considered in estimating the work to be completed and ultimate contract recovery include the availability and productivity of labor  the nature and complexity of the work to be performed  the effect of change orders  the availability of materials  the effect of any delays in performance and the recoverability of any claims 
changes in job performance  job conditions  estimated profitability and final contract settlements may result in revisions to costs and income and their effects are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined 
at the time a loss on a contract becomes known  the entire amount of the estimated ultimate loss is accrued 
costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings  classified as a current asset  primarily relates to revenues for completed but unbilled units under unit based contracts  as well as unbilled revenues recognized under the percentage of completion method for non unit based contracts 
for those contracts in which billings exceed contract revenues recognized to date  such excesses are classified as a current liability in the caption billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings 
estimation of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we record an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts when it is probable that the receivable has been impaired at the date of the financial statements and the loss can be reasonably estimated 
any increase in the allowance account has a corresponding negative effect on our results of operations 
management analyzes the collectibility of accounts receivable balances each period 
this review considers the aging of account balances  historical bad debt experience  changes in customer creditworthiness  current economic trends  customer payment activity and any other relevant factors 
should any of these factors change  the estimate made by management may also change  which could affect the level of our future provision for doubtful accounts 
as of july   we had accounts receivables of approximately million  net of a reserve for estimated uncollectible amounts  from a customer that is currently in chapter bankruptcy proceedings 
we have perfected liens with respect to a substantial majority of the outstanding balance and we have engaged legal counsel to handle our claim against the customer in the bankruptcy proceedings 
we do not believe that any of our significant customers are experiencing significant financial difficulty as of july  self insured claims liability 
we retain the risk of loss  up to certain limits  for automobile  general liability and damage claims  and workers compensation claims 
a liability for unpaid claims and the associated claim expenses  including incurred but not reported losses  is actuarially determined and reflected in the consolidated financial statements as an accrued liability 
loss reserves are undiscounted 
factors affecting the determination of amounts to be accrued for self insured claims include  but are not limited to  the expected cost for existing and anticipated claims  frequency  or payment patterns resulting from new types of claims  the hazard level of our operations  the overall level of medical cost inflation  changes in the medical 
table of contents conditions of claimants  economic factors such as inflation  tort reform or other legislative changes  unfavorable jury decisions and court interpretations 
in addition  we retain the risk  up to certain limits  under a self insured employee health plan 
we review quarterly  the paid claims history of our employees and analyze our accrued liability for claims  including claims incurred but not yet paid 
factors affecting the determination of amounts to be accrued under the employee health plan include  but are not limited to  frequency of use  changes in medical costs  changes in the medical conditions of claimants  levels of employee contributions  unfavorable jury decisions  legislative changes and court interpretations 
for losses occurring during fiscal year  excluding utiliquest  we have retained the risk on a per occurrence basis for worker s compensation  in states where we are allowed to retain risk  and automobile liability to  and for general liability to  for fiscal year  we had aggregate stop loss coverage for the above exposures at the stated retention of approximately million 
in addition  we have umbrella liability coverage to a policy limit for each year of million 
within the umbrella coverage  we have retained the risk of loss for automobile and general liability and damage claims between and million  on a per occurrence basis  with an aggregate stop loss for this layer of million for fiscal year for utiliquest  we have retained the risk of loss on a per occurrence basis for general liability and damage claims  workers compensation and automobile liability to  for losses occurring between april  and april  in addition  for utiliquest  we have umbrella liability coverage to a policy limit of million for the policy period april  to april  and million for the policy period april  to april  from april  to july   we retained the risk on a per occurrence basis for losses at utiliquest at the levels described in the preceding paragraph 
in addition  the locate damages included in general liability represent claims resulting from damages to the underground utility where we provided utility locating services 
the company s customer or their representative reports damages  which are investigated and assessed by the company 
the potential claim is estimated and developed by the company based on facts  circumstances and historical evidence 
for losses occurring in fiscal year  we have retained the risk on a per occurrence basis for workers compensation  in states where we are allowed to retain risk  and for automobile liability to  and for general liability excluding utiliquest to  for utiliquest s general liability and damage claims  we have retained the risk to  for fiscal year  we have an aggregate stop loss coverage for these exposures at a stated retention of approximately million 
in addition  we have umbrella liability coverage to a policy limit of million 
within the umbrella coverage  we have retained the risk of loss for automobile liability and general liability and damage claims between and million  on a per occurrence basis  with an aggregate stop loss for this layer of million 
for losses related to our employee health plan occurring during fiscal years and  we have retained the risk  on an annual basis  of  per participant 
for fiscal year and  excluding utiliquest  we have aggregate stop loss coverage for this exposure at the stated retention of approximately and million  respectively 
for losses related to the utiliquest health plan  there is no aggregate stop loss coverage 
the method of calculating the estimated accrued liability for self insured claims is subject to inherent uncertainty 
if actual results significantly differ from our estimates used to calculate the liability  our financial condition and results of operations could be materially impacted 
valuation of goodwill and intangible assets 
as of july   we had million of goodwill  million of indefinite lived intangible assets and of finite lived intangible assets 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we conduct  on at least an annual basis  a review of our reporting units to determine whether their carrying value exceeds their fair market value 
should this be the case  the value of our goodwill may be impaired and written down 
indefinite lived intangible assets are also tested for impairment annually and on an interim basis if events or changes in circumstances between annual tests indicate that the asset might be impaired 
if the fair value of the intangible asset is less than the 
table of contents carrying value  an impairment loss would be incurred in an amount equal to the difference 
we review finite lived intangible assets to be held and used for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable 
determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
measurement of an impairment loss is based on the fair value of the asset compared to its carrying value 
we use judgment in assessing goodwill and intangible assets for impairment 
when necessary  we engage third party specialists to assist us with our valuations 
the valuations employ a combination of present value techniques to measure fair value  corroborated by comparisons to estimated market multiples 
these valuations are based on a discount rate determined by our management to be consistent with industry discount rates and the risks inherent in our current business model 
impairment losses  if any  are reflected in operating income or loss in the consolidated statements of operations 
accounting for income taxes 
we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method 
this approach requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
developing our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment and expertise in federal and state income tax laws  regulations and strategies  including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and  if necessary  any valuation allowances that may be required for deferred tax assets 
we have not recorded any valuation allowances as of july  because management believes that future taxable income will  more likely than not  be sufficient to realize the benefits of those assets as the temporary differences in basis reverse over time 
our judgments and tax strategies are subject to audit by various taxing authorities 
while the company believes it has provided adequately for its income tax liabilities in its consolidated financial statements  adverse determinations by taxing authorities could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
contingencies and litigation 
in the ordinary course of our business we are involved in certain legal proceedings 
we estimate the range of liability related to pending litigation where the amount and range of loss can be estimated 
where there is a range of loss  we record the minimum estimated liability related to those claims in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for contingencies 
as additional information becomes available  we assess the potential liability related to our pending litigation and revise our estimates 
revisions of our estimates of the potential liability could materially impact our results of operations 
if the final outcome of such litigation and contingencies differs adversely from that currently expected  it would result in a charge to earnings when determined 
the federal employment tax returns for two of our subsidiaries have been audited by the internal revenue service irs 
as a result of the audit  we received an original proposed assessment from the irs in march at issue  according to the examination reports  are the taxpayers characterization of certain employee reimbursements for the years and we reached an agreed assessment with the irs regarding one of the two subsidiaries 
the amount of the agreed assessment  which was paid in the first quarter of fiscal  will be recorded against the reserve for this matter we established during fiscal subsequent to this agreement  million of the proposed assessment is still at issue 
we continue to disagree with the amount of the proposed assessment with respect to the other subsidiary and are pursuing an administrative appeal for this matter which we intend to vigorously defend 
we believe we have a number of legal defenses available that may substantially reduce the proposed assessment and have therefore not recorded any significant liability with respect to the remaining assessment

revenues 
contract revenues increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal of this increase  million was attributable to an increase in demand for specialty contracting services provided to telecommunications companies  an increase of million in underground utility locating services revenues and an increase of million attributable to electrical utilities and other construction and maintenance services revenues 
utiliquest  acquired in december  contributed million of underground utility locating service revenues during fiscal first south acquired in november  contributed million of contract revenues during fiscal in telecommunication services revenue 
excluding revenues from utiliquest and first south our total contract revenues for the year ended july  would have been million compared to million for last year  an increase of from fiscal revenue also increased due to weeks of results included in fiscal compared to weeks of results in fiscal during fiscal  we recognized million of contract revenues  or of our total contract revenues  from telecommunications services as compared to million or for fiscal first south contributed million  of contract revenues from telecommunications services for the year ended 
table of contents july  excluding revenue from first south  contract revenues from telecommunications services for the year ended july  would have been million compared to million for the year ended july   an increase of million or from the prior year 
the increase in our telecommunications service revenues  excluding the impact of first south  is attributable to a general increase in contract activity from a broad range of our customers as well as revenues from one of our significant customers engaged in a major upgrade project  the impact of a major new construction and maintenance contract with a significant customer and the commencement of a significant upgrade project with a telephone company 
we recognized contract revenues of million  or of our total contract revenues  from underground utility locating services for the year ended july  as compared to million  or for the year ended july  utiliquest contributed million of revenue for underground utility locating services for fiscal excluding revenue from utiliquest for underground utility locating services contract revenues for the year ended july  would have been million compared to million for the year ended july   an increase of million or from the prior year 
this increase was primarily the result of receiving a new contract award in the southeastern united states from an existing customer 
we recognized contract revenues of million  or of our total contract revenues  from electrical utilities and other construction and maintenance services for the year ended july   as compared to million or for the year ended july  this represents an increase of million or from the prior year and was primarily related to revenues from a new electrical maintenance master service agreement entered into with a customer during fiscal contract revenues from multi year master service agreements and other long term agreements represented of total contract revenues in fiscal as compared to in fiscal contract revenues from multi year master services agreements represented of total contract revenues in fiscal as compared to in fiscal the increase is primarily due to agreements in place at utiliquest which was acquired in december cost of earned revenues 
costs of earned revenues increased million to million for the year ended july  from million for the year ended july  and decreased as a percentage of contract revenues to from 
the primary components of this dollar increase were subcontractor costs  direct labor and other direct costs which increased  and million  respectively  due to higher levels of operations during the current year 
as a percentage of contract revenues  cost of earned revenue decreased due to improving claims experience under our self insurance program for general liability claims and due to reduced costs incurred for direct materials in proportion to the increased level of operations 
these decreases were partially offset by an approximate increase in subcontractor labor cost which rose on a percentage basis in response to the increased work demand and the shift in the business mix toward operating units that utilize more subcontract labor 
in addition  equipment costs rose by approximately as a percentage of contract revenues primarily due to increased equipment costs related to the increase in utility locating operations 
other direct costs increased in dollars  but were approximately flat on a percentage of revenue basis  primarily driven by a million increase in payroll and related payroll tax costs related to earned revenue  which included costs of approximately million related to the settlement of an irs assessment 
cost of earned revenues also increased due to weeks of results included in fiscal compared to weeks of results in fiscal general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in general and administrative expenses for the year ended july  as compared to the year ended july   was primarily attributable to increased overhead related to the utiliquest and first south acquisitions and due to the impact of weeks of results included in fiscal compared to weeks in fiscal additionally during  we incurred a charge of approximately million associated with a legal judgment and related expenses that resulted from a contract dispute that arose from the pre acquisition operations of one of our subsidiaries 
bad debt expense 
bad debt expense decreased million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this decrease is primarily attributable to the recovery of previously written off accounts receivable of million partially offset by current year bad debt experience 

table of contents depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased to million for the year ended july   from million for the year ended july   and as a percentage of contract revenues decreased to from 
the dollar amount increase was primarily due to increased amortization from intangible assets related to the current year acquisitions of utiliquest and first south 
we expect the amount of amortization expense to increase in fiscal due to a full year of amortization on intangible assets associated with the acquisitions of utiliquest and first south that were completed in the second quarter of fiscal gain on sale of accounts receivable 
at july   we had pre petition outstanding receivables from adelphia of approximately million after a write down of million 
in fiscal  we sold the adelphia accounts receivables and recorded an million gain on the sale 
interest income  net 
interest income  net  decreased million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in cash and cash equivalents as a result of the purchase of utiliquest and first south 
in addition  we incurred interest expense in the current year associated with notes and capital leases that were acquired in the utiliquest acquisition 
other income  net 
other income  net increased million to million for the year ended july  from million for the year ended july  the increase for the year ended july  is primarily due to gains from the sale of fixed assets 
income taxes 
the provision for income taxes was million in fiscal as compared to million in the same period last year 
our effective tax rate was for the year ended july  as compared to for the fiscal year ended july  the decrease in our effective tax rate was attributable to the mix of operating results from our subsidiaries and the impact that had on our state tax rates 
additionally  the impact of lower pre tax income combined with permanent nondeductible expense items for tax purposes resulted in a higher effective tax rate for the year ended july  during fiscal year  we expect our effective tax rate to remain consistent with the effective tax rate for fiscal year net income 
net income was million in fiscal as compared to a million in fiscal year ended july  compared to year ended july  revenues 
contract revenues decreased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal of this decrease  million was attributable to a decline in demand for specialty contracting services provided to telecommunications companies offset in part by an increase of million attributable to electrical utilities and other construction and maintenance services revenues and an increase of million in underground utility locating services revenues 
arguss  acquired in february  contributed million of contract revenues during fiscal and million for fiscal  primarily in contract revenues from telecommunications services 
excluding revenues attributable to arguss in both periods  our total contract revenues for the year ended july  would have been million compared to million for the same period last year  a decline of from fiscal during fiscal  we recognized million of contract revenues  or of our total contract revenues  from telecommunications services as compared to million or for fiscal the decrease in our telecommunications service revenue for the year ended july  is attributable to lower revenues  primarily from telecommunication and cable customers  due in part to the continued decrease in capital spending by our customers  bankruptcies of certain customers  and the overall continued downturn in the economy 
arguss contributed million of contract revenues from telecommunications services for the year ended july  and million for the year ended july  arguss was acquired in february 
excluding arguss in both periods  contract revenues from telecommunications services for the year ended july  would have been million compared to million for the year ended july   a decline of from the prior year 
we recognized contract revenues of million  or of our total contract revenues  from underground utility locating services for the year ended july  as compared to million  or for the year ended july  arguss had no underground utility locating services revenues in either period 

table of contents we recognized contract revenues of million  or of our total contract revenues  from construction and maintenance services to electrical and other utilities for the year ended july   as compared to million or for the year ended july  arguss contributed million of contract revenues from electrical utilities and other construction and maintenance services for the year ended july  and million for the same period last year arguss was acquired in february

costs of earned revenues increased million to million for the year ended july  from million for the year ended july  and increased as a percentage of contract revenues to from 
the primary components of this percentage increase were subcontractor costs  which increased  and insurance costs  which increased  partially offset by a decrease in labor and payroll related costs of 
subcontractor costs rose on a percentage basis as the mix of business shifted toward operating units that utilize more subcontract labor 
insurance costs have trended up as a consequence of higher premiums and losses associated with our casualty and health insurance programs 
labor and payroll related costs decreased as a percentage of contract revenues due to reductions in staffing based on work requirements 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in general and administrative expenses for the year ended july  as compared to the year ended july   was primarily attributable to increased overhead related to the arguss acquisition and increases in professional fees of million related to a review and reorganization of our corporate structure and increased legal expenses  partially offset by a decrease in payroll related expenses of million 
as a result of the review of our corporate structure  we reorganized our subsidiaries during the third quarter of fiscal this restructuring was designed to make our corporate structure more efficient from an organizational and income tax standpoint 
general and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of contract revenues to in fiscal from in fiscal bad debt expense 
bad debt expense decreased million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this decrease is primarily attributable to million of bad debt expense recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal year related to receivables due from adelphia and worldcom

depreciation and amortization increased to million for the year ended july   from million for the year ended july   and as a percentage of contract revenues increased to from 
interest income  net 
interest income  net  decreased million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in cash and cash equivalents as a result of the repayment of arguss million indebtedness subsequent to its acquisition as well as to lower interest rates during fiscal other income  net 
other income  net increased million to million for the year ended july  from million for the year ended july  the increase for the year ended july  is primarily due to gains from the sale of idle assets

table of contents cumulative effect of change in accounting principle for sfas no 
and impairment write off 
as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
in fiscal year  we recorded a non cash impairment charge of million million after tax as of the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal year the impairment loss was recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principles in our accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended july  sfas no 
requires us to conduct a valuation when an event occurs that would indicate that the goodwill of a reporting unit might be impaired 
because adelphia filed for bankruptcy protection in fiscal year and was a significant customer of several of our reporting units  we conducted a review for goodwill impairment at those units 
as a consequence  we recorded an impairment charge of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year additionally  sfas no 
requires us to conduct an annual valuation of operating units to determine whether the carrying value of their assets exceeds their fair market value 
this review resulted in an impairment charge at our point to point reporting unit of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year our annual valuation for fiscal year did not result in any impairment charge 
net income loss 
net income was million in fiscal as compared to a million loss in fiscal liquidity and capital resources capital requirements 
we primarily need capital for equipment to support our contractual commitments to customers and to maintain sufficient working capital 
our working capital needs are influenced by the level of operations during the period and generally increase with higher levels of contract revenues 
additionally  our working capital requirements are influenced by the timing of the collection of balances outstanding from our customers for work previously performed 
our sources of cash have historically been operating activities  equity offerings  bank borrowings  and proceeds from the sale of idle and surplus equipment and real property 
to the extent we seek to grow by acquisitions that involve consideration other than our stock  our capital requirements may increase 
we expect capital expenditures  net of disposals  to range from million to million for fiscal  which could vary depending on the expected timing of contract performance  overall economic growth  customer demand for our services and the replacement cycle we select for our equipment 
we intend to fund these expenditures primarily from operating cash flows  availability under our credit agreement and cash on hand

this plan does not obligate the company to acquire any particular amount of common stock  and the plan may be suspended at any time 
pursuant to florida law  any shares repurchased will be added to the company s authorized  unissued shares and are available for future issue 
no shares were repurchased under this program which expired in august we believe that our capital resources  together with existing cash balances  are sufficient to meet our financial obligations  including lease commitments  and to support our normal replacement of equipment at our current level of business for at least the next twelve months 
our future operating results and cash flows may be affected by a number of factors including our success in bidding on future contracts and our continued ability to manage controllable costs effectively 
backlog 
our backlog is comprised of the uncompleted portion of services to be performed under job specific contracts and the estimated value of future services that we expect to provide under long term requirements contracts 
our backlog at july  and july  was billion and million  respectively 
we expect to complete approximately of our current backlog during the next twelve months 
in many instances our customers are not contractually committed to specific volumes of services under a contract 
however  the customer is obligated to obtain these services from us if they are not performed by the customer s employees and we are committed to perform these services if requested by the customer 
many of these contracts are multi year agreements  and we include in our backlog the amount of services projected to be performed over the terms of the contracts based on our historical relationships with customers and our experience in procurements of this nature 
however  there can be no assurance as to a customer s requirements during a particular period or that such estimates at any point in time are accurate 

table of contents seasonality and quarterly fluctuations our revenues can be affected by seasonality 
since most of the work we perform is done outdoors  our results of operations can be impacted by extended periods of inclement weather 
generally  inclement weather occurs during the winter months or in our second and third quarters of our fiscal year 
in addition  a disproportionate number of holidays fall within our second quarter which impacts our number of available workdays and productivity 
in addition  we have experienced and expect to continue to experience quarterly variations in revenues and net income as a result of other factors  including the timing and volume of customers construction and maintenance projects  budgetary spending patterns of customers  the commencement or termination of master service agreements and other long term agreements with customers  costs incurred to support growth internally or through acquisitions  fluctuation in result of operations caused by acquisitions  changes in mix of customers  contracts  and business activities  and fluctuations in insurance expense accruals due to changes in claims experience and actuarial assumptions 
accordingly  operating results for any fiscal period are not necessarily indicative of results that may be achieved for any subsequent fiscal period
