excess and surplus lines 
excess and surplus lines insurance carriers provide insurance that is unavailable or difficult to obtain by businesses in the admitted market due to the unique characteristics of the insureds or the lack of insurers writing such coverage 
the excess and surplus lines market allows colony to underwrite certain risks with more flexible policy terms at unregulated premium rates

for the year  gross written premiums derived from new business increased million to million  primarily due to business written through the fulcrum insurance company renewal rights acquisition 
renewal gross written premiums increased million to million for the year ended december  a larger base of expiring premiums compounded by rate increases was the primary driver for the increase in renewal premiums 
this trend is a reflection of the current environment of the excess and surplus lines market  in that the current year premium has a similar risk profile to expiring policies  and is being written at higher rates 
partially offsetting these increases were cancellations and endorsements which reduced gross written premiums by approximately million for the year 
results for the year ended december  include activity for the four months from the acquisition of colony

as of december   the company earned a ceding commission of million 
earned premiums increased million from million for the year ended december  to million for the same period in the increase was primarily attributable to the strong premium growth in and continuing in earned premiums were also decreased by the quota share as discussed above 
the excess and surplus lines segment s loss ratio improved to for compared to for  and for the four months ended december  the improvement is attributable to a reduction in the current year loss ratio  reflecting the effects of rate increases realized over the past two years 
despite this improvement  development of prior year losses contributed approximately six percentage points to the current year loss ratio  or approximately million 
this resulted primarily from strengthening of case and incurred but not reported losses of this segment s other liability business for accident years to improvements in claims handling procedures implemented beginning in have contributed to this strengthening and should result in an improvement in the ultimate settlement value of individual losses 
additionally  reported and open claim counts indicate that claim counts are not increasing at the same rate as premiums 
the growth in reported claim counts  which increased in  compares favorably to the growth in earned premiums of in open claim 
table of contents counts have increased only since the beginning of indicating that the premium growth in the past two years was primarily the result of increased rates 
loss reserves for the excess and surplus lines segment were million  million and million as of december   and  respectively 
loss reserves as of december  represent management s best estimate based on current facts and trends within this segment  however  due to the inherent uncertainties in estimating ultimate loss reserves  the potential for future development exists 
the expense ratio for the year ended december  improved to as compared to for  and for the four months ended december  underwriting expenses grew at a slower pace than earned premiums enabling the company to realize this improvement in the expense ratio

table of contents for the last half of  the expense ratio for the risk management segment was approximately  which is more reflective of the underwriting expenses of this segment 
due to the loss sensitive nature of the business underwritten by risk management  the expense ratio is higher than if the business were written on a guaranteed cost basis 
this is due to the insured receiving a premium credit for participating in the losses on the policy while the costs to underwrite the policy are similar to guaranteed cost

run off lines 
the company has discontinued active underwriting of certain lines of business 
the company is still obligated to pay losses incurred on these lines which include general liability and medical malpractice policies written in past years 
the lines currently in run off are typically characterized by long elapsed periods between the occurrence of a claim and ultimate resolution of the claim 
the company utilizes a specialized staff dedicated to administer and settle these claims 
for the year ended december   the run off segment recorded a segment loss of million  compared to million for the same period of the underwriting loss for this segment was zero for the year ended december argonaut insurance company is exposed to asbestos liability at the primary level through claims filed against its direct insureds  as well as through its position as a reinsurer of other primary carriers 
argonaut insurance company s direct liability arises primarily from policies issued from the mid s to early s which pre dated policy contract wording that excluded asbestos exposure 
the majority of the policies were issued on behalf of small contractors or construction companies 
the company believes that the frequency and severity of asbestos claims for such insureds is typically less than that experienced for large  industrial manufacturing and distribution concerns 
argonaut insurance company also assumed risk as a reinsurer for a limited period of time  primarily for the period from to  a portion of which was assumed from the london market 
argonaut insurance company reinsured risks on policies written by direct carriers 
such reinsurance typically provided coverage for limits attaching at a relatively high dollar amount which are payable only after other layers of reinsurance are exhausted 
some of the claims now being filed on policies reinsured by argonaut insurance company are on behalf of claimants who may have been exposed at some time to asbestos incorporated into buildings they occupied  but have no current medical problems resulting from such exposure 
additionally  lawsuits are being brought against businesses that were not directly involved in the manufacture or installation of materials containing asbestos 
the company believes that claims generated out of this population of claimants may result in incurred losses generally lower than the asbestos claims filed over the past decade and could be below argonaut insurance company s attachment level

this analysis resulted in a decrease to ceded loss and loss adjustment expense reserves  and a corresponding increase to net loss and loss adjustment expense reserves and a related expense of million 
the company revised its analysis that projects anticipated future ceded reinsurance recoveries relative to existing claims and incurred but not reported claims 
the analysis relied on identification of reinsurance contracts that the company purchased at the time the policies were in force 
these reinsurance contracts provide coverage for specific policy contracts for which the company has claim exposure 
previously  the company utilized historical relationships of ceded losses to gross losses to estimate expected future ceded losses 
the current approach incorporates more of the specific characteristics of the existing and expected claims  and related policies and reinsurance contracts  and  accordingly  management believes it provides a more refined estimate of expected future ceded loss recoveries 
company policy beginning in was to exclude asbestos coverage on all general liability policies 
during the third quarter of  management identified claims associated with certain general liability policies issued through one office from to the early s which did not exclude absolute asbestos coverage 
the company strengthened its loss reserves by million in the third quarter of for these claims 
the company reviewed policy files issued during this period for additional exposures and management believes the policies written were limited to this specific time frame and one location 
the company completed its annual analysis of reserves for the run off lines in the fourth quarter of and as a result strengthened its asbestos reserves by million 
the decision to strengthen asbestos reserves was the result of an evaluation and review of exposure to asbestos claims  particularly in light of industry and litigation trends  actual claims experience  and actuarial analysis by the company s consulting and internal actuaries 
however  some 
table of contents uncertainty remains regarding the severity and frequency of future claims to the extent that other carriers and policyholders may not have provided notice of loss or addressed issues of coverage 
additional uncertainty is created by continued unfavorable trends in the insurance industry related to asbestos 
all of these factors were considered as part of the decision to strengthen reserves in the fourth quarter of although legislative reform for class action lawsuits  judicial and legislative actions imposing minimum proof requirements  and other tort related reforms are possible in the near term  the study did not take these mitigating factors into account in evaluating the severity or frequency of claims 
total reserves for run off lines as of december  were million  net of reinsurance but before effects of the adverse development cover  including reserves for environmental and asbestos claims of million 
management uses various actuarial methods to determine the potential range of losses for the run off lines in total  which resulted in a range of potential ultimate liability  net of reinsurance  of million to million 
in determining its best estimate  management primarily relied on the report year method 
the report year method relies most heavily on the company s historical claims and severity information  whereas other methods rely more heavily on industry information 
this method produces an estimate of losses which have been incurred but not yet reported based on projections of numbers of future claims and the average severity for those future claims 
the severities were calculated based on argonaut specific data and in management s opinion best reflect argonaut liabilities based upon the insurance policies issued 
as a result of this reserve analysis  the reserve for incurred but not reported environmental and asbestos claims net of reinsurance at december   was million compared to million and million as of december  and  respectively 
the reserve for incurred but not reported claims for the remaining run off lines net of reinsurance was million as of december   compared to million and million as of december  and  respectively 
the following table represents a reconciliation of the number of asbestos and environmental claims outstanding for each of the years in the three year period ended december  open claims  beginning of the year claims closed during the year claims opened during the year open claims  end of the year the number of claims opened during the three years ended december  were from the following sources direct domestic london total open claims new claims in the reinsurance assumed categories are primarily the result of the company typically providing coverage for higher limits which are payable only after other layers of reinsurance are exhausted 
additionally  there tend to be long delays in the ceding companies reporting claims to the reinsurers 
the following table represents gross payments on asbestos and environmental claims for each of the years in the three year period ended december  gross payments on closed claims gross payments on open claims total gross payments 
table of contents the above tables indicate downward trends in the number of open claims at the end of each year and total gross payments over the past three years 
because of the types of coverages within argonaut insurance company s run off lines of business  a significant amount of judgment and uncertainty exists in establishing the reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses 
factors that increase these uncertainties are lack of historical data  inapplicability of standard actuarial projection techniques  uncertainties regarding ultimate claim costs  coverage interpretations  and the judicial  statutory and regulatory environments under which these claims may ultimately be resolved 
significant uncertainty remains as to the ultimate liability to the company due to the potentially long waiting period between exposure and emergence of any bodily injury or property damage and the resulting potential for involvement of multiple policy periods for individual claims 
additionally  recent industry trends show an increasing number of claims being filed by individuals who claim asbestos exposure  but who have no symptoms of asbestos related disease 
due to these uncertainties  the current trends may not be indicative of future results 
the company  through its subsidiary argonaut insurance company  has been named in various legal actions filed by western macarthur company  western asbestos company and certain other individual claimants 
argonaut insurance company s involvement in these actions stems from nine construction wrap up policies with an occurrence limit of  per policy issued to western macarthur company and western asbestos company  respectively  for liability arising out of work performed on five construction sites in the s and s 
management estimates that approximately of the liabilities associated with previous suits and the entry of default judgments were associated in any way with the operations covered by the argonaut policies before any adjustment for other applicable coverage and without a determination as to whether argonaut would be bound by those judgments 
argonaut has in the ordinary course of business established loss reserves and loss adjustment expense reserves in connection with these claims 
based on the above circumstances  management s evaluation of the company s exposure to the western macarthur litigation remains unchanged 
although management has determined and recorded its best estimate of the reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses for run off lines  current judicial and legislative decisions continue to broaden liability  expand policy scopes and increase the severity of claims payments 
as a result of these and other recent developments  the uncertainties inherent in estimating ultimate loss reserves are heightened  further complicating the already complex process of determining loss reserves 
the industry as a whole is involved in extensive litigation over these coverages and liability issues  and must contend with the continuing uncertainty in its effort to quantify these exposures 
liquidity and capital resources the company s principal cash flow sources are premiums and investment income 
the primary cash outflows are claim payments and operating expenses 
the nature of insurance is that cash collected on premiums written is invested  interest and dividends are earned thereon  and loss and settlement expenses are paid out over a period of years 
this period of time varies by line of business and by the circumstances surrounding each claim 
a substantial portion of the company s loss and loss expenses are paid out over more than one year 
additional cash outflow occurs through payments of underwriting and acquisition costs such as commissions  taxes  payrolls and general overhead expenses
