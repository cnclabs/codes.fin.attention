business overview the company is a self administered and self managed real estate investment trust that began operations through a related entity in as of december   the company owned or jointly controlled industrial  office and retail properties including properties under development  consisting of over million square feet primarily located in states  and owned or jointly controlled approximately  acres of land with an estimated future development potential of more than million square feet of industrial  office and retail properties 
the company provides the following services for its properties and for certain properties owned by third parties leasing  management  construction  development  and other tenant related services 
the company s operating results depend primarily upon rental income from its office  industrial and retail properties rental operations 
the following highlights the areas of rental operations that the company considers critical for future revenue growth all square footage totals and occupancy percentages reflect both wholly owned properties and properties in joint ventures same property performance the company tracks same property performance  which measures the performance of properties that were in service for all reported portions of a two year period by comparing the results of the second year with the results of the first year 
in  net operating income from the same property portfolio decreased by from  compared to 
growth in over the current year decline is a result of a decrease of million in same property lease termination fees compared to in addition to the decrease in lease termination fees  the company increased the use of free rent concessions in as an incentive to attract quality tenants 
occupancy analysis the ability to maintain occupancy rates is a principal driver of the company s results of operations 
the following table sets forth information regarding the company s in service portfolio of rental properties as of december  and square feet in thousands total square feet percent of total square feet percent occupied type industrial service centers bulk office retail total the overall increase in occupancy for was the result of increased activity primarily in the bulk industrial product  fewer lease terminations through lease buyouts and fewer tenant bankruptcies 
an improving economy coupled with increased business spending and aggressive leasing led to the overall occupancy increase 
the current year decrease in service centers occupancy was mainly the result of a tenant terminating  square feet through a lease buyout in december in exchange for a termination payment of million 
lease expiration and renewals the company s ability to maintain and grow its occupancy rates primarily depends upon its continuing ability to re lease expiring space 
the following table reflects the company s in service lease expiration schedule as of december   by product type 
the table indicates square footage and annualized net effective rents based on december rental revenue under expiring leases in thousands total portfolio industrial office retail year of expiration square feet dollars square feet dollars square feet dollars square feet dollars and thereafter total portfolio square feet percent occupied the company renewed of its leases up for renewal in  totaling million square feet on which it attained a growth in net effective rents 
the relatively flat growth in rental rates is indicative of excess vacancies in many of the company s markets requiring competitive pricing strategies to retain current tenants 
the average term of renewals decreased to years in  from years in the company is currently renewing tenants for shorter terms in anticipation of better market rates for future renewal periods 
the company s lease renewal percentages over the past three years have remained relatively consistent at a success rate despite the relatively weak market conditions 
the company does not currently expect its renewal percentage in to significantly differ from that experienced in future development another source of growth in earnings for the company is the development of additional rental properties 
the company had approximately million square feet of properties under development at december  with total projected costs of approximately million 
the total projected costs of properties under development at december  was million 
the lower volume reflects the relative slowdown in business expansion in response to the overall weakened economy  and the company s plan to limit the development of speculative properties until activity increases 
the properties under development are expected to provide future rental operations growth as they are placed in service or  for those properties that are being developed for sale  earnings through service operations upon their eventual sale 
a summary of the properties under development as of december   follows in thousands  except percent leased and stabilized returns anticipated in service date square feet percent leased project costs anticipated stabilized return held for rental st quarter nd quarter rd quarter thereafter held for sale st quarter nd quarter rd quarter thereafter total acquisition and disposition activity the company has an active capital recycling program based upon a strategy to dispose of non strategic assets and utilize the proceeds to fund new development and acquisitions of more desirable properties 
through this program  the company is continually improving the overall quality of its investment portfolio 
during and  the company disposed of over billion of properties  which generated substantially greater proceeds than were required to fund new development and acquisitions 
the excess proceeds were utilized to pay down company debt  which has reduced the company s debt to total market capitalization ratio to a conservative at december  dispositions of held for rental properties slowed in and  totaling million and million  respectively  as the slower business climate limited reinvestment opportunities 
the disposition proceeds were used to partially fund and acquisitions of million and million  respectively 
the company will continue to pursue both disposition and acquisition opportunities that arise in while management expects the volume of acquisitions to exceed dispositions  management cannot predict when or if these opportunities will arise 
funds from operations funds from operations ffo is used by industry analysts and investors as a supplemental operating performance measure of an equity real estate investment trust reit 
ffo is calculated in accordance with the definition that was adopted by the board of governors of the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit 
ffo  as defined by nareit  represents net income loss determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  excluding extraordinary items as defined under gaap and gains or losses from sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets  plus certain non cash items such as real estate asset depreciation and amortization  and after adjustment for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with gaap implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions  many industry investors and analysts have considered the presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves 
thus  nareit created ffo as a supplemental measure of reit operating performance that excludes historical cost depreciation  among other items  from gaap net income 
management believes that the use of ffo  combined with the required primary gaap presentations  has improved the understanding of operating results of reits among the investing public and made comparisons of reit operating results more meaningful 
management considers ffo to be a useful measure for reviewing comparative operating and financial performance although ffo should be reviewed in conjunction with net income which remains the primary measure of performance because by excluding gains or losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets and excluding real estate asset depreciation and amortization  ffo assists in comparing the operating performance of a company s real estate between periods or as compared to different companies 
the following table summarizes the calculation of ffo for the years ended december in thousands net income available for common shares add back deduct depreciation and amortization share of adjustments for unconsolidated companies loss earnings from depreciated property sales minority interest share of add backs funds from operations funds from operations for and have been restated to include the effects of the company s adoption of the sec s july  staff policy statement that clarifies the application of fasb eitf topic d  the effect on the calculation of earnings per share for the redemption or induced conversion of preferred stock 
see discussion of restatement of net income below 
additionally  the company has restated and ffo through the adoption of recent guidance from the sec requiring the inclusion of impairment adjustments in the calculation of ffo 
results of operations a summary of the company s operating results and property statistics for each of the years in the three year period ended december   follows in thousands  except number of properties and per share amounts rental operations revenues service operations revenues earnings from rental operations earnings from service operations operating income net income available for common shares weighted average common shares outstanding weighted average common and dilutive potential common shares basic income per common share continuing operations discontinued operations diluted income per common share continuing operations discontinued operations number of in service properties at end of year in service square footage at end of year under development square footage at end of year comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  rental income from continuing operations rental income from continuing operations increased from million in to million in the following table reconciles rental income by reportable segment to the company s total reported rental income from continuing operations for the years ended december  and in thousands office industrial retail other total although the company s three reportable segments comprising rental operations office  industrial and retail are all within the real estate industry  they are not necessarily affected by the same economic and industry conditions 
for example  the company s retail segment experienced high occupancies and strong overall performance during  while the company s office and industrial segments reflected the weaker economic environment for those property types 
the primary causes of the increase in rental income from continuing operations  with specific references to a particular segment when applicable  are summarized below during  in service occupancy improved from at the end of to at the end of the second half of was highlighted by a significant increase in the industrial portfolio occupancy of along with a slight increase in office portfolio occupancy of 
increased occupancy continues to be management s primary focus for lease termination fees totaled million in compared to million in most of this decrease was attributable to the office segment  which recognized million of termination fees in as compared to million in lease termination fees relate to specific tenants that pay a fee to terminate their lease obligations before the end of the contractual lease term 
the high volume of termination fees in was reflective of the contraction of the business of large office users during that year and their desire to downsize their use of office space 
the decrease in termination fees for was indicative of an improving economy and a more stable financial position of the company s tenants 
although there is no way to predict the amount of future lease termination fees  management believes that the amount of these fees will continue to decline in during the year ended  the company acquired million of properties totaling million square feet 
the acquisitions were primarily class a office buildings in existing markets with overall occupancy near 
revenues associated with these acquisitions totaled million in in addition  revenues from acquisitions totaled million in compared to million in this significant increase is primarily due to a large office acquisition that closed at the end of december developments placed in service in provided revenues of million  while revenues associated with developments placed in service in totaled million in compared to million in proceeds from dispositions of held for rental properties totaled million in  compared to million in these properties generated revenue of million in versus million in equity in earnings of unconsolidated companies equity in earnings represents the company s ownership share of net income from investments in unconsolidated companies 
these joint ventures generally own and operate rental properties and hold land for development 
these earnings decreased from million in to million in this decrease is a result of the following significant activity in  a million gain was recognized on a property that was developed and sold upon completion to a third party 
in  the company s total investment in joint ventures decreased 
this decrease was the result of the company acquiring its partner s interest in three joint ventures  selling its interest in two and one venture being dissolved in the current year 
while the number of joint ventures decreased  the joint ventures occupancy increased from to in rental expenses and real estate taxes the following table reconciles rental expenses and real estate taxes by reportable segment to the company s total reported amounts in the statement of operations for the years ended december  and in s rental expenses office industrial retail other total real estate taxes office industrial retail other total the increased rental and real estate tax expenses for  as compared to  was the result of the company s increase in average in service square feet and occupancy 
these increases resulted from the company s acquisition activities and developments placed in service in interest expense the company s interest expense increased from million in to million in although the company benefited from significantly lower interest rates during the year  interest expense increased because of increased borrowings during the year and a decrease in the amount of interest that was capitalized 
the increased borrowings reflected the funding of the company s developments during the year and the excess of properties acquired over those disposed 
interest capitalized for was significantly lower than as development activity for was substantially slower than prior years 
development starts for totaled only million compared to approximately million for other significant factors impacting interest expense for are summarized as follows in thousands the company continued to replace secured debt financing with unsecured debt  and paid off over million of secured loans throughout the payoffs included secured loans due in and those due in and beyond for which the company was able to take advantage of expired or negotiated lower pre payment penalties and utilize lower financing costs from unsecured debt offerings or the unsecured line of credit 
approximately million of new unsecured debt was issued in the company issued million of seven year debt in january at an effective interest rate of  million of ten year debt in may at an effective interest rate of and million of four year debt in november at an effective interest rate of 
the company retired million of debt in june that had an effective interest rate of the company utilized its million unsecured line of credit more heavily in than it did during in order to take advantage of the historically low borrowing costs 
the balance on the line of credit was million at december  compared to million at december  depreciation and amortization expense depreciation and amortization expense for increased by over million compared to because of an increase in tenant improvements and leasing costs 
as discussed earlier  the company experienced higher overall occupancy and more acquisition activity in  which resulted in increased capital expenditures for tenant improvements and deferred lease commissions as well as increases in held for investment property basis 
the following highlights the significant changes in depreciable and amortizable property during the basis of the held for investment property portfolio increased by million as a result of the company s development and acquisition activity 
the company incurred tenant improvement costs of million in the company incurred lease commissions of million in also contributing to the increased expense in was the effect of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations sfas  on acquisitions 
this accounting pronouncement requires the allocation of a portion of a property s purchase price to intangible assets for leases acquired and in place at the closing date of the acquisition 
these intangible assets are amortized over the remaining life of the leases generally years as compared to the building basis portion of the acquisition  which is depreciated over years 
the amortization associated with the acquired lease intangible assets recorded on acquisitions totaled million 
service operations service operations primarily consist of leasing  management  construction and development services for joint venture properties and properties owned by third parties 
these operations are heavily influenced by the current state of the economy as leasing and management fees are dependent upon occupancy while construction and development services rely on businesses expanding operations 
the following highlights the significant components of revenues in service operations the company experienced more than a decrease in its overall gross profit margin percentage in its general contractor business in because of more competitive pricing in many of its markets 
however  despite this decrease  the company was able to increase its net general contractor revenues from million in to million in because of a significant increase in volume 
this volume increase was attributable to the low cost of financing available to businesses  thereby making it more attractive for them to own instead of lease facilities 
the company has a substantial backlog of million for third party work as of december  that will carry into property management  maintenance and leasing fee revenues have remained fairly constant between and as the number of properties managed by the company has not changed significantly 
construction management and development activity income represents construction and development fees earned on projects where the company acts as the construction manager along with profits from the company s held for sale program under which the company develops a property with the intent to sell upon completion 
the decrease in revenues from million in to million in is primarily due to fewer properties being sold in from the held for sale program 
during  the company sold eight held for sale properties for a pre tax gain of million compared to the sale of four properties in for a pre tax gain of million in profit margins on held for sale transactions fluctuate by sale depending on the type of property being sold  the strength of the underlying tenant and the nature of the sale  such as a pre contracted purchase price for a primary tenant versus a sale on the open market 
service operations expenses decreased from million in to million in included in these amounts are income taxes which decreased to million in from million in primarily as a result of lower income from the disposition of held for sale properties 
other service operations expenses increased by approximately million in over this increase was driven primarily from the costs associated with increased third party construction volume 
general and administrative expense general and administrative expense decreased from million in to million for the year ended december  the decrease is primarily attributable to an increase in construction volume for third party projects resulting in a greater allocation of overhead to service operations operating expenses 
other income and expenses gain on sale of land and depreciable property dispositions  net of impairment adjustment  is comprised of the following amounts in and gain on sales of depreciable properties gain on sale of joint venture interests gain on land sales impairment adjustment total gain on sales of depreciable properties represent sales of previously held for investment rental properties which did not qualify to be classified as discontinued operations under sfas see discussion under discontinued operations below

restatement of net income in july of  the sec issued a staff policy statement that clarified the application of fasb eitf topic d topic d  the effect on the calculation of earnings per share for the redemption or induced conversion of preferred stock 
under topic d  the difference between the amounts paid to the holders of preferred stock upon redemption and the carrying amount of the preferred stock on the issuer s balance sheet must be subtracted from net income when computing earnings per share 
the staff policy statement clarified that  in computing the reduction in net income  the carrying amount of the preferred stock should be reduced by the issuance costs of the preferred stock 
as a result of this clarification  the company s net income per share was restated for and the impact of this restatement is summarized as follows twelve months ended december  net income available for common shareholders prior to topic d post adoption of topic d basic net income per common share prior to topic d post adoption of topic d diluted net income per common share prior to topic d post adoption of topic d critical accounting policies the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
the company s estimates  judgments and assumptions are continually evaluated based upon available information and experience 
note to the consolidated financial statements includes further discussion of the company s significant accounting policies 
the company s management has assessed the accounting policies used in the preparation of its financial statements and discussed them with the company s audit committee and independent auditors 
the following accounting policies are considered critical based upon materiality to the financial statements  degree of judgment involved in estimating reported amounts and sensitivity to changes in industry and economic conditions accounting for joint ventures the company has equity interests ranging from in joint ventures that own and operate rental properties and hold land for development 
the company consolidates those joint ventures that it controls through majority ownership interests or substantial participating rights 
control is further demonstrated by the ability of the general partner to manage day to day operations  refinance debt and sell the assets of the joint venture without the consent of the limited partner and inability of the limited partner to replace the general partner 
the company uses the equity method of accounting for those joint ventures where the company does not have control over operating and financial polices 
under the equity method of accounting  the assets and liabilities of joint ventures for which the company uses the equity method are not included on the company s balance sheet 
cost capitalization direct and certain indirect costs  including interest  clearly associated with the development  construction  leasing or expansion of real estate investments are capitalized as a cost of the property 
the following discusses the significant categories of costs incurred by the company within the rental operations of the company  direct and indirect costs are capitalized under the guidelines of sfas  accounting for costs and initial rental operations of real estate projects sfas  and interest costs are capitalized under the guidelines of sfas  capitalization of interest cost sfas 
the company capitalizes these project costs associated with the initial construction of a property up to the time the property is substantially complete and ready for its intended use 
the company believes the completion of the building shell is the proper basis for determining substantial completion and that this basis is the most widely accepted standard in the real estate industry 
the interest rate used to capitalize costs is based upon the company s average borrowing rate on existing debt 
in addition  the company capitalizes costs  including interest costs  on vacant space during extended lease up periods after construction of the building shell has been completed if costs are being incurred to ready the vacant space for its intended use 
if costs and activities incurred to ready the vacant space cease  then cost capitalization is also discontinued until such activities are resumed 
once necessary work has been completed on a vacant space  project costs are no longer capitalized 
the company ceases capitalization of all project costs on extended lease up periods after the shorter of a one year period after the completion of the building shell or when the property attains a occupancy 
the company follows guidelines in sfas and sfas in determining the capitalization of project costs during the lease up period of a property and believes that this treatment is consistent with real estate industry standards for project cost capitalization 
all direct construction and development costs associated with the development of a new property are capitalized 
in addition  all leasing commissions paid to third parties for new leases or lease renewals are capitalized 
a portion of the company s indirect costs associated with its construction development and leasing efforts are capitalized 
in assessing the amount of indirect costs to be capitalized  the company first allocates payroll costs  on a department by department basis  among activities for which capitalization is warranted ie  construction  development and leasing and those for which capitalization is not warranted eg  property management  maintenance  acquisitions and dispositions and general corporate functions 
to the extent the employees of a department split their time between capitalizable and non capitalizable activities  the allocations are made based on estimates of the actual amount of time spent in each activity 
once the payroll costs are allocated  the non payroll costs of each department are allocated among the capitalizable and non capitalizable activities in the same proportion as payroll costs 
the capitalized cost pool does not include any costs allocable to its executive officers 
to ensure that an appropriate amount of costs are capitalized  the amount of capitalized costs that are allocated to a specific project are limited to amounts using standards developed by the company 
these standards consist of a percentage of the total development costs of a project and a percentage of the total gross lease amount payable under a specific lease 
these standards are derived after considering both the amount of costs that would need to be paid by the company if the services were performed by third parties  and the amounts that would be allocated if the personnel in the departments were working at full capacity 
the use of these standards ensures that overhead costs attributable to downtime or to unsuccessful projects or leasing activities are not capitalized by the company 
impairment of real estate investments the company evaluates its real estate investments upon occurrence of significant changes in the operations  but not less than annually  to assess whether any impairment indications are present that affect the recovery of the recorded value 
if any real estate investment is considered impaired  a loss is provided to reduce the carrying value of the asset to its estimated fair value 
the company utilizes the guidelines established under sfas to determine if impairment conditions exist 
under sfas  the company reviews the expected undiscounted cash flows of each property in its held for rental portfolio to determine if there are any indications of impairment of a property 
the review of anticipated cash flows involves subjective assumptions of estimated occupancy and rental rates and ultimate residual value 
in addition to reviewing anticipated cash flows  the company assesses other factors such as changes in business climate and legal factors that may affect the ultimate value of the property 
these assumptions are subjective and the anticipated cash flows may not ultimately be achieved 
real estate assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of their carrying value amount or the fair value less estimated cost to sell 
acquisition of real estate property 
the company treats each material property acquisition as a business within the scope of sfas in accordance with that statement  the company allocates the purchase price of acquired properties to net tangible and identified intangible assets based on their respective fair value 
the allocation to tangible assets building and land is based upon management s determination of the value of the property as if it were vacant using discounted cash flow models similar to those used by independent appraisers 
factors considered by management include an estimate of carrying costs during the expected lease up periods considering current market conditions  and costs to execute similar leases 
the remaining purchase price is allocated among three categories of intangible assets consisting of the above or below market component of in place leases  the value of in place leases and the value of customer relationships 
the value allocable to the above or below market component of an acquired in place lease is determined based upon the present value using an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the lease of the difference between i the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the lease over its remaining term  and ii management s estimate of the amounts that would be paid using current fair market rates over the remaining term of the lease 
the amounts allocated to above or below market leases are included in deferred leasing and other costs in the balance sheet and are amortized to rental income over the remaining terms of the respective leases 
the total amount of intangible assets is further allocated to in place lease values and to customer relationship values  based upon management s assessment of their respective values 
these intangible assets are included in deferred leasing and other costs in the balance sheet and are depreciated over the remaining term of the existing lease  or the anticipated life of the customer relationship  as applicable 
valuation of receivables the company is subject to tenant defaults and bankruptcies that could affect the collection of outstanding receivables 
in order to mitigate these risks  the company performs in house credit review and analysis on major existing tenants and all significant leases before they are executed 
the company has established the following procedures and policies to evaluate the collectibility of outstanding receivables and record allowances the company maintains a tenant watch list containing a list of significant tenants for which the payment of receivables and future rent may be at risk 
various factors such as late rent payments  lease or debt instrument defaults  and indications of a deteriorating financial position are considered when determining whether to include a tenant on the watch list 
as a matter of policy  the company reserves the entire receivable balance  including straight line rent  of any tenant with an amount outstanding over days 
straight line rent receivables for any tenant on the watch list or any other tenant identified as a potential long term risk  regardless of the status of rent receivables  are reviewed and reserved as necessary 
in addition  a general reserve for straight line rent receivables is provided in an amount equal to to of the outstanding balance 
revenue recognition on construction contracts the company recognizes income on construction contracts where the company serves as a general contractor on the percentage of completion method 
using this method  profits are recorded on the basis of the company s estimates of the overall profit and percentage of completion of individual contracts 
a portion of the estimated profits is accrued based upon the company s estimates of the percentage of completion of the construction contract 
cumulative revenues recognized may be less or greater than cumulative costs and profits billed at any point in time during a contract s term 
this revenue recognition method involves inherent risks relating to profit and cost estimates with those risks reduced through approval and monitoring processes

liquidity and capital resources sources of liquidity the company expects to meet its liquidity requirements over the next twelve months  including payments of dividends and distributions as well as recurring capital expenditures relating to maintaining the company s current real estate assets  primarily through the following working capital  and net cash provided by operating activities although the company historically has not used any other sources of funds to pay for recurring capital expenditures on its current real estate investments  the use of borrowings or property disposition proceeds may be needed to fund such expenditures during periods of high leasing volume 
this situation could arise in if the company experiences a significant increase in its occupancy 
the company expects to meet its long term liquidity requirements  such as scheduled mortgage debt maturities  preferred stock redemptions  the retirement of unsecured notes and amounts outstanding under the unsecured credit facility  property acquisitions  financing of development activities and other non recurring capital improvements  primarily from the following sources issuance of additional unsecured notes  issuance of additional preferred stock  undistributed cash provided by operating activities  if any  and proceeds received from real estate dispositions 
rental operations the company believes that its principal source of liquidity  cash flows from rental operations  provides a stable source of cash to fund operational expenses 
the company believes that this cash based revenue stream is substantially aligned with revenue recognition except for periodic straight line rental income accruals as cash receipts from the leasing of rental properties are generally received in advance of or in a short time following the actual revenue recognition 
the company is subject to risks of decreased occupancy through market conditions as well as tenant defaults and bankruptcies  and potential reduction in rental rates upon renewal or re letting of properties  which would result in reduced cash flow from operations

the indenture governing the company s unsecured notes also requires the company to comply with financial ratios and other covenants regarding the operations of the company 
the company is currently in compliance with all such covenants and expects to remain in compliance for the foreseeable future

in and  volume was substantially reduced as capital needs were met through other sources and the slower business climate provided fewer opportunities to profitably reinvest sale proceeds 
the company continues to pursue opportunities to sell real estate assets when beneficial to the long term strategy of the company
