item management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations management s overview during the past three years  our operations have consisted primarily of products and services provided to the bankruptcy industry 
for the government fiscal years ended september    and  the administrative office of the us courts reported approximately million  million  and million new bankruptcy filings  respectively 
our revenues do not  however  correlate directly with the number of bankruptcy filings 
for chapter bankruptcy filings  our revenues primarily depend on the level of trustee deposits held by the trustees using our software 
for chapter filings  our revenues primarily depend on the number of creditors of the bankrupt entity as well as on the overall complexity of the case 
for chapter bankruptcy filings  our revenues primarily depend on the number of cases being managed by trustees using our software 
the number of new bankruptcy filings each year may vary based on interest rate levels  the level of consumer and business debt  the general economy  and other factors 
we believe the level of consumer and business debt is among the most important indicators of future bankruptcy filings 
the federal reserve reported consumer debt outstanding of trillion  trillion  and trillion as of september    and  respectively 
the federal reserve reported business debt outstanding of trillion  trillion  and trillion as of september    and  respectively 
during  bankruptcy case management revenues accounted for approximately of total revenue received from bank of america and are related to the level of trustee deposits and the number of trustee customers 
until september   we maintain our current bankruptcy case management fee structure with bank of america 
during  bankruptcy professional services revenues accounted for approximately of the total revenue we received from bank of america 
bankruptcy professional services revenues are earned based on database conversions  software upgrades  and technology management and strategic consulting services provided to bank of america 
through the end of the exclusive marketing relationship  we will continue to provide bank of america with professional services at levels approximately commensurate with prior periods 
beginning april   we anticipate that aggregate professional services provided to bank of america will decline compared with prior periods 
acquisitions are a key component of our growth strategy 
we have acquired a number of businesses during the past several years  and we may acquire additional businesses in the future 
in january  we acquired bsi to begin offering an integrated solution of professional services and proprietary technology platform for chapter restructurings 
in january  we acquired poorman douglas to begin offering class action and mass tort case management and document management solutions 
in the future  we will continue to consider new acquisition opportunities 
during  we determined that our infrastructure software segment was no longer germane to our long term strategic plan  and we developed a plan to sell this segment within a year 
accordingly  our infrastructure software results for   and are included entirely within the discontinued operations section of our income statement 
we believe this disposition will enhance long term shareholder value by enabling us to focus our management and financial resources on the operations of our bankruptcy services and class action products and services 
critical accounting policies we consider our accounting policies related to revenue recognition  business combination accounting  goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization  and software capitalization to be critical policies in understanding our historical and future performance 
revenue recognition 
revenues are derived from bankruptcy case management fees and bankruptcy professional services 
we have agreements with each bankruptcy trustee or debtor in possession customer obligating us to deliver various products and services each month 
the fees paid are contingent upon the month to month delivery of the products and services and are based on formulas  as defined by the contracts  related to the number of trustees and cash balances in a trustee s bank account  the number of cases in a trustee s portfolio or the number of claims in each case 
the formula based fees earned each month become fixed and determinable on a monthly basis as a result of all contractually required products and services delivered by us during the month 
bankruptcy professional services revenues are recognized in the period the services are provided 
business combination accounting 
we have acquired a number of businesses during the last several years  and we may acquire additional businesses in the future 
business combination accounting  often referred to as purchase accounting  requires us to determine the fair value of all assets acquired  including identifiable intangible assets  and liabilities assumed 
the cost of the acquisition is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in amounts equal to the fair value of each asset and liability  and any remaining acquisition cost is classified as goodwill 
this allocation process requires extensive use of estimates and assumptions  including estimates of future cash flows to be generated by the acquired assets 
certain identifiable intangible assets  such as customer lists and covenants not to compete  are amortized on a straightline basis over the intangible asset s estimated useful life 
the estimated useful life of amortizable identifiable assets range from two to fourteen years 
goodwill and certain other identifiable intangible assets are not amortized 
accordingly  the acquisition cost allocation has had a significant impact on our current operating results and will have a significant impact on our future operating results 
goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization 
we assess goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization for impairment as of each july and also at any other date when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may exceed their fair value 
this assessment is performed at a reporting unit level 
a reporting unit is a component of a segment that constitutes a business  for which discrete financial information is available  and for which the operating results are regularly reviewed by segment management 
a change in events or circumstances  including a decision to hold an asset or group of assets for sale  a change in strategic direction  or a change in the competitive environment in which any reporting unit operates  could adversely affect the fair value of one or more reporting units 
during  we determined that our infrastructure software segment was no longer germane to our long term strategic plan  and we developed a plan to sell this segment within a year 
the estimate of fair value is highly subjective and requires significant judgment 
if we determine that the fair value of any reporting unit is less than the reporting unit s carrying value  then we will recognize an impairment charge 
as a result of our intent to sell our infrastructure software business  during we recognized a pre tax impairment charge of approximately  related to goodwill and other intangible assets 
if remaining goodwill and intangible assets on our balance sheet become impaired during a future period  the resulting impairment charge could have a material impact on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
our unimpaired  recognized goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization totaled  as of december  internal software development costs 
certain internal software development costs incurred in the creation of computer software products are capitalized once technological feasibility has been established 
prior to the completion of detailed program design  development costs are expensed and shown as general and administrative expenses on the statements of income 
capitalized internal software development costs are amortized based on the greater of the ratio of current revenue to current and estimated future revenue for each product  or the straight line amortization over the remaining estimated economic life of the product  not to exceed five years 
management periodically reevaluates its previous estimated future revenue for each product and the remaining estimated economic life of the product 
as a result of our decision to hold our infrastructure software assets for sale  during we recognized a pre tax impairment charge related to capitalized software of the infrastructure software business of approximately  our capitalized internal software development costs  net of accumulated amortization  totaled  as of december  results of operations year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenues revenues from the bankruptcy and related services segment increased by  or approximately  to  for the year ended december  compared to  during the prior year 
bankruptcy case management fees increased  or approximately 
 of this increase was the result of bankruptcy case management fees generated by bsi  which we acquired in january the remainder of the increase was due to the growth of chapter average aggregate bankruptcy estate deposits  which increased in excess of in bankruptcy professional services revenue increased by  primarily as a result of the acquisition of bsi 
fees from bank of america for marketing and strategic consulting and technology services accounted for approximately of bankruptcy professional services revenues compared to in the same period of the prior year 
based on current projects and agreed upon fees with bank of america  we anticipate that revenue from bank of america for bankruptcy professional services during the first quarter of will be comparable to revenue earned in the same period in the prior year 
after that date  our relationship with bank of america will become non exclusive  and we anticipate that bank of america will reduce the requested level of customized products and services 
we are currently seeking to expand our chapter deposit relationships 
we believe that we will be successful in establishing one or more of these relationships  but cannot predict the timing or pricing terms of any particular new relationship 
the revenues from any new chapter deposit relationship may offset some or all of the anticipated decline in professional services revenue from bank of america 
if we are not successful in establishing new banking relationships  our bankruptcy revenues could decline or fail to grow at rates comparable to past revenue growth 
cost of sales total bankruptcy and related services cost of sales increased to  or of bankruptcy and related services revenues  for the year ended december  compared to  or of bankruptcy and related services revenues  for the prior year 
the increase in cost of sales as a percent of bankruptcy and related services revenue is attributable to our acquisition of bsi 
as required by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states commonly referred to as gaap  bsi includes reimbursed expenses  primarily postage  in both its operating revenues and in its cost of sales 
during  such reimbursed expenses totaled approximately  exclusive of this reimbursed postage expense  bankruptcy and related services cost of sales as a percent of revenues decreased from during to in this decrease is primarily the result of cost reductions and spending controls 
the primary components of the dollar increase in bankruptcy and related services cost of sales were the increase in reimbursed expense as discussed above  an approximate  increase in expense related to noticing and printing services  and an approximate  increase in compensation expense 
all of these increases are primarily attributable to providing support for our new chapter case management and professional services product lines 
operating expenses operating expenses increased to  for the year ended december  compared to  for the prior year 
operating expenses as a percent of operating revenues were for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the largest component of operating expenses  general and administrative expenses  increased to  for the year ended december  compared to  during the prior year 
however  general and administrative expenses as a percent of bankruptcy and related services revenues decreased to approximately for the year ended december  compared to for the prior year 
the dollar increase in general and administrative expenses was largely related to our acquisition of bsi  including increases in compensation expense  travel expense to support integration of the operations of bsi into our consolidated operations  and rent expense for the acquired new york office facility 
amortization expense related to acquired identifiable intangible assets increased  compared with the same period in the prior year primarily due to amortization expense of amortizable identifiable assets acquired as a part of the bsi transaction 
acquisition related expenses  consisting of executive bonuses  legal  accounting and valuation services  and travel  increased  to  for the year ended december   due to the investigation of potential acquisitions and non capitalizable expenses related to completed acquisitions 
effective tax rate our effective tax rate related to income from continuing operations increased to for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  this increase is primarily due to the acquisition of bsi 
bsi primarily generates revenue in the city and state of new york  both of which have high corporate tax rates 
discontinued operations our infrastructure software results for and are included entirely within the discontinued operations section of our income statement 
the  increase in infrastructure software s loss before income tax benefit during as compared with is primarily the result of a  impairment charge to reduce goodwill  other intangible assets  software and other long lived assets to their estimated fair value 
year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenues bankruptcy and related services operating revenues increased by  or approximately  to  for the year ended december   compared to  during the prior year 
bankruptcy case management fees increased approximately  or  to  for the year ended december  compared with the prior year primarily due to strong growth in both the value of bankruptcy estate deposits as well as the number of trustee customers 
bankruptcy professional services revenue increased approximately  or  to  for the year ended december  compared with the prior year 
this growth primarily resulted from increased fees from bank of america for marketing and strategic consulting and technology services 
these fees from bank of america accounted for of bankruptcy professional services revenue for compared to for cost of sales total bankruptcy and related services cost of sales increased approximately to  or of bankruptcy and related services revenues  for the year ended december  compared to  or of bankruptcy and related services revenues  for the year ended december  the decrease in the cost of products and services as a percentage of revenue was largely attributable to the increase in the number of trustees and deposits from which revenues are generated 
these bankruptcy related fees provided increases in revenue without a proportionate increase in the cost of products and services  resulting in an improvement in our gross profit percentage 
operating expenses operating expenses increased approximately  or  to  for the year ended december  compared to  for the prior year 
operating expenses as a percent of operating revenues were approximately for the year ended december  compared to approximately for the year ended december  the increase in operating expenses was primarily due to an approximate increase in general and administrative expenses 
to support our revenue growth  we had increased expenses related to personnel and insurance 
acquisition related expenses  consisting primarily of legal  accounting and valuation services  travel and executive bonuses  increased  in due to the increased volume of work related to both potential and completed acquisitions 
these increases in operating expenses were partly offset by a  decrease in amortization expense related to goodwill and intangible assets 
this decrease results primarily from our cessation of goodwill amortization effective january   as required by sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
effective tax rate our effective tax rate related to income from continuing operations was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  discontinued operations our infrastructure software results for and are included entirely within the discontinued operations section of our income statement 
the infrastructure software segment s loss before income tax benefit was  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  the increase in loss was primarily the result of an increase in software amortization due to the completion and release into production of updated software products 
liquidity and capital resources during the year ended december   we generated  of cash and cash equivalents from operating activities 
during the year ended december   our cash and cash equivalents decreased by  from  at january  to  at december  the cash and cash equivalents generated during this period and the  decrease in cash and cash equivalents since the beginning of the year were primarily used as follows  net of cash acquired  was paid as partial consideration for the purchase of bsi   was used to purchase property and equipment  primarily related to the installation of computer equipment at various trustee locations  and  was used to fund internal costs related to development of computer software for which technological feasibility has been established 
as of december   we maintained a working capital line of credit of  maturing on may  the  line of credit replaced two existing lines of credit  with an aggregate capacity of  that were in place as of december  no amounts were borrowed under any line of credit during subsequent to year end  we acquired of the equity of poorman douglas for approximately  in cash 
to partly finance this acquisition  we terminated the line of credit outstanding at december  and entered into a  syndicated credit facility 
the credit facility consists of a  senior term loan  with amortizing quarterly principal payments of  million beginning april   a  senior revolving loan  and a  subordinated term loan 
at inception of the credit facility  we borrowed  under the credit facility  consisting of all of the senior and subordinated term loans and  of the senior revolving loan  and used the proceeds to partly finance the acquisition of poorman douglas 
the senior term loan and revolver mature july   while the subordinated term loan matures december  we believe that the funds generated from operations plus amounts available under our line of credit will be sufficient for the foreseeable future to finance currently anticipated working capital requirements  software and property and equipment expenditures  payments for contractual obligations  interest payments due on our credit facility borrowings  and the required principal payments on our senior term loan under the credit facility 
during  we may decide to issue equity  subordinated debt  or convertible subordinated debt to repay part or all of the borrowings under the credit facility 
furthermore  we continue to explore acquisition opportunities 
covenants contained in our new credit facility may limit our ability to consummate an acquisition 
if we make an additional acquisition or acquisitions  it may be necessary to raise additional capital through a restructuring of our credit facility  the issuance of equity  subordinated debt  or convertible subordinated debt  or some combination of the preceding 
contractual obligations the following table sets forth a summary of our contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period contractual obligation total less than year years years more than years in thousands long term debt continuing operations employment agreements capital lease obligations operating leases total debt incurred to partly finance the acquisition of poorman douglas is not included in this table as the debt was incurred subsequent to year end

recent accounting pronouncements in may  the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas established standards for classifying and measuring certain financial instruments that embody obligations and have characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas became effective june   for all financial instruments created or modified after may   and other wise became effective as of july  in december  the fasb deferred for an indefinite period the application of the guidance in sfas to noncontrolling interest that are classified as equity in the financial statements of a subsidiary but  on application of sfas  would be classified as a liability in the parent s financial statements 
the deferral is limited to mandatorily redeemable noncontrolling interests associated with finite lived subsidiaries 
we believe we do not have any such entities and that future guidance on this issue will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin  which applies to all public entities  clarifies the application of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements  to certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
in december  the fasb reissued fin with certain modifications and clarifications 
application of this guidance was effective for interests in certain variable interest entities commonly referred to as special purpose entities as of december  application for all other types of entities is required for periods ending after march   unless previously applied 
we expect that final adoption of this statement will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements
