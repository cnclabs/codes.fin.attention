overview the company owns and operates million rentable square feet of flex  industrial and office properties located in eight states 
the company focuses on increasing profitability and cash flow aimed at maximizing shareholder value 
the company strives to maintain high occupancy levels while increasing rental rates when market conditions allow 
the company also acquires properties which it believes will create long term value  and disposes of properties which no longer fit within the company s strategic objectives or in situations where it can optimize cash proceeds 
operating results are driven by income from rental operations and are therefore substantially influenced by rental demand for space within our properties 
in the company continued to experience the effects of a generally slow economy and a particularly difficult real estate market heavily favoring tenants 
these market conditions impacted many aspects of the company s business including occupancy levels and rental rates 
market conditions  characterized by weak demand and over supply resulted in downward pressure on rental rates coupled with increased necessity to give rental concessions 
the company also continued to experience increasing tenant improvement costs in despite these difficult market conditions  the company successfully leased million square feet of lease transactions and achieved an overall occupancy for the year of 
however  operating income for our same park properties decreased from by million or on a cash basis and million or on a straight line basis 
see further discussion of operating results below 
the company believes that will continue to see some downward pressure on rents coupled with upward pressure on transaction costs 
that said  the company is cautiously optimistic that it will see some stabilization in some markets  with some potential opportunities to improve rental rates 
critical accounting policies and estimates our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
we believe our most critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  impairment of long lived assets  capitalization of real estate facilities  depreciation  accrual of operating expenses and accruals for contingencies  each of which we discuss below 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
of the securities and exchange commission  revenue recognition in financial statements sab  as amended 
sab requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the delivery has occurred or services rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
all leases are classified as operating leases 
rental income is recognized on a straight line basis over the terms of the leases 
deferred rent receivables represents rental revenue accrued on a straight line basis in excess of rental revenue currently billed 
reimbursements from tenants for real estate taxes and other recoverable operating expenses are recognized as revenues in the period the applicable costs are incurred 
allowance for doubtful accounts rental revenue from our tenants is our principal source of revenue 
we monitor the collectibility of our receivable balances including the deferred rent receivable on an on going basis 
based on these reviews  we establish a provision  and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the possible inability of our tenants to make required rent payments to us 
tenant receivables and unbilled deferred rent receivables are carried net of the allowances for uncollectible tenant receivables and unbilled deferred rent 
management s determination of the adequacy of these allowances requires significant judgments and estimates 
current tenant receivables consist primarily of amounts due for contractual lease payments  reimbursements of common area maintenance expenses  property taxes and other expenses recoverable from tenants 
management s determination of the adequacy of the allowance for uncollectible current tenant receivables is performed using a methodology that incorporates both a specific identification and aging analysis and includes an overall evaluation of the company s historical loss trends and the current economic and business environment 
the specific identification methodology relies on factors such as the age and nature of the receivables  the payment history and financial condition of the tenant  the company s assessment of the tenant s ability to meet its lease obligations  and the status of negotiations of any disputes with the tenant 
the company s allowance also includes a reserve based on historical loss trends not associated with any specific tenant 
this reserve as well as the company s specific identification reserve is reevaluated quarterly based on economic conditions and the current business environment 
unbilled deferred rents receivable represents the amount that the cumulative straight line rental income recorded to date exceeds cash rents billed to date under the lease agreement 
given the longer term nature of these types of receivables  management s determination of the adequacy of the allowance for unbilled deferred rents receivables is based primarily on historical loss experience 
management evaluates the allowance for unbilled deferred rents receivable using a specific identification methodology for the company s significant tenants assessing the tenants financial condition and its ability to meet its lease obligations 
impairment of long lived assets the company evaluates a property for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable 
in the event that these periodic assessments reflect that the carrying amount of a property exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows excluding interest that are expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the property  the company would recognize an impairment loss to the extent the carrying amount exceeded the estimated fair value of the property 
the estimation of expected future net cash flows is inherently uncertain and relies on subjective assumptions dependent upon future and current market conditions and events that affect the ultimate value of the property 
it requires management to make assumptions related to future rental rates  tenant allowances  operating expenditures  property taxes  capital improvements  occupancy levels  and the estimated proceeds generated from the future sale of the property 
capitalization of real estate facilities real estate facilities are recorded at cost 
costs related to the renovation or improvement of the properties are capitalized 
expenditures for repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred 
expenditures that are expected to benefit a period greater than months and exceed  are capitalized and depreciated over the estimated useful life 
buildings and equipment are depreciated on the straight line method over the estimated useful lives  which are generally and years  respectively 
leasing costs in excess of  for leases with terms greater than two years are capitalized and depreciated amortized over their estimated useful lives 
leasing costs for leases of less than two years or less than  are expensed as incurred 
interest cost and property taxes incurred during the period of construction of real estate facilities are capitalized 
if these costs are not capitalized correctly  the timing of expenses and the recording of real estate assets could be over or understated 
depreciation we compute depreciation on our buildings and equipment using the straight line method based on estimated useful lives of generally and years 
a significant portion of the acquisition cost of each property is allocated to building and building components usually 
the allocation of the acquisition cost to building and its components and the determination of the useful life are based on management s estimates 
if we do not allocate appropriately to building or related components or incorrectly estimate the useful life of our properties  the timing and or the amount of depreciation expense will be affected 
in addition  the net book value of real estate assets could be over or understated 
the statement of cash flows  however  would not be affected 
accruals of operating expenses the company accrues for property tax expenses  performance bonuses and other operating expenses each quarter based on historical trends and anticipated disbursements 
if these estimates are incorrect  the timing of expense recognition will be affected 
accruals for contingencies the company is exposed to business and legal liability risks with respect to events that may have occurred  but in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles has not accrued for such potential liabilities because the loss is either not probable or not estimable 
future events and the result of pending litigation could result in such potential losses becoming probable and estimable  which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
clarification of emerging issues task force topic d and impact on reported earnings per common share emerging issues task force eitf topic d  the effect on the calculation of earnings per share for the redemption or induced conversion of preferred stock provides  among other things  that any excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred to the holders of preferred stock redeemed over the carrying amount of the preferred stock should be subtracted from net earnings to determine net earnings available to common stockholders in the calculation of earnings per share 
at the july  meeting of the eitf  the securities and exchange commission s observer clarified that for the purposes of applying eitf topic d  the carrying amount of the preferred stock should be reduced by the issuance costs of the preferred stock upon redemption  regardless of where in the stockholders equity section those costs were initially classified on issuance 
the company records its issuance costs as a reduction to paid in capital on its balance sheet at the time the preferred securities are issued and reflects the carrying value of the preferred stock at the stated value 
the company reduces the carrying value of preferred stock by the issuance costs at the time it notifies the holders of preferred stock or units of its intent to redeem such shares or units to comply with eitf topic d qualification as a reit income tax expense we believe that we have been organized and operated  and we intend to continue to operate  as a qualifying reit under the internal revenue code and applicable state laws 
a qualifying reit generally does not pay corporate level income taxes on its taxable income that is distributed to its shareholders  and accordingly  we do not pay or record as an expense income tax on the share of our taxable income that is distributed to shareholders 
given the complex nature of the reit qualification requirements  the ongoing importance of factual determinations and the possibility of future changes in our circumstances  we cannot provide any assurance that we actually have satisfied or will satisfy the requirements for taxation as a reit for any particular taxable year 
for any taxable year that we fail or failed to qualify as a reit and applicable relief provisions did not apply  we would be taxed at the regular corporate rates on all of our taxable income  whether or not we made or make any distributions to our shareholders 
any resulting requirement to pay corporate income tax  including any applicable penalties or interest  could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
unless entitled to relief under specific statutory provisions  we also would be disqualified from taxation as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which qualifications was lost 
there can be no assurance that we would be entitled to any statutory relief 
effect of economic conditions on the company s operations during and  the company has been affected by the slowdown in economic activity in the united states in most of its primary markets 
these effects include a decline in occupancy rates  a reduction in market rental rates throughout the portfolio  increased rent concessions  tenant improvement allowances and lease commissions  slower than expected lease up of the company s development properties  increased tenant defaults and the termination of leases pursuant to early termination options 
the reduction in occupancies and market rental rates has been the result of several factors related to general economic conditions 
there are more businesses contracting than expanding  more businesses failing than starting up and general uncertainty for businesses  resulting in slower decision making and requests for shorter term leases 
there is also more competing vacant space  including substantial amounts of sub lease space  in many of the company s markets 
many of the company s properties have lower vacancy rates than the average rates for the markets in which they are located  consequently  the company may have difficulty in maintaining its occupancy rates as leases expire 
an extended economic slowdown will put additional downward pressure on occupancies and market rental rates 
the economic slowdown and the abundance of space alternatives available to customers has led to pressure for greater rent concessions  more generous tenant improvement allowances and higher broker commissions 
these economic conditions have also resulted in the erosion of tenant credit quality throughout the portfolio 
as a result  more tenants are contacting us regarding their economic viability  including those that could be material to our revenue base  and more tenants are electing to terminate their leases early under lease termination options 
to a certain extent  these economic conditions have affected three large tenants representing a combined of the company s revenues 
leases with footstar generate approximately of our revenues 
footstar and its affiliates recently filed protection under chapter of the us bankruptcy laws 
in connection with such filing  they have rejected one of two leases with the company 
the lease which has been rejected was for approximately  square feet in dallas  texas  with minimum annual rents of approximately  no action has been taken with respect to the second lease 
leases with worldcom and a related worldcom entity  both of which are in bankruptcy  generate approximately of our revenues 
worldcom and its bankrupt related entity have recently notified us that they are rejecting leases representing approximately of our revenues and are threatening to reject the other leases with us 
in addition  we believe that a second worldcom related entity  although not in bankruptcy  may be in financial difficulty 
a lease with this second worldcom related entity generates approximately of our revenues 
another large tenant representing approximately of revenues originally defaulted on its lease obligations in the third quarter of while the tenant subsequently cured the original default  they have continued to experience multiple default situations  most recently in february   which was subsequently cured in march  the company will continue to monitor this tenant and its financial condition 
the tenant is requesting a modification of its lease 
several other of our large tenants have contacted us  requesting early termination of their lease  rent reduction in space under lease  rent deferment or abatement 
at this time  the company cannot anticipate what impact  if any  the ultimate outcome of these discussions will have on our operating results 
effect of economic conditions on the company s primary markets the company has concentrated its operations in eight major markets 
each of these markets has been affected by the slowdown in economic activity 
the company s overall view of these markets is summarized below as of december  the company has compiled the market occupancy information set forth below  using broker reports for these respective markets 
these sources are deemed to be reliable by the company  but there can be no assurance that these reports are accurate 
the company owns approximately million square feet in southern california 
this is one of the more stable markets in the country but continues to experience relatively flat rental rates 
vacancy rates have decreased slightly throughout southern california for flex  industrial and office space  and range from to for office and less than for industrial  depending on sub markets and product type 
the rental rates for the company s properties have improved slightly 
the company s vacancy rate at december  was approximately 
the company owns approximately million square feet in northern virginia  where the overall vacancy rate is as of december  vacancy rates have stabilized at in the sub markets in the western technology corridor  such as herndon  chantilly and sterling  primarily as a result of the decline in the technology sector 
other sub markets have been positively impacted by increased federal government spending on defense 
the company s vacancy rate at december  was approximately 
the company owns approximately million square feet in maryland 
this region is split between two very different markets 
the montgomery county submarket accounts for approximately of the company s maryland properties and remains stable  with increases in rental income driven by anticipated lease up and some increase in rental rates 
prince george s county remains relatively weak with fewer demand drivers in the market 
the company expects that the business of the federal government  defense contractors and the biotech industry will remain strong in the company s vacancy rate at december  was approximately 
the company owns approximately million square feet in northern california with a concentration in south san francisco  santa clara  san jose  and sacramento 
the vacancy rates in these submarkets stand at  and  respectively  or more throughout most of the bay area 
market rental rates dropped dramatically in and continue to decrease 
the company s vacancy rate at december  was approximately 
the company owns approximately million square feet in the beaverton sub market of portland  oregon 
leasing activity slowed dramatically during and continues to be slow in the vacancy rate in this market is over

the company s vacancy rate at december  was approximately 
the company owns approximately million square feet in the dallas metroplex and greater houston markets 
the vacancy rate in las colinas  where most of the company s properties are concentrated  has stabilized at for office and for industrial flex 
during the year ended december   the number of new properties coming on line has decreased  virtually no new construction has commenced and very little pre leasing of space has occurred 
the company believes that any such new construction will cause vacancy rates to rise 
leasing activity has slowed overall and sub leasing is continuing to increase in the telecom corridor in north dallas county 
the company s vacancy rate at december  was approximately 
the company owns approximately million square feet in austin  texas 
this market experienced a dramatic increase in office and flex vacancy  both running at  respectively 
a substantial portion of the office vacancy is due to sub lease space 
construction deliveries of office and flex space continue to add to the vacancy rate resulting in downward pressure on rental rates 
the company s vacancy rate at december  was approximately 
in december   the company acquired a million square foot property located in the airport west sub market of miami dade county in florida 
the property s vacancy rate upon acquisition was approximately  compared to a vacancy rate of approximately for the entire sub market 
the property is located less than one mile from the cargo entrance of the miami international airport  which is recognized as one of the nation s busiest cargo and passenger airports 
growth of the company s operations and acquisitions and dispositions of properties during and  the company has focused on maximizing cash flow from its existing core portfolio of properties  seeking to expand its presence in existing markets through strategic acquisitions and developments and strengthening its balance sheet  primarily through the issuance of preferred stock units 
the company has historically maintained low debt and overall leverage levels  including preferred stock units  which the company believes should give it the flexibility for future growth without the issuance of additional common stock 
during  the company added approximately million square feet to its portfolio at an aggregate cost of approximately million 
the company acquired  square feet in southern california for million   square feet in northern texas for million   square feet in florida for million  and  square feet in phoenix  arizona for million 
during  the company did not complete any acquisitions 
the company plans to continue to seek to build its presence in existing markets by acquiring high quality facilities in selected markets 
the company targets properties in markets with below market rents which may offer it growth in rental rates above market averages  which offer the company the ability to achieve economies of scale resulting in more efficient operations 
during the first half of  the company identified a property in lakewood  california with  square feet  two buildings in nashville  tennessee totaling  square feet  and five office and flex buildings totaling  square feet and a acre parcel of vacant land in beaverton  oregon as assets the company intended to sell 
the sale of lakewood  california was completed early in the second quarter of with net proceeds of approximately million 
the sale of the nashville properties was completed in june  with net proceeds of million 
a gain on the lakewood and nashville properties of million was recognized in the second quarter of during the third quarter of  the company sold a one acre parcel of land located in beaverton  oregon with net proceeds of approximately  the transaction was completed in july  at a gain of approximately  the remaining beaverton properties are held for disposition 
an impairment loss of million based on the estimated proceeds from the potential disposition of the beaverton  oregon properties was recognized in the first quarter of during the fourth quarter of  the company sold a  square foot flex facility in beaverton  oregon with net proceeds of approximately million 
the transaction was completed in december  at a loss of approximately in  the company sold four properties totaling  square feet 
the company exited the san antonio  texas and overland park  kansas markets 
in addition  the company sold a property located in landover  maryland that no longer met the company s investment criteria 
net proceeds from the sales were approximately million and the company recognized a net gain of million 
in addition  during the first quarter of  the company recognized million of deferred gain from a sale completed in through a joint venture with an institutional investor  the company held a equity interest in an industrial park in the city of industry  submarket of los angeles county 
initially the joint venture consisted of buildings totaling  square feet 
during  the joint venture sold eight of the buildings totaling approximately  square feet 
the company recognized gains of approximately  on the disposition of these eight buildings 
in addition  the company s interest in cash distributions from the joint venture increased from to as a result of meeting its performance measures 
therefore  the company recognized additional income of  in as of december   the joint venture held six buildings totaling  square feet 
during january   five of the remaining six buildings were sold and the company recognized gains of approximately million as a result of these sales and additional income of approximately  in the first quarter of the remaining building with approximately  square feet was sold in april  during the second quarter of  the company recognized a gain of  and additional income of  impact of inflation although inflation has slowed in recent years  it is still a factor in our economy and the company continues to seek ways to mitigate its impact 
a substantial portion of the company s leases require tenants to pay operating expenses  including real estate taxes  utilities  and insurance  as well as increases in common area expenses 
management believes these provisions reduce the company s exposure to the impact of inflation
