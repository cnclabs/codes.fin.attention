table of contents item business general hanover compressor company  we  hanover  or the company a delaware corporation  together with its subsidiaries  is a global market leader in the full service natural gas compression business and is also a leading provider of service  fabrication and equipment for oil and natural gas processing and transportation applications 
we sell and rent this equipment and provide complete operation and maintenance services  including run time guarantees  for both customer owned equipment and our fleet of rental equipment 
hanover was founded as a delaware corporation in  and has been a public company since our customers include both major and independent oil and gas producers and distributors as well as national oil and gas companies in the countries in which we operate 
our maintenance business  together with our parts and service business  provides solutions to customers that own their own compression and surface production and processing equipment  but want to outsource their operations 
we also fabricate compressor and oil and gas production and processing equipment and provide gas processing and treating  gas measurement and oilfield power generation services  primarily to our domestic and international customers as a complement to our compression services 
in addition  through our subsidiary  belleli energy srl belleli  we provide engineering  procurement and construction services primarily related to the manufacturing of heavy wall reactors for refineries and construction of desalination plants  primarily for use in europe and the middle east 
substantially all of our assets and operations are owned or conducted by our wholly owned subsidiary  hanover compression limited partnership hclp 
in december and  hclp and its subsidiaries completed various internal restructuring transactions pursuant to which certain of the domestic subsidiaries of hclp were merged  directly or indirectly  with and into hclp 
we believe that we are currently the largest natural gas compression company in the united states on the basis of aggregate rental horsepower  with approximately  rental units in the united states having an aggregate capacity of approximately  horsepower at december  in addition  we estimate that we are one of the largest providers of compression services in the latin american and canadian markets  operating approximately units internationally with approximately  horsepower at december  as of december   approximately of our natural gas compression horsepower was located in the united states and approximately was located elsewhere  primarily in latin america and canada 
our products and services are essential to the production  processing  transportation and storage of natural gas and are provided primarily to energy producers and distributors of oil and natural gas 
our decentralized operating structure  technically experienced personnel and high quality compressor fleet have allowed us to successfully provide reliable and timely customer service 
industry trends we compete primarily in the market for transportable natural gas compression units of up to  horsepower 
the market for rental compression has experienced significant growth over the past decade 
although recently we have not experienced any significant growth in domestic rentals or purchases of equipment and services by our customers  which we believe is primarily a result of the lack of a significant increase in us natural gas production levels  we believe that the us gas compression market will continue to grow due to the increased demand for natural gas  the continued aging of the natural gas reserve base and the attendant decline of wellhead pressures  the discovery of new reserves and the continuing interest in outsourcing compression by independent producers 
however  because the majority of oil and gas reserves are located outside of the united states  we believe that international markets will be a primary source of our growth opportunities in the gas compression market in the years to come 
as of december   the rental portion of the domestic gas compression market was estimated by industry sources to be approximately million horsepower  which we estimate accounts for approximately of aggregate us horsepower  having doubled since growth of the rental 
table of contents compression capacity in the us market has been primarily driven by the trend toward outsourcing by energy producers and processors 
we believe that outsourcing provides the customer greater financial and operating flexibility by minimizing the customer s investment in equipment and enabling the customer to more efficiently resize their compression capabilities to meet changing reservoir conditions 
in addition  we believe that outsourcing typically provides the customer with more timely and technically proficient service and maintenance  which often reduces operating costs 
we believe growth opportunities for compressor rental and sales exist due to increased worldwide energy consumption  implementation of international environmental and conservation laws prohibiting the flaring of natural gas  which increases the need for gathering systems  increased outsourcing by energy producers and processors  the environmental soundness  economy and availability of natural gas as an alternative energy source and continued aging of the worldwide natural gas reserve base and the attendant decline of wellhead pressures 
the rental compression business is capital intensive  and our ability to take advantage of these growth opportunities may be limited by our ability to raise capital to fund our expansion

recent events securities class actions 
on october   we entered into a stipulation of settlement  which settled all of the claims underlying the putative securities class action  the putative erisa class action and the shareholder derivative actions which were filed against the company and are more fully described in item legal proceedings in this form k 
the terms of the settlement provide for us to make a cash payment of approximately million of which million was funded by payments from hanover s directors and officers insurance carriers  issue million shares of our common stock  and issue a contingent note with a principal amount of million 
the note is payable  together with accrued interest  on march  but will be extinguished with no money owing under it if our common stock trades at or above the average price of per share for consecutive trading days at any time between march  and march  in addition  upon the occurrence of a change of control that involves us  if the change of control or shareholder approval of the change of control occurs before february   which is twelve months after final court approval of the settlement  we will be obligated to contribute an additional million to the settlement fund 
as part of the settlement  we have also agreed to implement corporate governance enhancements  including allowing shareholders owning more than but less than of our outstanding common stock to participate in the process to appoint two independent directors to our board of directors pursuant to which on february  we appointed margaret k 
dorman and stephen m 
pazuk to our board of directors and making certain changes to our code of conduct 
gkh investments  lp and gkh private limited collectively gkh  which  as of december   together owned approximately of our outstanding common stock and which sold shares in our march secondary offering of common stock  are parties to the settlement and have agreed to settle claims against them that arise out of that offering as well as other potential securities  erisa  and derivative claims 
the terms of the settlement provide for gkh to transfer million shares of our common stock from their holdings or from other sources to the settlement fund 
we received a letter on march  from the administrative trustee of the gkh liquidating trust indicating it and one of its affiliates had decided to distribute million shares of the million shares of hanover common stock owned by the gkh liquidating trust formerly held by gkh and its affiliate to the relevant beneficiaries 
the remaining million shares held by gkh will be paid as part of the global shareholder litigation settlement 
on february   the united states district court for the southern district of texas entered three orders and final judgments  approving the settlement on the terms agreed upon in the stipulation of settlement with respect to all of the claims described above 
the court also entered an order and final judgment approving the plans of allocation with respect to each action  as well as an order and final 
table of contents judgment approving the schedule of attorneys fees for counsel for the settling plaintiffs 
the time in which these orders and final judgments may be appealed expired on march  without any appeal being lodged 
the settlement has therefore become final and will be implemented according to its terms 
our independent auditor  pricewaterhousecoopers llp  is not a party to the settlement and remains a party to the securities class action 
see item legal proceedings and item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  provision for securities litigation settlement 
sec settlement 
in december  we entered into a settlement with the securities and exchange commission sec  concluding the previously disclosed sec investigation into the transactions underlying  and other matters relating to  the restatement of our financial statements for fiscal years  and without admitting or denying any of the sec s findings  we consented to the entry of a cease and desist order requiring future compliance with certain periodic reporting  record keeping and internal control provisions of the securities laws 
the settlement did not impose any monetary penalty on us and required no additional restatements of our historical financial statements 
debt refinancings 
in december  we issued under our shelf registration statement million aggregate principal amount of our senior notes due  which are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior subordinated basis by hclp 
the net proceeds from this offering were used to repay the outstanding indebtedness and minority interest obligations of million and million  respectively  under our a equipment lease that was to expire in june also in december  we issued under our shelf registration statement million aggregate principal amount of our convertible senior notes due we may redeem these convertible notes beginning in under certain circumstances 
the convertible notes are convertible into shares of our common stock at an initial conversion rate of shares of our common stock per  principal amount of the convertible notes subject to adjustment in certain events at any time prior to the stated maturity of the convertible notes or the redemption or repurchase of the convertible notes by us 
the net proceeds from this offering were used to repay a portion of the outstanding indebtedness under our bank credit facility 
new bank credit facility 
effective december   we entered into a new million bank credit facility having a maturity date of december  and made conforming amendments related to the compression equipment lease obligations that we entered into in our prior million bank credit facility that was scheduled to mature in november  was terminated upon closing of the new facility 
the new bank credit facility modified certain covenants that were contained in the prior facility and eliminated certain covenants entirely 
the new agreement prohibits us without the lenders prior approval from declaring or paying any dividend other than dividends payable solely in our common stock or in options  warrants or rights to purchase such common stock on  or making similar payments with respect to  our capital stock 
the new agreement clarifies and provides certain thresholds with respect to our ability to make investments in our foreign subsidiaries 
in addition  under the new agreement  we granted the lenders a security interest in the inventory  equipment and certain other property of hanover and its domestic subsidiaries with certain exceptions  and pledged of the equity interest in certain of our foreign subsidiaries 
we believe that this new bank credit facility will provide flexibility in accessing the capacity under the facility to support our short term liquidity needs 
panoche gates dispositions 
in may  we announced that we had agreed to sell our membership interest in wellhead power panoche  llc panoche and our membership interest in wellhead power gates  llc gates to hal dittmer and fresno power investors limited partnership  who owned the remaining interests in panoche and gates 
panoche and gates own gas fired peaking power plants of megawatts and megawatts  respectively 
the panoche transaction closed in june and the gates transaction closed in september total consideration for the transactions was approximately million consisting of approximately million in cash  million in notes that mature in may  a million note that matures in september and the release of our obligations under a capital lease from ge capital to gates that had an outstanding balance of 
table of contents approximately million at the time of the gates closing 
in addition  we were released from a million letter of credit from us to ge capital that was provided as additional credit support for the gates capital lease 
pigap ii restructuring and our zero coupon subordinated notes due march  on may   we entered into an agreement with schlumberger limited to terminate our right to put our interest in the pigap ii joint venture to schlumberger 
as a result  we retained our interest in pigap ii 
we had previously given notice of our intent to exercise the pigap put in january pigap ii is a joint venture  currently owned by a subsidiary of williams companies inc and by hanover  which operates a natural gas compression facility in venezuela 
the natural gas processed by pigap ii is re injected into oil reservoirs for enhanced oil recovery 
also on may   we agreed with schlumberger surenco  an affiliate of schlumberger  to the modification of the repayment terms of a million obligation that was accrued as a contingent liability on our balance sheet since the acquisition of production operators corporation poc and was associated with the pigap ii joint venture 
the obligation was converted into a non recourse promissory note the pigap note payable by hanover cayman limited  our indirect wholly owned consolidated subsidiary  with a interest rate compounding semi annually until maturity in december in october  the pigap ii joint venture closed on the project s financing and distributed approximately million to hanover  of which approximately million was used to repay the pigap note 
in connection with the agreement to terminate our right to put our interest in pigap ii back to schlumberger  we also agreed with schlumberger to restructure the million subordinated note that schlumberger received from hanover in august as part of the purchase price for our acquisition of poc s natural gas compression business  ownership interest in certain joint venture projects in south america including pigap ii  and related assets 
as of march   the date from which the interest rate was adjusted  the million subordinated note had an outstanding principal balance of approximately million  including accrued interest 
we restructured the million subordinated note as our zero coupon subordinated notes due march   which notes were issued to schlumberger and were sold by schlumberger in a registered public offering in december original issue discount accretes under the zero coupon notes at a rate of per annum for their remaining life  up to a total principal amount of million payable at maturity 
the notes will accrue additional interest at a rate of per annum upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default under the notes 
the notes will also accrue additional interest at a rate of per annum if our consolidated leverage ratio  as defined in the indenture governing the notes  exceeds to as of the end of any two consecutive fiscal quarters 
notwithstanding the preceding  in no event will the total additional interest accruing on the notes exceed per annum if both of the previously mentioned circumstances occur 
the notes also contain a covenant that limits our ability to incur additional indebtedness if our consolidated leverage ratio exceeds to  subject to certain exceptions 
belleli acquisition 
in  we increased our ownership of belleli to from by converting million in loans  together with approximately million in accrued interest thereon  into additional equity ownership and in november began consolidating the results of belleli s operations 
belleli has three manufacturing facilities  one in mantova  italy and two in the united arab emirates jebel ali and hamriyah 
during  we also purchased certain operating assets used by belleli for approximately million from a bankruptcy estate of belleli s former parent and leased these assets to belleli for approximately million per year  for a term of seven years 
in connection with our increase in ownership in  we entered into an agreement with the minority owner of belleli that provided the minority owner the right  until june   to purchase our interest for an amount that approximated our investment in belleli 
the agreement also provided us with the right  beginning in july  to purchase the minority owner s interest in belleli 
in addition  the minority owner historically had been unwilling to provide its proportionate share of capital to belleli 
we believed that our ability to maximize value would be enhanced if we were able to exert greater control through the exercise of our purchase right 
thus  in august  we exercised our option to acquire the remaining interest 
table of contents in belleli for approximately million in order to gain complete control of belleli 
as a result of these transactions and intervening foreign exchange rate changes  we recorded million in identifiable intangible assets  with a weighted average life of approximately years  and million in goodwill 
as a result of the war in iraq  the strengthening of the euro and generally unfavorable economic conditions  we believe that the estimated fair value of belleli declined significantly during upon gaining complete control of belleli and assessing our long term growth strategy  we determined that these general factors in combination with the specific economic factors impacting belleli had significantly and adversely impacted the timing and amount of the future cash flows that we expected belleli to generate 
we currently do not expect to realize our original growth expectations for belleli in the timeframe that we originally forecasted 
during the performance of our annual goodwill impairment review in the fourth quarter of  we determined the present value of belleli s expected future cash flows was less than our carrying value of belleli 
this resulted in a full impairment charge for the million in goodwill associated with belleli 
upon further analysis  it was determined that the factors resulting in the goodwill impairment charge were also present during the third quarter of and that the exercise of our purchase option in the third quarter of and the presence of such factors should have resulted in an interim goodwill impairment test under sfas and an impairment charge at that time 
we have adjusted our third quarter results accordingly 
industry overview gas compression typically  compression is required at several intervals of the natural gas production cycle at the wellhead  at the gathering lines  into and out of gas processing facilities  into and out of storage and throughout the transportation systems 
over the life of an oil or gas well  natural reservoir pressure and deliverability typically decline as reserves are produced 
as the natural reservoir pressure of the well declines below the line pressure of the gas gathering or pipeline system used to transport the gas to market  gas no longer flows naturally into the pipeline 
it is at this time that compression equipment is applied to economically boost the well s production levels and allow gas to be brought to market 
in addition to such wellhead and gas field gathering activities  natural gas compressors are used in a number of other applications  most of which are intended to enhance the productivity of oil and gas wells  gas transportation lines and processing plants 
compressors are used to increase the efficiency of a low capacity gas field by providing a central compression point from which the gas can be removed and injected into a pipeline for transmission to facilities for further processing 
as gas is transported through a pipeline  compression equipment is applied to allow the gas to continue to flow in the pipeline to its destination 
additionally  compressors are used to re inject associated gas to lift liquid hydrocarbons and thereby increase the rate of crude oil production from oil and gas wells 
furthermore  compression enables gas to be stored in underground storage reservoirs for subsequent extraction during periods of peak demand 
finally  compressors are often used in combination with oil and gas production equipment to process and refine oil and gas into higher value added and more marketable energy sources  as well as used in connection with compressed natural gas vehicle fueling facilities providing an alternative to gasoline 
changing well and pipeline pressures and conditions over the life of a well often require producers to reconfigure or change their compressor units to optimize the well production or pipeline efficiency 
due to the technical nature of the equipment  a dedicated local parts inventory  a diversified fleet of natural gas compressors and a highly trained staff of field service personnel are necessary to perform such functions in the most economic manner 
these requirements  however  have typically proven to be an extremely inefficient use of capital and manpower for independent natural gas producers and have caused producers  
table of contents as well as natural gas transporters and processors  to increasingly outsource their non core compression activities to specialists such as us 
the advent of rental and contract compression roughly years ago made it possible for natural gas producers  transporters and processors to improve the efficiency and financial performance of their operations 
we believe compressors leased from specialists generally have a higher rate of mechanical reliability and typically generate greater productivity than those owned by oil and gas operators 
furthermore  because compression needs of a well change over time  outsourcing of compression equipment enables an oil and gas producer to better match variable compression requirements to the production needs throughout the life of the well 
also  certain major domestic oil companies are seeking to streamline their operations and reduce their capital expenditures and other costs 
to this end  they have sold certain domestic energy reserves to independent energy producers and are outsourcing facets of their operations 
we believe that such initiatives are likely to contribute to increased rentals of compression equipment 
natural gas compressor fabrication involves the design  fabrication and sale of compressors to meet the unique specifications dictated by the well pressure  production characteristics and the particular applications for which compression is sought 
compressor fabrication is essentially an assembly operation in which an engine  compressor  control panel  cooler and necessary piping are attached to a frame called a skid 
a fabricator typically purchases the various compressor components from third party manufacturers  but employs its own engineers and design and labor force 
in order to meet customers needs  gas compressor fabricators typically offer a variety of services to their customers  including engineering  fabrication and assembly of the compressor unit  installation and testing of the unit  ongoing performance review to assess the need for a change in compression  and periodic maintenance and replacement parts supply 
production and processing equipment crude oil and natural gas are generally not marketable as produced at the wellhead and must be processed before they can be transported to market 
production and processing equipment is used to separate and treat oil and gas as it is produced to achieve a marketable quality of product 
production processing typically involves the separation of oil and gas and the removal of contaminants 
the end result is pipeline  or sales quality oil and gas 
further processing or refining is almost always required before oil or gas is suitable for use as fuel or feedstock for petrochemical production 
production processing normally takes place in the upstream market  while refining and petrochemical production is referred to as the downstream market 
wellhead or upstream production and processing equipment includes a wide and diverse range of products 
we sell standard production equipment primarily into us markets  which is used for processing wellhead production from onshore or shallow water offshore platform production 
in addition  we sell custom engineered  built to specification production and processing equipment  which typically consists of much larger equipment packages than standard equipment  and is generally used in much larger scale production operations 
these large projects tend to be in remote areas  such as deepwater offshore sites  and in developing countries with limited oil and gas industry infrastructure 
the standard production equipment market tends to be somewhat commoditized  with sales following general industry trends 
equipment can be built for inventory based on historical product mix and predicted industry activity 
the custom equipment market is driven by global economic and political trends  and the type of equipment that is purchased can vary significantly 
technology  engineering capabilities  project management and quality control standards are the key drivers in the custom equipment market 

table of contents in addition  through our ownership of belleli  we provide engineering  procurement and construction services primarily related to the manufacturing of heavy wall reactors for refineries and construction of desalination plants  primarily for use in europe and the middle east 
market conditions we believe that the most fundamental force driving the demand for gas compression and production equipment is the growing global consumption of natural gas 
as more gas is consumed  the demand for compression and production equipment increases 
in addition  we expect the demand for liquefied natural gas  compressed natural gas and liquefied petroleum gas to continue to increase and result in additional demand for our compression and production equipment and related services 
although natural gas has historically been a more significant source of energy in the united states than in the rest of the world  we believe that aggregate foreign natural gas consumption has recently grown 
despite this growth in energy demand  most non us energy markets have historically lacked the infrastructure necessary to transport natural gas to local markets and natural gas historically has been flared at the wellhead 
given recent environmental legislation and the construction of numerous natural gas fueled power plants built to meet international energy demand  we believe that international compression markets are experiencing growth 
we believe that natural gas is considered to be the fuel of the future because it provides the best mix of environmental soundness  economy and availability of any energy source 
rising worldwide energy demand  environmental considerations  the further development of the natural gas pipeline infrastructure and the increasing use of natural gas as a fuel source in oilfield power generation are the principal reasons for this growth 
while gas compression and production and processing equipment typically must be engineered to high specifications to meet demanding and unique customer specifications  the fundamental technology of such equipment has been stable and has not been subject to significant technological change 
business segments our revenues and income are derived from five business segments domestic rentals 
our domestic rentals segment primarily provides natural gas compression and production and processing equipment rental and maintenance services to meet specific customer requirements on hanover owned assets located within the united states 
international rentals 
our international rentals segment provides substantially the same services as our domestic rentals segment except it services locations outside the united states 
compressor and accessory fabrication 
our compressor and accessory fabrication segment involves the design  fabrication and sale of natural gas compression units and accessories to meet unique customer specifications 
production and processing equipment fabrication 
our production and processing equipment fabrication segment includes the design  fabrication and sale of equipment used in the production and treating of crude oil and natural gas  and the engineering  procurement and manufacturing of heavy wall reactors for refineries and the construction of desalination plants 
parts  service and used equipment 
our parts  service and used equipment segment provides a full range of services to support the surface production needs of customers  from installation and normal maintenance and services to full operation of a customer s owned assets and surface equipment as well as sales of used equipment 
the domestic and international compression rentals segments have operations primarily in the united states  canada and south america

compression rentals  maintenance services and compressor and accessory fabrication we provide our customers with a full range of compressor and associated equipment sales  rental  maintenance and contract compression services 
as of december   our compressor fleet consisted of approximately  units  ranging from to  horsepower per unit 
the size  type and geographic diversity of this rental fleet enable us to provide our customers with a range of compression units that can serve a wide variety of applications and to select the correct equipment for the job  rather than trying to fit the job to our fleet of equipment 
we base our gas compressor rental rates on several factors  including the cost and size of the equipment  the type and complexity of service desired by the customer  the length of the contract and the inclusion of any other desired services  such as installation  transportation and the degree of daily operation 
in early  we began to selectively introduce price increases for our domestic compression rental business 
such price increases  along with a slight improvement in market conditions  resulted in a increase in revenue from our domestic rentals business in the six months ended december  as compared to the six months ended december  substantially all of our units are operated pursuant to contract compression or rental with full maintenance agreements under which we perform all maintenance and repairs on such units while under contract 
in the us onshore market  compression rental fleet units are generally leased under contract with minimum terms of six months to two years  which convert to month to month at the end of the stipulated minimum period 
historically  the majority of our customers have extended the length of their contracts  on a month to month basis  well beyond the initial term 
typically  our compression rental units used in offshore and international applications carry substantially longer lease terms than those for onshore domestic applications 
an essential element of our success is our ability to provide compression services to customers with contractually committed compressor run times of between and 
historically  our incidence of failing to meet run time commitments the penalty for which is paid in credits to the customer s account has been insignificant  due largely to our rigorous preventive maintenance program and extensive field service network that permits us to promptly address maintenance requirements 
our team of experienced maintenance personnel performs our rental compression maintenance services both at our facilities and in the field 
such maintenance facilities are situated in close proximity to actual rental fleet deployment to permit superior service response times 
all rental fleet units are serviced at manufacturers recommended maintenance intervals  modified as required by the peculiar characteristics of each job and the actual operating experience of each compressor unit 
prior to the conclusion of any rental job  our field management evaluates the condition of the equipment and  where practical  corrects any problems before the equipment is shipped out from the job site 
although natural gas compressors generally do not suffer significant technological obsolescence  they do require routine maintenance and periodic refurbishing to prolong their useful life 
routine maintenance includes alignment  compression checks and other parametric checks that indicate a change in the condition of the equipment 
in addition  oil and wear particle analysis is performed on all units on an ongoing scheduled basis and prior to their redeployment at specific compression rental jobs 
overhauls are done on a condition based interval instead of a time based schedule 
in our experience  these rigorous procedures maximize component life and unit availability and minimize avoidable downtime 
typically  we overhaul each rental compressor unit for general refurbishment every to months and anticipate performing a comprehensive overhaul of each rental compressor unit every to months 
this maintenance program has provided us with a highly reliable fleet of compressors in excellent condition 
our field service mechanics provide all operating and maintenance services for our compression units leased on a contract compression or full maintenance basis and are on call hours a day 
those field 
table of contents personnel receive regular mechanical and safety training both from our staff and our vendors 
each of our field mechanics is responsible for specific compressor unit installations and has at his or her disposal a dedicated local parts inventory 
additionally  each field mechanic operates from a fully equipped service vehicle 
each mechanic s field service vehicle is equipped with a radio or cellular telephone  which allows that individual to be our primary contact with the customer s field operations staff and to be contacted at either his or her residence or mobile phone hours a day 
accordingly  our field service mechanics are given the responsibility to promptly respond to customer service needs as they arise based on the mechanic s trained judgment and field expertise 
we believe our competitive position has benefited from the managerial parity that our sales and field service organizations enjoy within the company  enabling these two vital organizations to work together in a highly coordinated fashion in order to deliver maximum customer service  responsiveness and reliability 
the foundation for our successful field operations effort is the experience and responsiveness of our compressor rental field service and shop staff of compressor mechanics 
our field service mechanics are coordinated and supported by regional operations managers who have supervisory responsibility for specific geographic areas 
our compressor and accessory fabrication operations design  engineer and assemble compression units and accessories for sale to third parties as well as for placement in our compressor rental fleet 
as of december   we had a compressor unit fabrication backlog for sale to third parties of million compared to million at december  substantially all of our compressor and accessory fabrication backlog is expected to be produced within a three month to six month period 
in general  units to be sold to third parties are assembled according to each customer s specifications and sold on a turnkey basis 
we acquire major components for these compressor units from third party suppliers 
compressor rental fleet the size and horsepower of our compressor rental fleet owned or operated under lease on december  is summarized in the following table 
aggregate number horsepower of range of horsepower per unit of units in thousands horsepower total production and processing equipment fabrication through our production and processing equipment fabrication division  we design  engineer  fabricate  sell and rent a broad range of oil and gas production equipment designed to heat  separate  dehydrate and measure crude oil and natural gas 
our product line includes line heaters  oil and gas separators  glycol dehydration units and skid mounted production packages designed for both onshore and offshore production facilities 
we also purchase and recondition used production and processing equipment that is then sold or rented and generally maintain standard product inventories to meet most customers rapid response requirements and minimize customer downtime 
as of december   we had a production and processing equipment fabrication backlog of million excluding belleli s backlog of million at december  compared to million at december  substantially all of our production equipment backlog is expected to be produced within a three to thirty six month period 
in addition  through our subsidiary  belleli  we provide engineering  procurement and construction services 
table of contents primarily related to the manufacturing of heavy wall reactors for refineries and construction of desalination plants  primarily for use in europe and the middle east 
parts  service and used equipment we purchase and recondition used gas compression units  oilfield power generation and treating facilities and production equipment that is then sold or rented to customers 
in addition  we often provide contract operations and related services for customers that prefer to own their production  gas treating and oilfield power generation or compression equipment 
we believe that we are particularly well qualified to provide these services because our highly experienced operating personnel have access to the full range of our compression rental  production processing equipment and oilfield power generation equipment and facilities 
as customers look to us to provide an ever widening array of outsourced services  we will continue to build our core business with emerging business opportunities  such as turnkey gas treatment  gas measurement and oilfield related power generation sales and services 
we maintain parts inventories for our own use and to meet our customers needs 
as of december   we had approximately million in parts and supplies inventories 
sources and availability of raw materials our fabrication operations consist of fabricating compressor and production and processing equipment from components and subassemblies  most of which we acquire from a wide range of vendors 
these components represent a significant portion of the cost of our compressor and production and processing equipment products 
although our products are generally shipped within days following their order date  increases in raw material costs cannot always be offset by increases in our products sales prices 
we believe that all materials and components are readily available from multiple suppliers at competitive prices 
market and customers our global customer base consists of us and international companies engaged in all aspects of the oil and gas industry  including major integrated oil and gas companies  national oil and gas companies  large and small independent producers and natural gas processors  gatherers and pipelines 
additionally  we have negotiated strategic alliances or preferred vendor relationships with key customers pursuant to which we receive preferential consideration in customer compressor and oil and gas production equipment procurement decisions in exchange for providing enhanced product availability  product support  automated procurement practices and limited pricing concessions 
no individual customer accounted for more than of our consolidated revenues during  or our compressor leasing activities are located throughout the continental united states  internationally and in offshore operations 
international locations include argentina  barbados  egypt  united arab emirates  equatorial guinea  india  venezuela  colombia  trinidad  bolivia  brazil  mexico  peru  pakistan  indonesia  nigeria  united kingdom  russia and canada 
in addition  we have representative offices in the netherlands and the cayman islands 
as of december   equipment representing approximately of our compressor rental fleet horsepower was being used in international applications 
sales and marketing our salespeople pursue the rental and sales market for compressors and production equipment and other products in their respective territories 
each salesperson is assigned a customer list on the basis of the experience and personal relationships of the salesperson and the individual service requirements of the customer 
this customer and relationship focused strategy is communicated through frequent direct contact  technical presentations  print literature  print advertising and direct mail 
our advertising and promotion strategy is a concentrated approach  tailoring specific messages into a very focused presentation methodology 

table of contents additionally  our salespeople coordinate with each other to effectively pursue customers who operate in multiple regions 
the salespeople maintain contact with our operations personnel in order to promptly respond to and satisfy customer needs 
our sales efforts concentrate on demonstrating our commitment to enhancing the customer s cash flow through superior product design  fabrication  installation  customer service and after market support 
upon receipt of a request for proposal or bid by a customer  we assign a team of sales  operations and engineering personnel to analyze the application and prepare a quotation  including selection of the equipment  pricing and delivery date 
the quotation is then delivered to the customer and  if we are selected as the vendor  final terms are agreed upon and a contract or purchase order is executed 
our engineering and operations personnel also often provide assistance on complex compressor applications  field operations issues or equipment modifications 
competition we believe that we are currently the largest natural gas compression company in the united states on the basis of aggregate rental horsepower 
however  the natural gas compression services and fabrication business is highly competitive 
overall  we experience considerable competition from companies who may be able to more quickly adapt to changes within our industry and changes in economic conditions as a whole  more readily take advantage of available opportunities and adopt more aggressive pricing policies 
because the business is capital intensive  our ability to take advantage of growth opportunities is limited by our ability to raise capital 
to the extent that any of our competitors have a lower cost of capital or have greater access to capital than we do  they may be able to compete more effectively  which may allow them to more readily take advantage of available opportunities 
compressor industry participants can achieve significant advantages through increased size and geographic breadth 
as the number of rental units increases in a rental fleet  the number of sales  engineering  administrative and maintenance personnel required does not increase proportionately 
one of the significant cost items in the compressor rental business is the amount of inventory required to service rental units 
each rental company must maintain a minimum amount of inventory to remain competitive 
as the size of the rental fleet increases  the required amount of inventory does not increase in the same proportion  thus providing economic efficiencies 
the larger rental fleet companies can generate cost savings through improved purchasing power and vendor support 
we believe that we compete effectively on the basis of price  customer service  and flexibility in meeting customer needs and quality and reliability of our compressors and related services 
a few major fabricators  some of whom also compete with us in the compressor rental business  continue to be aggressive competitors in the compressor fabrication business 
in our production and processing equipment business  we have different competitors in the standard and custom engineered equipment markets 
competitors in the standard equipment market include several large companies and a large number of small  regional fabricators 
competition in the standard equipment market is generally based upon price  availability  the ability to provide integrated projects and level of product support after the sale 
our competition in the custom engineered market usually consists of larger companies 
increasingly  the ability to fabricate these large systems near to the point of end use is a major competitive issue 
government regulation we are subject to various federal  state  local and foreign laws and regulations relating to the environment  health and safety  including regulations and permitting for air emissions  wastewater and stormwater discharges and waste handling and disposal activities 
from time to time as part of the regular overall evaluation of our operations  including newly acquired operations  we apply for or amend facility permits with respect to stormwater or wastewater discharges  waste handling  or air emissions relating to manufacturing activities or equipment operations  which subjects us to new or revised permitting conditions that may be onerous or costly to comply with 
in addition  certain of our customer service arrangements 
table of contents may require us to operate  on behalf of a specific customer  petroleum storage units such as underground tanks  or pipelines and other regulated units  all of which may impose additional regulatory compliance and permitting obligations 
failure to comply with these environmental laws and regulations or associated permits may result in the assessment of administrative  civil  and criminal penalties  the imposition of investigatory and remedial obligations  and the issuance of injunctions as to future compliance 
moreover  as with any owner or operator of real property  we are subject to clean up costs and liability for regulated substances or any other toxic or hazardous wastes that may exist on or have been released under any of our properties 
in connection with our due diligence investigation of potential new properties for acquisition  we typically perform an evaluation to identify potentially significant environmental issues and take measures to have such issues addressed by the seller or ourselves  as appropriate under the circumstances 
we cannot be certain  however  that all such possible environmental issues will be identified and fully addressed prior to our acquisition of new properties 
moreover  the handling of petroleum products and other regulated substances is a normal part of our operations and we have experienced occasional minor spills or incidental leakages in connection with our operations 
as part of the regular overall evaluation of our operations  including newly acquired facilities  we assess the compliance and permitting status of these operations and facilities with applicable environmental laws and regulations and seek to address identified issues in accordance with applicable law 
the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act  also known as cercla or the superfund law  imposes liability  without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct  on persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a hazardous substance into the environment 
these persons include the owner or operator of the facility or disposal site or sites where the release occurred and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances 
under cercla and similar state laws  such persons may be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment  for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies 
furthermore  it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by hazardous substances or other pollutants released into the environment 
the resource conservation and recovery act rcra and regulations promulgated by it govern the generation  storage  transfer and disposal of hazardous wastes 
we must comply with rcra regulations for any of our operations that involve the generation  management or disposal of hazardous wastes such as painting activities or the use of solvents 
in addition  to the extent we operate underground tanks on behalf of specific customers  such operations may be regulated under rcra 
we believe we are in substantial compliance with rcra and are not aware of any current claims against us alleging rcra violations 
we cannot provide any assurance  however  that we will not receive such notices of potential liability in the future 
we currently own or lease  and in the past have owned or leased  a number of properties that have been used in support of our operations for a number of years 
although we have utilized operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time  hydrocarbons  hazardous substances  or other regulated wastes may have been disposed of or released on or under the properties owned or leased by us or on or under other locations where such materials have been taken for disposal 
in addition  many of these properties have been operated by third parties whose treatment and disposal or release of hydrocarbons  hazardous substances or other regulated wastes was not under our control 
these properties and the materials released or disposed thereon may be subject to cercla  rcra  and analogous state laws 
under such laws  we could be required to remove or remediate historical property contamination  or to perform remedial plugging or pit closure operations to prevent future contamination 
we are not currently under any order requiring that we undertake or pay for any clean up activities  nor are we aware of any current environmental claims by the government or private parties against us demanding remedial action or alleging that we are liable for remedial costs already incurred 
however  we cannot provide any assurance that we will not receive any such claims in the future 

table of contents the federal water pollution control act of  also known as the clean water act  and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into waters of the united states 
the discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited  except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the epa or the state 
the epa also has adopted regulations requiring covered industrial operators to obtain permits for storm water discharges 
costs may be associated with the treatment of wastewater or developing and implementing storm water pollution prevention plans 
we believe that we are in substantial compliance with requirements under the clean water act 
the clean air act restricts the emission of air pollutants from many sources  including compressors and operational support facilities 
new facilities may be required to obtain permits before work can begin  and existing facilities may be required to incur capital costs in order to remain in compliance 
in addition  certain states have or are considering and the federal government has recently passed more stringent air emission controls on off road engines 
these laws and regulations may affect the costs of our operations 
on june   we notified the air quality bureau of the environmental protection division  new mexico environment department  of potential violations of regulatory and permitting requirements 
the potential violations included failure to conduct required performance tests  failure to file required notices and failure to pay fees for compressor units located on sites for more than one year 
we promptly paid the required fees and corrected the potential violations 
on june   after the potential violations had been corrected  the director of the division issued a compliance order to us in connection with the potential violations 
the compliance order assessed a civil penalty of  per day per alleged regulatory violation and permit  no total penalty amount was proposed in the compliance order 
on october   the division notified us that the total proposed penalty would be  however  since the alleged violations had been self disclosed  that amount was reduced to  we have responded to the penalty assessment  challenging some of the calculations  and have proposed an alternative settlement amount 
we are currently negotiating with the new mexico environment department on the method of calculation and proposed settlement amounts  and the issue is not yet resolved 
a stipulated motion for extension of time to file answer has been filed which extends the deadline for filing our response to march  we believe that we are currently in substantial compliance with environmental laws and regulations and that the phasing in of recent more stringent air emission controls on off road engines and other known regulatory requirements in the time periods currently contemplated by such laws and regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our business  consolidated financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
it is possible that stricter environmental laws and regulations may be imposed in the future  such as more stringent air emission requirements or proposals to make currently non hazardous wastes subject to more stringent and costly handling  disposal and clean up requirements 
while we may be able to pass on the additional costs of complying with such laws to our customers  there can be no assurance that attempts to do so will be successful 
accordingly  new laws or regulations or amendments to existing laws or regulations might require us to undertake significant capital expenditures and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business  consolidated financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
our operations outside the united states are potentially subject to similar foreign governmental controls and restrictions pertaining to the environment 
we believe our operations are in substantial compliance with existing foreign governmental controls and restrictions and that compliance with these foreign controls and restrictions has not had a material adverse effect on our operations 
we cannot provide any assurance  however  that we will not incur significant costs to comply with these foreign controls and restrictions in the future 
international operations we operate in many different geographic markets  some of which are outside the united states 
at december   of the approximately  horsepower of compression we had deployed 
table of contents internationally  approximately was located in latin america primarily in venezuela  argentina and mexico and approximately was located in canada 
changes in local economic or political conditions  particularly in venezuela  argentina and other parts of latin america  could have a material adverse effect on our business  consolidated financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
additional risks inherent in our international business activities include the following difficulties in managing international operations  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs and other trade barriers which may restrict our ability to enter into new markets  changes in political conditions  potentially adverse tax consequences  restrictions on repatriation of earnings or expropriation of property  the burden of complying with foreign laws  and fluctuations in currency exchange rates and the value of the us dollar 
our future plans involve expanding our business in international markets where we currently do not conduct business 
our decentralized management structure and the risks inherent in new business ventures  especially in international markets where local customs  laws and business procedures present special challenges  may affect our ability to be successful in these ventures or avoid losses which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we have significant operations that expose us to currency risk in argentina and venezuela 
to mitigate that risk  the majority of our existing contracts provide that we receive payment in or based on us dollars rather than argentine pesos and venezuelan bolivars  thus reducing our exposure to fluctuations in their value 
although the operating environment in argentina has since stabilized  in january  argentina devalued its peso against the us dollar and imposed significant restrictions on fund transfers internally and outside the country 
in addition  the argentine government enacted regulations to temporarily prohibit enforcement of contracts with exchange rate based purchase price adjustments 
instead  payment under such contracts could either be made at an exchange rate negotiated by the parties or  if no such agreement were reached  a preliminary payment could be made based on a one dollar to one peso equivalent pending a final agreement 
the argentine government also required the parties to such contracts to renegotiate the price terms within business days of the devaluation 
we have renegotiated all of our agreements in argentina 
as a result of these negotiations  we received approximately million in reimbursements in and million in for the year ended december   our argentine operations represented approximately of our revenue and of our gross profit 
during the years ended december  and  we recorded an exchange gain of approximately million and an exchange loss of approximately million  respectively  for assets exposed to currency translation in argentina 
the economic situation in argentina is subject to change 
to the extent that the situation in argentina deteriorates  exchange controls continue in place and the value of the peso against the dollar is reduced further  our results of operations in argentina could be materially and adversely affected which could result in reductions in our net income 
in december  opponents of venezuelan president hugo ch vez initiated a country wide strike by workers of the national oil company in venezuela 
this strike  a two month walkout  had a significant negative impact on venezuela s economy and temporarily shut down a substantial portion of venezuela s oil industry 
as a result of the strike  venezuela s oil production has dropped substantially 
in addition  exchange controls have been put in place which put limitations on the amount of venezuelan currency that can be exchanged for foreign currency by businesses operating inside venezuela 
in may  after six months of negotiation  the organization of the american states brokered an accord between the venezuelan government and its opponents 
although the accord does offer the prospect of stabilizing venezuela s economy  if another national strike is staged  exchange controls remain in place  or economic and political conditions in venezuela continue to deteriorate  our results of operations in venezuela could 
table of contents be materially and adversely affected  which could result in reductions in our net income 
as a result of the disruption in our operations in venezuela  during the fourth quarter of  our international rental revenues decreased by approximately million 
in the twelve months ended december   we recognized approximately million of billings to venezuelan customers that were not recognized in due to concerns about the ultimate receipt of those revenues 
in addition  a recent movement to remove president ch vez has resulted in renewed civil strife in venezuela 
if such strife continues or escalates  our results of operations in venezuela could be further materially and adversely affected 
during the years ended december  and  we recorded exchange losses of approximately million and million  respectively  for assets exposed to currency translation in venezuela 
for the year ended december   our venezuelan operations represented approximately of our revenue and of our gross profit 
at december   we had approximately million in accounts receivable related to our venezuelan operations 
in february  the venezuelan government fixed the exchange rate to  bolivars for each us dollar 
in february  the government devalued the currency by approximately 
the impact of the devaluation on our results will depend upon the amount of our assets primarily working capital exposed to currency fluctuation in venezuela in future periods 
as of december   we had approximately million in net assets exposed to currency fluctuation in venezuela 
based on these assets  a change in exchange rates would result in a million gain or loss in venezuela 
as part of our acquisition of the gas compression business of schlumberger  we acquired minority interests in three joint ventures in venezuela 
as a minority investor in these joint ventures  we will not be able to control their operations and activities  including  without limitation  whether and when they distribute cash or property to their holders 
in january  we gave notice of our intent to exercise our right to put our interest in one of these joint ventures  the pigap ii joint venture  back to schlumberger surenco 
if not exercised  the put right would have expired as of february  on may   we entered into an agreement with schlumberger surenco to terminate the pigap ii put and thus have retained our ownership interest in pigap ii 
we are involved in a project to build and operate barge mounted gas compression and gas processing facilities to be stationed in a nigerian coastal waterway as part of the performance of a contract between an affiliate of the royal dutch shell group shell and global energy and refining ltd 
global  a nigerian company 
we have completed the building of the required barge mounted facilities 
we understand that global must complete a significant financing for part of the project in the near term or shell would be able to terminate its contract with global 
global has orally informed us that they have completed a financing  although it is not clear to us whether the funds raised will be sufficient to perform their obligations under the shell contract 
in light of the political environment in nigeria  global s lack of a successful track record with respect to this project and other factors  there is no assurance that global will be able to comply with its obligations under the shell contract 
we believe that global is in default with respect to certain agreements they have with us  as a result of which we believe we have certain termination rights 
if shell were to terminate its contract with global for any reason or we were to terminate our involvement in the project  we would be required to find an alternative use for the barge facility which could result in a write down of our investment 
we currently have an investment of approximately million associated with the barge facility and approximately million associated with advances to  and our investment in  global

table of contents on october   the harbor finance partners derivative lawsuit was consolidated into the pirelli armstrong tire corporation retiree medical benefits trust securities class action 
on and after march   three plaintiffs filed separate putative class actions against hanover  certain named individuals and other purportedly unknown defendants  in the united states district court for the southern district of texas 
the alleged class was composed of persons who participated in or were beneficiaries of the hanover companies retirement and savings plan  which was established by hanover pursuant to section k of the united states internal revenue code of  as amended 
the purported class action sought relief under erisa based upon hanover s and the individual defendants alleged mishandling of hanover s k plan 
the three erisa putative class actions are entitled kirkley v

hanover  case no 
h on august   the three erisa class actions were consolidated into the pirelli armstrong tire corporation retiree medical benefits trust federal securities class action 
on october   a consolidated amended complaint was filed by the plaintiffs in the erisa class action against hanover  michael mcghan  michael o connor and william goldberg  which included the same allegations as indicated above  and was filed on behalf of themselves and a class of persons who purchased or held hanover securities in their k plan between may  and december  these actions alleged generally that  in connection with the transactions that were restated in  we and certain individuals acting as fiduciaries of hanover s k plan breached our fiduciary duties to the plan participants by offering hanover common stock as an investment option  failing to provide material information to plan participants regarding the suitability of hanover common stock as an investment alternative  failing to monitor the performance of plan fiduciaries  and failing to provide material information to other fiduciaries 
on october   we entered into a stipulation of settlement  which settled all of the claims underlying the putative securities class action  the putative erisa class action and the shareholder derivative actions described above 
the terms of the settlement provided for us to make a cash payment of approximately million of which million was funded by payments from hanover s directors and officers insurance carriers  issue million shares of our common stock  and issue a contingent note with a principal amount of million 
the note is payable  together with accrued interest  on march  but will be extinguished with no money owing under it if our common stock trades at or above the average price of per share for consecutive trading days at any time between march  and march  in addition  upon the occurrence of a change of control that involves us  if the change of control or shareholder approval of the change of control occurs before february   which is twelve months after final court approval of the settlement  we will be obligated to contribute an additional million to the settlement fund 
as part of the settlement  we have also agreed to implement corporate governance enhancements  including allowing shareholders owning more than but less than of our outstanding common stock to participate in the process to appoint two independent directors to our board of directors pursuant to which on february  we appointed margaret k 
dorman and stephen m 
pazuk to our board of directors and making certain changes to our code of conduct 
gkh investments  lp and gkh private limited collectively gkh which  as of december   together owned approximately of hanover s outstanding common stock and which sold shares in our march secondary offering of common stock  are parties to the settlement and have agreed to settle claims against them that arise out of that offering as well as other potential securities  erisa  and derivative claims 
the terms of the settlement provide for gkh to transfer million shares of hanover common stock from their holdings or from other sources to the settlement fund 
on october   the parties moved the united states district court for the southern district of texas for preliminary approval of the proposed settlement and sought permission to provide notice to the potentially affected persons and to set a date for a final hearing to approve the proposed settlement 
on december   the court held a hearing and granted the parties motion for preliminary approval of the proposed settlement and  among other things  ordered that notice be provided to appropriate persons and 
table of contents set the date for the final hearing 
the final hearing was held on february   and no objections to the settlement or requests to be excluded from the terms of the settlement had been received prior to the deadline set by the court 
on february   the united states district court for the southern district of texas entered three orders and final judgments  approving the settlement on the terms agreed upon in the stipulation of settlement with respect to all of the claims described above including the dismissal of each of the actions other than the coffelt family derivative action filed in the delaware chancery court 
the court also entered an order and final judgment approving the plans of allocation with respect to each action  as well as an order and final judgment approving the schedule of attorneys fees for counsel for the settling plaintiffs 
the time in which these orders and final judgments may be appealed expired on march  without any appeal being lodged 
in addition  on march   the delaware chancery court dismissed the coffelt family derivative action 
the settlement has therefore become final and will be implemented according to its terms 
in march  we issued and delivered to the escrow agent for the settlement fund million shares of hanover common stock  as required by the settlement 
our independent auditor  pricewaterhousecoopers  is not a party to the settlement and remains a party to the securities class action 
based on the terms of the settlement agreement and individual components of the settlement  we recorded the cost of the litigation settlement 
the details of the litigation settlement charge were as follows in thousands cash estimated fair value of note to be issued common stock to be issued by hanover legal fees and administrative costs total less insurance recoveries net litigation settlement the million estimated fair value of the note to be issued was based on the present value of the future cash flows discounted at borrowing rates currently available to us for debt with similar terms and maturities 
using a market borrowing rate of  the principal value and the stipulated interest rate required by the note of per annum  a discount of million was computed on the note to be issued 
upon the issuance of the note  the discount will be amortized to interest expense over the term of the note 
because the note could be extinguished without a payment if our common stock trades at or above the average price of per share for consecutive trading days at any time between march  and march   we will be required to record an asset when the note is issued for the value of the embedded derivative  as required by sfas we estimated the value of the derivative and reduced the amount we included for the estimate of the value of the note by approximately million at december  this asset will be marked to market in future periods with any increase or decrease included in our statement of operations 
as of december   our accompanying balance sheet included a million long term liability and million in accrued liabilities related to amounts that are expected to be paid in the next twelve months 
during the second quarter of  the million receivable from the insurance carriers and million of our portion of the cash settlement was paid into an escrow fund and is included in the accompanying balance sheet as restricted cash 
in the first quarter of  we will reclassify million  the value accrued for the stock to be paid  from other liabilities to stockholders equity and will include the shares in our outstanding shares used for earnings per share calculations 
on november   the sec issued a formal order of private investigation relating to the transactions underlying and  other matters relating to  the restatements of our financial statements 
in december  we entered into a settlement with the sec 
without admitting or denying any of the sec s findings  we consented to the entry of a cease and desist order requiring future compliance with 
table of contents certain periodic reporting  record keeping and internal control provisions of the securities laws 
the settlement did not impose any monetary penalty on us  and required no additional restatements of our historical financial statements 
as of december   we had incurred approximately million in legal related expenses in connection with the internal investigations  the putative class action securities and erisa lawsuits  the derivative lawsuits and the sec investigation 
of this amount  we advanced approximately million on behalf of certain current and former officers and directors in connection with the above named proceedings 
we intend to advance any litigation costs of our current and former officers and directors  subject to the limitations imposed by delaware and other applicable law and hanover s certificate of incorporation and bylaws 
we do not expect additional legal fees and administrative costs in connection with the settlement of the litigation  advances on behalf of current and former officers and directors for legal fees and other related costs to exceed million  the remaining balance of the accrual 
on june   we notified the air quality bureau of the environmental protection division  new mexico environment department  of potential violations of regulatory and permitting requirements 
the potential violations included failure to conduct required performance tests  failure to file required notices and failure to pay fees for compressor units located on sites for more than one year 
we promptly paid the required fees and corrected the potential violations 
on june   after the potential violations had been corrected  the director of the division issued a compliance order to us in connection with the potential violations 
the compliance order assessed a civil penalty of  per day per alleged regulatory violation and permit  no total penalty amount was proposed in the compliance order 
on october   the division notified us that the total proposed penalty would be  however  since the alleged violations had been self disclosed  that amount was reduced to  we have responded to the penalty assessment  challenging some of the calculations  and have proposed an alternative settlement amount 
we are currently negotiating with the new mexico environment department on the method of calculation and proposed settlement amounts  and the issue is not yet resolved

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of the results of operations and financial condition of hanover compressor company should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto 
overview we are a global market leader in the full service natural gas compression business and are also a leading provider of service  fabrication and equipment for oil and natural gas processing and transportation applications 
we sell and rent this equipment and provide complete operation and maintenance services  including run time guarantees  for both customer owned equipment and our fleet of rental equipment 
hanover was founded as a delaware corporation in  and has been a public company since our customers include both major and independent oil and gas producers and distributors as well as national oil and gas companies in the countries in which we operate 
our maintenance business  together with our parts and service business  provides solutions to customers that own their own compression and surface production and processing equipment  but want to outsource their operations 
we also fabricate compressor and oil and gas production and processing equipment and provide gas processing and treating  gas measurement and oilfield power generation services  primarily to our domestic and international customers as a complement to our compression services 
in addition  through our subsidiary  belleli  we provide engineering  procurement and construction services primarily related to the manufacturing of heavy wall reactors for refineries and construction of desalination plants  primarily for use in europe and the middle east 
impact of rapid growth we experienced rapid growth from through primarily as a result of significant acquisitions during and  during which period our total assets increased from approximately million as of december  to approximately billion as of december   and our debt  including compression equipment leases obligations  increased from approximately million at december  to approximately  million at december  in addition to substantially increasing our outstanding debt  our growth exceeded our infrastructure capabilities and strained our internal control environment 
during  we announced a series of restatements of certain transactions that occurred in  and in november  the sec issued a formal order of private investigation relating to the transactions underlying and other matters relating to the restatements 
in addition  during  hanover and certain of its past and present officers and directors were named as defendants in a consolidated action pending in federal court that included a putative securities class action  a putative class action arising under the employee retirement income security act and shareholder derivate actions 
the litigation related principally to the matters involved in the transactions underlying the restatements of our financial statements 
as discussed below  both the sec investigation and the litigation have recently been settled 
for a more detailed discussion of the sec investigation and the securities litigation  see legal proceedings in item of this form k 
industry conditions our operations depend upon the levels of activity in natural gas development  production  processing and transportation 
such activity levels typically decline when there is a significant reduction in oil and gas prices or significant instability in energy markets 
in recent years  oil and gas prices have been extremely volatile 
in addition  domestic natural gas consumption fell in and as a result of the recent economic slowdown in the united states 
due to a deterioration in market conditions  we experienced a decline in the demand for our products and services in and  which  along with the distractions associated with our management reorganization  resulted in reductions in the utilization of our compressor rental fleet and our revenues  gross margins and profits in those years 

table of contents the north american rig count increased by to  at december  from  at december   and the twelve month rolling average north american rig count increased by to  at december  from  at december  in addition  the twelve month rolling average new york mercantile exchange wellhead natural gas price increased to per mcf at december  from per mcf at december  despite the increase in natural gas prices and the recent increase in the rig count  us natural gas production levels have not significantly changed 
recently  we have not experienced any significant growth in domestic rentals or purchases of equipment and services by our customers  which we believe is primarily the result of the lack of a significant increase in us natural gas production levels 
however  with several non operational issues behind us  we are focused on improving our sales success ratio on new bid opportunities and anticipate some revenue growth in management reorganization and new initiatives during  a number of our executives involved directly or indirectly with the transactions underlying the restatements described above resigned  including our former chief executive officer  chief financial officer  vice chairman of our board of directors  chief operating officer and the head of our international operations 
during and after  we hired and appointed a new chief executive officer and chief financial officer  hired and appointed our first general counsel  hired a new controller  and hired new managers of human resources  financial reporting and policy administration 
during  we added three independent directors to our board of directors and elected an independent chairman of the board from among the three new directors 
in addition  on february   we added two new independent directors to our board of directors 
our new management team has undertaken the following initiatives to improve our operations and our liquidity position 
focus on core business 
we have built our leading market position through our strengths in compression rentals  compressor fabrication  production and processing equipment rental and fabrication and parts and service 
we are focusing our efforts on these businesses and on streamlining operations in our core markets 
in connection with these efforts  we have decided to exit and sell certain non core business lines 
in december  our board of directors approved management s recommendation to exit and sell our non oilfield power generation assets and certain used equipment business lines 
in  we sold our interests in two non oilfield power generation facilities for approximately million  consisting of million in cash  million in notes that mature in and and the release from a capital lease that had an outstanding balance of approximately million 
enhance return on capital 
we are seeking to deploy our capital more effectively in order to improve the total returns from our investments 
to achieve this objective  we intend to work to improve our operating performance and profitability by focusing on the following initiatives improve our domestic fleet utilization by limiting the addition of new units  where applicable and permissible under our bank credit facility and the conforming amendments to our compression equipment lease obligations  moving idle domestic units into service in international markets and retiring less profitable units 
during  we renewed several key domestic customer alliances involving approximately  horsepower  retired approximately  horsepower  moved approximately  horsepower to international markets and increased compression under contract by approximately  horsepower 
as a result  domestic utilization increased to at december  from at december  increase prices selectively for our domestic rental business 
in early  we began to selectively introduce price increases for our domestic compression rental business 
such price increases  along with a slight improvement in market conditions  resulted in a increase in revenue from our domestic rentals business in the six months ended december  as compared to the six months ended december  improve operating efficiencies by consolidating certain of our operations 
during  we shut down six facilities and reduced our us headcount by approximately employees 

table of contents increase activity in our fabrication sales and parts and service operations to take advantage of our available fabrication capacity and field technician manpower 
exploit international opportunities 
international markets continue to represent the greatest growth opportunity for our business 
we believe that these markets are underserved 
in addition  we typically see higher pricing in international markets relative to the domestic market 
during  we added approximately  horsepower to our international rental fleet under contract 
we intend to allocate additional resources toward international markets  to open offices abroad  where appropriate  and to move idle domestic units into service in international markets  where applicable 
however  our ability to invest capital resources and allocate assets into international markets is restricted by our new bank credit facility and the conforming amendments to our compression equipment lease obligations and by our intentions to reduce outstanding debt as described below 
improve our capital discipline 
we plan to improve our capital discipline by lowering the working capital we have employed and reducing our substantial level of debt with both excess operating cash flow and proceeds from asset sales 
we are also focused on improving the management of our working capital by lowering the number of days outstanding for our accounts receivable and reducing inventory levels 
to reduce debt  we are committed to under spending cash flow  and we are currently planning to allocate approximately million of our operating cash flow generated from through to debt repayment 
as part of our plans to address our substantial level of debt resulting from our growth through acquisitions  we engaged in a number of refinancing transactions in to address liquidity issues associated with our debt 
in december  we issued million aggregate principal amount of our senior notes due and million aggregate principal amount of our convertible senior notes due the net proceeds from these offerings were used to repay outstanding indebtedness under our a equipment lease notes due june and a portion of the outstanding indebtedness under our previous bank credit facility 
in addition  in december  we entered into a new million bank credit facility that matures in december the new bank credit facility replaced our previous bank credit facility that matured in november the new bank credit facility provides additional flexibility to support our short term liquidity needs 
also  in october  the pigap ii joint venture  in which we have a interest  engaged in a project financing and distributed approximately million to us  of which approximately million was used to pay off a non recourse promissory note issued by one of our subsidiaries that had been secured by our interest in pigap ii 
we also restructured a million subordinated note that had been issued to schlumberger in connection with an acquisition 
we restructured the note as our zero coupon subordinated notes due march  and reduced the implicit interest rate 
resolved pending litigation and investigations 
in  we entered into an agreement to settle the pending securities litigation 
on february   the united states district court for the southern district of texas entered three orders and final judgments  approving the settlement on the terms agreed upon in the stipulation of settlement with respect to all of the pending claims 
the court also entered an order and final judgment approving the plans of allocation with respect to each action  as well as an order and final judgment approving the schedule of attorneys fees for counsel for the settling plaintiffs 
the time in which these orders and final judgments may be appealed expired on march  without any appeal being lodged 
the settlement has therefore become final and will be implemented according to its terms 
the settlement provides for us to make a cash payment of approximately million of which million was funded by payments from our directors and officers insurance carriers  issue million shares of our common stock  and issue a contingent note with a principal amount of million  which may be extinguished in certain circumstances 
in addition  upon the occurrence of a change of control that involves us  if the change of control or shareholder approval of the change of control occurs before february   which is twelve months after final court approval of the settlement  we will be obligated to contribute an additional million to the settlement fund 
also  in december  a 
table of contents settlement between the sec and us was entered by the sec 
without admitting or denying any of the sec s findings  we consented to the entry of a cease and desist order requiring future compliance with certain periodic reporting  record keeping and internal control provisions of the securities laws 
the settlement with the sec did not impose any monetary penalty on us 
summary of results net losses 
we recorded a consolidated net loss of million for the year ended december   as compared to a consolidated net loss of million and consolidated net income of million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
our results for each of the last two years have been affected by a number of charges that may not necessarily be indicative of our core operations or our future prospects and impact comparability between years 
these special items are discussed in results of operations below 
results by segment 
the following table summarizes revenues  expenses and gross profit margin percentages for each of our business segments dollars in thousands years ended december  revenues and other income domestic rentals international rentals parts  service and used equipment compressor and accessory fabrication production and processing equipment fabrication equity in income of non consolidated affiliate other expenses domestic rentals international rentals parts  service and used equipment compressor and accessory fabrication production and processing equipment fabrication gross profit margin domestic rentals international rentals parts  service and used equipment compressor and accessory fabrication production and processing equipment fabrication belleli acquisition belleli acquisition 
in  we increased our ownership of belleli to from by converting million in loans  together with approximately million in accrued interest thereon  into additional equity ownership and in november began consolidating the results of belleli s operations 
belleli has three manufacturing facilities  one in mantova  italy and two in the united arab emirates jebel ali and hamriyah 
during  we also purchased certain operating assets used by belleli for approximately million from a bankruptcy estate of belleli s former parent and leased these assets to belleli for approximately million per year  for a term of seven years 

table of contents in connection with our increase in ownership in  we entered into an agreement with the minority owner of belleli that provided the minority owner the right  until june   to purchase our interest for an amount that approximated our investment in belleli 
the agreement also provided us with the right  beginning in july  to purchase the minority owner s interest in belleli 
in addition  the minority owner historically had been unwilling to provide its proportionate share of capital to belleli 
we believed that our ability to maximize value would be enhanced if we were able to exert greater control through the exercise of our purchase right 
thus  in august  we exercised our option to acquire the remaining interest in belleli for approximately million in order to gain complete control of belleli 
as a result of these transactions and intervening foreign exchange rate changes  we recorded million in identifiable intangible assets  with a weighted average life of approximately years  and million in goodwill 
as a result of the war in iraq  the strengthening of the euro and generally unfavorable economic conditions  we believe that the estimated fair value of belleli declined significantly during upon gaining complete control of belleli and assessing our long term growth strategy  we determined that their general factors in combination with the specific economic factors impacting belleli had significantly and adversely impacted the timing and amount of the future cash flows that we expected belleli to generate 
we currently do not expect to realize our original growth expectations for belleli in the timeframe that we originally forecasted 
during the performance of our annual goodwill impairment review in the fourth quarter of  we determined the present value of belleli s expected future cash flows was less than our carrying value of belleli 
this resulted in a full impairment charge for the million in goodwill associated with belleli 
upon further analysis  it was determined that the factors resulting in the goodwill impairment charge were also present during the third quarter of and that the exercise of our purchase option in the third quarter of and the presence of such factors should have resulted in an interim goodwill impairment test under sfas and an impairment charge at that time 
we have adjusted our third quarter results accordingly 
facility consolidation we had previously announced our plan to reduce our us headcount by approximately employees worldwide and to close four fabrication facilities 
during the year ended december   we accrued approximately million in employee separation costs related to the reduction in workforce 
during the year ended december   we paid approximately million in employee separation costs  implemented further cost saving initiatives and closed two additional facilities 
we expect to incur an additional million in employee separation costs related to the completion of these activities 
since december   our us workforce has decreased by approximately employees 
during the fourth quarter of  we reviewed our business lines and our board of directors approved management s recommendation to exit and sell our non oilfield power generation facilities and certain used equipment business lines 
the results from these businesses are reflected as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements 
additionally  during and  we recorded certain write downs  asset impairments and restructuring costs 
a summary of these charges and the related impact on our financial results is discussed below 
critical accounting estimates this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and accounting policies  including those related to bad debts  inventories  fixed assets  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  warranty obligations  sale leaseback transactions  revenue recognition and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we 
table of contents believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of this process form the basis of our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and these differences can be material to our financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
allowances and reserves we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of a customer deteriorates  resulting in an impairment of its ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
as of december   our largest account receivable from a customer was approximately million 
during  and  we recorded approximately million  million and million in additional allowances for doubtful accounts  respectively 
a increase in bad debt expense would have resulted in approximately million in additional selling  general and administrative expense for we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those expected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
during  and  we recorded approximately million  million and million  respectively  in additional reserves for obsolete and slow moving inventory 
long lived assets and investments we review for the impairment of long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment  assets held for sale and investments in non consolidated affiliates whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss exists when estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition are less than its carrying amount 
when necessary  an impairment loss is recognized and represents the excess of the asset s carrying value as compared to its estimated fair value and is charged to the period in which the impairment occurred 
the determination of what constitutes an indication of possible impairment  the estimation of future cash flows and the determination of estimated fair value are all significant judgments 
during and  as a result of the review of our rental fleet  we recorded million and million  respectively  in additional depreciation on equipment that was retired and equipment that was expected to be sold or abandoned 
in addition  we perform an annual goodwill impairment test  pursuant to the requirements of sfas  in the fourth quarter of each year  to determine if the estimated recoverable value of the reporting unit exceeds the net carrying value of the reporting unit  including the applicable goodwill 
we determine the fair value of our reporting units using a combination of the expected present value of future cash flows and the market approach 
the present value of future cash flows is estimated using our most recent five year forecast  the weighted average cost of capital and a market multiple on the reporting units earnings before interest  tax  depreciation and amortization 
changes in forecasts could effect the estimated fair value of our reporting units and result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period 
we used a weighted average cost of capital in our analysis of the present value of future cash flows 
during and  we recorded million and million  respectively  in goodwill impairments as a result of our goodwill evaluations 
we hold minority interests in companies having operations or technology in areas that relate to our business  one of which is publicly traded and may experience volatile share prices 
we record an investment impairment charge when we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge 
table of contents in the future 
during  we recorded approximately million in write downs and charges related to our interest in non consolidated affiliates 
tax assets we must estimate our expected future taxable income in order to assess the realizability of our deferred income tax assets 
as of december   we reported a net deferred tax liability of million  which included gross deferred tax assets of million  net of a valuation allowance of million and gross deferred tax liabilities of million 
numerous assumptions are inherent in the estimation of future taxable income  including assumptions about matters that are dependent on future events  such as future operating conditions and future financial conditions 
additionally  we must consider any prudent and feasible tax planning strategies that might minimize the amount of deferred tax liabilities recognized or the amount of any valuation allowance recognized against deferred tax assets  if management has the ability to implement these strategies and the expectation of implementing these strategies if the forecasted conditions actually occur 
the principal tax planning strategy available to us relates to the permanent reinvestment of the earnings of foreign subsidiaries 
assumptions related to the permanent reinvestment of the earnings of foreign subsidiaries are reconsidered periodically to give effect to changes in our businesses and in our tax profile 
as a result of current year operating losses and charges in  we were in a net deferred tax asset position for us income tax purposes for the first time in due to our cumulative domestic losses over the past three years  we could not reach the conclusion that it was more likely than not that certain of our us deferred tax assets will be realized in the future 
accordingly  we provided a million deferred tax valuation allowance against our net us deferred tax asset 
we will be required to record additional valuation allowances if our domestic deferred tax asset position is increased and the more likely than not criteria of sfas is not met 
if we are required to record additional valuation allowances  our effective tax rate will be increased  perhaps substantially above the statutory rate 
our preliminary analysis leads us to believe that we will likely be required to record additional valuation allowances in the first quarter of  unless we are able to implement tax planning strategies that would minimize or eliminate the amount of such additional valuation allowance prior to the end of the first quarter  and may be required to record additional valuation allowances in future periods 
revenue recognition percentage of completion accounting we recognize revenue and profit for our fabrication operations as work progresses on long term  fixed price contracts using the percentage of completion method  which relies on estimates of total expected contract revenue and costs 
we follow this method because reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and costs applicable to various stages of a contract can be made and because the fabrication projects usually last several months 
recognized revenues and profit are subject to revisions as the contract progresses to completion 
revisions in profit estimates are charged to income in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
the average duration of these projects is four to thirty six months 
due to the long term nature of some of our jobs  developing the estimates of cost often requires significant judgment 
we estimate percentage of completion for compressor and processing equipment fabrication on a direct labor hour to total labor hour basis 
this calculation requires management to estimate the number of total labor hours required for each project and to estimate the profit expected on the project 
production and processing equipment fabrication percentage of completion is estimated using the direct labor hour and cost to total cost basis 
the cost to total cost basis requires us to estimate the amount of total costs labor and materials required to complete each project 
since we have many fabrication projects in process at any given time  we do not believe that materially different results would be achieved if different estimates  assumptions  or conditions were used for any single project 
factors that must be considered in estimating the work to be completed and ultimate profit include labor productivity and availability  the nature and complexity of work to be performed  the impact of 
table of contents change orders  availability of raw materials and the impact of delayed performance 
if the aggregate combined cost estimates for all of our fabrication businesses had been higher or lower by in  our results of operations before tax would have been decreased or increased by approximately million 
as of december   we had approximately million in costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts in excess of billings to our customers 
contingencies and litigation in the ordinary course of business  we are involved in various pending or threatened legal actions 
while we are unable to predict the ultimate outcome of these actions  sfas  accounting for contingencies requires management to make judgments about future events that are inherently uncertain 
we are required to record and have recorded a loss during any period in which we  based on our experience  believe a contingency is likely to result in a financial loss to us 
in making its determinations of likely outcomes of pending or threatened legal matters  management considers the evaluation of counsel knowledgeable about each matter

table of contents business segment results domestic rentals in thousands years ended december  increase decrease revenue operating expense gross profit gross margin for  domestic rental revenues and gross profit decreased from due to weaker demand  stronger competition  which resulted in lower fleet utilization in the first six months of the year relative to the same period a year earlier  and higher operating expenses including higher repairs and maintenance and start up costs for a large gas plant in as a result of lower fleet utilization in the first half of the year  our average domestic utilization for was approximately lower than our average utilization for however  our domestic rental horsepower utilization rate at december  was compared to at december  the increase in utilization was due to an increase in contracted units  which led to a increase in utilization  the retirement of units to be sold or scrapped and the deployment of units into international operations 
international rentals in thousands years ended december  increase decrease revenue operating expense gross profit gross margin for  international rental revenue and gross profit increased  compared to  due to increased compression rental activity  primarily in argentina and mexico  and the addition in of two gas processing plants in mexico and brazil

after a review of our idle rental fleet assets in and  we determined that certain assets should be scrapped or sold rather than repaired 
a number of these units were acquired in business acquisitions over the last several years and given our utilization level  we determined not to repair or rebuild them to bring them up to hanover s standards 
beginning in july  payments accrued under our sale leaseback transactions are included in interest expense as a result of consolidating the entities that lease compression equipment to us 
see cumulative effect of accounting change below 
as a result of this  our interest expense increased million  to million  and our leasing expense decreased million to million for the year ended december  our interest and leasing expense increased due to the increase in the outstanding balance of our zero coupon note  the inclusion of approximately million in interest expense from belleli and higher effective rates as a result of the february amendment to our bank credit facility and compression equipment operating leases 
these increases were offset by lower interest on our bank credit facility as a result of lower balances outstanding and by a decrease in additional interest paid on leases  explained below 
in connection with the compression equipment leases entered into in august  we were obligated to prepare registration statements and complete an exchange offer to enable the holders of the notes issued by the lessors to exchange their notes with notes registered under the securities act of because of the restatement of our financial statements  the exchange offer was not completed pursuant to the time line required by the agreements related to the compression equipment lease obligations and we were required to pay additional lease expense in an amount equal to  per week until the exchange offering was completed 
the additional lease expense began accruing on january  and increased our lease expense by million and million during and  respectively 
the registration 
table of contents statements became effective in february the exchange offer was completed and the requirement to pay the additional lease expense ended on march  foreign currency translation expense for the year ended december  was million  compared to a million for the year ended december  in january  argentina devalued its peso against the us dollar and imposed significant restrictions on fund transfers internally and outside the country 
in addition  the argentine government enacted regulations to temporarily prohibit enforcement of contracts with exchange rate based purchase price adjustments 
instead  payment under such contracts could either be made at an exchange rate negotiated by the parties or  if no such agreement were reached  a preliminary payment could be made based on a one dollar to one peso equivalent pending a final agreement 
the argentine government also required the parties to such contracts to renegotiate the price terms within business days of the devaluation 
we have renegotiated all of our agreements in argentina 
as a result of these negotiations  we received approximately million in reimbursements in and million in during the years ended december  and  we recorded an exchange gain of approximately million and an exchange loss of approximately million  respectively  for assets exposed to currency translation in argentina 
in addition  during the years ended december  and  we recorded exchange losses of approximately million and million  respectively  for assets exposed to currency translation in venezuela and recorded translation losses of approximately million and million  respectively  for all other countries 
other expenses decreased by million to million during the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  for the year ended december   other expenses included million in charges primarily recorded to write off certain non revenue producing assets and to record the settlement of a contractual obligation 
for the year ended december   other expenses included million of write downs and charges related to investments in four non consolidated affiliates that had experienced a decline in value that we believed to be other than temporary  a million write off of a purchase option for an acquisition that we had abandoned  million in other non operating costs and a million write down of notes receivable  including a million reserve established for loans to employees who were not executive officers 
during  we recorded a million non cash charge for goodwill impairment associated with belleli 
as a result of the war in iraq  the strengthening of the euro and generally unfavorable economic conditions  we believe that the estimated fair value of belleli declined significantly during upon gaining complete control of belleli and assessing our long term growth strategy  we determined that these general factors in combination with the specific economic factors impacting belleli had significantly and adversely impacted the timing and amount of the future cash flows that we expected belleli to generate 
we currently do not expect to realize our original growth expectations for belleli in the timeframe that we originally forecasted 
during the performance of our annual goodwill impairment review in the fourth quarter of  we determined the present value of belleli s expected future cash flows was less than our carrying value of belleli 
this resulted in a full impairment charge for the million in goodwill associated with belleli 
upon further analysis  it was determined that the factors resulting in the goodwill impairment charge were also present during the third quarter of and that the exercise of our purchase option in the third quarter of and the presence of such factors should have resulted in an interim goodwill impairment test under sfas and an impairment charge at that time 
we have adjusted our third quarter results accordingly 
in the fourth quarter  we recorded a million goodwill impairment charge related to the write down of the goodwill associated with our pump division 
in addition  in the second quarter  we recorded a million goodwill impairment charge on the goodwill associated with our production and processing equipment fabrication business 

table of contents provision for securities litigation settlement hanover and certain of its past and present officers and directors are named as defendants in a consolidated action pending in federal court that includes a putative securities class action  a putative class action arising under the employee retirement income security act erisa and shareholder derivative actions 
the litigation relates principally to the matters involved in the transactions underlying the restatements of our financial statements 
the plaintiffs allege  among other things  that we and the other defendants acted unlawfully and fraudulently in connection with those transactions and our original disclosures related to those transactions and thereby violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and the other defendants fiduciary duties to hanover 
on october   we entered into a stipulation of settlement  which settled all of the claims underlying the putative securities class action  the putative erisa class action and the shareholder derivative actions described above 
the terms of the settlement provided for us to make a cash payment of approximately million of which million was funded by payments from hanover s directors and officers insurance carriers  issue million shares of our common stock  and issue a contingent note with a principal amount of million 
the note is payable  together with accrued interest  on march  but will be extinguished with no money owing under it if our common stock trades at or above the average price of per share for consecutive trading days at any time between march  and march  in addition  upon the occurrence of a change of control that involves us  if the change of control or shareholder approval of the change of control occurs before february   which is twelve months after final court approval of the settlement  we will be obligated to contribute an additional million to the settlement fund 
as part of the settlement  we have also agreed to implement corporate governance enhancements  including allowing shareholders owning more than but less than of our outstanding common stock to participate in the process to appoint two independent directors to our board of directors pursuant to which on february  we appointed margaret k 
dorman and stephen m 
pazuk to our board of directors and certain enhancements to our code of conduct 
gkh  which  as of december   owned approximately of hanover s outstanding common stock and which sold shares in our march secondary offering of common stock  are parties to the settlement and have agreed to settle claims against them that arise out of that offering as well as other potential securities  erisa  and derivative claims 
the terms of the settlement provide for gkh to transfer million shares of hanover common stock from their holdings or from other sources to the settlement fund 
on october   the parties moved the united states district court for the southern district of texas for preliminary approval of the proposed settlement and sought permission to provide notice to the potentially affected persons and to set a date for a final hearing to approve the proposed settlement 
on december   the court held a hearing and granted the parties motion for preliminary approval of the proposed settlement and  among other things  ordered that notice be provided to appropriate persons and set the date for the final hearing 
the final hearing was held on february   and no objections to the settlement or requests to be excluded from the terms of the settlement had been received prior to the deadline set by the court 
on february   the united states district court for the southern district of texas entered three orders and final judgments  approving the settlement on the terms agreed upon in the stipulation of settlement with respect to all of the claims described above 
the court also entered an order and final judgment approving the plans of allocation with respect to each action  as well as an order and final judgment approving the schedule of attorneys fees for counsel for the settling plaintiffs 
the time in which these orders and final judgments may be appealed expired on march  without any appeal being lodged 
the settlement has therefore become final and will be implemented according to its terms 
in march  we issued and delivered to the escrow agent for the settlement fund million shares of hanover common stock  as required by the settlement 
our independent auditor  pricewaterhousecoopers  is not a party to the settlement and remains a party to the securities class action 

table of contents based on the terms of the settlement agreement and the individual components of the settlement  we recorded the cost of the litigation settlement 
the details of the litigation settlement charge were as follows in thousands cash estimated fair value of note to be issued common stock to be issued by hanover legal fees and administrative costs total less insurance recoveries net litigation settlement the million estimated fair value of the note to be issued was based on the present value of the future cash flows discounted at borrowing rates currently available to us for debt with similar terms and maturities 
using a market borrowing rate of  the principal value and the stipulated interest rate required by the note of per annum  a discount of million was computed on the note to be issued 
upon the issuance of the note  the discount will be amortized to interest expense over the term of the note 
because the note could be extinguished without a payment if our common stock trades at or above the average price of per share for consecutive trading days at any time between march  and march   we will be required to record an asset when the note is issued for the value of the embedded derivative  as required by sfas we estimated the value of the derivative and reduced the amount we included for the estimate of the value of the note by approximately million at december  this asset will be marked to market in future periods with any increase or decrease included in our statement of operations 
income taxes the provision for income taxes increased million  to million during the year ended december  from a benefit of million during the year ended december  the average effective income tax rates during the year ended december  and december  were and  respectively 
the decrease in rate was primarily due to a million valuation allowance recorded for us deferred tax assets where near term future realization is uncertain and the non deductible belleli goodwill impairment 
as a result of current year operating losses in  we were in a net deferred tax asset position for us income tax purposes for the first time in due to our cumulative domestic tax losses over the past three years  we could not reach the conclusion that it was more likely than not that certain of our us deferred tax assets will be realized in the future 
accordingly  we provided a million deferred tax valuation allowance against our net us deferred tax asset 
we will be required to record additional valuation allowances if our domestic deferred tax asset position is increased and the more likely than not criteria of sfas is not met 
if we are required to record additional valuation allowances  our effective tax rate will be increased  perhaps substantially above the statutory rate 
discontinued operations during the fourth quarter of  we reviewed our business lines and the board of directors approved management s recommendation to exit and sell our non oilfield power generation and certain used equipment business lines 
income from discontinued operations increased million  to net income of million during the year ended december   from a loss of million during the year ended december  in  we recorded an additional million charge net of tax to write down our investment in discontinued operations to their current estimated market value 
during  we recorded a million charge net of tax related to write downs of our investment in discontinued operations 

table of contents cumulative effect of accounting change we recorded a cumulative effect of accounting change of million  net of tax  related to the partial adoption of fin on july  in january  the fasb issued fin the primary objectives of fin are to provide guidance on the identification of entities for which control is achieved by means other than through voting rights and the determination of when and which business enterprise should consolidate a variable interest entity vie in its financial statements 
fin applies to an entity in which either the equity investors if any do not have a controlling financial interest or the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entity s activities without receiving additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
in addition  fin requires that both the primary beneficiary and all other enterprises with a significant variable interest in a vie make additional disclosures 
as revised  fin was effective immediately for vie s created after january  for special purposes entities created prior to february   fin is effective at the first interim or annual reporting period ending after december   or december  for us 
for entities  other than special purpose entities  created prior to february   fin is effective for us as of march  in addition  fin allows companies to elect to adopt early the provisions of fin for some  but not all  of the variable interest entities they own 
because we are still evaluating whether we will be required to make any other potential changes in connection with our adoption of fin  we have not adopted the provisions of fin other than discussed here and under management discussion and analysis of financial condition new accounting pronouncements in item of this form k 
prior to july   we had entered into lease transactions that were recorded as a sale and leaseback of the compression equipment and were treated as operating leases for financial reporting purposes 
on july   we adopted the provisions of fin as they relate to the special purpose entities that lease compression equipment to us 
as a result of the adoption  we added approximately  million in compressor equipment assets  million of accumulated depreciation including approximately million of accumulated depreciation related to periods before the sale and leaseback of the equipment   million in debt and million in minority interest obligations to our balance sheet  and we reversed million of deferred gains that were recorded on our balance sheet as a result of the sale leaseback transactions 
on july   we recorded a million charge million net of tax to record the cumulative effect from the adoption of fin related to prior period depreciation of the compression equipment assets 
additionally  we estimate that we will record approximately million per year in additional depreciation expense on our leased compression equipment as a result of the inclusion of the compression equipment on our balance sheet and will also record the payments made under our compression equipment leases as interest expense 
in december  we exercised our purchase option under the compression equipment operating lease 
as of december   the remaining compression assets owned by the entities that lease equipment to us but are now included in property  plant and equipment in our consolidated financial statements had a net book value of approximately million  including improvements made to these assets after the sale leaseback transactions 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  summary our total revenues decreased by million to  million during the year ended december  from  million during  as declining revenues in our fabrication businesses more than offset increases in revenues from our domestic and international rental revenues 
revenues from rentals increased by million  or  to million during from million during the increase in both domestic and international rental revenues resulted from expansion of our rental fleet and business acquisitions completed in during  we completed two significant acquisitions in march we acquired oec compression corporation  which increased 
table of contents our rental fleet by approximately  horsepower  and in august we acquired production operators corporation  which increased our rental fleet by approximately  horsepower 
at december   the compressor rental fleet consisted of approximately  horsepower  a increase over the  horsepower in the rental fleet at december  net income decreased million  or  to a net loss of million during from net income of million during primarily due to the decline in market conditions which impacted our compressor and accessory fabrication and production and processing equipment sales and gross profits  an inventory write down  a charge included in depreciation and amortization expense for reductions in the carrying value of certain idle units of our compression fleet that are being retired and the acceleration of depreciation related to certain plants and facilities expected to be sold or abandoned  an increase in selling  general and administrative expenses  depreciation expense  leasing expense  foreign currency translation expense and interest expense  a goodwill impairment and a charge to write down investments in discontinued operations to their estimated fair market values

the increase in revenues was more than offset by higher operating expenses creating a decrease in the gross margin of approximately for the year compared to the higher operating expenses were primarily due to lower horsepower utilization brought on by weaker domestic market conditions without a decrease in overhead 
domestic horsepower decreased by to approximately  horsepower at december  from approximately  horsepower at december  domestic horsepower utilization rate at december  was compared to at december  
table of contents international rentals in thousands years ended december  increase decrease revenue operating expense gross profit gross margin the increase in international rentals resulted from the expansion of our rental fleet and business acquisitions completed in international horsepower increased by to approximately  horsepower at december  from approximately  horsepower at december  the increase in revenues was offset in part by decreased revenues from our venezuelan operations 
in december  certain opposition groups in venezuela initiated an unofficial national strike 
this caused economic conditions in venezuela to deteriorate  including a substantial reduction in the production of oil in venezuela 
as a result  during the fourth quarter of  our international rental revenues were decreased by approximately million as a result of the disruption in our operations in venezuela 
however  our international gross margin benefited from approximately million in partial reimbursement of foreign currency losses from the renegotiations of contracts with our argentine customers  discussed further below  but was negatively impacted by approximately million in revenues from venezuelan customers that was not recognized until we estimate that these items increased our gross margin by approximately 
international horsepower utilization rate at december  was compared to at december  parts service and used equipment in thousands years ended december  increase decrease revenue operating expense gross profit gross margin the increase in revenues from parts  service and used equipment was due to a million gas plant sale transaction and a million compression equipment sale transaction offset by lower revenues as a result of weaker market conditions 
the increase in operating expenses of our parts  service and used equipment segment and the decrease in the gross profit margin from parts  service and used equipment was primarily due to lower profit margins on used equipment sales in compared to used equipment sales in in  parts and service revenue included million in used equipment sales at a gross margin  compared to million in  with a gross margin 
approximately four percentage points of the decrease in gross margin for parts  service and used equipment was due to a low margin gas plant sale transaction and a low margin compressor sale transaction 
in addition  approximately three percentage points of the decrease in gross margin was due to million in inventory write downs and reserves for parts that were either obsolete  excess or carried at a price above market value 
the remainder of the decrease was primarily due to the impact of weaker market conditions on sales volume and margins 

table of contents compressor and accessory fabrication in thousands years ended december  increase decrease revenue operating expense gross profit gross margin revenues  operating expenses and gross profit from the compressor and accessory fabrication segment decreased due to weaker market conditions 
during  an aggregate of approximately  horsepower of compression equipment was fabricated and sold compared to approximately  horsepower fabricated and sold during the decrease in gross profit margin for compression and accessory fabrication was attributable to lower sales levels without a corresponding decrease in overhead and the impact of weaker market conditions on sales margins 
production and processing equipment fabrication in thousands years ended december  increase decrease revenue operating expense gross profit gross margin production and processing equipment revenues include million in revenues from the consolidation of belleli since november in november  we increased our ownership in belleli to and began consolidating the results of belleli s operations 
excluding belleli  revenues from our fabrication businesses declined by due to decreased capital spending by our customers in caused by weak economic market conditions and recent political and economic events in south america resulting in lower drilling and new well completion activity by oil and gas producers 
the average north and south american rig count decreased by in to  from  in and the twelve month rolling average henry hub natural gas price decreased to per mcf in december from per mcf in december production and processing equipment fabrication operating expenses and gross profit decreased due to lower sales levels 
the decrease in gross profit margin for production and processing equipment fabrication was attributable to lower sales levels without a corresponding decrease in overhead and the impact of weaker market conditions on sales margins 
other revenue equity in earnings in subsidiaries increased million  or  to million during  from million during this increase is primarily due to our acquisition of poc  which included interests in three joint venture projects in south america 
these joint ventures contributed million in equity earnings for compared to million in and was partially offset by a decrease in equity earnings from hanover measurement services company lp which decreased to a loss of million in from million in income in expenses sg a expenses increased million  or  to million in from million in the increase was attributable to increased personnel and other selling and administrative activity in our business segments resulting from the acquisitions completed during we also recorded million in employee separation costs relating to our announced reduction in our work force and 
table of contents management changes and approximately million in additional legal and accounting costs  a significant portion of which was associated with our board of directors and special litigation committee review of certain transactions  the restatement of our financial results and the sec investigation 
depreciation and amortization increased by million  or  to million during compared to million during during we recorded a million charge included in depreciation and amortization expense for reductions in the carrying value of certain idle compression equipment that is being retired and the acceleration of depreciation related to certain plants and facilities expected to be sold or abandoned 
the remaining increase in depreciation was due to the additions to the rental fleet  partially offset by the change in estimated lives of certain compressors 
after a review of the estimated economic lives of our compression fleet  on july  we changed our estimate of the useful life of certain compression equipment to range from to years instead of a uniform year depreciable life 
our new estimated lives are based upon our experience  maintenance program and the different types of compressors presently in our rental fleet 
we believe our new estimate reflects the economic useful lives of the compressors more accurately than a uniform useful life applied to all compressors regardless of their age or performance characteristics 
the effect of this change in estimate on was a decrease in depreciation expense of approximately million and an increase in net income of approximately million per share 
in addition  because we sold compressors in sale leaseback transactions in august  depreciation expense was reduced by approximately million in compared to approximately million in the decrease in depreciation in from was due to our change in estimate of useful lives of our compressors on july  as discussed above 
the increase in depreciation was also offset by the decrease in goodwill amortization due to our adoption of sfas under sfas  amortization of goodwill over an estimated useful life was discontinued 
instead  goodwill amounts became subject to a fair value based annual impairment assessment 
during  approximately million in goodwill amortization was recorded 
we incurred leasing expense of million during compared to million during the increase of million was attributable to the sale leaseback transactions we entered into in august and was partially offset by the unrealized gains and losses recorded related to two of our interest rate swaps 
in connection with these leases  we were obligated to prepare registration statements and complete an exchange offer to enable the holders of the notes issued by the lessors to exchange their notes for notes that were registered under the securities act of because the exchange offer was not completed until march   we were required to pay additional leasing expense in the amount of approximately  per week until march  the additional leasing expense began accruing on january  in  we recorded additional leasing expense of approximately million related to the registration and exchange offering obligations 
the fair value of our derivative instruments interest rate swaps increased by million during while the fair value decreased by million in these changes in fair value were due to the recognition of an unrealized change in the fair value of our interest rate swaps that we had not designated as cash flow hedges under sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the unrealized gains and losses are reflected in our leasing expense 
interest expense increased by million to million during from million during the increase in interest expense was due to higher levels of outstanding debt partially offset by lower effective interest rates 
foreign currency translation expense increased by million  or  to million during compared to million during the increase was primarily due to our operations in argentina and venezuela 
in january  argentina devalued its peso against the us dollar and imposed significant restrictions on funds transfers internally and outside the country 
in addition  the argentine government enacted regulations to temporarily prohibit enforcement of contracts with exchange rate based purchase price adjustments 
instead  payment under such contracts could either be made at an exchange 
table of contents rate negotiated by the parties or  if no such agreement was reached  a preliminary payment could be made based on a one dollar to one peso equivalent pending a final agreement 
the argentine government also required the parties to such contracts to renegotiate the price terms within days of the devaluation 
we have renegotiated all of our agreements in argentina 
as a result of these negotiations  we received approximately million in partial reimbursements in we recorded million of these partial reimbursements in translation expense and million in revenues from international rentals 
during  we recorded an exchange loss of approximately million and million for assets exposed to currency translation in argentina and venezuela  respectively  and recorded a translation loss of approximately million for all other countries 
due to a downturn in our business and changes in the business environment in which we operate  we completed a goodwill impairment analysis as of june  as a result of the test performed as of june   we recorded an estimated million impairment of goodwill attributable to our production and processing equipment fabrication business in the second quarter of we estimated the fair value of our reporting units using a combination of the expected present value of future cash flows and the market approach  which uses actual market sales 
in the fourth quarter of  we also recorded a million goodwill impairment related to our pump division  which is expected to be sold 
other expenses increased million  or  to million during compared to million during other expenses in included million of write downs and charges related to investments in four non consolidated affiliates that had experienced a decline in value that we believed to be other than temporary  a million write off of a purchase option for an acquisition that we had abandoned  million in other non operating costs and a million write down of notes receivable  including a million reserve established for loans to employees who were not executive officers 
other expenses in included a million bridge loan commitment fee associated with our acquisition of poc  a million write down of an investment in aurion technologies  inc  a million litigation settlement and million in other non operating expenses 
income taxes the provision for income taxes decreased by million  or  to a tax benefit of million during from million of tax expense during the decrease resulted primarily from the corresponding decrease in income before income taxes 
the average effective income tax rates during and were and  respectively 
the decrease in the effective tax rate was due primarily to a nondeductible goodwill impairment charge  us impact of foreign operations  and valuation allowances against certain net operating losses 
the effective tax rate benefited from non us foreign exchange losses deductible for tax in excess of book losses 
discontinued operations during the fourth quarter of  we reviewed our business lines and the board of directors approved management s recommendation to exit and sell our non oilfield power generation and certain used equipment business lines 
during  we recorded a million charge net of tax to write down our investment in discontinued operations to current estimated fair market values 
discontinued operations include three non oilfield power generation projects in california and related inventory  and certain of our used equipment divisions 
income loss from discontinued operations decreased million  or  to a net loss of million during from net income of million during the decrease in net income was primarily attributable to weaker market conditions that impacted sales volume and gross margins 
leasing transactions and accounting change for fin as of december  we are the lessee in four transactions involving the sale of compression equipment by us to special purpose entities  which in turn lease the equipment back to us 
at the time we entered into the leases  these transactions had a number of advantages over other sources of capital then 
table of contents available to us 
the sale leaseback transactions enabled us to affordably extend the duration of our financing arrangements and reduced our cost of capital 
in august and in connection with the acquisition of poc  we completed two sale leaseback transactions involving certain compression equipment 
under one sale leaseback transaction  we received million in proceeds from the sale of certain compression equipment 
under the second sale leaseback transaction  we received million in proceeds from the sale of additional compression equipment 
under the first transaction  the equipment was sold and leased back by us for a seven year period and will continue to be deployed by us in the normal course of our business 
the agreement calls for semi annual rental payments of approximately million in addition to quarterly rental payments of approximately million 
under the second transaction  the equipment was sold and leased back by us for a ten year period and will continue to be deployed by us in the normal course of our business 
the agreement calls for semi annual rental payments of approximately million in addition to quarterly rental payments of approximately million 
we have options to repurchase the equipment under certain conditions as defined by the lease agreements 
through december   we incurred transaction costs of approximately million related to these transactions 
these costs are included in intangible and other assets and are being amortized over the respective lease terms 
in october  we completed a million sale leaseback transaction of compression equipment 
in march  we entered into a separate million sale leaseback transaction of compression equipment 
under the march transaction  we received proceeds of million from the sale of compression equipment at the first closing in march  and in august  we completed the second half of the equipment lease and received an additional million for the sale of additional compression equipment 
under our lease agreements  the equipment was sold and leased back by us for a five year term and will be used by us in our business 
we have options to repurchase the equipment under the leases  subject to certain conditions set forth in these lease agreements 
the lease agreements call for variable quarterly payments that fluctuate with the london interbank offering rate and have covenant restrictions similar to our bank credit facility 
we incurred an aggregate of approximately million in transaction costs for the leases entered into in  which are included in intangible and other assets on the balance sheet and are being amortized over the respective lease terms of the respective transactions

we are entitled under the compression equipment operating lease agreements to substitute equipment that we own for equipment owned by the special purpose entities  provided that the value of the equipment that we are substituting is equal to or greater than the value of the equipment that is being substituted 
each lease agreement limits the aggregate amount of replacement equipment that may be substituted to under each lease 
prior to july   these lease transactions were recorded as a sale and leaseback of the compression equipment and were treated as operating leases for financial reporting purposes 
on july   we adopted the provisions of fin as they relate to the special purpose entities that lease compression equipment to us 
as a result of the adoption  we added approximately  million in compressor equipment assets  million of accumulated depreciation including approximately million of accumulated depreciation related to periods before the sale and leaseback of the 
table of contents equipment   million in debt and million in minority interest obligations to our balance sheet  and we reversed million of deferred gains that were recorded on our balance sheet as a result of the sale leaseback transactions

additionally  we estimate that we will record approximately million per year in additional depreciation expense on our leased compression equipment as a result of the inclusion of the compression equipment on our balance sheet and will also record the payments made under our compression equipment leases as interest expense 
in december we exercised our purchase option under the compression equipment operating lease 
as of december   the remaining compression assets owned by the entities that lease equipment to us but are now included in property  plant and equipment in our consolidated financial statements had a net book value of approximately million  including improvements made to these assets after the sale leaseback transactions 
the minority interest obligations represent the equity of the entities that lease compression equipment to us 
in accordance with the provisions of our compression equipment lease obligations  the equity certificate holders are entitled to quarterly or semi annual yield payments on the aggregate outstanding equity certificates 
as of december   the yield rates on the outstanding equity certificates ranged from to 
equity certificate holders may receive a return of capital payment upon lease termination or our purchase of the leased compression equipment after full payment of all debt obligations of the entities that lease compression equipment to us 
at december   the carrying value of the minority interest obligations approximated the fair market value of assets that would be required to be transferred to redeem the minority interest obligations in connection with the compression equipment leases entered into in august  we were obligated to prepare registration statements and complete an exchange offer to enable the holders of the notes issued by the lessors to exchange their notes with notes registered under the securities act of because of the restatement of our financial statements  the exchange offer was not completed within the time frame required by the agreements related to the compression equipment lease obligations and we were required to pay additional lease expense in an amount equal to  per week until the exchange offering was completed 
the additional lease expense began accruing on january  and increased our lease expense by million and million during and  respectively 
the registration statements became effective in february the exchange offer was completed and the requirement to pay the additional lease expense ended on march  in february  in connection with an amendment to our bank credit facility and  in december  in connection with the closing on our new bank credit facility we executed conforming amendments to the compression equipment leases entered into in see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources in item of this form k 
liquidity and capital resources our unrestricted cash balance amounted to million at december  compared to million at december  working capital increased to million at december  from million at december  the increase in working capital was primarily due to modification and subsequent payment of a million obligation associated with the pigap ii joint venture that was accrued as a contingent liability on our balance sheet since the acquisition of poc 
the obligation was converted into the pigap note with a interest rate compounding semi annually until maturity in december in october  the pigap ii joint venture closed on the project s financing and distributed approximately million to hanover  of which approximately million was used to pay off the pigap note

the decrease in cash used in investing activities during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  was primarily attributable to a decrease in capital expenditures and the return of some of our investment in pigap ii as a result of the financing discussed above 
we are seeking to deploy our capital more effectively in order to improve our returns from our investments  and we decreased our capital expenditures in the year ended december  by million from the year ended december  we invested million in property plant and equipment during the year ended december   primarily for international rental projects and maintenance capital 
the increase in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to the repayment of the pigap note from the cash distributed from the financing discussed above 
the increase in cash provided by discontinued operations was related to the proceeds from the sale of gates and panoche which were approximately million 
we may carry out new customer projects through rental fleet additions and other related capital expenditures 
we generally invest funds necessary to make these rental fleet additions when our idle equipment cannot economically fulfill a project s requirements and the new equipment expenditure is matched with long term contracts whose expected economic terms exceed our return on capital targets 
during  we plan to spend approximately to million on capital expenditures including rental equipment fleet additions and approximately to million on equipment maintenance capital 
since capital expenditures are largely discretionary  we believe we would be able to significantly reduce them  in a reasonably short time frame  if expected cash flows from operations were not realized 
as a result of our agreement to settle the securities related litigation  we expect to incur approximately million in additional legal fees and administrative costs over the next months in addition to the amount held in escrow and reported as restricted cash on our condensed consolidated balance sheet 
historically  we have funded our capital requirements with a combination of internally generated cash flow  borrowings under a bank credit facility  sale leaseback transactions  raising additional equity and issuing long term debt

as part of our business  we are a party to various financial guarantees  performance guarantees and other contractual commitments to extend guarantees of credit and other assistance to various subsidiaries  investees and other third parties 
to varying degrees  these guarantees involve elements of performance and credit risk  which are not included on our consolidated balance sheet or reflected in the table above 
the possibility of our having to honor our contingencies is largely dependent upon future operations of various subsidiaries  investees and other third parties  or the occurrence of certain future events 
we would record a reserve for these guarantees if events occurred that required that one be established 
debt refinancing 
in june  we filed a shelf registration statement with the sec pursuant to which we may from time to time publicly offer equity  debt or other securities in an aggregate amount not to exceed million 
the sec subsequently declared the shelf registration statement effective on november  subject to market conditions  the remaining shelf registration statement will be available to offer one or more series of additional debt or other securities 
in december  we issued under our shelf registration statement million aggregate principal amount of our senior notes due  which are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior subordinated basis by hclp 
the proceeds from this offering were used to repay the outstanding indebtedness and minority interest obligations of million and million  respectively  under our a equipment lease that was to expire in june also in december  we issued under our shelf registration statement million aggregate principal amount of our convertible senior notes due we may redeem these convertible notes beginning in under certain circumstances 
the convertible notes are convertible into shares of our common stock at an initial conversion rate of shares of our common stock per  principal amount of the convertible notes subject to adjustment in certain events at any time prior to the stated maturity of the convertible notes or the redemption or repurchase of the convertible notes by us 
the proceeds from this offering were used to repay a portion of the outstanding indebtedness under our bank credit facility 

table of contents new bank credit facility 
effective december   we entered into a new million bank credit facility with a maturity date of december  and made conforming amendments related to the compression equipment lease obligations that we entered into in our prior million bank credit facility that was scheduled to mature in november was terminated upon closing of the new facility 
the new bank credit facility  modified certain covenants that were contained in the prior facility and eliminated certain covenants entirely 
the new agreement prohibits us without the lenders prior approval from declaring or paying any dividend other than dividends payable solely in our common stock or in options  warrants or rights to purchase such common stock on  or making similar payments with respect to  our capital stock 
the new agreement clarifies and provides certain thresholds with respect to our ability to make investments in our foreign subsidiaries 
in addition  under the new agreement we granted the lenders a security interest in the inventory  equipment and certain other property of hanover and its domestic subsidiaries with certain exceptions  and pledged of the equity interest in certain of our foreign subsidiaries 
we believe that this new bank credit facility will provide flexibility in accessing the capacity under the facility to support our short term liquidity needs 
our new bank credit facility provides for a million revolving credit facility in which advances bear interest at a the greater of the administrative agent s prime rate  the federal funds effective rate  or the base cd rate  or b a eurodollar rate  plus  in each case  a specified margin weighted average interest rate at december  
a commitment fee equal to times the average daily amount of the available commitment under the bank credit facility is payable quarterly to the lenders participating in the bank credit facility 
our bank credit facility contains certain financial covenants and limitations on  among other things  indebtedness  liens  leases and sales of assets 
as of december   we were in compliance with all material covenants and other requirements set forth in our bank credit facility  agreements related to our compression equipment lease obligations and indentures 
giving effect to the covenant limitations in our bank credit facility  the liquidity available under that facility as of december  was approximately million 
while there is no assurance  we believe based on our current projections for that we will be in compliance with the financial covenants in our bank credit facility and the agreements related to our compression equipment lease obligations 
a default under our bank credit facility or these agreements would trigger cross default provisions under the agreements relating to certain of our other debt obligations 
such defaults would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity  financial position and operations 
we expect that our new bank credit facility and cash flow from operations will provide us adequate capital resources to fund our estimated level of capital expenditures for the short term 
as of december   we had approximately million in borrowings and approximately million in letters of credit outstanding under our bank credit facility weighted average effective rate at december  
our bank credit facility permits us to incur indebtedness  subject to covenant limitations described above  up to a million credit limit  plus  in addition to certain other indebtedness  an additional million in unsecured indebtedness  million of nonrecourse indebtedness of unqualified subsidiaries  and million of secured purchase money indebtedness 
in addition to purchase money and similar obligations  the indentures and the agreements related to our compression equipment lease obligations for our a and b sale leaseback transactions and our senior notes due permit us to incur indebtedness up to the million credit limit under our bank credit facility  plus an additional million in unsecured indebtedness and any additional indebtedness so long as  after incurring such indebtedness  our ratio of the sum of consolidated net income before interest expense  income taxes  depreciation expense  amortization of intangibles  certain other non cash charges and rental expense to total fixed charges all as defined and adjusted by the agreements  or our coverage ratio  is greater than to and no default or event of default has occurred or would occur as a consequence of incurring such additional indebtedness and the application of the proceeds thereon 
the indentures and agreements related to our compression equipment lease obligations for our a and b sale leaseback transactions define indebtedness to include the present value of our rental obligations under sale leaseback transactions and under facilities similar to our compression equipment operating leases 
as of december   hanover s coverage ratio was less than 
table of contents to and therefore as of such date we could not incur indebtedness other than under our bank credit facility and up to an additional million in unsecured indebtedness and certain other permitted indebtedness  including certain refinancing indebtedness 
pigap ii restructuring and our zero coupon subordinated notes due march  on may   we entered into an agreement with schlumberger to terminate our right to put our interest in the pigap ii joint venture to schlumberger 
as a result  we retained our interest in pigap ii 
we had previously given notice of our intent to exercise the pigap put in january pigap ii is a joint venture  currently owned by a subsidiary of williams companies inc and by hanover  which operates a natural gas compression facility in venezuela 
the natural gas processed by pigap ii is re injected into oil reservoirs for enhanced oil recovery 
also on may   we agreed with schlumberger surenco  an affiliate of schlumberger  to the modification of the repayment terms of a million obligation that was accrued as a contingent liability on our balance sheet since the acquisition of poc and was associated with the pigap ii joint venture 
the obligation was converted into the pigap note payable by hanover cayman limited  our indirect wholly owned consolidated subsidiary  with a interest rate compounding semi annually until maturity in december in october  the pigap ii joint venture closed on the project s financing and distributed approximately million to hanover  of which approximately million was used to repay the pigap note 
in connection with the agreement to terminate our right to put our interest in pigap ii back to schlumberger  we also agreed with schlumberger to restructure the million subordinated note that schlumberger received from hanover in august as part of the purchase price for our acquisition of poc s natural gas compression business  ownership interest in certain joint venture projects in south america including pigap ii  and related assets 
as of march   the date from which the interest rate was adjusted  the million subordinated note had an outstanding principal balance of approximately million  including accrued interest 
we restructured the million subordinated note as our zero coupon subordinated notes due march   which notes were issued to schlumberger and were sold by schlumberger in a registered public offering in december original issue discount accretes under the zero coupon notes at a rate of per annum for their remaining life  up to a total principal amount of million payable at maturity 
the notes will accrue additional interest at a rate of per annum upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default under the notes 
the notes will also accrue additional interest at a rate of per annum if our consolidated leverage ratio  as defined in the indenture governing the notes  exceeds to as of the end of any two consecutive fiscal quarters 
as of december   we estimate that our debt balance could have increased by approximately million in additional indebtedness and not exceeded the to ratio 
notwithstanding the preceding  in no event will the total additional interest accruing on the notes exceed per annum if both of the previously mentioned circumstances occur 
the notes also contain a covenant that limits our ability to incur additional indebtedness if our consolidated leverage ratio exceeds to  subject to certain exceptions

see discussion of the impact of fin in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations new accounting pronouncements under item of this form k 
we do not have any credit rating downgrade provisions in our debt agreements or the agreements related to our compression equipment lease obligations that would accelerate their maturity dates 
however  a downgrade in our credit rating could materially and adversely affect our ability to renew existing  or obtain access to new  credit facilities in the future and could increase the cost of such facilities 
should this occur  we might seek alternative sources of funding 
in addition  our significant leverage puts us at greater risk of default under one or more of our existing debt agreements if we experience an adverse change to our financial condition or results of operations 
our ability to reduce our leverage depends upon market and economic conditions  as well as our ability to execute liquidity enhancing transactions such as sales of non core assets or our equity securities 
derivative financial instruments 
we use derivative financial instruments to minimize the risks and or costs associated with financial and global operating activities by managing our exposure to interest rate fluctuation on a portion of our variable rate debt and leasing obligations 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes 
the cash flow from hedges is classified in our consolidated statements of cash flows under the same category as the cash flows from the underlying assets  liabilities or anticipated transactions 
sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by sfas  sfas and sfas  requires that all derivative instruments including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts be recognized in the balance sheet at fair value  and that changes in such fair values be recognized in earnings unless specific hedging criteria are met 
changes in the values of derivatives that meet these hedging criteria will ultimately offset related earnings effects of the hedged item pending recognition in earnings 
prior to  we entered into two interest rate swaps with notional amounts of million and million and strike rates of and  respectively 
these swaps were to expire in july  however  they were extended for an additional two years at the option of the swap counterparty and expired in july the difference paid or received on the swap transactions was recorded as an accrued liability and recognized in leasing expense in all periods before july   and in interest expense thereafter 
because management decided not to designate the interest rate swaps as hedges at the time they were extended by the counterparty  we recognized unrealized gains of approximately million and approximately million related to the change in the fair value of these interest rate swaps in lease expense in our statement of operations during the years ended december  and  respectively  and recognized an unrealized gain of approximately million in interest expense during the fair value of these interest rate swaps fluctuated with changes in interest rates over their terms and the fluctuations were recorded in our statement of operations 

table of contents during the second quarter of  we entered into three additional interest rate swaps to convert variable lease payments under certain lease arrangements to fixed payments as follows lease maturity date strike rate notional amount march march   august march   october october   these three swaps  which we have designated as cash flow hedging instruments  meet the specific hedge criteria and any changes in their fair values have been recognized in other comprehensive income 
during the years ended december  and  we recorded income of approximately million and a loss of million  respectively  related to these three swaps million and million  net of tax in other comprehensive income 
as of december  and december   a total of approximately million and million  respectively  was recorded in current liabilities and approximately million and million  respectively  in long term liabilities with respect to the fair value adjustment related to these three swaps 
the counterparties to the interest rate swap agreements are major international financial institutions 
we continually monitor the credit quality of these financial institutions and do not expect non performance by any counterparty  although such non performance could have a material adverse effect on us 
during  we entered into forward exchange contracts with a notional value of million to mitigate the risk of changes in exchange rates between euro and the us dollar 
these contracts mature during as of december   a total of approximately million was recorded in other current assets and other comprehensive income with respect to the fair value adjustment related to these three contracts 
we have significant operations that expose us to currency risk in argentina and venezuela 
to mitigate that risk  the majority of our existing contracts provide that we receive payment in or based on us dollars rather than argentine pesos and venezuelan bolivars  thus reducing our exposure to fluctuations in the their value 
for the year ended december   our argentine operations represented approximately of our revenue and of our gross profit 
during the years ended december  and  we recorded an exchange gain of approximately million and an exchange loss of approximately million  respectively  for assets exposed to currency translation in argentina 
in addition  during the years ended december  and  we recorded exchange losses of approximately million and million  respectively  for assets exposed to currency translation in venezuela and recorded translation losses of approximately million and million  respectively  for all other countries 
for the year ended december   our venezuelan operations represented approximately of our revenue and of our gross profit 
at december   we had approximately million in accounts receivable related to our venezuelan operations 
in december  opponents of venezuelan president hugo ch vez initiated a country wide strike by workers of the national oil company in venezuela 
this strike  a two month walkout  had a significant negative impact on venezuela s economy and temporarily shut down a substantial portion of venezuela s oil industry 
as a result of the strike  venezuela s oil production dropped substantially 
in addition  exchange controls have been put in place that put limitations on the amount of venezuelan currency that can be exchanged for foreign currency by businesses operating inside venezuela 
in may  after six months of negotiation  the organization of the american states brokered an agreement between the venezuelan government and its opponents 
although the accord does offer the prospect of stabilizing venezuela s economy  if another national strike is staged  exchange controls remain in place  or economic and political conditions in venezuela continue to deteriorate  our results of operations in venezuela could be materially and adversely affected  which could result in reductions in our net income 
as a result of the disruption in our operations in venezuela  during the fourth quarter of  our international rental revenues decreased by approximately million 
in the year ended december   we recognized 
table of contents approximately million of billings to venezuelan customers that were not recognized in due to concerns about the ultimate receipt of those revenues 
in addition  a recent movement to remove president ch vez has resulted in renewed civil strife in venezuela 
if such strife continues or escalates  our results of operations in venezuela could be further materially and adversely affected 
in february  the venezuelan government fixed the exchange rate to  bolivars for each us dollar 
in february  the government devalued the currency by approximately 
the impact of the devaluation on our results will depend upon the amount of our assets primarily working capital exposed to currency fluctuation in venezuela in future periods 
as of december   we had approximately million in net assets exposed to currency fluctuation in venezuela 
based on these assets  a change in exchange rates would result in a million gain or loss in venezuela 
the economic situation in argentina and venezuela is subject to change 
to the extent that the situation deteriorates  exchange controls continue in place and the value of the peso and bolivar against the dollar is reduced further  our results of operations in argentina and venezuela could be materially and adversely affected which could result in reductions in our net income 
we are involved in a project to build and operate barge mounted gas compression and gas processing facilities to be stationed in a nigerian coastal waterway as part of the performance of a contract between an affiliate of the royal dutch shell group shell and global energy and refining ltd 
global  a nigerian company 
we have completed the building of the required barge mounted facilities 
we understand that global must complete a significant financing for part of the project in the near term or shell would be able to terminate its contract with global 
global has orally informed us that they have completed a financing  although it is not clear to us whether the funds raised will be sufficient to perform their obligations under the shell contract 
in light of the political environment in nigeria  global s lack of a successful track record with respect to this project and other factors  there is no assurance that global will be able to comply with its obligations under the shell contract 
we believe that global is in default with respect to certain agreements they have with us  as a result of which we believe we have certain termination rights 
if shell were to terminate its contract with global for any reason or we were to terminate our involvement in the project  we would be required to find an alternative use for the barge facility which could result in a write down of our investment 
we currently have an investment of approximately million associated with the barge facility and approximately million associated with advances to  and our investment in  global 
off balance sheet arrangements we agreed to assume from certain affiliates of schlumberger the guarantee obligations of indebtedness of the simco harwat consortium and of el furrial  each of which are joint ventures that we acquired interests in pursuant to our acquisition of poc from schlumberger 
each of these joint ventures are non consolidated affiliates of hanover and our guarantee obligations are not recorded on our accompanying balance sheet 
our guarantee obligation is a percentage of the total debt of the non consolidated affiliate equal to our ownership percentage in such affiliate 
we have issued the following guarantees of the indebtedness of our non consolidated affiliates in thousands maximum potential undiscounted payments as of term december  simco harwat consortium el furrial our obligation to perform under the guarantees arises only in the event that our non consolidated affiliate defaults under the agreements governing the indebtedness 
we currently have no reason to believe that either of these non consolidated affiliates will default on their indebtedness 

table of contents factors that may affect our financial condition and future results we have a substantial amount of debt  including our compression equipment lease obligations  that could limit our ability to fund future growth and operations and increase our exposure during adverse economic conditions 
as of december   we had approximately  million of debt 
our substantial debt and compression equipment lease commitments could have important consequences 
for example  these commitments could make it more difficult for us to satisfy our contractual obligations  increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  limit our ability to fund future working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions or other general corporate requirements  increase our vulnerability to interest rate fluctuations because the interest payments on a portion of our debt are at  and a portion of our compression equipment leasing expense is based upon  variable rates  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and our industry  place us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt or fewer operating lease commitments  and limit our ability to borrow additional funds 
we will need to generate a significant amount of cash to service our debt  to fund working capital and to pay our debts as they come due 
our ability to make scheduled payments on our compression equipment lease obligations and our other debt  or to refinance our debt and other obligations  will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future 
our ability to generate cash in the future is subject to our operational performance  as well as general economic  financial  competitive  legislative and regulatory conditions  among other factors 
for the year ended december   we incurred interest and leasing expense of million related to our debt  including our compression equipment lease obligations 
as of december   we had outstanding borrowings of approximately million rate at december  and outstanding letters of credit of approximately million under our bank credit facility and approximately million of credit capacity remaining after giving effect to the covenant limitations in our bank credit facility 
approximately million of our debt will mature within two years from december  our ability to refinance this debt and other financial obligations at a reasonable cost will be affected by the factors discussed herein and by the general market at the time we refinance 
our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations  and future borrowings may not be available to us under our bank credit facility in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debt  compression equipment lease obligations  operating lease commitments and other financial obligations  or to fund our other liquidity needs 
we cannot be sure that we will be able to refinance any of our debt or our other financial obligations on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
our inability to refinance our debt or our other financial obligations on commercially reasonable terms could materially adversely affect our business 

table of contents the documents governing our outstanding debt  including our compression equipment lease obligations  contain financial and other restrictive covenants 
failing to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which  if not cured or waived  could have a material adverse effect on us 
our bank credit facility and other debt obligations  including the agreements related to our compression equipment lease obligations  contain  among other things  covenants that may restrict our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities 
these covenants include provisions that restrict our ability to incur additional debt or issue guarantees  create liens on our assets  engage in mergers  consolidations and dispositions of assets  enter into additional operating leases  pay dividends on or redeem capital stock  enter into derivative transactions  make certain investments or restricted payments  make capital expenditures above certain limits  make investments  loans or advancements to certain of our subsidiaries  prepay or modify our debt facilities  enter into transactions with affiliates  or enter into sale leaseback transactions 
in addition  under our bank credit facility and the agreements related to certain of our compression equipment lease obligations that we entered into in  we have granted the lenders a security interest in our inventory  equipment and certain of our other property and the property of our domestic subsidiaries and pledged of the equity interest in certain of our foreign subsidiaries 
our bank credit facility also prohibits us without the lenders prior approval from declaring or paying any dividend other than dividends payable solely in our common stock or in options  warrants or rights to purchase such common stock on  or making similar payments with respect to  our capital stock 
our bank credit facility and other financial obligations and the agreements related to our compression equipment lease obligations require us to maintain financial ratios and tests  which may require that we take action to reduce our debt or act in a manner contrary to our business objectives 
adverse conditions in the oil and gas business or in the united states or global economy or other events related to our business may affect our ability to meet those financial ratios and tests 
a breach of any of these covenants or failure to maintain such financial ratios would result in an event of default under our bank credit facility  the agreements related to our compression equipment lease obligations and the agreements relating to our other financial obligations 
if such an event of default occurs  the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder  together with accrued interest  to be immediately due and payable

we do not have any credit rating downgrade provisions in our debt agreements or the agreements related to our compression equipment lease obligations that would accelerate their maturity dates 
however  a downgrade in our credit rating could materially and adversely affect our ability to renew existing  or obtain access to new  credit facilities in the future and could increase the cost of such facilities 
should this occur  we might seek alternative sources of funding 
in addition  our significant leverage puts us at greater risk of default under one or more of our existing debt agreements if we experience an adverse change to our financial condition or results of operations 
our ability to reduce our leverage depends upon market and economic conditions  as well as our ability to execute liquidity enhancing transactions such as sales of non core assets or our equity securities 
we are still in the process of improving our infrastructure capabilities  including our internal controls and procedures  which were strained by our rapid growth  to reduce the risk of future accounting and financial reporting problems 
we experienced rapid growth from through primarily as a result of acquisitions  particularly during and  during which period our total assets increased from approximately million as of december  to approximately billion as of december  our growth exceeded our infrastructure capabilities and strained our internal control environment 
during  we announced a series of restatements of transactions that occurred in  and these restatements of our financial statements ultimately reduced our initially reported pre tax income by million  or  for the year ended december   by million  or  for the year ended december   and by million  or  for the year ended december   although certain restatements resulted in a larger percentage adjustment on a quarterly basis 
during  a number of company executives involved directly and indirectly with the transactions underlying the restatements resigned  including our former chief executive officer  chief financial officer and vice chairman of our board of directors  chief operating officer and the head of our international operations 
during and after  we hired and appointed a new chief executive officer and chief financial officer  hired and appointed our first general counsel  and hired a new controller and managers of human resources  financial reporting and policy administration 
during  we added three independent directors to our board of directors and elected an independent chairman of the board from among the three new directors 
in addition  on february  we added two new independent directors to our board of directors 

table of contents under the direction of our board of directors and new management  we have been reviewing and continue to review our internal controls and procedures for financial reporting and have substantially enhanced certain of our controls and procedures 
we have begun to implement a new enterprise resource planning system to better integrate our accounting functions  particularly to better integrate acquired companies 
we have made personnel changes and hired additional qualified staff in the legal  accounting  finance and human resource areas and are utilizing third parties to assist with certain aspects of our integration 
we have hired a third party to perform internal audit functions for us and anticipate hiring internal personnel to perform this function 
our new management has also adopted policies and procedures  including disseminating a new code of conduct applicable to all employees  to better assure compliance with applicable laws  regulations and ethical standards 
although we have had certain financial reporting problems in recent months that required us  to amend our form q for the third quarter of  adjust our income tax provision for the fourth quarter from what we had previously announced and delay the filing of our form k for  we do not believe these problems resulted from any material deficiency in our internal controls and procedures or financial reporting process 
however  we are continuing to implement improvements to our internal controls and procedures 
full implementation of these improvements will be accomplished over a period of time and  unless and until these efforts are successfully completed  we could experience future accounting and financial reporting problems 
accounting and financial reporting problems could result in  among other things  new securities litigation claims being brought against us  future investigations of us by the sec and possible fines and penalties  including those resulting from a violation of the cease and desist order we entered into with the sec in december  and a loss of investor confidence which could adversely affect the trading prices of our debt and equity securities and adversely affect our ability to access sources of necessary capital 
unforeseen difficulties with the implementation of our enterprise resource planning system could adversely affect our internal controls and our business 
we have contracted with oracle corporation to assist us with the design and implementation of a new enterprise resource planning system that will support our human resources  accounting  estimating  financial  fleet and job management and customer systems 
we are currently implementing this system 
the efficient execution of our business is dependent upon the proper functioning of our internal systems 
any significant failure or malfunction of our enterprise resource planning system may result in disruptions of our operations 
our results of operations could be adversely affected if we encounter unforeseen problems with respect to the implementation or operation of this system 
we require a substantial amount of capital to expand our compressor rental fleet and our complementary businesses 
we invested million in property plant and equipment during the year ended december   primarily for international rental projects and maintenance capital 
during we plan to spend approximately to million on continued expansion and maintenance of our rental fleet and other businesses  including to million on equipment maintenance capital 
the amount of these expenditures may vary depending on conditions in the natural gas industry and the timing and extent of any significant acquisitions we may make 
historically  we have funded our capital expenditures through internally generated funds  sale leaseback transactions and debt and equity financing 
while we believe that cash flow from our operations and borrowings under our existing million bank credit facility will provide us with sufficient cash to fund our planned capital expenditures  we cannot assure you that these sources will be sufficient 
as of december   we had approximately million of credit capacity remaining after giving effect to the covenant limitations in our bank credit facility under our bank credit facility weighted average effective interest rate at december  
failure to generate sufficient cash flow  together with the absence of alternative sources of capital  could have a material adverse effect on our business  consolidated financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 

table of contents our ability to substitute compressor equipment under our compressor equipment leases is limited and there are risks associated with reaching that limit prior to the expiration of the lease term 
we are the lessee in four transactions involving the sale of compression equipment by us to special purpose entities  which in turn lease the equipment back to us 
we are entitled under the compression equipment operating lease agreements to substitute equipment that we own for equipment owned by the special purpose entities  provided that the value of the equipment that we are substituting is equal to or greater than the value of the equipment that is being substituted 
we generally substitute equipment when one of our lease customers exercises a contractual right or otherwise desires to buy the leased equipment or when fleet equipment owned by the special purpose entities becomes obsolete or is selected by us for transfer to international projects 
each lease agreement limits the aggregate amount of replacement equipment that may be substituted to  among other restrictions  a percentage of the termination value under each lease 
the termination value is equal to the aggregate amount of outstanding principal of the corresponding notes issued by the special purpose entity  plus accrued and unpaid interest and the aggregate amount of equity investor contributions to the special purpose entity  plus all accrued amounts due on account of the investor yield and any other amounts owed to such investors in the special purpose entity or to the holders of the notes issued by the special purpose entity or their agents 
in the following table  termination value does not include amounts in excess of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of notes and the aggregate outstanding amount of the equity investor contributions  as such amounts are periodically paid as supplemental rent as required by our compression equipment operating leases 
the aggregate amount of replacement equipment substituted in dollars and percentage of termination value  the termination value and the substitution percentage limitation relating to each of our compression equipment operating leases as of december  are as follows substitution limitation as value of percentage of percentage of lease substituted termination termination termination termination lease equipment value value value date dollars in millions march and august march october october august september august september total termination value assumes all accrued rents paid before termination 
in the event we reach the substitution limitation prior to a lease termination date  we will not be able to effect any additional substitutions with respect to such lease 
this inability to substitute could have a material adverse effect on our business  consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
a prolonged  substantial reduction in oil or gas prices  or prolonged instability in domestic or global energy markets  could adversely affect our business 
our operations depend upon the levels of activity in natural gas development  production  processing and transportation 
in recent years  oil and gas prices and the level of drilling and exploration activity have been extremely volatile 
for example  oil and gas exploration and development activity and the number of well completions typically decline when there is a significant reduction in oil and gas prices or significant instability in energy markets 
as a result  the demand for our gas compression and oil and gas production equipment would be adversely affected 
any future significant  prolonged decline in oil and gas prices could have a material adverse effect on our business  consolidated financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
erosion of the financial condition of our customers can also adversely affect our business 
during times when the oil or natural gas market weakens  the likelihood of the erosion of the financial condition of these customers increases 
if and to the extent the financial condition of our customers declines  our customers could seek to preserve capital by canceling or delaying scheduled maintenance of their existing 
table of contents gas compression and oil and gas production equipment and determining not to purchase new gas compression and oil and gas production equipment 
in addition  upon the financial failure of a customer  we could experience a loss associated with the unsecured portion of any of our outstanding accounts receivable 
recently  due in part to a deterioration in market conditions  we have experienced a decline in revenues and profits 
our business recorded a million net loss for the year ended december  and a million net loss for the year ended december  our results for the years ended december  and have been affected by an increase in selling  general and administrative expenses  depreciation expense  foreign currency translation expense  interest expense  goodwill impairments  asset impairments  write downs of discontinued operations  the provision for the cost of the litigation settlement and the cumulative effect of an accounting change 
if market conditions were to deteriorate  there could be a material decline in our business  consolidated financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
there are many risks associated with conducting operations in international markets 
we operate in many different geographic markets  some of which are outside the united states 
changes in local economic or political conditions  particularly in latin america or canada  could have a material adverse effect on our business  consolidated financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
additional risks inherent in our international business activities include the following difficulties in managing international operations  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs and other trade barriers that may restrict our ability to enter into new markets  potentially adverse tax consequences  expropriation of property or restrictions on repatriation of earnings  difficulties in establishing new international offices and risks inherent in establishing new relationships in foreign countries  the burden of complying with foreign laws  and fluctuations in currency exchange rates and the value of the us dollar  particularly with respect to our operations in argentina and venezuela 
in addition  our future plans involve expanding our business in international markets where we currently do not conduct business 
our decentralized management structure and the risks inherent in establishing new business ventures  especially in international markets where local customs  laws and business procedures present special challenges  may affect our ability to be successful in these ventures or avoid losses which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
some of the international markets in which we operate or plan to operate in the future are politically unstable and are subject to occasional civil and community unrest  such as venezuela and western africa 
riots  strikes  the outbreak of war or terrorist attacks in foreign locations could also adversely affect our business 
we have not obtained insurance against terrorist attacks and  due to its limited availability and high cost  do not expect to obtain such insurance in the future 
political conditions and fluctuations in currency exchange rates in argentina and venezuela could adversely affect our business 
we have substantial operations in argentina and venezuela 
as a result  adverse political conditions and fluctuations in currency exchange rates in argentina and venezuela could materially and adversely affect our business 

table of contents in january  argentina devalued its peso against the us dollar and imposed significant restrictions on fund transfers internally and outside the country 
in addition  the argentine government enacted regulations to temporarily prohibit enforcement of contracts with exchange rate based purchase price adjustments 
instead  payment under such contracts could either be made at an exchange rate negotiated by the parties or  if no such agreement were reached  a preliminary payment could be made based on a one dollar to one peso equivalent pending a final agreement 
the argentine government also required the parties to such contracts to renegotiate the price terms within business days of the devaluation 
we have renegotiated all of our agreements in argentina 
as a result of these negotiations  we received approximately million in reimbursements in and million in for the year ended december   our argentine operations represented approximately of our revenue and of our gross profit 
during the years ended december  and  we recorded an exchange gain of approximately million and an exchange loss of approximately million  respectively  for assets exposed to currency translation in argentina 
the economic situation in argentina is subject to change 
to the extent that the situation in argentina deteriorates  exchange controls continue in place and the value of the peso against the dollar is reduced further  our results of operations in argentina could be materially and adversely affected which could result in reductions in our net income 
in addition  during the years ended december  and  we recorded exchange losses of approximately million and million  respectively  for assets exposed to currency translation in venezuela and recorded translation losses of approximately million and million  respectively  for all other countries 
for the year ended december   our venezuelan operations represented approximately of our revenue and of our gross profit 
at december   we had approximately million in accounts receivable related to our venezuelan operations 
in december  opponents of venezuelan president hugo ch vez initiated a country wide strike by workers of the national oil company in venezuela 
this strike  a two month walkout  had a significant negative impact on venezuela s economy and temporarily shut down a substantial portion of venezuela s oil industry 
as a result of the strike  venezuela s oil production dropped substantially 
in addition  exchange controls have been put in place which put limitations on the amount of venezuelan currency that can be exchanged for foreign currency by businesses operating inside venezuela 
in may  after six months of negotiation  the organization of the american states brokered an agreement between the venezuelan government and its opponents 
although the accord does offer the prospect of stabilizing venezuela s economy  if another national strike is staged  exchange controls remain in place  or economic and political conditions in venezuela continue to deteriorate  our results of operations in venezuela could be materially and adversely affected  which could result in reductions in our net income 
as a result of the disruption in our operations in venezuela  during the fourth quarter of  our international rental revenues decreased by approximately million 
in the year ended december   we recognized approximately million of billings to venezuelan customers that were not recognized in due to concerns about the ultimate receipt of those revenues 
in addition  a recent movement to remove president ch vez has resulted in renewed civil strife in venezuela 
if such strife continues or escalates  our results of operations in venezuela could be further materially and adversely affected 
in february  the venezuelan government fixed the exchange rate to  bolivars for each us dollar 
in february  the government devalued the currency by approximately 
the impact of the devaluation on our results of operations will depend upon the amount of our assets primarily working capital exposed to currency fluctuation in venezuela in future periods 
as of december   we had approximately million in net assets exposed to currency fluctuation in venezuela 
based on these assets  a change in exchange rates would result in a million gain or loss in venezuela 
many of our compressor leases with customers have short initial terms  and we cannot be sure that the leases for these rental compressors will be renewed after the end of the initial lease term 
the length of our compressor leases with customers varies based on operating conditions and customer needs 
in most cases  under currently prevailing lease rates  the initial lease terms are not long enough to enable us to fully recoup the average cost of acquiring or fabricating the equipment 
we cannot be sure that 
table of contents a substantial number of our lessees will continue to renew their leases or that we will be able to re lease the equipment to new customers or that any renewals or re leases will be at comparable lease rates 
the inability to renew or re lease a substantial portion of our compressor rental fleet would have a material adverse effect upon our business  consolidated financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we operate in a highly competitive industry 
we experience competition from companies that may be able to adapt more quickly to technological and other changes within our industry and throughout the economy as a whole  more readily take advantage of acquisitions and other opportunities and adopt more aggressive pricing policies 
we also may not be able to take advantage of certain opportunities or make certain investments because of our significant leverage and the restrictive covenants in our bank credit facility  the agreements related to our compression equipment lease obligations and our other obligations 
in times of weak market conditions  we may experience reduced profit margins from increased pricing pressure 
we may not be able to continue to compete successfully in this market or against such competition 
if we cannot compete successfully  we may lose market share and our business  consolidated financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
natural gas operations entail inherent risks that may result in substantial liability to us 
natural gas operations entail inherent risks  including equipment defects  malfunctions and failures and natural disasters  which could result in uncontrollable flows of gas or well fluids  fires and explosions 
these risks may expose us  as an equipment operator or fabricator  to liability for personal injury  wrongful death  property damage  pollution and other environmental damage 
we have obtained insurance against liability for personal injury  wrongful death and property damage  but we cannot be sure that the insurance will be adequate to cover the liability we may incur 
insurance premium pricing is highly volatile and we cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain insurance in the future at a reasonable cost or at all 
our business  consolidated financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected if we incur substantial liability and the damages are not covered by insurance or are in excess of policy limits 
our ability to manage our business effectively will be weakened if we lose key personnel 
we depend on the continuing efforts of our executive officers and senior management 
the departure of any of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we do not maintain key man life insurance coverage with respect to our executive officers or key management personnel 
in addition  we believe that our success depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees 
there is significant demand in our industry for qualified engineers and mechanics to manufacture and repair natural gas compression equipment 
if we fail to retain our skilled personnel and to recruit other skilled personnel  we could be unable to compete effectively 
there is a risk that the internal revenue service or another taxing authority would not agree with our treatment of sale leaseback transactions  which could increase our taxes 
we treat our sale leaseback transactions as financing arrangements for income tax and certain other tax purposes 
a tax treatment inconsistent with our position could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
we intend to continue to treat the leases as a secured financing arrangement for income and certain other tax purposes  which is consistent with the way the leases are intended to be treated for bankruptcy law and state law purposes 
if the internal revenue service or another taxing authority were to successfully contend that the leases or any of our other operating leases should be treated as a sale leaseback of equipment rather than a secured financing arrangement  we may owe significant additional taxes 
this result may affect our ability to make payments on our debt or our compression equipment lease obligations 

table of contents our business is subject to a variety of governmental regulations relating to the environment  health and safety 
our business is subject to a variety of federal  state  local and foreign laws and regulations relating to the environment  health and safety 
these laws and regulations are complex  change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in a variety of administrative  civil and criminal enforcement measures  including assessment of monetary penalties  imposition of remedial requirements and issuance of injunctions as to future compliance 
from time to time as part of the regular overall evaluation of our operations  including newly acquired operations  we apply for or amend facility permits with respect to stormwater or wastewater discharges  waste handling  or air emissions relating to manufacturing activities or equipment operations  which subjects us to new or revised permitting conditions that may be onerous or costly to comply with 
in addition  certain of our customer service arrangements may require us to operate  on behalf of a specific customer  petroleum storage units such as underground tanks or pipelines and other regulated units  all of which may impose additional compliance and permitting obligations 
as one of the largest natural gas compression companies in the united states  we conduct operations at numerous facilities in a wide variety of locations across the country 
our operations at many of these facilities require federal  state or local environmental permits or other authorizations 
for example  natural gas compressors at many of our customer facilities require individual air permits or general authorizations to operate under various air regulatory programs established by rule or regulation 
these permits and authorizations frequently contain numerous compliance requirements  including monitoring and reporting obligations and operational restrictions  such as emission limits 
given the large number of facilities in which we operate  and the numerous environmental permits and other authorizations applicable to our operations  we occasionally identify or are notified of technical violations of certain requirements existing in various permits and other authorizations  and it is likely that similar technical violations will occur in the future 
occasionally  we have been assessed penalties for our non compliance  and we could be subject to such penalties in the future 
while such penalties generally do not have a material financial impact on our business or operations  it is possible future violations could result in substantial penalties 
we are evaluating the impact on our operations of recently promulgated air emission regulations under the clean air act relating to non road engines 
we intend to implement any equipment upgrades or permit modifications required by these air emission regulations according to the required schedule of compliance 
we do not anticipate  however  that any changes or updates in response to such regulations  or any other anticipated permit modifications for stormwater  other air emission sources or otherwise or anticipated ongoing regulatory compliance obligations will have a material adverse effect on our operations either as a result of any enforcement measures or through increased capital costs 
based on our experience to date  we believe that the future cost of compliance with existing laws and regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our business  consolidated financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
however  future events  such as compliance with more stringent laws  regulations or permit conditions  a major expansion of our operations into more heavily regulated activities  more vigorous enforcement policies by regulatory agencies  or stricter or different interpretations of existing laws and regulations could require us to make material expenditures 
we have conducted preliminary environmental site assessments with respect to some  but not all  properties currently owned or leased by us  usually in a pre acquisition context 
some of these assessments have revealed that soils and or groundwater at some of our facilities are contaminated with hydrocarbons  heavy metals and various other regulated substances 
with respect to newly acquired properties  we do not believe that our operations caused or contributed to any such contamination in any material respect and we are not currently under any governmental orders or directives requiring us to undertake any remedial activity at such properties 
we typically will develop a baseline of site conditions so we can establish conditions at the outset of our operations on such property 
however  the handling of petroleum products and other regulated substances is a normal part of our operations and we have experienced occasional minor spills or incidental leakage in connection with our operations 
certain properties previously owned or leased by us were determined to be affected by soil contamination 
where such contamination was 
table of contents identified and determined by us to be our responsibility  we conducted remedial activities at these previously held properties to the extent we believed necessary to meet regulatory standards and either sold the owned properties to third parties or returned the leased properties to the lessors 
based on our experience to date and the relatively minor nature of the types of contamination we have identified to date  we believe that the future cost of necessary investigation or remediation on our current properties will not have a material adverse effect on our business  consolidated financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
we cannot be certain  however  that clean up standards will not become more stringent  or that we will not be required to undertake any remedial activities involving any material costs on any of these current or previously held properties in the future or that the discovery of unknown contamination or third party claims made with respect to current or previously owned or leased properties will not result in material costs 
our stock price may experience volatility 
our stock price  like that of other companies  can be volatile 
some of the factors that could affect our stock price are quarterly increases or decreases in revenue or earnings  changes in revenue or earnings estimates by the investment community  and speculation in the press or investment community about our financial condition or results of operations 
general market conditions and domestic or international economic factors unrelated to our performance may also affect our stock price 
for these reasons  investors should not rely on recent trends to predict future stock prices or financial results 
in addition  following periods of volatility in a company s securities  securities class action litigation against a company is sometimes instituted and has been previously brought against us 
this type of litigation could result in liability  substantial costs and the diversion of management time and resources 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets sfas 
sfas establishes the accounting standards for the recognition and measurement of an asset retirement obligation and its associated asset retirement cost 
sfas became effective for us on january  the adoption of this new standard did not have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations  cash flows or financial position 
in april  the fasb issued sfas  rescission of fasb statements   and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections sfas 
sfas updates  clarifies and simplifies existing accounting pronouncements 
provisions of sfas related to the rescission of statement became effective for us on january  the provisions of sfas related to sfas are effective for transactions occurring after may  we have adopted the provisions of the new standard  which had no material effect on our consolidated results of operations  cash flows or financial position 
in june  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas  which addresses accounting for restructuring and similar costs 
sfas supersedes previous accounting guidance  principally emerging issues task force issue eitf no 
we adopted the provision of sfas for restructuring activities initiated after december   which had no material effect on our financial statements 
sfas requires that the liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
under eitf no 
 a liability for an exit cost was recognized at the date of the commitment to an exit plan 
sfas also establishes that the liability should initially be measured and recorded at fair value 
accordingly  sfas may affect the timing of recognizing future restructuring costs as well as the amounts recognized 
in november  the eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
eitf addresses certain aspects of the accounting by a vendor for arrangements under which the vendor will perform multiple revenue generating activities 
eitf became effective for interim periods beginning after june  we have adopted the 
table of contents provisions of eitf  which did not have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations  cash flows or financial position 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  which clarifies disclosure and recognition measurement requirements related to certain guarantees 
the disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements issued after december  and the recognition measurement requirements are effective on a prospective basis for guarantees issued or modified after december  the adoption of the provisions of this interpretation did not have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations  cash flows or financial position 
in january  the fasb issued fin the primary objectives of fin are to provide guidance on the identification of entities for which control is achieved by means other than through voting rights and the determination of when and which business enterprise should consolidate the vie in its financial statements 
fin applies to an entity in which either the equity investors if any do not have a controlling financial interest or the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entity s activities without receiving additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
in addition  fin requires that both the primary beneficiary and all other enterprises with a significant variable interest in a vie make additional disclosures 
as revised  fin was effective immediately for vie s created after january  for special purposes entities created prior to february   fin is effective at the first interim or annual reporting period ending after december   or december  for us 
for entities  other than special purpose entities  created prior to february   fin is effective for us as of march  in addition  fin allows companies to elect to adopt early the provisions of fin for some  but not all  of the variable interest entities they own 
because we are still evaluating whether or not we will make any other potential changes in connection with our adoption of fin  we have not adopted the provisions of fin other than discussed below 
prior to july   we entered into five lease transactions that were recorded as a sale and leaseback of the compression equipment and were treated as operating leases for financial reporting purposes 
on july   we adopted the provisions of fin as they relate to the special purpose entities that lease compression equipment to us 
as a result of the adoption  we added approximately  million in compressor equipment assets  million of accumulated depreciation including approximately million of accumulated depreciation related to periods before the sale and leaseback of the equipment   million in debt and million in minority interest obligations to our balance sheet  and we reversed million of deferred gains that were recorded on our balance sheet as a result of the sale leaseback transactions 
on july   we recorded a million charge million net of tax to record the cumulative effect from the adoption of fin related to prior period depreciation of the compression equipment assets 
additionally  we estimate that we will record approximately million per year in additional depreciation expense on our leased compression equipment as a result of the inclusion of the compression equipment on our balance sheet and will also record the payments made under our compression equipment leases as interest expense 
in december  we exercised our purchase option under the compression equipment operating lease 
as of december   the remaining compression assets owned by the entities that lease equipment to us but are now included in property  plant and equipment in our consolidated financial statements had a net book value of approximately million  including improvements made to these assets after the sale leaseback transactions 
we have a consolidated subsidiary trust that has mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred securities outstanding that have a liquidation value of million 
these securities were previously reported on our balance sheet as mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred securities 
because we only have a limited ability to make decisions about its activities and we are not the primary beneficiary of the trust  the trust is a vie under fin as such  the mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred securities issued by the trust are no longer reported on our balance sheet 
instead  we now report our subordinated notes payable to the trust as a debt 
these intercompany notes have previously been 
table of contents eliminated in our consolidated financial statements 
the changes related to our mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred securities for our balance sheet are reclassifications and had no impact on our consolidated results of operations or cash flow 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
sfas amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement is effective for contracts entered into or modified after june  and for hedging relationships designated after june  all provisions of sfas will be applied prospectively 
we have adopted the provisions sfas  which did not have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations  cash flow or financial position 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity sfas 
sfas changes the accounting for certain financial instruments that  under previous guidance  issuers could account for as equity 
sfas requires that those instruments be classified as liabilities in statements of financial position 
sfas is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective for interim periods beginning after june  on november  the fasb issued staff position that delayed the effective date for certain types of financial instruments 
we do not believe the adoption of the guidance currently provided in sfas will have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations or cash flow 
however  we may be required to classify as debt approximately million in sale leaseback obligations that are currently reported as minority interest on our condensed consolidated balance sheet pursuant to fin see leasing transactions and accounting change for fin these minority interest obligations represent the equity of the entities that lease compression equipment to us 
in accordance with the provisions of our compression equipment lease obligations  the equity certificate holders are entitled to quarterly or semi annual yield payments on the aggregate outstanding equity certificates 
as of december   the yield rates on the outstanding equity certificates ranged from to 
equity certificate holders may receive a return of capital payment upon lease termination or our purchase of the leased compression equipment after full payment of all debt obligations of the entities that lease compression equipment to us 
at december   the carrying value of the minority interest obligations approximated the fair market value of assets that would be required to be transferred to redeem the minority interest obligations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate and foreign currency risk 
hanover and its subsidiaries periodically enter into interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates 
at december   the fair market value of our interest rate swaps  excluding the portion attributable to and included in accrued interest  was a liability of approximately million  of which million was recorded in accrued liabilities and million in other long term liabilities 
at december  we were party to three interest rate swaps to convert variable lease payments under certain lease arrangements to fixed payments as follows dollars in thousands fair value of the swap at company pays notional december  maturity date fixed rate amount at december   we were exposed to variable rental rates  which fluctuate with market interest rate  on a portion of the equipment leases we entered into in and assuming a hypothetical 
table of contents increase in the variable rates from those in effect at year end  the increase in annual interest expense on the equipment lease notes would be approximately million 
we are also exposed to interest rate risk on borrowings under our floating rate bank credit facility 
at december   million was outstanding bearing interest at a weighted average effective rate of per annum 
assuming a hypothetical increase in the weighted average interest rate from those in effect at december   the increase in annual interest expense for advances under this facility would be approximately million 
we have significant operations that expose us to currency risk in argentina and venezuela 
to mitigate that risk  the majority of our existing contracts provide that we receive payment in or based on us dollars rather than argentine pesos and venezuelan bolivars  thus reducing our exposure to fluctuations in the their value 
for the year ended december   our argentine operations represented approximately of our revenue and of our gross profit 
during the years ended december  and  we recorded an exchange gain of approximately million and an exchange loss of approximately million  respectively for assets exposed to currency translation in argentina 
in addition  during the years ended december  and  we recorded exchange losses of approximately million and million  respectively  for assets exposed to currency translation in venezuela and recorded translation losses of approximately million and million  respectively  for all other countries 
for the year ended december   our venezuelan operations represented approximately of our revenue and of our gross profit 
at december   we had approximately million in accounts receivable related to our venezuelan operations 
in february  the venezuelan government fixed the exchange rate to  bolivars for each us dollar 
in february  the government devalued the currency by approximately 
the impact of the devaluation on our results will depend upon the amount of our assets primarily working capital exposed to currency fluctuation in venezuela in future periods 
as of december   we had approximately million in net assets exposed to currency fluctuation in venezuela 
based on these assets  a change in exchange rates would result in a million gain or loss in venezuela 
the economic situation in argentina and venezuela is subject to change 
to the extent that the situation deteriorates  exchange controls continue in place and the value of the peso and bolivar against the dollar is reduced further  our results of operations in argentina and venezuela could be materially and adversely affected which could result in reductions in our net income 
during  we entered into forward exchange contracts with a notional value of million to mitigate the risk of changes in exchange rates between the euro and the us dollar 
these contracts mature during
