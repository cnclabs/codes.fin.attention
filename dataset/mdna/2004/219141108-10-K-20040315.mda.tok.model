the company s service capacity is comprised of the number of beds currently available for service or available upon the completion of construction or renovation of residential facilities and the average program capacity of non residential community based programs 
at certain facilities  the company s contracted capacity is lower than the facility s service capacity 
the company could increase a facility s contracted capacity to service capacity by obtaining additional contracts or by renegotiating its existing contracts 
however  there is no guarantee that the company will be able to obtain contracts that provide occupancy levels at a facility s service capacity or that the company s current contracted capacities can be maintained in future periods

additionally  certain facilities have and are currently operating above the company s contracted capacity 
as a result  average contract occupancy percentages can exceed if the average actual occupancy exceeded contracted capacity 
the average contract occupancy percentages reflected in the table would be lower if the percentages were calculated based on average actual occupancy for the period as a percentage of service capacity rather than contracted capacity 
occupancy percentages reflect less than normalized occupancy during the start up phase of any applicable facility  resulting in a lower average occupancy in periods when the company has substantial start up activities 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the company is a leading provider of correctional  treatment and educational services outsourced by federal  state and local government agencies 
the company provides a diversified portfolio of services for adults and juveniles through its three operating divisions adult secure institutional services  juvenile justice  educational and treatment services and adult community based corrections and treatment services 
at december   the company operated facilities with a total service capacity of  and had four facilities under development  construction or renovation with an aggregate service capacity of  upon completion 
the company s facilities are located in states and the district of columbia

additionally  certain facilities have and are currently operating above the company s contracted capacity 
as a result  average contract occupancy percentages can exceed if the average actual occupancy exceeded contracted capacity 
the average contract occupancy percentages reflected in the table would be lower if the percentages were calculated based on average actual occupancy for the period as a percentage of service capacity rather than contracted capacity 
occupancy percentages reflect less than normalized occupancy during the start up phase of any applicable facility  resulting in a lower average occupancy in periods when the company has substantial start up activities 
the company derives substantially all its revenues from providing adult corrections and treatment and juvenile justice  educational and treatment services outsourced by federal  state and local government agencies in the united states 
revenues for the company s services are generally recognized on a per diem rate based upon the number of occupant days or hours served for the period  on a guaranteed take or pay basis or on a cost plus reimbursement basis 
for the year ended december  the company s revenue base consisted of for services provided under per diem contracts  for services provided under take or pay and management contracts  for services provided under cost plus reimbursement contracts  for services provided under fee for service contracts and from other miscellaneous sources 
these percentages are generally consistent with comparable statistics for the years ended december  and revenues can fluctuate from year to year due to changes in government funding policies  changes in the number of clients referred to the company s facilities by governmental agencies  the opening of new facilities or the expansion of existing facilities and the termination of contracts for a facility or the closure of a facility 
revenues for the company s adult secure institutional services division are primarily generated from per diem  take or pay and management contracts 
for the years ended december   and  the company realized average per diem rates on its adult secure institutional facilities of approximately  and  respectively 
the decrease in the average per diem rate in as compared to is attributable to a reduction in the per diem rate at a large facility in the second half of as requested by the contracting agency the company mitigated a portion of this rate reduction by negotiating reductions in the level of service provided 
in the past year  the company has experienced increasing pressure from contracting governmental agencies to limit or even reduce per diem rates 
many of these governmental entities are under severe budget pressures and the company anticipates that more governmental agencies may approach the company about per diem rate concessions 
the company has implemented measures in hopes of protecting the company from rate decreases and assuring itself of attaining rate increases necessary to offset cost increases 
factors the company considers in determining billing rates to charge include the programs specified by the contract and the related staffing levels  wage levels customary in the respective geographic areas  whether the proposed facility is to be leased or purchased and the anticipated average occupancy levels that the company believes could reasonably be maintained 
revenues for the company s juvenile justice  educational and treatment services division are primarily generated from per diem  fee for service and cost plus reimbursement contracts 
for the years ended december   and  the company realized average per diem rates on its residential juvenile justice  educational and treatment facilities of approximately  and  respectively 
the decrease in the average per diem rate for as compared to is primarily attributable to the closure of the new morgan academy in the fourth quarter of for the years ended december   and  the company realized average rates for its non residential community based juvenile facilities programs  including rates that are limited by medicaid and other private insurance providers  of approximately  and  respectively 
the decrease in the average rate for as compared to is due to changes in the mix of the services provided by the company s various juvenile justice  educational and treatment programs and facilities 
additionally  the company did not receive per diem rate increases for its juvenile programs in pennsylvania in the company expects to receive per diem rate increases for these programs in the majority of the company s juvenile services contracts renew annually 
revenues for the company s adult community based corrections and treatment services division are primarily generated from per diem contracts and fee for service contracts 
for the years ended december   and  the company realized average per diem rates on its residential adult corrections and treatment facilities of approximately  and  respectively 
the decrease in the average per diem rate for as compared to is due to the termination of the santa barbara center contract in may and the inglewood men s center contract in june additionally the company experienced slight rate reductions at certain of its alaskan facilities resulting from contract renewals in for the years ended december   and  the company realized average fee for service rates on its non residential adult community based corrections and treatment facilities and programs of approximately  and  respectively 
the increase in the average rate for as compared to is due to changes in the mix of the services provided by the company s various adult community based programs and facilities 
the company has historically experienced higher operating margins in its adult secure institutional services and adult community based corrections and treatment services as compared to the juvenile justice  educational and treatment services division 
additionally  the company s operating margins within a division can vary from facility to facility based on whether a facility is owned or leased  the level of competition for the contract award  the proposed length of the contract  the occupancy levels for a facility  the level of capital commitment required with respect to a facility  the anticipated changes in operating costs over the term of the contract  and the company s ability to increase a facility s contract revenue 
a decline in occupancy of certain juvenile justice  educational and treatment facilities can have a more significant impact on operating results than the adult secure institutional services division due to higher per diem revenues at certain juvenile facilities 
the company has experienced and expects to continue to experience interim period operating margin fluctuations due to the number of calendar days in the period  higher payroll taxes in the first half of the year  and salary and wage increases and insurance cost increases that are incurred prior to certain contract rate increases 
additionally  a decrease in per diem rates could adversely affect the company s operating margin 
the company is responsible for all facility operating costs  except for certain debt service and interest or lease payments for facilities where the company has a management contract only 
for facilities that the company has a management contract only  the facility owner is responsible for all debt service and interest or lease payments related to the facility 
the company is responsible for all other operating expenses at these facilities 
the company operated facilities under management contracts at december  and december  and facilities at december  a majority of the company s facility operating costs consists of fixed costs 
these fixed costs include lease and rental expense  insurance  utilities and depreciation 
as a result  when the company commences operation of new or expanded facilities  fixed operating costs increase 
the amount of the company s variable operating costs  including food  medical services  supplies and clothing  depend on occupancy levels at the facilities operated by the company 
the company s largest single operating cost  facility payroll expense and related employment taxes and costs  has both a fixed and a variable component 
the company can adjust a facility s staffing levels and the related payroll expense to a certain extent based on occupancy at a facility  however a minimum fixed number of employees is required to operate and maintain any facility regardless of occupancy levels 
personnel costs are subject to increases in tightening labor markets based on local economic and other conditions 
the company incurs pre opening and start up expenses including payroll  benefits  training and other operating costs prior to opening a new or expanded facility and during the period of operation while occupancy is ramping up 
these costs vary by contract 
since pre opening and start up costs are generally factored into the revenue per diem rate that is charged to the contracting agency  the company typically expects to recover these upfront costs over the life of the contract 
because occupancy rates during a facility s start up phase typically result in capacity under utilization for at least to days  the company may incur additional post opening start up costs 
the company does not anticipate post opening start up costs at facilities operated under any future contracts with the bop because these contracts are currently and expected to continue to be take or pay contracts  meaning that the bop will pay the company at least of the contractual monthly revenue once the facility opens regardless of actual occupancy 
newly opened facilities are staffed according to applicable regulatory or contractual requirements when the company begins receiving offenders or clients 
offenders or clients are typically assigned to a newly opened facility on a phased in basis over a one to six month period 
the company s start up period for new juvenile operations is months from the date the company begins recognizing revenue unless break even occupancy levels are achieved before then 
the company s start up period for new adult operations is nine months from the date the company begins recognizing revenue unless break even occupancy levels are achieved before then 
although the company typically recovers these upfront costs over the life of the contract  quarterly results can be substantially affected by the timing of the commencement of operations as well as the development and construction of new facilities 
working capital requirements generally increase immediately prior to the company s commencing management of a new or expanded facility as the company incurs start up costs and purchases necessary equipment and supplies before facility management revenue is realized 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of costs for the company s corporate and administrative personnel who provide senior management  legal  finance  accounting  human resources  payroll and information systems  costs of business development and outside professional and consulting fees 
management overview demand 
the company s business is driven generally by demand for incarceration or treatment services  and specifically by demand for private incarceration or treatment services  within its three primary business segments adult secure institutional services  juvenile justice  educational and treatment services  and adult community based corrections and treatment services 
the demand for adult and juvenile corrections and treatment services has generally increased at a steady rate over the past ten years  largely as a result of increasingly long sentences and or mandatory sentences for criminals  increasing demand for incarceration of illegal aliens and a public recognition of the need to provide services to juveniles that will improve the possibility that they will lead productive lives 
recent suggestions by social commentators and various political or governmental representatives suggest that community based corrections of adults may be emphasized in the future as alternatives to traditional incarceration 
among other things  the company s management monitors federal  state and industry statistics relative to trends in prison populations  juvenile justice statistics and initiatives  and developments in alternatives to traditional incarceration or detention of adults 
demand for private provision of the services within the company s three business segments has not  on a capacity basis  precisely mirrored the increase in general demand because the federal  state and local governmental provide services which satisfy a portion of the demand 
the federal government increasingly is turning to private providers for the incarceration of adults whether they are serving prison sentences  detained as illegal aliens  detained in anticipation of pending judicial administration or transitioning from prison to society 
chief among the federal agencies which use private providers are the bop  the bureau of immigration  customs and enforcement  and the us marshals service 
most of the federal involvement in juvenile administration in the federal system is handled via medicare and medicaid assistance to state governments 
although there are circumstances in which the company may contract with a federal agency on a sole source basis  the primary means by which the company secures a contract with a federal agency is via the rfp bidding process 
from time to time  the company contracts to provide management services to a local governmental unit who then bids on a federal contract 
states and smaller governmental units are divided on the issue of private prisons and private provision of juvenile and community based programs 
a majority of states permit private provision of the company s services 
the company anticipates that increasing budget pressure on states and smaller governmental units will lead to more states and smaller governmental units looking for services from private providers such as the company 
although it varies from governmental unit to governmental unit  the primary political forces who oppose privatization of prisons is organized labor and religious groups 
private juvenile and community based programs are much more widely accepted and utilized by states and local governmental units than adult prisons 
many private providers are organized on a not for profit basis  but there a number of large  for profit providers  such as the company  of juvenile and community based programs 
the company s management monitors opportunities in these segments via its corporate and regional development officials 
many of these opportunities are not published in any manner and  accordingly  the company views a local initiative as being key 
performance 
management tracks a number of factors as it monitors the company s financial performance 
chief among them are capacity the number of beds within each business segment s facilities  occupancy utilization  per diem reimbursement rates  and operating expenses 
the company s capacity  commonly expressed in terms of a number of beds  is primarily impacted by the number and size of the facilities owned or leased by the company and the facilities which are not owned or leased by the company but which are managed by the company on behalf of a third party owner or lessee 
management views capacity primarily as a measure of its development efforts  which may increase capacity by adding new projects or adding to existing projects 
the company has a number of projects in development which it expects to be placed into service in and as part of measuring its development efforts  management will assess a whether a given development project was brought into service in accordance with management s expectation as to time and expense  and b the number of projects in development at the relevant point in time 
in addition to the focus on new projects  capacity will reflect management s success in renewing and maintaining existing contracts and facilities 
recently  the company has been confronted with the possibility that state or local budgetary limitations may cause the contractual commitment to a given facility to be reduced or even eliminated  which would cause the company to secure alternate customers or close the operation and ultimately be reflected as a decrease in capacity 
occupancy is typically expressed by the company in terms of percentage of capacity utilized 
management looks at occupancy to assess the efficacy of both its efforts to market its facilities and its efforts to retain existing customers or contracts 
because revenue varies directly with occupancy  occupancy is a driver of the company s revenues 
some of the company s contracts are take or pay  meaning that the agency making use of the facility is obligated to pay for beds even though they are not used 
historically  the company s occupancy has been very high and management is mindful of the need to maintain high occupancy levels 
as new development projects are brought into service  occupancy percentages may decline until the projects reach full utilization 
where the company has commitments for utilization before the commencement of operations  occupancy reflects the speed at which the company achieves full service implementation 
however  the company has undertaken five development projects without written commitments to make full use of a facility 
in these instances  the company has performed its own assessment  based on conversations with local government representatives and other factors  of the demand for services at the facility 
the company will monitor occupancy as a measure of the accuracy of management s estimation of the demand for the services of a development facility 
per diem reimbursement rates are the other key element of the company s gross revenue and operating margin 
per diem rates are a function of negotiation between the company and a governmental unit at the inception of a contract or through the rfp process 
actual per diem rates vary dramatically across the company s business segments  and then within each business segment depending upon the particular service or program provided 
the initial per diem rates often change during the term of a contract in accordance with a schedule 
the amount of the change can be a fixed amount set forth within the contract  an amount determined by formulas set forth within the contract or an amount determined by negotiations between the company and the governmental unit often these negotiations are along the same lines as the original per diem negotiation a review of the company s expenses and approval of an amount to recompense the company for expenses and assure the company the potential of an operating profit 
in recent years  as budgetary pressures on governmental units have increased  some of the governmental units who are parties to agreements with the company have negotiated relief from formulaic increase provisions within their agreements or have declined to include in their appropriation legislation amounts that would increase the per diem rates payable to the company needed by the company in some cases to offset operating expense increases 
although the company has mitigated a portion of the impact of these developments  it has taken steps primarily in the area of legislative and governmental monitoring and lobbying  to avoid these sorts of adverse developments in the future 
the company will continue to monitor per diem rates as a measure of negotiation skill  customer service  management and maintenance  political and business astuteness 
management tracks several different areas of its operating expenses 
foremost among these expenses are employee compensation and benefits and expenses  risk related areas such as general liability  medical and worker s compensation  client inmate costs such as food  clothing and programming costs  costs of financing and administrative overhead expenses such as travel 
increases or decreases in one or more of these items  such as the company s recent experience with rising insurance costs  can have a material effect on the company s performance 
management is particularly monitoring the costs of complying with the sarbanes oxley act of  both in terms of fees paid to third parties  such as independent auditors and consultants  and internal administrative costs 
management of the company recognizes that its operating margins are subject to pressure from a variety of factors  but most notably rising costs and governmental and agency budgetary constraints 
management also believes that successful development is key to mitigating such pressure 
the company has several development projects committed and in various stages of completion 
until those projects are completed and brought into service  management will monitor operations and existing customer relationships in an attempt to protect operating margins 
significant events the company has not been able to develop a use for the operation of the new morgan academy since the termination of its last program in the fourth quarter of the company has recognized pre tax costs of approximately million in its consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss in for related holding costs depreciation  interest  property taxes and other maintenance costs

in september  the company entered into negotiations with the state of south dakota to the lease the former state training school in plankinton  south dakota to operate a bed juvenile justice center  the plankinton regional detention center  and a bed residential juvenile treatment center  the plankinton regional treatment center 
the company will make some minor renovations to the facilities at an estimated cost of approximately  as of december   the company had not finalized the lease agreements or obtained contracts for services at the facilities 
however  management believes there is demand for the company s services to be provided at these facilities and anticipates operating the detention center in april and the treatment center in august the company closed the new morgan academy in the fourth quarter of and is currently considering several options ranging from the sale or lease of the facility to the utilization of the facility for another type of program 
as of december   management of the company was focusing its efforts on reactivating the facility 
the primary use currently under consideration is using the facility to house illegal non criminal adult detainees or to house non criminal juvenile aliens 
management is discussing these opportunities with the bureau of immigration and customs enforcement bice  who has indicated a level of interest but necessary budget appropriations have not been made and the parties have not progressed to contract phase 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in securing a contract with bice 
further  before the company could house adult detainees  the company will likely need to obtain a change in the zoning of the academy  which is currently zoned only for the housing of juveniles 
there can be no assurances that the company will be able to secure the contemplated zoning change or to do so on terms favorable to the company 
management of the company believes that there is a market for the services the company could provide at per diem rates that will support the recovery of the cost structure of the facility 
however  the company will continue to evaluate any offers to buy or lease the facility 
the company is maintaining a small staff to secure and maintain the facility while the company considers its options for the use or sale of the facility 
the company expects to incur operating expenses of approximately  per month for payroll  property taxes and other operating costs until the facility is utilized for an alternative program or until the facility is sold 
additionally  the company is incurring interest expense of approximately  per month related to the borrowings for the facility and depreciation expense of approximately  per month for the building 
the carrying value of the property and equipment at the new morgan academy was approximately million at december  management performed a probability weighted recoverability analysis and believes that  based on its analysis  the long lived assets at the new morgan academy are recoverable from the range of alternative courses of action currently available to the company 
accordingly  pursuant to the provisions of sfas no 
 an impairment allowance is not deemed necessary as of december  however  management estimates that  were the company to sell the facility  it is reasonably possible that the company would not be able to fully recover the carrying value of its long lived assets for this facility 
in march  the company reached an agreement with the commonwealth of pennsylvania that resolved all outstanding administrative issues relative to the contract awarded to the company by the bop to operate the moshannon valley correctional center 
in october  the company received final approval from the bop of a revised building design for moshannon valley correctional center 
construction plans are being developed for the new design and work is expected to begin in the second quarter of in the interim  the company is negotiating a contract amendment with the bop to accommodate the revised facility design and update the contract for changes since it was originally signed 
if and when an amendment to the contract with the bop is successfully negotiated  this agreement would allow the company to move forward with the construction and operation of the facility 
as of december   the company had incurred approximately million for design  construction and land development costs and capitalized interest related to the moshannon valley correctional center contract 
the company is in the process of submitting a claim to the bop for reimbursement of costs related to the original construction efforts incurred beginning in the company estimates an additional capital investment of approximately million to complete construction of the facility 
financing of the facility is subject to re approval of the project by the lenders under the company s amended credit facility and agreement by such lenders to amend certain financial covenants and provisions of the amended credit facility 
in the event the company s lenders are unwilling to re approve the project or to adopt the necessary amendments  or if the company s cash and current financing arrangements do not provide sufficient financing to fund construction costs related to the project  the company anticipates needing to obtain additional sources of financing 
according to the bop contract  as amended  the company was required to complete the construction of the project by january  the company did not complete construction by that date and anticipates obtaining another long term contract amendment from the bop extending the construction deadline 
in the event the company is not able to negotiate a contract amendment with the bop  then the bop may have the right to assert that the company has not completed construction of the facility within the time frame provided in the bop contract  as amended 
management expects that the contract will be amended to address cost and construction timing matters resulting from the extended delay 
in the event that the bop decides not to continue with the construction of the moshannon valley correctional center and terminates the contract  management believes that the company has the right to and will recover its invested costs 
in the event any portion of these costs are determined not to be recoverable upon contract termination by the bop  the company will expense that portion of costs that cannot be capitalized with respect to the company s remaining real property interest 
separate from a possible recovery in the event that the bop terminates the moshannon valley contract  the company is pursuing a claim for reimbursement of a portion of its expenses incurred in connection with the issuance of the stop work order and the delay of the project included among these expenses is approximately million in accounts receivable for expenses incurred by the company after the june issuance of the stop work order 
this reimbursement claim is independent of the amendment to the contract ie  if the bop agrees to an amendment of the contract  the company will still pursue its claim and the company is currently negotiating this claim with the bop 
the bop has asserted that it is only responsible for reimbursing a portion of these costs that portion of the investment lost due to the issuance of the stop work order 
although the company believes that the bop will reimburse substantially more than the million account receivable  it is uncertain how much the bop will agree to pay in connection with the company s claim for reimbursement 
any amounts not reimbursed by the bop will be included in the construction costs for the moshannon valley project

the annual repurchase of shares is limited to million  and an aggregate limit of million  under the amended credit facility 
under the current aggregate limitation under the amended credit facility  as of december  the company can purchase additional shares of treasury stock valued at approximately million 
future liquidity 
management believes that the company s existing cash and cash equivalents and the cash flows generated from operations  together with the revolving credit available under the amended credit facility  and the synthetic lease financing capacity thereunder  will provide sufficient liquidity to meet the company s committed capital and working capital requirements for currently awarded and certain potential future contracts 
to the extent the company s cash and current financing arrangements do not provide sufficient financing to fund construction costs related to future adult secure institutional contract awards or significant facility expansions  the company anticipates obtaining additional sources of financing to fund such activities 
management is in the process of negotiating terms for a new senior credit facility to refinance the amended credit facility which matures in july additionally  management is pursuing other sources of debt financing to fund a portion of the construction costs for the moshannon valley correctional center 
however  there can be no assurance that such financing will be available  or will be available on terms favorable to the company

inflation other than personnel  offender medical costs at certain facilities and employee medical and worker s compensation insurance costs  management believes that inflation has not had a material effect on the company s results of operations during the past three years 
most of the company s facility management contracts provide for payments to the company of either fixed per diem fees or per diem fees that increase by only small amounts during the term of the contracts 
inflation could substantially increase the company s personnel costs the largest component of operating expenses  medical and insurance costs or other operating expenses at rates faster than any increases in contract revenues

in addition  the company disclaims any obligation to update any forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this report 
with this in mind  you should consider the risks discussed elsewhere in this report and other documents the company files with the commission from time to time and the following important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statement made by the company or on its behalf 
public resistance to privatization of correctional and detention facilities could result in the company s inability to obtain new contracts or the loss of existing contracts 
management of correctional and detention facilities by private entities has not achieved complete acceptance by either the government or the public 
the movement toward privatization of correctional and detention facilities has also encountered resistance from certain groups  such as labor unions  local sheriff s departments  and groups believing that correctional and detention facility operations should only be conducted by government agencies 
changes in the dominant political party in any market in which correctional facilities are located could have an adverse impact on privatization 
further  some government agencies are not legally permitted to delegate their traditional management responsibilities for correctional and detention facilities to private companies 
any of these resistances may make it more difficult for the company to renew or maintain existing contracts  to obtain new contracts or sites on which to operate new facilities or to develop or purchase facilities and lease them to government or private entities  any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
the company is subject to the short term nature of government contracts 
many governmental agencies are legally limited in their ability to enter into long term contracts that would bind elected officials responsible for future budgets 
therefore  many contracts with government agencies typically either have a very short term or are subject to termination on short notice without cause 
in addition  the company s contracts with government agencies may contain one or more renewal options that may be exercised only by the contracting government agency 
no assurance can be given that any agency will exercise a renewal option in the future 
the non renewal or termination of any of the company s significant contracts with government agencies could materially adversely affect the company s financial condition  results of operation and liquidity  including its ability to secure new facility management contracts from others 
the company is dependent on government appropriations 
if government appropriation levels are reduced  the company s business may be harmed 
the company s cash flow is subject to the receipt of sufficient funding of and timely payment by contracting government entities 
if the appropriate government agency does not receive sufficient appropriations to cover its contractual obligations  a contract may be terminated or the amounts payable to the company may be deferred or reduced 
any delays in payment  or the termination of a significant contract  could have an adverse effect on the company s cash flow and financial condition 
moreover  as a result of the slowing economy  federal  state and local governments may encounter unusual budgetary constraints and there is a risk that spending on outsourced services provided by the company may be curtailed 
the company has experienced both rate reductions and rescission of scheduled rate increases at the hands of several state and local governments 
the company has implemented measures to protect itself from such occurrences in the future  but there is no assurance that such steps will be completely successful 
the company may not be successful in meeting the requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of the sarbanes oxley act of has introduced many new requirements applicable to the company regarding corporate governance and financial reporting 
among many other requirements is the requirement under section of the act  beginning with the annual report for management to report on the company s internal controls over financial reporting and for the company s registered public accountant to attest to this report 
during  the company commenced actions to ensure its ability to comply with these requirements  including but not limited to  the engaging of outside experts to assist in the evaluation of our controls  additional staffing requirements of our internal audit department and documentation of existing controls 
in addition  the company expects to continue to devote substantial time and incur substantial costs during to ensure compliance 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in complying with section failure to do so could result in the loss of customers  penalties and additional expenditures to meet the requirements 
the company s ability to win new contracts to develop and manage correctional  detention and treatment facilities depends on many factors outside its control 
the company s growth is generally dependent upon its ability to win new contracts to develop and manage new correctional  detention and treatment facilities 
this depends on a number of factors the company cannot control  including crime rates and sentencing patterns in various jurisdictions 
accordingly  the demand for the company s facilities could be adversely affected by the relaxation of enforcement efforts  leniency in conviction and sentencing practices or through the legal decriminalization of certain activities that are currently proscribed by criminal laws 
for instance  any changes with respect to drugs and controlled substances or illegal immigration could affect the number of persons arrested  convicted and sentenced  thereby potentially reducing demand for correctional facilities to house them 
similarly  reductions in crime rates could lead to reductions in arrests  convictions and sentences requiring correctional facilities 
the bureau of justice statistics reports that the level of violent crime in the united states has declined steadily since and the level of property crime is at the lowest level since however  the number of detained offenders has grown steadily during that period 
while the company believes that governments will continue to privatize correctional  detention and treatment facilities  the company believes the rate of growth experienced in the state private corrections industry during the late s and early s is moderating 
certain jurisdictions recently have required successful bidders to make a significant capital investment in connection with the financing of a particular project  a trend that could require the company to have sufficient capital resources to compete effectively 
the company may not be able to obtain these capital resources when needed 
additionally  the company s success in obtaining new awards and contracts may depend  in part  upon its ability to locate land that can be leased or acquired under favorable terms 
otherwise desirable locations may be in or near populated areas and  therefore  may generate legal action or other forms of opposition from residents in areas surrounding a proposed site 
the company is currently negotiating a contract amendment with the bop related to the moshannon valley correctional center 
if the company is unable to successfully negotiate the amendment with the bop or if the company is unable to obtain the re approval of the project by the lenders under the company s amended credit facility  the company will be unable to move forward with the construction and operation of the facility 
the company s profitability may suffer if the number of offenders occupying its correctional  detention and treatment facilities decreases 
the company s correctional  detention and treatment facilities are dependent upon government agencies supplying offenders 
a substantial portion of the company s revenues is generated under contracts that specify a net rate per day per resident  or a per diem rate  sometimes with no minimum guaranteed occupancy levels  even though most correctional facility cost structures are relatively fixed 
under such a per diem rate structure  a decrease in occupancy levels at a particular facility could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition and results of operations at such facility 
a failure to comply with existing regulations could result in material penalties or non renewal or termination of the company s contracts to manage correctional  detention and treatment facilities 
the company s industry is subject to a variety of federal  state and local regulations  including education  health care and safety regulations  which are administered by various regulatory authorities 
the company may not always successfully comply with these regulations  and failure to comply could result in material penalties or non renewal or termination of facility management contracts 
the contracts typically include extensive reporting requirements and supervision and on site monitoring by representatives of contracting government agencies 
corrections officers are customarily required to meet certain training standards  and in some instances facility personnel are required to be licensed and subject to background investigation 
certain jurisdictions also require the subcontracts to be awarded on a competitive basis or to subcontract with businesses owned by members of minority groups 
the company s facilities are also subject to operational and financial audits by the governmental agencies with which the company has contracts 
the failure to comply with any applicable laws  rules or regulations and the loss of any required license could adversely affect the financial condition and results of operations at the company s affected facilities 
government agencies may investigate and audit the company s contracts and  if any improprieties are found  the company may be required to refund revenues it has received  to forego anticipated revenues and may be subject to penalties and sanctions  including prohibitions on the company s bidding in response to requests for proposals  or rfps 
certain of the government agencies the company contracts with have the authority to audit and investigate the company s contracts with them 
as part of that process  the government agency reviews the company s performance on the contract  its pricing practices  its cost structure and its compliance with applicable laws  regulations and standards 
if the agency determines that the company has improperly allocated costs to a specific contract  the company may not be reimbursed for those costs and the company could be required to refund the amount of any such costs that have been reimbursed 
if a government audit uncovers improper or illegal activities by the company or the company otherwise determines that these activities have occurred  the company may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions  including termination of contracts  forfeitures of profits  suspension of payments  fines and suspension or disqualification from doing business with the government 
any adverse determination could adversely impact the company s ability to bid in response to rfps in one or more jurisdictions 
if the company fails to satisfy its contractual obligations  the company s ability to compete for future contracts and its financial condition may be adversely affected 
the company s failure to comply with contract requirements or to meet its client s performance expectations when performing a contract could materially and adversely affect the company s financial performance and its reputation  which  in turn  would impact the company s ability to compete for new contracts 
the company s failure to meet contractual obligations could also result in substantial actual and consequential damages 
in addition  the company s contracts often require it to indemnify clients for the company s failure to meet performance standards 
some of the company s contracts contain liquidated damages provisions and financial penalties related to performance failures 
although the company has liability insurance  the policy limits may not be adequate to provide protection against all potential liabilities 
new competitors in the company s industry may adversely affect the profitability of the company s business 
the company must compete on the basis of cost  quality and range of services offered  experience in managing facilities  reputation of personnel and ability to design  finance and construct new facilities on a cost effective competitive basis 
while there are barriers for companies seeking to enter into the management and operation of correctional  detention and treatment facilities  there can be no assurance that these barriers will be sufficient to limit additional competition 
a disturbance in one of the company s facilities could result in closure of a facility or harm to the company s business 
an escape  riot or other disturbance at one of the company s facilities could adversely effect the financial condition  results of operations and liquidity of the company s operations 
among other things  the adverse publicity generated as a result of an event could adversely affect the company s ability to retain an existing contract or obtain future ones 
in addition  if such an event were to occur  there is a possibility that the facility where the event occurred may be shut down by the relevant governmental agency 
a closure of certain of the company s facilities could adversely affect the financial condition  results of operations and liquidity of the company s operations 
inaccurate  misleading or negative media coverage could adversely affect the company s reputation and its ability to bid for government contracts 
the media frequently focuses its attention on private operators contracts with government agencies 
if the media coverage is negative  it could influence government officials to slow the pace of outsourcing government services  which could reduce the number of rfps 
the media may also focus its attention on the activities of political consultants engaged by the company  even when their activities are unrelated to the company s business  and the company may be tainted by adverse media coverage about their activities 
moreover  inaccurate  misleading or negative media coverage about the company could harm its reputation and  accordingly  its ability to bid for and win government contracts 
the company may incur significant costs before receiving related revenues  which could result in cash shortfalls 
when the company is awarded a contract to manage a government program  it may incur significant expenses before the company receives contract payments 
these expenses include leasing office space  purchasing office equipment and hiring and training personnel 
as a result  in certain large contracts where the government does not fund program pre opening and start up costs  the company may be required to invest significant sums of money before receiving related contract payments 
in addition  payments due to the company from government agencies may be delayed due to billing cycles or as a result of failures to approve governmental budgets and finalize contracts in a timely manner 
several of the company s contracts provide for annual collection several months after a school year is completed 
the company may be unable to attract and retain sufficient qualified personnel necessary to sustain its business 
the company s delivery of services is labor intensive 
when the company is awarded a government contract  the company must hire operating management  security  case management and other personnel 
the success of the company s business requires that the company attract  develop  motivate and retain these personnel 
the company s inability to hire sufficient personnel on a timely basis or the loss of significant numbers of personnel could adversely affect its business 
unsuccessful financing or acquisition projects may result in charges to expense for deferred costs 
if the company determines that one or more financing or acquisition projects is unlikely to be successfully concluded  the company could incur significant charges to expense for deferred costs associated with such projects 
failure to obtain additional capital in the future could reduce the company s ability to grow 
the company believes that existing cash and cash equivalents and the cash flows generated from operations  together with the company s revolving credit available under the amended credit facility  and the lease capacity thereunder  will be adequate to fund the company s operating plans for the foreseeable future 
however  the company may need additional debt or equity financing in order to carry out its growth strategy 
to the extent that the company requires additional financing in the future and is unable to obtain such additional financing on satisfactory terms  if at all  it may not be able to fully implement its growth strategy 
if the company does not successfully integrate the businesses that it acquires  the company s results of operations could be adversely affected 
the company may be unable to manage businesses that it may acquire profitably or integrate them successfully without incurring substantial expenses  delays or other problems that could negatively impact the company s results of operations 
moreover  business combinations involve additional risks  including diversion of management s attention  loss of key personnel  assumption of unanticipated legal or financial liabilities  the company s becoming significantly leveraged as a result of the incurrence of debt to finance an acquisition  unanticipated operating  accounting or management difficulties in connection with the acquired entities  amortization or charges of acquired intangible assets  including goodwill  and dilution to the company s earnings per share 
also  client dissatisfaction or performance problems with an acquired business could materially and adversely affect the company s reputation as a whole 
further  the acquired businesses may not achieve the revenues and earnings the company anticipated 
because federal environmental laws impose strict as well as joint and several liability for clean up costs  unforeseen environmental risks could prove to be costly 
the company s facilities may be subject to unforeseen environmental risks 
the federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act  as amended  or cercla  imposes strict  as well as joint and several  liability for certain environmental cleanup costs on several classes of potentially responsible parties  including current owners and operators of the property and  in some cases  lenders who did not cause or contribute to the contamination 
furthermore  liability under cercla is not limited to the original or unamortized principal balance of a loan or to the value of the property securing a loan 
other federal and state laws in certain circumstances may impose liability for environmental remediation  which costs may be substantial 
moreover  certain federal statutes and certain states by statute impose a lien for any cleanup costs incurred by such state on the property that is the subject of such cleanup costs 
all subsequent liens on such property generally are subordinated to such an environmental lien and  in some states  even prior recorded liens are subordinated to environmental liens 
the company is the subject of class action lawsuits that  if decided against it  could have a negative effect on its financial condition  results of operations  cash flows and future prospects 
in march and april  the company  the company s former president and chief executive officer and the company s chief financial officer were named as defendants in four federal putative class action lawsuits 
these lawsuits were brought on behalf of all purchasers of the company s common stock between march  and march  and relate to the company s restatement in of certain financial statements 
the lawsuits involved disclosures made concerning two prior transactions executed by the company the august sale leaseback transaction and the synthetic lease transaction 
these four lawsuits were consolidated into one action and an amended consolidated complaint was filed 
the amended consolidated complaint seeks  among other things  restitution damages  compensatory damages  rescission or a rescissory measure of damages  costs  expenses  attorneys fees and expert fees 
in may and june  the company and its directors were sued in certain other derivative lawsuits 
these lawsuits relate to the company s restatement in of certain financial statements 
these lawsuits all allege breaches of fiduciary duty and waste of corporate assets by all of the defendants 
the plaintiffs in these cases have not quantified their claim of damages and the outcome of the matters discussed above cannot be predicted with certainty 
certain insurance policies held by the company to cover potential director and officer liability may limit the company s cash outflows in the event of a decision adverse to the company in the matters discussed above 
however  if an adverse decision in these matters exceeds the insurance coverage or if the insurance coverage is deemed not to apply to these matters  an adverse decision to the company in these matters could have a material adverse effect on the company  its financial condition  its results of operations and its future prospects 
the company is the subject of a securities and exchange commission investigation that could have a negative effect on the company if adversely determined 
following the restatement of the company s financial statements in  the sec initiated an investigation into the circumstances leading to this restatement 
following the sec s initial inquiry in the sec made no further inquiry with respect to the investigation until july since july  the company has received additional information requests from the sec 
the company has cooperated  and intends to continue to fully cooperate  with the sec s investigation 
depending on the scope  timing and result of the sec investigation  management s attention and the company s resources could be diverted from operations  which could adversely affect the company s operating results and contribute to future stock price volatility 
the sec investigation could also require that the company take other actions not currently contemplated 
in addition  the sec investigation or its outcome may increase the costs of defending or resolving current litigation 
the sec has not given the company any indication as to the outcome of its investigation 
if the sec makes a determination adverse to the company  the company and its officers and directors may face penalties  including  but not limited to  monetary fines and injunctive relief 
in addition  in the event of an adverse determination by the sec against the company or its officers or directors  federal and or state agencies may be reluctant to enter into or prohibited from entering into contracts for the company s services 
any such reaction from the company s customer base could have a material adverse effect on its business 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  the company is exposed to market risk  primarily from changes in interest rates 
the company continually monitors exposure to market risk and develops appropriate strategies to manage this risk 
the company is not exposed to any other significant market risks  including commodity price risk  foreign currency exchange risk or interest rate risks from the use of derivative financial instruments 
management does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or to speculate on changes in interest rates or commodity prices 
interest rate exposure the company s exposure to changes in interest rates primarily results from its long term debt with both fixed and floating interest rates 
the debt on the company s consolidated financial statements with fixed interest rates consists of the bonds issued by mcf in august in connection with the sale and leaseback transaction 
at december   approximately approximately million of debt outstanding to the synthetic lease investor notes a and b and million outstanding on the company s amended credit facility of the company s consolidated long term debt was subject to variable interest rates
