item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of the partnership s financial condition and results of operations are based on its consolidated financial statements  which were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes of the partnership listed in the index to consolidated financial statements on page f of this report 
business overview the partnership provides services to its customers and creates value for its unitholders primarily through the following activities interstate transportation of crude oil and liquid petroleum  gathering  treating  processing and transmission of raw natural gas  interstate and intrastate transmission of natural gas  and providing supply  transmission and sales service  including purchasing and selling natural gas 
the partnership primarily provides fee based services to customers to minimize commodity price risks 
however  in the partnership s natural gas businesses  a portion of its earnings and cash flows are exposed to movements in the prices of natural gas and ngls 
to substantially mitigate this exposure  the partnership enters into hedge transactions 
the partnership conducts its business through four business segments liquids transportation  gathering and processing  natural gas transportation and marketing 
these segments are strategic business units established by senior management to facilitate the achievement of the partnership s long term objectives  to aid in resource allocation decisions and to assess operational performance 
liquids transportation liquids transportation includes the operations of the lakehead and north dakota systems 
the lakehead and north dakota systems largely consist of ferc regulated interstate crude oil and liquid petroleum pipelines 
these systems generate most of their revenues by charging shippers a per barrel tariff rate to transport crude oil and liquid petroleum 
the lakehead system links crude oil production from western canada to markets in the great lakes and midwest regions of the united states and the province of ontario  canada 
western canadian crude oil production comes from two sources  conventional drilling and oil sands extraction projects 
currently  conventional drilling produces the majority of the supply  however  with the number of new oil sands construction projects in progress  this stable source of supply is expected to increase significantly over the next ten years 
deliveries on the north dakota system are impacted by the willingness of crude oil producers to maintain their crude oil production and exploration activities in north dakota  montana and the province of saskatchewan  canada 
similar to the lakehead system  the north dakota system depends upon demand for crude oil in the great lakes and midwest regions of the united states 
gathering and processing gathering and processing includes the east texas system  acquired on november   the northeast texas system  the south texas system and certain other assets of the midcoast system  all of which were acquired from the general partner in october  and the north texas system  acquired on december  collectively  these systems include natural gas gathering and transmission pipelines  nine active natural gas treating plants and twelve active natural gas processing plants 
the midcoast system assets acquired also include trucks  trailers and rail cars used for transporting ngls  crude oil and carbon dioxide 
the gathering and processing assets are largely located in the mid continent and gulf coast regions of the united states 
the partnership receives revenues for its gathering and processing services under the following types of arrangements fee based arrangements under a fee based contract  the partnership receives a set fee for gathering  treating  processing and transmission of raw natural gas and providing other gathering services 
these revenues correlate with volumes and types of service  and do not depend directly on commodity prices 
the partnership prefers fee based contracts because they produce relatively stable cash flows 
other arrangements while the partnership prefers fee based contracts  it also utilizes other types of arrangements in its natural gas gathering and processing business  including percentage of index contracts under these contracts  the partnership purchases raw natural gas at a negotiated discount to an agreed upon index 
the partnership then resells the natural gas  generally for the index price  keeping the difference as its fee 
percentage of proceeds contracts under these contracts  the partnership receives a negotiated percentage of the natural gas it processes in the form of residue natural gas  ngls and sulfur  which it then sells at market prices 
keep whole contracts under these contracts  the partnership gathers or purchases raw natural gas from the producer for processing 
a portion of the gathered or purchased gas is consumed during processing 
the partnership extracts and retains the ngls produced during processing  which it sells at market prices 
in instances when the partnership purchases raw gas at the wellhead  it also sells for its own account at market prices the residue gas resulting from processing 
in those instances where the partnership gathers and processes raw natural gas for the account of the producer  it must return to the producer residue gas with a british thermal unit content equivalent to the original raw gas it received 
some of these arrangements expose the partnership to commodity price risk  which is mitigated by offsetting physical purchases and sales and the use of financial derivative instruments 
in addition  the partnership occasionally takes title to natural gas and ngls for other reasons  such as to sell these products to customers 
the partnership will continue to hedge a significant amount of this commodity price risk to support the stability of cash flows

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk for more information 
natural gas transportation natural gas transportation consists of four ferc regulated natural gas transmission pipeline systems and intrastate natural gas transmission and wholesale customer pipeline systems located in the mid continent and gulf coast regions of the united states 
these pipeline systems form part of the midcoast system assets that were acquired from the general partner in october the partnership s ferc regulated interstate natural gas transmission pipeline systems generally derive their revenue from capacity reservation fees charged for transmission of natural gas  while its intrastate pipelines generally derive their revenue from the bundled sales of natural gas and from transmission services 
customers of the partnership s ferc regulated natural gas pipeline systems typically pay a reservation fee each month to reserve capacity plus a nominal commodity charge based on actual transmission volumes 
in some cases  the partnership s marketing operation uses the capacity on these pipeline systems to sell natural gas it owns to its customers  such as local distribution companies or industrial facilities 
marketing the partnership s marketing segment provides supply  transmission and sales service for producers and wholesale customers on its gathering  transmission and customer pipelines as well as other interconnected pipeline systems 
marketing activities are primarily undertaken to realize incremental margins on gas purchased at the wellhead  increase pipeline utilization and provide value added services to customers 
in general  natural gas purchased and sold by the marketing segment is priced at a published daily or monthly price index 
sales to wholesale customers typically incorporate a premium for managing their transmission and balancing requirements 
higher premiums and associated margins result from transactions that involve smaller volumes or that offer greater service flexibility for wholesale customers 
at their request  the partnership will enter into long term fixed price purchase or sales contracts with its customers and generally will enter into offsetting hedged positions under the same or similar terms 
critical accounting policies and estimates the partnership s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures with respect to contingent assets and liabilities 
the basis for these estimates is historical experience  consultation with experts and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
any effects on the partnership s business  financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
the partnership believes the critical accounting policies and estimates discussed in the following paragraphs affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition in general  the partnership recognizes revenue when delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  pricing is determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
for its natural gas businesses  the partnership records an estimate each month for its operating revenues and cost of natural gas based on quantities delivered  along with a true up of the prior month s estimate to equal the prior month s actual data 
as a result  there is one month of estimated data recorded in the partnership s operating revenues and cost of natural gas for each of the years ended december   and these estimates are based on the best available volume and price data 
the partnership believes that the assumptions underlying these estimates will not be significantly different from actual amounts due to the routine nature of these estimates and the stability of the partnership s processes 
property  plant and equipment property  plant and equipment is recorded at its original cost and is depreciated based on the lesser of the estimated useful lives of the assets or the estimated remaining life of crude oil or natural gas production in the basins served by the pipelines 
determining the useful life requires various assumptions to be made  including the supply of and demand for hydrocarbons in the markets served by assets  normal wear and tear of the facilities  and the extent and frequency of maintenance programs 
changes in any of these assumptions may impact the rate at which depreciation is recognized in the financial statements 
additionally  if it is determined that an asset s undepreciated cost may not be recoverable due to economic obsolescence  the business climate  legal and other factors  the asset would be reviewed for impairment and any necessary reduction in its value would be recorded as a charge against earnings 
if there are changes to any of the estimates and assumptions  actual results may differ 
if an average remaining service life of years had been used compared to the average remaining service life of approximately years in the results  depreciation expense would be million or million higher and net income per unit would have been or lower 
if an average remaining service life of years had been used  depreciation expense would be million or million lower and net income per unit would have been or higher 
assessment of recoverability of goodwill and intangibles goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination 
goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment annually as of the end of the second quarter or more frequently if impairment indicators arise that indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recovered 
impairment occurs when the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value 
at the time the partnership determines that impairment has occurred  the carrying value of the goodwill is written down to its fair value 
to estimate the fair value of the reporting units  management makes estimates and judgments about future cash flows  as well as revenue  cost of sales  operating expenses  capital expenditures and net working capital based on assumptions that are consistent with the partnership s most recent five year plan to manage the business 
preparation of forecast information for use in the five year plan involves significant judgments 
based on the results of the impairment analysis  the fair value of the total equity of each reporting unit is deemed to exceed the respective carrying value 
actual results can  and often do  differ from the projections and assumptions made 
these changes can have a negative impact on the estimates of impairment  which would result in charges to income 
in addition  further changes in the economic and business environment can impact the partnership s original and ongoing assessments of potential impairment 
other intangible assets consist of natural gas purchase and sale customer contracts  and natural gas supply opportunities  which are amortized on a straight line basis over the weighted average useful life of the underlying assets  which is the period over which the asset is expected to contribute directly or indirectly to the future cash flows of the partnership 
the partnership evaluates the carrying value of the intangible assets whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
in assessing the recoverability of intangibles  the partnership compares the carrying value to the undiscounted future cash flows the intangibles are expected to generate 
if the total of the undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the intangibles  the intangibles are written down to their fair value 
if there are changes to any of the estimates and assumptions  actual results may differ 
derivative financial instruments net income and cash flows are subject to volatility from changes in market prices such as interest rates  natural gas prices  natural gas liquids prices and fractionation margins 
in order to manage the risks to partnership unitholders  the general partner uses a variety of derivative financial instruments to create offsetting positions to specific commodity or interest rate exposures 
under sfas no 
 all derivative financial instruments are reflected in the balance sheet at their fair value 
for those instruments that qualify for hedge accounting  the accounting treatment depends on each instrument s intended use and how it is designated 
derivative financial instruments qualifying for hedge accounting treatment and in use by the partnership can be divided into two categories cashflow hedges  or fair value hedges 
cashflow hedges are entered into to hedge the variability in cashflow s related to a forecasted transaction 
fair value hedges are entered into to hedge the value of a recognized asset or liability 
price assumptions used to value the cash flow and fair value hedges can have an impact on net income results for each period 
the partnership uses published market price information where available  or quotations from otc market makers to find executable bids and offers 
the valuations also reflect the potential impact of liquidating the partnership s position in an orderly manner over a reasonable period of time under present market conditions  modeling risk  credit risk of our counterparties and operational risk 
the amounts reported in the partnership s consolidated financial statements change quarterly as these estimates are revised to reflect actual results  changes in market conditions or other factors  many of which are beyond the partnership s control 
at inception and on an ongoing basis  the partnership also assesses whether the derivatives that are used in its hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows or fair value of the hedged item 
to the extent the hedges are determined to be highly effective  changes in the derivative fair values are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income until the hedged transactions occur and are then recognized into earnings 
if the hedge is determined to not be highly effective  it can no longer be designated as a cash flow or fair value hedge and changes in the fair value would be reported directly in the income statement 
the partnership s earnings are also affected by use of the mark to market method of accounting required under gaap for certain basis swap financial instruments 
the partnership uses short term  highly liquid financial instruments such as basis swaps and other contracts to economically hedge market price risks associated with inventories  firm commitments and certain anticipated transactions  primarily within our marketing segment 
as of december   certain basis swap financial instruments  however  did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under sfas no 
 and thus the changes in fair value of these instruments are recorded on the balance sheet and through earnings ie  using the mark to market method rather than being deferred until the firm commitment or anticipated transaction affects earnings 
the use of mark to market accounting for financial instruments may cause the partnership s non cash earnings to fluctuate based upon changes in underlying indexes  primarily commodity prices 
fair value for these financial instruments is determined using price data from highly liquid markets such as the nymex commodity exchange or from otc market makers 
for the year ended december   the partnership recognized losses of million in the consolidated statement of income  as part of the cost of natural gas balance of the marketing segment 
the fair value of the basis swaps at december   is a payable of million  and is included in the consolidated statement of financial position as part of the deferred credits balance 
these losses resulted from the negative change in market value of these basis swap hedging portfolio activities 
at that date  the partnership had a limited number of open positions that extend beyond december  commitments  contingencies and environmental liabilities the partnership accrues reserves for contingent liabilities  including environmental remediation and clean up costs  when its assessments indicate that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and an amount can be reasonably estimated 
estimates of the liabilities are based on currently available facts  existing technology and presently enacted laws and regulations taking into consideration the likely effects of inflation and other factors  and include estimates of associated legal costs 
these amounts also consider prior experience in remediating contaminated sites  other companies clean up experience and data released by government organizations 
these estimates are subject to revision in future periods based on actual costs or new circumstances and the revisions are reflected in the partnership s income in the period in which they are reasonably determinable 
the partnership evaluates recoveries from insurance coverage separately from its liability and  when recovery is reasonably assured  it records and reports an asset separately from the associated liability in its financial statements 
new environmental developments  such as increasingly strict environmental laws and regulations and new claims for damages to property  employees  other persons and the environment resulting from current or past operations  could result in substantial cost and future liabilities 
the partnership recognizes liabilities for other contingencies when it has an exposure that  when fully analyzed  indicates it is both probable that an asset has been impaired or that a liability has been incurred and the amount of impairment or loss can be reasonably estimated 
the partnership s potential exposure to adverse outcomes is evaluated by both internal and external counsel 
when a range of probable loss can be estimated  the partnership accrues the most likely amount  or at least the minimum of the range of probable loss 
to the extent that actual outcomes differ from estimates or additional facts and circumstances cause the partnership to review its estimates  income may be affected 
oil shortage balance and oil measurement losses oil shortage balance and oil measurement losses are inherent in the transportation of crude oil due to  among other factors  evaporation  measurement differences and blending of commodities in transit 
the estimates recorded on the partnership are based on mathematical calculations and physical measurement and include assumptions related to the type of crude oil  its market value  normal physical losses due to evaporation and capacity limitations of the system 
a material change in these assumptions may result in a change to the carrying value of the oil shortage balance or revision of oil measurement loss estimates 
the balances are included in the accounts payable and other in the consolidated statement of financial position 
operational balancing agreements and natural gas imbalances payables and receivables associated with natural gas pipeline operational balancing agreements and natural gas imbalances recorded monthly 
these balances are either settled on a cash basis or are carried by the pipelines and shippers on an in kind basis 
accruals associated with these in kind balances are derived from the best available third party and internal documentation and are valued on a published third party index 
if there is a change to these estimates and assumptions  actual results may differ 
results of operations the following table shows the partnership s consolidated revenues  expenses  operating income  net income and net income per unit 
year ended december  dollars in millions  except per unit amounts operating revenues   expenses   operating income net income net income per unit the increases in overall operating revenue  expenses  operating income and net income in compared with are attributable to the full year contribution from the midcoast system  which was acquired by the partnership in october and improved performance on the lakehead and east texas systems 
increases in operating revenue  expenses  operating income and net income in compared with resulted from the full year contribution of the east texas system acquired in december and the partial year contribution from the midcoast system 
the following table reflects operating income by business segment and corporate charges 
year ended december  dollars in millions operating income liquids transportation gathering and processing natural gas transportation marketing corporate  operating and administrative total operating income corporate net income corporate consists of interest expense  interest income  minority interest and certain other operating and administrative costs such as franchise taxes  that are not allocated to the other business segments 
liquids transportation the results of operations for the liquids transportation segment include the lakehead system and the north dakota system  since its acquisition by the partnership in may year ended december  dollars in millions operating revenues operating and administrative power depreciation and amortization expenses operating income the following table sets forth the lakehead system s average deliveries per day  barrel miles  and average haul year ended december  average bpd united states  province of ontario total deliveries thousands    barrel miles billions year ended december  compared with year ended december  operating income was higher in compared with due to higher revenue and lower operating expenses  including depreciation 
operating revenue was million higher in compared with due to higher deliveries on the lakehead and north dakota systems  partially offset by slightly lower tariffs 
overall  production of western canadian crude oil increased in over mainly due to the start up of new oil sands projects in the province of alberta 
these latest oil sands projects differ from conventional oil production in two ways 
first  oil sands deposits are a mixture of bitumen  water  sand and clay 
as a result  oil production takes the form of either mining the oil sands from subsurface deposits and separating out the water  sand and clay components  or  if the deposits are deeper  heating the reservoir sufficiently to flow the pure bitumen to the surface 
second  the bitumen requires either upgrading or blending prior to being sent to market 
the upgrading process partially refines the bitumen into a crude stream  which can be readily refined by most conventional refineries 
this product is known as synthetic crude oil 
due to startup challenges at the newest upgrader  known as the athabasca oil sands project aosp  crude oil production lagged behind expectations 
this delayed the expected increase in western canadian oil production during the year  and as a result  impacted the level of deliveries on the lakehead system 
on a full year basis  tariffs were lower during due to negative indexing adjustments calculated under ferc regulations and tariff reductions related to existing agreements with customers 
in february  the ferc issued an order on remand  which replaced the annual index of producers price index for finished goods ppi less one percent with an index of ppi without the minus one percent 
the ferc allowed the indexed levels to increase for a short period of time in to reflect the change in the index during however  effective july  the ppi adjustment was negative 
power costs increased by million in to million from million in primarily due to the increase in deliveries on the lakehead and north dakota systems 
operating and administrative expenses decreased by million to million in from million in the partnership experienced higher leak clean up and remediation costs related to two leaks in minnesota during  as well as higher workforce costs related to benefits 
these increases were offset by lower oil measurement expenses and higher labor costs capitalized to construction projects 
depreciation expense was lower in by million compared with the decrease was due to revised depreciation rates effective january  on the lakehead system of million  offset by depreciation on new facilities placed into service during the fourth quarter of and throughout of million 
the reduction in depreciation rates pursuant to a third party study  better represents the expected remaining service life of the lakehead system 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  operating income for was million compared with million for operating income was higher in compared with primarily due to higher revenues  partially offset by higher operating expenses 
operating income for includes the full year results of the north dakota acquisition  whereas includes the results from the date of acquisition of may  operating revenue was higher in compared with due to increased tariffs and a full year contribution from the north dakota system  partially offset by lower deliveries on the lakehead system 
tariffs were higher due to positive adjustments calculated under ferc regulations and agreements with customers 
as well  the amount of heavy oil transported on the lakehead system  which attracts a higher tariff  was higher in compared with volumes delivered on the lakehead system declined over the period as western canadian crude oil was delivered to other markets on competing pipeline systems 
operating and administrative expenses were higher in by million compared with this increase was due to higher workforce costs  as well as expenses related to a lakehead system pipeline leak in july  partially offset by lower oil measurement losses and the non recurring charge in related to the relocation of the partnership s head office to houston 
depreciation expense was higher in by million compared with  due to plant additions from the prior year and a full year impact of the north dakota system 
gathering and processing the results of operations for the gathering and processing segment include the east texas system since its acquisition date on november   and the remaining systems purchased as part of the midcoast system since their acquisition on october  the north texas system was purchased effective december   and therefore  the partnership did not record any results of operations from this system in comparative results for include only one month of operations from the east texas system  and comparative results for include less than three months of operations from the midcoast system 
year ended december  dollars in millions operating revenues  cost of natural gas  operating and administrative depreciation and amortization expenses  operating income the table below indicates the average daily volumes for each of the major systems in the partnership s gathering and processing segment during each of the years ending december  and  in million british thermal units per day 
the anadarko  northeast texas and south texas systems were acquired in october the full year volume data for is shown for informational purposes and includes data from the records of the previous owner  the general partner 
average mmbtu d average mmbtu d east texas   anadarko   northeast texas   south texas   total   year ended december  compared with year ended december  gathering and processing results of operations improved due to the full year impact of the midcoast assets and increased volume of natural gas on the east texas system 
compared with  natural gas volumes on the gathering and processing assets increased approximately from  mmbtu d to  mmbtu d 
increased drilling activity by natural gas producers due to higher natural gas prices is a key contributor to volume growth 
in addition  the partnership has undertaken modest expansions of its facilities to handle increased customer volumes 
the northeast texas system shows a modest decline in volumes partially due to low levels of natural gas drilling in its service area that are not offsetting natural production declines in the area 
drilling near these assets is expected to increase to a level  which should result in a lesser decline or keep production levels flat in the near future 
while high natural gas prices positively impacted volumes on the partnership s gathering and processing systems  this positive impact was largely offset by poor processing economics in the majority of the partnership s operating income is derived from fee based contracts  percentage of index or percentage of proceeds contracts 
however  a portion of this segment s operating income is derived from keep whole processing of natural gas 
this contract structure requires the partnership to process natural gas at times on limited volumes  when it may not be economic to do so 
this can happen when natural gas prices are unusually high or natural gas liquids prices are unusually low 
keep whole processing for the partnership is mostly attributable to the anadarko and east texas systems 
the partnership s keep whole processing is a small but variable element of the gathering and processing segment s operating income 
during  operating income associated with keep whole processing was approximately million 
this compares to operating income of million for the gathering and processing segment as a whole 
during  high natural gas prices  particularly at the beginning of the year  adversely affected processing results 
in the second half of  processing economics improved marginally as a result of lower natural gas prices 
as levels of natural gas in storage increased through the year  natural gas prices decreased 
the partnership estimates that a per mmbtu change in keep whole processing operating revenues less cost of natural gas would increase or decrease total segment operating income by approximately million 
a  mmbtu d change in gathering volume will increase or decrease operating income by approximately million 
these estimates may vary depending upon the pipeline system to which they relate  competition  other factors and are subject to variability 
natural gas transportation the natural gas transportation segment was established upon the acquisition of the midcoast system on october   and its results of operations are included in the partnership s results since that date 
the natural gas transportation segment results for reflect a full year s contribution to the partnership compared with less than three months of results in year ended december  dollars in millions operating revenues cost of natural gas operating and administrative depreciation and amortization expenses operating income the table below indicates the average daily volumes for each of the major systems in partnership s natural gas transportation segment during each of the years ending december  and  in million british thermal units per day 
the utos  midla  alatenn  kpc  bamagas and other major intrastate systems were acquired in october the full year volume data for is shown for informational purposes and includes data from the records of the previous owner  the general partner 
average average mmbtu d utos   midla   alatenn   kpc   bamagas   other major intrastates   total   year ended december  compared with year ended december  results of operations for the natural gas transportation segment improved in due to the full year contribution of the midcoast assets 
performance of the natural gas transportation segment depends largely upon revenues derived from reserved pipeline capacity 
natural gas transportation revenue is typically higher in the winter months due to increased pipeline rates and greater pipeline reservations  thus  the first and fourth quarter operating income is typically higher as compared with the second and third quarter operating income 
volumes on the utos system have decreased in  as compared to the fourth quarter of this decrease is attributable to both general decline associated with volumes received into the utos system and stricter enforcement of gas quality specifications by pipelines downstream of the utos pipeline 
the full year impact to revenue in was less than million if these volumes had remained consistent with the volumes 
as anticipated  certain customer contracts on the alatenn system representing approximately of its capacity terminated during and were not renewed by the customers 
the partnership is exploring alternative customer connections to increase the utilization of this system 
high natural gas prices have impacted the anticipated development of increased natural gas demands expected in the tennessee river valley area and are a factor in lower utilization of the partnership s bamagas system 
this system connects to two new natural gas fueled power plants owned by third parties 
bamagas earns a base return whether the system is used or not because a significant portion of its capacity is contracted on a take or pay basis 
nonetheless  increased earnings cannot be realized until the power plants or other facilities transport more natural gas than their contracted take or pay levels 
marketing the marketing segment was established upon the acquisition of the midcoast system on october   and its results of operations are included in the partnership s results since that date 
the marketing segment s results for reflect a full year s contribution to the partnership compared with less than three months of results in year ended december  dollars in millions operating revenues cost of natural gas operating and administrative depreciation and amortization expenses operating income operating income for the marketing segment was million for the year ended december   compared with million for colder weather during the first four months of created greater demand for natural gas  increasing the ability to optimize firm transportation contracts in competitive markets 
during  the volume of gas marketed by the marketing segment was  mmbtu d 
results for the marketing segment for the year ended december   also include the positive impact of approximately million due to the settlement of disputed amounts  which is included in the consolidated statement of income as a reduction of cost of natural gas 
typically  the first and fourth quarters will result in higher operating income for the marketing segment due to colder weather in the market areas served by this segment 
colder weather generates significant incremental sales to the partnership s wholesale customers and creates the opportunity to optimize transportation and storage agreements 
corporate interest expense was million in compared with million in and million in the million increase in compared with reflects higher average borrowings during due to the full year impact on interest expense of the debt assumed upon the acquisition of the midcoast system in october this was partially offset by a decrease in average borrowing rates that has occurred since the end of during  the partnership issued million in principal amount of senior notes and repaid million in loans from the general partner and affiliates 
interest expense in was approximately the same as in as higher average debt balances were more than offset by lower interest rates and higher interest capitalized on construction projects due to the terrace expansion program in liquidity and capital resources general the partnership believes that it will continue to have adequate liquidity to fund future recurring operating and investing activities 
the primary cash requirements for the partnership consist of normal operating expenses  maintenance and expansion capital expenditures  debt service payments  distributions to partners and acquisitions of new businesses 
short term cash requirements  such as operating expenses  maintenance capital expenditures  debt service payments and quarterly distributions to partners  are expected to be funded by operating cash flows 
long term cash requirements for expansion projects and acquisitions are expected to be funded through several sources  including cash flows from operating activities  borrowings under bank credit facilities  i unit payment in kind distributions in lieu of cash and the issuance of additional debt and equity securities  including common and i units 
the partnership s ability to complete future debt and equity offerings will depend on various factors  including prevailing market conditions  interest rates and its financial condition and credit rating at the time 
on june   the partnership filed a universal shelf registration statement with the sec 
the partnership may offer and sell debt securities or class a common units from time to time up to a total of billion  with the amount  price and terms to be determined at the time of the sale 
the partnership expects to use the net proceeds from any future sales of securities under the universal shelf registration statement for operations and for other general corporate purposes  including repayment or refinancing of borrowings  working capital  capital expenditures or acquisitions of businesses or assets 
in december and january  the partnership issued an additional million class a common units under its universal shelf registration  which generated net proceeds of million  net of underwriters discounts  commissions and issuance expenses 
proceeds from this offering were used to reduce borrowings under the partnership s day credit facility  by approximately million  to reduce borrowings under the three year term facility of approximately million and to pay the december  sinking fund payment of million on the partnership s first mortgage notes 
in january  the partnership issued million in principal amount of senior notes due under its universal shelf registration  from which it received net proceeds of approximately million after offering expenses 
the proceeds were used to repay a portion of the amount outstanding under the partnership s day revolving credit facility 
after giving effect to the class a common unit issuance in december and january  and the debt issuance in january  approximately  million in debt securities or class a common units are available for issuance under the existing universal shelf registration statement 
summary of obligations and commitments the following table summarizes the partnership s obligations and commitments at december  payment due by period total less than year years years after years dollars in millions contractual obligations long term debt  right of way operating leases power and other purchase commitments total contractual cash obligations  right of way payments are estimated to be approximately million per year for the remaining life for all pipelines 
for purposes of this table  the partnership has estimated its remaining life to be years 
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was million in compared with million in an improvement in net income in compared with of million reflects the full year contribution by the midcoast system as well as stronger performance on the lakehead and east texas systems 
this was offset by the overall net decrease for changes in balances for working capital items included in operating activities of million 
the change was primarily the result of accrued gas receivables and payables changes due to the increased sales volumes and gas prices in compared with  a deposit of million made in december  related to the mid continent asset acquisition that closed on march   as well as the result of timing differences in the collection on and payment of the partnership s current accounts 
at december   cash and cash equivalents totaled million  an increase of million from december  of this amount  million was available for cash distributions to unitholders 
of the cash available for distribution  million was retained from i unit holders and million was retained from the general partner by the partnership for use in its business 
the fourth quarter distribution to unitholders and the general partner of million per unit  which includes the effects of million for the exercise of the over allotment option in january  was paid on february  investing activities net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december   compared with million for the prior year 
the million decrease in funds utilized in investing activities was attributable to two items lower cash out flows made for strategic acquisitions in compared with of million 
during  the partnership acquired the north texas system for cash paid of million and paid post closing adjustments to the general partner related to the midcoast acquisition of million  compared with the acquisition of the midcoast system during for cash paid of million  and a decrease in additions to property  plant and equipment in of million primarily due to a significant amount of construction activity during related to the terrace phase iii expansion program 
during  the partnership spent million for capital expenditures including core maintenance and enhancement projects 
core maintenance activities  such as the replacement of equipment and planned major maintenance activities  are undertaken to enable the partnership s systems to operate at their maximum operating capacity 
enhancements to the systems are expected to extend the life of the systems  reduce costs or enhance revenues  and permit the partnership to respond to developing industry and government standards and the changing service expectations of its customers 
the partnership s core maintenance capital expenditures increased to million for compared with million for  due to the full year impact of the midcoast system acquisition in financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was million in  compared with million in the decrease of million from is primarily due to higher net repayments to the general partner and affiliates and an increase in the distributions to partners 
in may  the partnership issued million in aggregate principal of senior unsecured notes and used the net proceeds to repay existing loans from enbridge affiliates and amounts outstanding under the partnership s credit facilities 
cash distributions to partners increased to million in compared with million in the increase in distributions was due to an increase in the per unit cash distributions paid  from per unit in to per unit in  an increase in the number of units outstanding  and an increase in the general partner incentive distributions  which resulted from increased cash distributions to unitholders 
during  working capital decreased by million to a working capital deficit of million  primarily due to the inclusion of the million balance of the partnership s day credit facility in current liabilities in  compared with classifying it as long term debt in this balance was recorded as a current liability  as the partnership s lender granted a three month extension to the existing maturity date of january to facilitate the credit review process and better coordinate the annual request for extension 
in december  the partnership issued million class a common units at per unit  which generated proceeds  net of underwriters discounts  commissions and issuance expenses  of approximately million 
proceeds from this offering were used to reduce borrowings under the partnership s day credit facility by approximately million  million to reduce borrowings under the partnership s three year term facility and million to pay the december  sinking fund payment on the first mortgage notes 
the remainder of the net proceeds was used to fund a portion of the north texas system acquisition 
in addition to the proceeds generated from the unit issuances  the general partner contributed million to the partnership to maintain its general partner interest in the partnership 
in may  the partnership issued million class a common units at per unit  which generated proceeds  net of underwriters discounts  commissions and issuance expenses  of approximately million 
proceeds from this offering were used to reduce borrowings under the partnership s day credit facility by million and an affiliate loan by million 
in addition to the proceeds generated from the unit issuances  the general partner contributed million to the partnership to maintain its general partner interest in the partnership 
in march  the partnership issued million class a common units at per unit 
the net proceeds from the offering were million and were used to repay indebtedness 
on october   the partnership issued  i units to enbridge management for net proceeds of million 
the partnership used the net proceeds to repay debt owed to affiliates that was assumed in connection with the acquisition of the midcoast system 
cash distributions the partnership distributes quarterly to the general partner and the holders of its common units an amount equal to its available cash  which generally is defined to mean for any calendar quarter the sum of all of the cash receipts of the partnership plus net reductions to reserves less all of its cash disbursements and net changes to reserves 
these reserves are retained to provide for the proper conduct of the partnership s business  to stabilize distributions of cash to unitholders and the general partner and  as necessary  to comply with the terms of any agreement or obligation of the partnership 
enbridge management  as the delegate of the general partner under a delegation of control agreement  computes the amount of the partnership s available cash 
enbridge management  as owner of the i units  does not receive distributions in cash 
instead  each time that the partnership makes a cash distribution to the general partner and the holders of its common units  the number of i units owned by enbridge management and the percentage of total units in the partnership owned by enbridge management increases automatically under the provisions of the partnership agreement with the result that the number of i units owned by enbridge management will equal the number of enbridge management s shares and voting shares that are then outstanding 
the amount of this increase per i unit is determined by dividing the cash amount distributed per common unit by the average price of one of enbridge management s listed shares on the nyse for the day period immediately preceding the ex dividend date for enbridge management s shares 
for purposes of calculating the sum of all distributions of available cash  the cash equivalent amount of the additional i units that are issued when a distribution of cash is made to the general partner and owners of common units is treated as distribution of available cash  even though the i unit holder will not receive cash 
the partnership will retain and use that cash in its business 
during  the partnership distributed a total of  i units through quarterly distributions to enbridge management  compared with  in the increase was the result of a full year s distributions in  compared with one quarter in  as the i units were issued in october the partnership retained million in related to the i unit distributions compared with million in credit facilities and debt the partnership s credit facilities and debt consist of the following december  dollars in millions short term debt day credit facility current portion of first mortgage notes total short term debt long term debt day credit facility three year term facility first mortgage notes senior notes due senior notes due senior notes due senior notes due senior notes due unamortized discount total long term debt   loans from enbridge affiliates total debt   credit facilities 
in january  the partnership amended and restated the terms of its two unsecured revolving credit facilities  which were originally entered into in january the facilities consist of a million three year term facility the three year facility  which matures in subject to extension as provided in the facility and a million day facility the day facility  which matures in april subject to a one year term out option and extension as provided in the facility 
interest is charged on amounts drawn under each of these facilities at a variable rate equal to the base rate or a eurodollar rate as defined in the facility agreements 
in the case of a eurodollar rate loans an additional margin is charged which varies depending on the partnership s credit rating and the amounts drawn under the facility 
a facility fee is payable on the entire amount of each facility whether or not drawn 
the facility fee varies depending on the partnership s credit rating 
as of december   the facility fees on the three year and day facilities were and  respectively 
these credit facilities contain restrictive covenants that require that the partnership maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio of times and a maximum leverage ratio of times  each as defined in the facility agreements 
the facility agreements also place limitations on the amount of debt that may be incurred directly by the partnership s subsidiaries 
accordingly  it is expected that the partnership will provide debt financing to its subsidiaries as required 
as of december   million was drawn on the partnership s day facility at a weighted average interest rate of and million was drawn on the partnership s three year facility at a weighted average interest rate of 
first mortgage notes 
the first mortgage notes are collateralized by a first mortgage on substantially all of the property  plant and equipment of the lakehead partnership and are due and payable in equal annual installments of million until their maturity in the notes contain various restrictive covenants applicable to the partnership  and restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness  including compliance with certain debt issuance tests 
the partnership believes these issuance tests will not negatively impact its ability to finance future expansion projects 
under the first mortgage note agreements  the partnership cannot make cash distributions more frequently than quarterly in an amount not to exceed available cash for the immediately preceding calendar quarter 
if the notes were to be paid prior to their stated maturities  the first mortgage note agreements provide for the payment of a redemption premium by the partnership 
senior notes 
in addition to the million of senior unsecured notes previously outstanding  on may   the partnership issued million in aggregate principal amount of its notes due and million in aggregate principal amount of its notes due in a private placement 
the partnership used the proceeds of approximately million  net of expenses of approximately million  to repay loans from affiliates of the partnership and other bank debt 
the partnership recorded a discount of million in connection with the issuance of the notes 
on june   the partnership completed a form s with the sec  which registered the exchange of the unregistered notes for publicly registered notes 
all of the notes pay interest semi annually and have varying maturities and terms as previously outlined in the table above 
the senior unsecured notes do not contain any covenants restricting the issuance of additional indebtedness 
loans from enbridge affiliates 
as of december   the partnership had million in debt outstanding under a note to an affiliate of the general partner 
this note relates to debt assumed by the partnership in connection with the acquisition of the midcoast system in october the note matures in and has cross default provisions that are triggered by events of default under the first mortgage notes issued by the partnership or defaults under the partnership s three year term facility and day credit facility 
the note is subordinate to the partnership s credit facilities and other senior indebtedness 
off balance sheet arrangements the partnership has no off balance sheet arrangements 
credit ratings in may  standard poor s and moody s assigned the ratings for the partnership s senior unsecured debt obligations of bbb and a baa  respectively 
in may  moody s also lowered its senior unsecured debt rating of the lakehead partnership  a wholly owned subsidiary of the partnership  from a to baa standard poor s rating for the lakehead partnership s senior unsecured debt obligations was unchanged during at bbb 
cash requirements for future growth acquisitions 
the primary strategy of the partnership is to grow cash distributions through the profitable expansion of existing assets and through development and acquisition of complementary businesses with risk profiles similar to the partnership s current businesses 
the partnership will continue to analyze potential acquisitions  with a focus on crude oil  refined products and natural gas pipelines  terminals and related facilities 
major energy companies have sold their non strategic assets in recent years  continuing the trend of rationalization of the energy infrastructure in the united states 
the partnership expects this trend to continue and believes it is well positioned to participate in these opportunities 
the partnership will seek opportunities throughout the united states  particularly in the us gulf coast area  where asset acquisitions are anticipated in and around its recently acquired natural gas gathering  processing  and transportation businesses 
the partnership expects that the funds needed to achieve the objective of growth through acquisitions will be obtained through a combination of cash flows from operating activities  borrowings under bank credit facilities  i unit payment in kind distributions in lieu of cash and the issuance of additional debt and equity securities  including common units and i units 
the partnership s acquisition of the north texas system on december  for million was funded with borrowings under the partnership s day revolving credit facility and three year term facility 
the additional debt will result in increased debt service costs in the future 
to the extent that proceeds from future equity offerings are used to reduce the principal amount of debt  the partnership s interest expense will be reduced 
to the extent that the partnership refinances its existing debt with new debt  its interest expense will generally be affected by differences in interest rates charged on the existing debt versus the new debt and by any fees associated with the new debt 
on december   the partnership entered into definitive agreements to acquire crude oil pipeline and storage systems from shell pipeline company lp and shell oil products us shell for million  excluding customary closing adjustments for working capital and other items 
the asset purchase closed on march  the partnership funded the acquisition through its existing credit facilities 
distributions 
for the year ended december   the declared annual distribution rate was per unit  compared with per unit for the year ended december  an increase in the partnership s distribution rate will result in additional cash payments to existing unitholders and the general partner 
as well  an increase in the number of common units eligible for cash distributions will result in higher total distribution payments 
the partnership expects that all cash distributions will be paid out of operating cash flows over the long term  however  from time to time  the partnership may temporarily borrow under its credit facilities for the purpose of paying cash distributions until the full impact of operations is realized 
capital spending 
at december   the partnership had million in estimated outstanding purchase commitments attributable to capital projects for the construction of assets that will be recorded as property  plant and equipment 
expenditures related to property  plant and equipment are capitalized capital expenditures  subject to a minimum rule  that have a useful life greater than one year for assets purchased or constructed  existing assets that are extended  replaced  or improved  or all land  regardless of cost 
acquisition of new assets  additions  replacements and improvements other than land costing less than the established minimum rules are expensed accordingly 
capital expenditures are categorized by the partnership as either core maintenance or enhancement expenditures 
core maintenance expenditures are those expenditures that are necessary to maintain the service capability of the existing assets and includes the replacement of system components and equipment which is worn  obsolete or completing its useful life 
enhancement expenditures improve the service capability of the existing assets  extend asset useful lives  increase capacities from existing levels  reduce costs or enhance revenues  and enable the partnership to respond to governmental regulations and developing industry standards 
in  the partnership anticipates capital expenditure spending to approximate dollars in millions system enhancements core maintenance activities lakehead system expansion projects east texas expansion excluding major expansion projects and acquisitions  ongoing capital expenditures are expected to average approximately million annually approximately for core maintenance and for system enhancements 
the partnership anticipates funding the expenditures temporarily through its bank credit facilities  with permanent debt and equity funding being provided when appropriate 
the partnership expects to incur continuing annual capital and operating expenditures for pipeline integrity measures to ensure both regulatory compliance and to maintain the overall integrity of the pipeline systems 
expenditure levels have continued to increase as pipelines age and require higher levels of inspection or maintenance  however  these are viewed to be consistent with industry trends 
included in the anticipated capital expenditures spending for system enhancements in is approximately million of capital expenditures to ensure regulatory compliance on the lakehead system 
this spending is for pressure testing of the lakehead system to establish operating pressures in excess of operating limits that would otherwise be allowed under current circumstances 
subsequent events class a common unit issuance in january  the partnership issued an additional  class a common units to its underwriters pursuant to the exercise of the over allotment option as part of the december class a common unit issuance 
this resulted in additional proceeds to the partnership  net of underwriters fees and discounts  commissions and issuance expenses  of approximately million 
the proceeds were used to reduce amounts outstanding under the partnership s revolving credit facilities 
distribution declaration on january   the partnership s board of directors declared a distribution payable on february   to unitholders of record as of february   of its available cash of million at december   or per common unit 
of this distribution  million was distributed in i units to i unit holders and million was retained from the general partner in respect of this i unit distribution 
senior notes offering in january  the partnership issued million in principal amount of senior notes due  from which it received net proceeds of million after offering expenses 
the proceeds were used to repay a portion of the amount outstanding under the day revolving credit facility 
mid continent liquids system on december   the partnership entered into definitive agreements to acquire crude oil pipeline and storage systems from shell pipeline company lp and shell oil products us shell for million  excluding customary closing adjustments for working capital and other items 
the asset purchase closed on march  the assets acquired serve refineries in the mid continent from the cushing  oklahoma hub  and consist of the following the mile ozark pipeline that currently transports approximately  barrels of crude oil per day from cushing to wood river  illinois  a million barrel storage terminal located in el dorado  kansas  the mile west tulsa pipeline that currently transports approximately  barrels per day to two refineries in oklahoma  and the storage terminal at cushing  which is one of the largest terminal facilities in north america with million barrels of storage capacity 
these systems provide cash flows primarily from toll or fee based revenues from a combination of regulated assets and contracted unregulated assets and are expected to be accretive to the partnership s distributable cash flow 
the assets are consistent with the partnership s core operating expertise in crude oil pipelines and the throughput originates from sources of supply different from those on its other crude oil systems  providing increased diversity in the partnership s sources of cash flow 
enbridge concurrently acquired shell s patoka west tank farm 
these assets complement enbridge s initiative to access new markets for canadian crude oil 
the partnership expects to benefit from the market access initiative by facilitating throughput on the lakehead system 
other matters future prospects the partnership believes that its financial performance will continue to improve in as a result of increased capacity utilization on the lakehead system  combined with the contributions from the recently acquired north texas and mid continent liquids systems 
liquids transportation average daily crude oil deliveries on the lakehead system are expected to increase by  bpd during  from million barrels per day in to approximately million bpd in the majority of the growth in deliveries is expected to come from a full year s production from the aosp project that commenced during the aosp is sponsored by two multinational integrated oil companies and an independent oil and gas company 
while start up problems delayed the expected incremental supply from the aosp during  the partnership anticipates production to increase significantly in to meet the aosp sponsor s expectations 
this increase in supply is expected to result in higher deliveries on the lakehead system 
future prospects for the lakehead system depend upon increased crude oil production from western canada 
while conventional oil supplies in this area are declining  crude oil production from canada s oil sands supply is increasing 
estimated recoverable crude oil reserves from the oil sands  using existing technology  represent only of the volume in place  of approximately trillion barrels 
to put this in perspective  this total volume in western canada exceeds the estimated reserves of saudi arabia 
therefore this resource is expected to be an important crude oil supply for north america in the coming decades 
recognizing this  a number of major oil companies have announced projects requiring investments of approximately billion over the next decade 
this level of investment is expected to increase production of crude oil and enhance utilization of the capacity available on the lakehead system 
there are several major oil sands projects scheduled for completion over the next few years including expansions of existing oil sands projects as well as new projects 
the two original oil sands producers  suncor and syncrude  are both constructing projects to increase production by in combination  these projects are expected to provide more than  bpd of supply 
in addition to the alberta oil sands  canada has substantial conventional crude oil resources 
conventional crude production will remain sensitive to the price of crude oil and the level of crude oil drilling activity 
for a complete discussion of supply and demand for crude oil  please see items business and properties 
recognizing the need to expand beyond the lakehead system s traditional markets  enbridge and the partnership have undertaken an oil sands market study to research supply and disposition of crude oil 
the findings indicate that there is demand among us refiners who have not previously had access to canadian crude oil due to a lack of pipeline infrastructure or economic tariffs 
enbridge and the partnership are focusing on developing transportation solutions to allow padd ii refineries  and ultimately  refiners on the us gulf coast  to gain increased or new access to western canadian crude oil production 
two tangible steps have already been announced under this initiative 
first  enbridge acquired a stake in a pipeline that runs from cushing  oklahoma to chicago and intends to reverse its flow 
the pipeline will be renamed the spearhead pipeline and will provide capacity to deliver  bpd into the major oil hub at cushing by the partnership expects to benefit following the reversal  as western canadian crude oil will be carried on the lakehead system as far as chicago  and then transferred to spearhead 
the second step was the partnership s announcement in october of plans to extend the lakehead system with a new  to  bpd pipeline to serve the large wood river  illinois refining center by this southern access project would intersect with spearhead to offer customers delivery options to cushing and chicago  in addition to wood river 
the partnership closed its previously announced acquisition of shell s mid continent liquids systems  centered around the major cushing crude oil hub  on march  the pipeline assets provide us domestic and imported feedstock to mid continent area refineries 
the partnership also acquired considerable tank storage capacity  mainly at the cushing hub 
the cushing storage capacity in excess of operating requirements is contracted under term agreements 
these assets provide basin diversification for the partnership  because the crude oil shipped is not sourced from the western canadian basin  as are the bulk of the lakehead system deliveries 
natural gas gathering and processing  transportation and marketing the partnership s natural gas assets are located in the gulf coast and mid continent regions of the united states  two of the premier natural gas producing areas of the united states 
as a result  there are many opportunities to connect new natural gas supplies either by installing new facilities or acquiring adjacent third party gathering operations 
consolidation with neighboring facilities will extract efficiencies by eliminating costs  for example  by combining redundant facilities  increasing volume  and increasing processing margins 
these opportunities tend to involve modest amounts of capital with attractive rates of return 
results of the partnership s natural gas gathering and processing business depend upon the drilling activities of natural gas producers in the areas served by the partnership 
during  increased drilling in the areas where the partnership s gathering systems are located has generally exceeded the national trend 
one of the prominent areas in which this occurred was the barnett shale formation in north texas  where natural gas production increased from mmcf d in to mmcf d in late the barnett shale is a prominent new natural gas development within the fort worth basin  not previously accessed by the partnership s system 
to address this opportunity  the partnership acquired the north texas system in a transaction that closed on december  the acquired facilities will provide approximately mmcf d of processing capacity 
the barnett shale is being actively developed  and the partnership anticipates that throughput on the north texas system will increase modestly in each of the next several years 
the partnership has announced proposed construction of a new mmcf d intrastate transmission pipeline to carry increased volumes of natural gas to the pipeline hub at carthage  texas 
carthage access is important to natural gas shippers because it offers a number of connections to interstate pipelines  which tend to support more favorable margins to producers 
following a successful open season for the proposed east texas line  preliminary volume commitments were obtained from natural gas producers  and the partnership expects to proceed with construction to bring the system on stream in mid the partnership is pursuing options to connect production from north texas to the new transmission line and provide carthage access for gas producers in that area 
growth by acquisitions acquisitions are expected to play a role in the achievement of financial targets of the partnership for in general  these acquisitions are expected to be in or near areas where the partnership already operates and will present the best opportunities for consolidation savings and enhancement of the partnership s market position 
in addition to the previously announced mid continent crude oil acquisition  approximately million of capital has been budgeted for additional acquisitions in the partnership also will evaluate more significant acquisitions 
subject to financing capability  enbridge plans to use the partnership as its primary vehicle for acquiring mature energy delivery assets  particularly in the gulf coast region of the united states 
the partnership could make acquisitions directly from enbridge or its subsidiaries in the future and will continue to pursue strategic acquisitions from unaffiliated parties 
growth in cash distributions the partnership has modestly grown its cash distributions over the last several years 
cash distributions would likely have increased more were it not for lower utilization of the lakehead system expansions than anticipated when the partnership committed to the expansions in the late s 
increased utilization of the lakehead system and the approximately million terrace expansion program are fundamental to increasing cash distributions above the current per unit  per year 
it is anticipated that oil sands developments will provide increased utilization of the lakehead system in the near future 
it is also anticipated that oil sands development will support further expansions  such as the southern access project  that will grow the earnings and cash flow of the partnership 
selected acquisitions and growth of the natural gas segments are also expected to contribute to improved near term performance of the partnership 
regulatory matters kpc system from  when kpc became subject to the ferc jurisdiction  until november   when kpc s rate case rates became effective  the ferc established initial rates based upon an annual cost of service of approximately million 
since that time  these initial rates have been the subject of various ongoing challenges that remain unresolved 
the united states court of appeals for the dc circuit issued an order on august   vacating the ferc s remand order and rehearing order and remanded the issue of kpc s initial rates back to the ferc with directions that the ferc address the question of an appropriate rate refund 
in prior kpc orders in this proceeding  the ferc determined that it had no authority to impose a refund condition on initial rates 
on october   kpc filed a pleading at the ferc requesting the issuance of an order finding that it had no refund obligation and requesting termination of the proceedings on remand 
there are other actions and administrative proceedings that may be undertaken in connection with the court s determination 
the outcome of kpc s motion or any proceedings  including the amount of any refunds that may be ordered  is uncertain 
if the ferc determines refunds are required  after all administrative options and court appeals are exhausted  the amount of the refunds may range from zero to million 
liquids petroleum pipelines since  ferc regulated liquid petroleum pipelines have been generally subject to an indexed ceiling rate methodology under which the annual change in the ceiling rate is the annual change in the producers price index for finished goods minus ppi 
in december  ferc affirmed this methodology and the existing index 
the petroleum industry appealed this decision  and on february   the ferc issued an order on remand  replacing the ppi index by removing the reduction 
during the second quarter of  flying j  lion oil  sinclair oil and tesoro refining and marketing filed an appeal against this order with the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate and foreign exchange risk to the extent the amounts drawn under its revolving credit facilities carry a floating rate of interest  the partnership s earnings and cash flow are exposed to changes in interest rates 
this exposure is managed through periodically refinancing floating rate bank debt with long term fixed rate debt and through the use of interest rate risk management hedge contracts 
the partnership does not have any material exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates as virtually all of its revenues and expenses are denominated in us dollars 
to the extent that a material foreign exchange exposure arises  the partnership intends to hedge such exposure using forward or other financial derivative contracts

however  the partnership has commodity risk related to degradation losses associated with fluctuating differentials between the price of heavy crude oil relative to light crude oil 
commodity prices have a significant impact on the underlying supply of  and demand for  crude oil and ngls that the partnership transports 
a portion of the partnership s earnings and cash flows in its natural gas segments are exposed to movements in the prices of natural gas and ngls 
the partnership has entered into hedge transactions to substantially mitigate exposure to movements in these prices 
pursuant to policies approved by the board of directors of the general partner  the partnership may not enter into derivative instruments for speculative purposes 
all financial derivative transactions must be undertaken with creditworthy counterparties 
as at december   all financial counterparties were rated at least a by all major credit rating agencies
