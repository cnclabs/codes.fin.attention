item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is intended to assist in understanding our financial condition  and the results of operations for willow grove bancorp  inc  the company and its subsidiary willow grove bank  the bank at and for the fiscal years ended june   and the information in this section should be read in conjunction with the company s financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere herein 
general our net income is primarily based upon our net interest income  which is the difference between the income earned on interest earning assets and the interest paid on interest bearing liabilities and the relative amount of our interest earning assets to interest bearing liabilities 
non interest income and expenses  the provision for loan losses and income tax expense also affect our results of operations 
critical accounting policies the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
in management s opinion  the most critical accounting policies affecting our consolidated financial statements are evaluation of the allowance for loan losses 
the determination of the allowance for loan losses involves significant judgments and assumptions by management which may have a material impact on the carrying value of net loans and  potentially  on the amount of net income we recognize from period to period 
for a description of the methods we use to determine our allowance for loan losses  see results of operations provision for loan losses 
accrual and recognition of interest on loans 
these policies involve significant judgments and assumptions by management which may have a significant impact on the amount of interest income recognized from period to period 
for a description of our policies for recognizing interest income on loans  see note summary of significant accounting policies loans  loan origination fees and uncollected interest of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
realization of deferred income tax items 
we include in our other assets a net deferred tax asset which is an estimate of net deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities 
these estimates involve significant judgments and assumptions by management which may have a material effect on the carrying value of this asset for financial reporting purposes 
for a more detailed description of these items and estimates  see note income taxes to our notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in item hereof 
the notes to consolidated financial statements identify other significant accounting policies used in the development and presentation of our financial statements 
this discussion and analysis of the significant accounting policies and other financial statement disclosures identify and address key variables and other qualitative and quantitative factors that are necessary for an understanding and evaluation of the company and its results of operations 
changes in financial condition general 
our total assets increased by million  or  to million at june  compared to million at june  this increase was primarily due to an increase in the net loan portfolio of million and an icrease in securities available for sale and held to maturity of million in the aggregate 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in cash and cash equivalents 
the increase in total assets during the fiscal year ended june  was funded by a million increase in borrowings from the federal home loan bank fhlb of pittsburgh and a million increase in deposits 
cash and cash equivalents 
cash and cash equivalents  which consist of cash on hand and in other banks in interest earning and non interest earning accounts  amounted to million and million at june  and  respectively 
the decrease in cash and cash equivalents of million or was the result of the utilization of funds to originate new loans  to purchase additional securities and to repurchase shares of company common stock 
securities available for sale 
at june   we had securities that were classified available for sale afs totaling million  compared to million in afs securities at june  the company s afs securities are comprised primarily of mortgage backed securities  issued by fannie mae  freddie mac and ginnie mae  as well as us government agency securities  stock in the fhlb and certain equity securities 
the decrease in available for sale securities was part of the company s investment strategy to maintain the portfolio at an optimal level to effectively assist in asset liability management without overexposing our capital component to the potential effects of changes in interest rates 
securities classified as afs are accounted for at fair value with unrealized gains and losses  which are temporary in nature  net of tax  reflected as an adjustment to stockholders equity 
primarily as a result of interest rates increasing  during the year ending june  compared to june   we had unrealized losses on afs securities of million compared to unrealized gains on afs securities of million at june  securities held to maturity 
at june   we had securities that were classified held to maturity totaling million  compared to million in held to maturity securities at june  our held to maturity securities at june  were comprised of million in cmos  million in municipal bonds  million in us government agency securities and million in mortgage backed securities 
our held to maturity securities at june  were comprised solely of municipal bonds 
the increase in held to maturity securities was part of the company s investment strategy to increase its portfolio in part to enhance earnings to supplement loan income 
held to maturity securities are carried at amortized cost  and assets transferred from available for sale to held to maturity are transferred at fair value 
loans 
our net loan portfolio increased to million at june  from million at june  during the fiscal year ended june   new loan originations and purchases of million of loans were partially offset by loan repayments of million and loan sales of million 
this increase in our net portfolio of million  or  was a result of increases in single family residential mortgage loans  commercial real estate and multi family residential mortgage loans  construction loans and home equity loans 
our single family residential mortgage loans amounted to million  or of the total loan portfolio  at june  compared to million  or of the total loan portfolio  at june  the million  or  increase in our single family residential mortgage loans primarily was the result of the purchase of wholesale loan packages during fiscal totaling million in newly originated single family residential loans 
other significant changes in the types of loans in our portfolio during the year ended june  were an increase of million in commercial real estate and multi family residential mortgage loans  an increase of million in construction mortgage loans  an increase of million in home equity loans  a million decrease in commercial business loans  and a  decrease in consumer loans 
as of june   our single family residential mortgage loans and home equity loans amounted to an aggregate of of our total loans 
in recent years we have increased our emphasis on commercial real estate and construction loans 
commercial real estate and multi family residential loans amounted to of loans  while construction loans amounted to of the total loans at june  commercial real estate and multi family residential loans and construction loans generally have higher yields and shorter terms to maturity and or repricing compared to single family residential mortgage loans 
however  commercial real estate and construction loans generally are considered to involve a higher degree of risk of loss compared to single family residential mortgage loans 
our allowance for loan losses amounted to million at june  representing a net decrease of  from the allowance of million at june  primarily based on improved asset quality and an increased single family residential loan portfolio at year end 
loans held for sale 
mortgage loans originated or purchased with the intention of being sold into the secondary market are classified as held for sale and are carried at the lower of cost or market value with any unrealized loss reflected in the statements of financial income 
at june   million of fixed rate  single family residential mortgage loans were classified as held for sale compared to million in such loans classified as held for sale at june  the decrease of million is related to the reduction in loan refinancings with the increase in interest rates at june  compared to june  intangible assets 
at june   the amount of our intangible assets totaled  this compares to million at june  our intangible assets include a core deposit intangible and an unidentified intangible asset  which represents the excess cost over fair value of assets acquired over liabilities assumed in a branch acquisition which occurred in the core deposit intangible is being amortized over a year life 
at june  the company had goodwill of  which is periodically measured for impairment 
deposits 
total deposits increased by million  or  to million at june  compared to million at june  at june   checking accounts totaled million  representing an increase of million or compared to the balance of checking accounts at june  of million 
savings accounts increased approximately million  or  to million at june  compared to million at june   and money market accounts increased million  or  to million at june  compared to million at june  at june   certificates of deposit  which comprise the largest component of our deposit portfolio  amounted to million or of our deposit portfolio  a decrease of million  or from million or of total deposits at june  we believe the changes in our deposit portfolio are due to our efforts to increase core deposit accounts and balances through targeted marketing as well as many depositor s unwillingness to extend the maturity of their certificate accounts into longer term certificate of deposit accounts in the current low interest rate environment whereby a strategy of depositing funds into a competitive money market account until rates increase may be employed 
federal home loan bank advances 
we use advances from the fhlb of pittsburgh as an additional source of funds to meet our loan demand  as leverage to fund certain revenue enhancing investment strategies and for other asset liability management purposes 
at june   the total amount of these borrowings outstanding was million  which is a million or increase from the million outstanding at june  during the fiscal year ended june  the average balance of fhlb advances was million compared to million in the year ended june  during the fiscal year ended june  the average cost of fhlb advances was compared to in the year ended june  the maximum amount of borrowings at any month end in fiscal was million compared to million in fiscal of the total amount of borrowings outstanding  million and million were designated for use to fund revenue enhancement investment strategies at june  and  respectively 
such revenue enhancement strategies consist primarily of using fhlb advances as leverage  that is  the company obtains advances at a specified interest rate and then reinvests the proceeds into securities yielding a higher interest rate resulting in a net differential or spread for the company which increases net interest income 
stockholders equity 
at june   our total stockholders equity amounted to million or of assets compared to million or of assets at june  this decrease of million  or was primarily due to the repurchase of  shares of stock in the open market at an aggregate cost of million under the company s stock buyback program and aggregate cash dividend payments of million 
these decreases were partially offset by net income of million for fiscal other changes in stockholders equity for the year ended june  were a million reduction in accumulated other comprehensive income as a result of the impact of increasing interest rates on the unrealized change in fair value of afs securities  additional paid in capital increasing million to million primarily as a result of director and employee stock option exercises  and a decrease of  and  in unallocated shares held by the recognition and retention plan trust rrp and the employee stock ownership plan esop  respectively  primarily as a result of amortization related to the plans 
rrp amortization is five years on granted shares while the esop  which consiste of our esop adopted in and esop adopted in connection with the reorganization are each being amortized over years

the adjustment of tax exempt securities to a tax equivalent yield in the table below may be considered to include non gaap financial information 
management believes that it is a standard practice in the banking industry to present net interest margin  net interest rate spread and net interest income on a fully tax equivalent basis

net income for the year ended june  was million compared to million and million for the years ended june  and  respectively 
fiscal net income decreased compared to fiscal primarily due to decreased net interest income of million and increased non interest expense of million  respectively 
these were partially offset by a decrease in income tax expense of million  a decrease in the provision for loan losses of  and an increase in non interest income of  net interest income 
net interest income is determined by our interest rate spread ie  the difference between the average yields on interest earning assets and the average rates paid on interest bearing liabilities and also the amount of interest earning assets relative to interest bearing liabilities 
our average interest rate spread for the years ended june   and was  and  respectively 
our net interest margin ie  net interest income expressed as a percentage of average interest earning assets was  and for the same three fiscal years 
in fiscal year  the average cost of our interest bearing liabilities decreased by basis points from during fiscal to during fiscal this decrease was due primarily to the re pricing of maturing certificates of deposit at lower rates 
because our certificates of deposit bear a stated interest for a specified term to maturity  there usually is a lagging effect on our cost of funds when market rates of interest change 
when interest rates fall  as they generally were during most of the past three fiscal years  we continue to pay the higher rate on certificates of deposit until their maturity at which time  if the customer determines to maintain such funds on deposit with us  they are re priced to our then current rate 
during the fiscal year ended june   the average yield on our interest earning assets declined by basis points from during fiscal to during fiscal average yields on both loans and taxable securities decreased in fiscal due to the decline in the average yield on our interest earning assets greater than the decline in average cost of interest bearing liabilities  our interest rate spread decreased by basis point to for fiscal from in fiscal similarly  net interest margin for the fiscal year ended june  decreased by basis points to primarily due to the impact of the decline in yield on our interest earning assets combined with the decrease in our ratio of interest earning assets to interest bearing liabilities 
average interest earning assets increased by million in fiscal compared to fiscal  and were funded by increases in interest bearing liabilities of million 
in fiscal compared to fiscal  our net interest margin decreased six basis points  due primarily to the impact of the decline in yield on our interest earning assets more than offsetting the increase in our ratio of interest earning assets to interest bearing liabilities 
the ratio of average interest earning assets to average interest bearing liabilities was   and for fiscal years  and  respectively 
for the fiscal year ended june   net interest income totaled million compared to million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the decrease in fiscal compared to fiscal of million or was primarily due to a greater decrease in the average yields earned on our interest earning assets than the decrease in the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities 
in fiscal year compared to fiscal  the increase in net interest income of million or  was primarily due to a greater decrease in the average cost of our interest bearing liabilities than the decrease in our average yield earned on interest earning assets in fiscal compared to fiscal interest income 
interest income includes the interest earned on our various loans and securities  as well as yield adjustments for the premiums  discounts and deferred fees or costs recorded in connection with the acquisition of these assets 
our total interest income for the year ended june  was million compared to million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
the decrease in interest income in fiscal compared to fiscal was million  or 
this decrease was primarily due to the overall decrease in loans 
during the year ended june  compared to the year ended june   the average balance of our loans receivable decreased by million 
for fiscal  the yield on average interest earning assets dropped basis points to from in fiscal the major factors for this decline were the decrease in the average yield on loans  which decreased basis points from to  modest increases in the average balance of securities outstanding more than offset by a decline in the average yield earned on securities from to and increased average balances and decreased average yields on other interest earning assets 
these yield declines were due primarily to the interest rate environment  during fiscal  which resulted in accelerated loan repayments that have been reinvested in lower yielding assets 
the increase in interest income in fiscal compared to was million  or 
this increase was primarily due to an increase of million in the average balance of securities  which was partially offset by declining average yields on all our interest earning assets 
interest expense 
interest expense consists of the interest paid to our depositors on their interest bearing deposit accounts with us  and to a lesser extent  interest paid on funds borrowed from the fhlb and certain escrow accounts 
for the fiscal year ended june   our total interest expense was million compared to million and million  for the fiscal years ended june  and  respectively 
for the fiscal year ended june   interest expense decreased by million  or compared to the fiscal year ended june  this decrease was due primarily to a million decrease in interest paid on deposits primarily attributed to lower rates paid on our deposit accounts and a reduction in certificates of deposit as a percent of the total deposit portfolio 
compared to fiscal  our average cost of deposits in fiscal decreased by basis points from to while the average balance of interest bearing deposits increased by million from million to million 
interest expense on borrowings decreased by  or during fiscal compared to the fiscal year ended june  the average balance of borrowings outstanding during fiscal was million compared to million in fiscal the average cost of these borrowings for fiscal was compared to during fiscal the primary reason for the million  or  decrease in interest expense for the year ended june  compared to fiscal  was due to a million decrease in interest paid on deposit accounts which was partially offset by a million increase in interest expense on borrowed money 
our average cost of deposits declined basis points to during fiscal compared to during fiscal during fiscal year  the average balance of our certificates of deposit cds decreased million to million  a decrease compared to fiscal at june  and june   cds made up and  respectively  of our total deposits 
the average balance on our core deposit categories interest and non interest checking  savings and money market accounts increased million to million during fiscal compared to an average balance of million during fiscal interest rates on core deposits are typically less than rates paid on cds 
we believe that increasing our core deposits as a percentage of total deposits should decrease our weighted average cost of funds in a stable interest rate environment 
provision for loan losses 
we establish provisions for loan losses  which are charges to our operating results  in order to maintain our total allowance for losses at a level that we deem adequate to absorb known and inherent losses which are both probable and can be reasonably estimated 
our determination of the adequacy of the allowance is based upon the company s regular review of credit quality and is based upon  but not limited to  the following factors an evaluation of our loan portfolio  loss experience  current economic conditions  volume  growth  composition of the loan portfolio and other relevant factors 
the amount of our allowance for loan losses is only an estimate and actual losses may vary from these estimates 
we assess our allowance for loan loss at least quarterly and make any necessary adjustment to maintain our allowance for loan losses at a level deemed adequate 
for the years ended june   and  our provisions for loan losses were  million and million  respectively 
in fiscal  we charged off a total of  of loans  consisting of  in commercial business loans   in mortgage loans  and  in consumer loans 
at june   the amount of our allowance for loan losses was million compared to million at june  in assessing the amount of allowance for loan losses during the fiscal year ended june   we considered in particular the improvement in the amount of our non performing and delinquent loans  our lower level of classified assets and the increase in the proportion of our single family residential mortgage loans which generally are considered to have a lower degree of risk in our portfolio 
the percentage of the allowance for loan losses to net loans receivable decreased to at june  compared to at june  and at june  we believe that the allowance for loan loss was adequate at june  and represents all known and inherent losses in the portfolio that are both probable and reasonably estimable  however no assurance can be given as to the amount or timing of additional provisions for loan losses in the future as a result of potential increases in the amount of the company s non performing loans in the remainder of the company s loan portfolio 
regulatory agencies  in the course of their regular examinations  review the allowance for loss and carrying value of non performing assets 
no assurance can be given that these agencies might not require changes to the allowance for loan losses in the future 
non interest income 
non interest income is comprised of account service fees and charges  loan servicing fees  realized gains and losses on assets available or held for sale and increases in the cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance boli 
total non interest income for the years ended june    and was million  million and million  respectively 
the increase in non interest income of  or for fiscal compared to fiscal  was due primarily as a result of increases in service charges  fees and the cash surrender value of boli  which was partially offset by the decline in realized gains on sales of loans and securities 
during the fiscal year ended june   service charges and fees increased  or to million 
the increases in service charges were primarily the result of our recently implemented overdraft protection plan opp  increased retail sales of annuities and loan prepayment penalties 
for the fiscal year ended june   the company realized gains of  and  on the sale of securities and loans  respectively  compared to gains of million and million  partially offset by a million in penalties paid upon our prepayment of million of fhlb borrowings which had an average rate of  respectively  during the fiscal year ended june  non interest expense 
the primary components of non interest expense are compensation and employee benefits  occupancy and equipment expenses  data processing costs  deposit account services and a variety of other expenses 
for the years ended june    and  non interest expense totaled million  million and million  respectively 
the primary reason for the increase in non interest expenses in fiscal was due to a  increase in compensation and employee benefits 
compensation and benefits expenses totaled million  million and million  respectively  for the fiscal years ended june    and some of the factors affecting the increase in compensation and benefits include our increased branch network  increased costs to expand and support our lending function and costs of stock benefit plans that have increased due to the appreciation of our stock value and the full year impact of additional allocated shares in the recognition and retention plans 
the company s esop expense increased  or to million for june   compared to  and  for the years ended june  and  respectively 
expenses relating to rrp grants were   and  for fiscal years  and  respectively 
at june   we had full time and part time employees compared to full time and part time employees at june  occupancy and furniture and equipment expenses were million  million  and million for the fiscal years ended june    and  respectively 
the  increase in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to slight increases in operating costs as well as a full year of expenses associated with the operations of our th branch office 
advertising expenses for fiscal  and were   and  respectively 
for the fiscal years ended june    and  amortization of intangible assets was   and  respectively  data processing expenses were   and  respectively  deposit account service expenses were   and  respectively  and professional fees were   and  respectively 
increases in professional fees were due primarily to costs related to the company s review of potential acquisition transactions and other general corporate matters 
for the fiscal years ended june    and  other expenses  which include miscellaneous operating items  were million  million and million  respectively 
other expenses increased primarily due to our growth and diversification efforts 
income tax provision 
expense for income taxes amounted to million for the year ended june  this compares to a tax expense of million  and million for the years ended june  and  respectively 
the effective tax rates for fiscal  and were  and  respectively 
the decrease in the provision for taxes for the year ended june  was primarily related to a decrease in the pre tax income  decreased tax liability associated with the tax exempt interest income as a percentage of interest income of certain investment securities and increased exercises of non qualified stock options which increased the amount of our tax deductable employee compensation expense 
liquidity and commitments our primary sources of funds are from deposits  amortization of loans  loan and securities prepayments and repayments  interest income from mortgage backed securities and other investments  and other funds provided from operations 
while scheduled payments from the amortization of loans and mortgage backed securities and maturing investment securities are relatively predictable sources of funds  deposit flows and loan prepayments can be greatly influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
we also maintain excess funds in short term  interest bearing assets that provide additional liquidity 
we have also utilized outside borrowings  primarily from the fhlb of pittsburgh as an additional funding source 
we use our liquidity resources to fund existing and future loan commitments  to fund maturing certificates of deposit and demand deposit withdrawals  to invest in other interest earning assets  and to meet operating expenses 
at june   we had outstanding approved loan commitments totaling million and certificates of deposit maturing within the next twelve months amounting to million 
based upon historical experience  we anticipate that a significant portion of the maturing certificates of deposit will be reinvested in the bank 
during the year ended june  total amount of prepayments of loans and mortgage backed securities approximated the prepayments of loans and mortgage backed securities during the year ended june  we experienced a decline in the amount of bonds with call provisions having those call provisions exercised by the issuer 
we recently have also increased our use of borrowings from the fhlb of pittsburgh as a cost effective means to obtain funds at varying maturities to implement some of our asset liability strategies 
our outstanding borrowings from the fhlb of pittsburgh have increased to million at june  compared to million at june  under terms of our borrowing agreement with the fhlb of pittsburgh  we pledge certain residential mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities as well as our stock in the fhlb as collateral for these advances 
at june   we had million in additional borrowing capacity available from the fhlb of pittsburgh 
we have not used  and currently are not intending to use  any significant off balance sheet financing arrangement for liquidity or other purposes 
our financial assets with off balance sheet risk are limited to our obligations to fund loans to borrowers pursuant to existing loan commitments 
additionally  we have not had any transactions  arrangements or other relationships with any unconsolidated  limited purpose entities that could affect our liquidity or capital resources  nor do we  or currently intend to  engage in trading commodity contracts 
we anticipate that we will continue to have sufficient funds and alternative funding sources to meet our current commitments 
the company s contractual obligations as of june  are as follows payments due by period total less than year years years more than years dollars in thousands federal home loan debt     operating leases   severance agreements total obligations      off balance sheet obligations the company is a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit 
those instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheet 
the company s exposure to credit loss in the event of non performance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual notional amount of those instruments 
the company uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on balance sheet instruments see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item herein 
the company s contingent liabilities and commitments as of june  are as follows total less than year years years more than years dollars in thousands lines of credit    standby letters of credit   other commitments to make loans   undisbursed funds on previous disbursed loans   total     impact of inflation and changing prices the financial statements  accompanying notes  and related financial data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of our operations 
most of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature  therefore  the impact of interest rates has a greater impact on our performance than the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services 
for a discussion of the impact of recent accounting pronouncements on the company s financial condition or results of operations  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in item hereof 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk asset liability management and interest rate risk the market value of assets and liabilities  as well as future earnings  can be affected by interest rate risk 
market values of financial assets have an inverse relationship to rates  ie  when interest rates rise  the market value of many of the company s assets declines and when rates fall  the market value of many of the company s assets rise 
the primary assets of the company are loans to borrowers who often have the ability to prepay their loan 
therefore  in a falling rate environment  the increase in the market value of the company s assets is limited by this option for the borrower to prepay the loan 
the ability to maximize net interest income is largely dependent upon the achievement of a positive interest spread that can be maintained during fluctuations in prevailing interest rates 
interest rate sensitivity gap gap is a measure of the difference between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities that either mature or re price within a specified time period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest earning assets exceeds the amount of interest bearing liabilities  and is considered negative when interest bearing liabilities exceed interest earning assets 
generally  during a period of rising interest rates  a negative gap would adversely affect net interest income  while a positive gap would result in an increase in net interest income 
during a period of falling interest rates  a negative gap would generally result in an increase in net interest income  and a positive gap would result in a decrease in net interest income 
this is usually the case  however  interest rates on differing financial instruments will not always change at the same time or to the same extent 
the following gap table shows the amount as of june  of assets and liabilities projected to mature or re price within various time periods 
this table includes certain assumptions we have made that affect the rate at which loans will prepay and the duration of core deposits 
changes in interest rates may affect these assumptions which would impact our gap position

we have adopted asset liability management policies designed to quantify the interest rate risk caused by mismatches in the maturities and re pricing of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
these interest rate risk and asset liability management actions are taken under the guidance of the asset liability management committee alco 
the alco s purpose is to communicate  coordinate and control asset liability management consistent with our business plan and board approved policies 
the objective of the alco is to manage assets and funding sources to produce results that are consistent with liquidity  capital adequacy  growth  risk and profitability goals 
the alco meets at least quarterly and monitors the volume and mix of assets and funding sources taking into account the relative costs and spreads  the interest rate sensitivity gap and liquidity needs 
the alco also reviews economic conditions and interest rate projections  current and projected liquidity needs and capital positions  anticipated changes in the mix of assets and liabilities  and interest rate exposure limits versus current projections pursuant to gap analysis and interest income simulations 
at each meeting  the alco recommends changes in strategy as appropriate 
interest rate risk issues are also discussed by the board of directors on a regular basis 
management meets weekly to monitor progress in achieving asset liability targets approved by the board  particularly the type and rate on asset generation and sources of funding 
in order to manage our assets and liabilities and improve our interest rate risk position  emphasis has been placed on the origination of assets with shorter maturities or adjustable rates such as commercial and multi family real estate loans  construction loans  home equity loans and to a lesser extent commercial business loans 
at the same time  other actions include attempts to increase our core deposits and the use of fhlb advances as additional sources of funds 
we also classify a portion of the longer term fixed rate loans we originate as held for sale 
during the years ended june  and  we sold long term  generally year  fixed rate single family residential mortgage loans totaling million and million  respectively 
the alco regularly reviews interest rate risk by  among other things  examining the impact of alternative interest rate environments on net interest income and net portfolio value npv  and the change in npv 
npv is the difference between the market value of assets and the market value of liabilities and off balance sheet items under various interest rate scenarios 
sensitivity is the difference measured in basis points between the npv to assets ratio at market rate and the npv to assets ratio determined under each rate scenario 
the alco monitors both the npv and sensitivity according to guidelines established by the office of thrift supervision ots in thrift bulletin a management of interest rate risk  investment securities and derivative activities  and board approved limitations 
presented below  as of june  and  is an analysis of the interest rate risk position as measured by npv and sensitivity based upon various rate scenarios 
these values have been obtained from data submitted by the bank to the ots 
the ots performs scenario analysis to estimate current or base case economic value and estimates npv that would result from instantaneous  parallel shifts of the yields on various financial instruments of plus and minus  and basis points 
due to the level of current interest rates  no values are calculated for hypothetical rate scenarios of down or down basis points 
the model does not value new business activities 
it only provides an estimate of economic value at a point in time and the economic value of the same portfolio under the above referenced interest rate scenarios

npv is more sensitive and may be more negatively impacted by rising interest rates than by declining rates 
this occurs primarily because as rates rise  the market value of long term fixed rate assets  like fixed rate mortgage loans  declines due to both the rate increase and slowing prepayments 
when rates decline  these assets do not experience similar appreciation in value 
this is due to the decrease in the duration of the asset resulting from the increase in prepayments
