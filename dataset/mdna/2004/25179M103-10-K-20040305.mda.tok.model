operation of properties the day to day operation of oil and gas properties are the responsibility of an operator designated under pooling or operating agreements 
the operator supervises production  maintains production records  employs field personnel and performs other functions 
the charges under operating agreements customarily vary with the depth and location of the well being operated 
devon is the operator of  of its wells 
as operator  devon receives reimbursement for direct expenses incurred in the performance of its duties as well as monthly per well producing and drilling overhead reimbursement at rates customarily charged in the area 
in presenting its financial data  devon records the monthly overhead reimbursements as a reduction of general and administrative expense  which is a common industry practice 
organization structure devon s north american properties are concentrated within five geographic areas 
operations in the united states are focused in the permian basin  the mid continent  the rocky mountains and onshore and offshore gulf coast regions 
canadian operations are focused in the western canadian sedimentary basin in alberta and british columbia 
operations outside north america currently include azerbaijan  brazil  china  egypt  indonesia  russia  syria  and areas in west africa  including equatorial guinea  gabon  cote d ivoire  nigeria and angola 
maintaining a tight geographic focus in selected core areas has allowed devon to improve operating and capital efficiency

canadian dollars converted to us dollars at the rate of canadian us united states permian basin devon s permian basin assets are located in portions of southeast new mexico and west texas 
these assets include conventional oil and gas properties from a wide variety of geologic formations and productive depths 
the permian basin represented of devon s proved reserves at december  devon s leasehold position in southeast new mexico encompasses more than  acres of developed lands and  acres of undeveloped land and minerals 
historically  devon has been a very active operator in this area developing gas from the high productivity morrow formation and oil in the lower risk delaware formation 
in the west texas area of the permian basin  devon maintains a base of oil production with long life reserves 
many of these reserves are from both operated and non operated positions in large enhanced oil recovery units such as the wasson odc unit  the willard unit  the reeves unit  the north welch unit and the anton irish clearfork unit 
these oil producing units often exhibit low decline rates 
devon also owns a significant acreage position in west texas with over  acres of developed lands and over  acres of undeveloped land and minerals at december  mid continent the mid continent region includes portions of texas  oklahoma and kansas 
these areas encompass a wide variety of geologic formations and productive depths and produce both oil and natural gas 
devon s mid continent production has historically come from conventional oil and gas properties 
however  the barnett shale  acquired in our merger with mitchell energy  is a non conventional gas resource 
the mid continent region represented of devon s proved reserves at december  approximately of devon s proved reserves in the mid continent area are in the barnett shale 
the barnett shale  devon s largest producing field  is known as a tight gas formation 
this means that  in its natural state  the formation is resistant to the production of natural gas 
mitchell spent decades understanding how to efficiently develop and produce this gas 
the resulting technology has yielded a low risk and highly profitable natural gas operation 
devon holds  net acres and nearly  producing wells in the barnett shale 
devon s average working interest is approximately 
devon has experienced success extracting gas from the barnett shale by using light sand fracturing 
light sand fracturing yields better results than earlier techniques  is less expensive and can be used to complete new wells and to refracture existing wells 
refractured wells often exceed their original flow rates 
devon is also applying horizontal drilling and closer well spacing to further enhance the value of the barnett shale 
devon s marketing and midstream operations transport and process its barnett shale production along with barnett shale production from unrelated third parties 
the transport system consists of approximately  miles of pipeline  a mmcf per day gas processing plant  and a  bbls per day ngl fractionator 
in  devon plans to drill a total of new barnett shale wells including horizontals and verticals 
more than half of the horizontal wells will be drilled outside the core development area in an 
table of contents effort to further expand the productive area of the field 
the barnett shale is expected to continue to be an important producing area for devon for the foreseeable future 
current production from the barnett shale is approximately mmcf and  bbls of oil and ngls per day net 
rocky mountains devon s operations in the rocky mountain region include properties in wyoming  montana  utah  and northern new mexico 
these assets include conventional oil and gas properties and coalbed methane projects 
as of december   the rocky mountain region comprised of devon s proved reserves 
approximately of devon s proved reserves in the rocky mountains are from coalbed methane 
devon began producing coalbed methane in the san juan basin of new mexico in the mid s and began drilling coalbed methane wells in the powder river basin of wyoming in as of december   devon has drilled  coalbed methane wells in the powder river basin 
devon s net coalbed methane gas production from the basin was approximately mmcf per day as of december   and devon plans to drill new wells in the powder river basin in current production in the basin is primarily from the wyodak coal formation 
development of the deeper big george formation could significantly expand the coalbed methane play into the western portion of the powder river basin 
the recently approved federal environmental impact statement should facilitate development of the deeper formation 
eighty five of the wells planned in target these deeper coals 
devon s most significant conventional gas project in the rocky mountains region is the washakie field in wyoming 
devon is continuing to develop and grow production from this field 
in  devon drilled wells and plans to drill another wells in devon has interests in over  acres 
devon s current net production from washakie is approximately mmcf and  bbls of oil and ngls per day 
gulf coast devon s gulf coast properties are located in south and east texas  louisiana and mississippi 
most of the wells in the region are completed in conventional sandstone formations 
at december   the gulf coast accounted for approximately of devon s proved reserves 
devon s operations in south texas have focused on exploration in the edwards  wilcox and frio vicksburg formations 
devon has high working interests  up to  in several producing fields 
east texas is an important conventional gas producing region for devon 
carthage bethany and groesbeck are two of the primary producing areas 
wells produce from the cotton valley sands  the travis peak sands and from shallower sands and carbonates 
devon operates over  producing wells in east texas and is currently employing a five rig drilling and recompletion program to continue low risk  infill development throughout the area 
devon s current net production from east texas is about mmcf and  bbls of oil and ngls per day 
gulf of mexico the offshore gulf of mexico accounted for of devon s production and of year end proved reserves 
devon is among the largest independent oil and gas producers in the gulf of mexico and operates platforms and caissons 
the merger with ocean more than tripled devon s gulf reserves 
gulf of mexico operations are typically differentiated by water depth 
the shelf is defined by water depths of feet or less 
the deepwater is at depths beyond feet 
devon has active development and drilling programs ongoing in both the shelf and deepwater areas 
in the ocean merger  devon acquired interests in the nansen boomvang complex in the east breaks area of the deepwater gulf of mexico 
devon acquired a working interest in the nansen field and a interest in the boomvang field 
ocean established oil and natural gas production at nansen boomvang in the nansen and boomvang production spars have a combined daily production 
table of contents capacity of  bbls of oil and mmcf of gas 
devon s share of current production from the fields is about  bbls of oil and mmcf of gas per day 
ocean had two additional deepwater development projects under construction in redhawk garden banks is expected to commence production in the second half of devon has a working interest in redhawk and estimates net production at about  boe per day 
magnolia garden banks is expected to commence production near year end devon has a working interest in this project 
net production is estimated at between  and  boe per day 
in the deepwater of the gulf of mexico  devon drilled two exploratory discovery wells in the sturgis well atwater valley found more than net feet of oil pay sands 
sturgis  in  feet of water  was the second well in devon s four well joint venture with chevrontexaco 
upon completion of the fourth well  devon will earn a working interest in deepwater blocks 
the fourth well is planned for early the second deepwater discovery in was at st 
malo walker ridge 
st 
malo  in  feet of water  encountered more than net feet of oil pay 
st 
malo and the previously announced cascade discovery walker ridge are located in the lower tertiary trend 
based on early evidence  the lower tertiary trend may hold significant reserve potential 
devon plans to drill appraisal wells to better define the st 
malo and cascade discoveries in the first half of devon also plans to drill an appraisal well to the sturgis discovery and additional lower tertiary exploratory wells during in  devon had a notable shelf discovery on its grays prospect galveston block 
three producing wells from this discovery were brought on production in early at approximately mmcf per day net to devon s interest 
the federal government is encouraging gulf of mexico operators to drill deep shelf wells  wells drilled on the shelf to a depth greater than  feet  through a reduced royalty incentive program 
devon plans to drill to deep shelf wells in canada devon is among the largest independent oil and gas producers in canada and operates in most of the producing basins in western canada 
as of december   of devon s proved reserves were canadian 
many of the canadian basins where devon operates are accessible for drilling only in the winter when the ground is frozen 
consequently  the winter season  from december through march  is the most active drilling period 
devon expects to drill about wells in the winter program and spend million  or nearly half of the full year canadian capital budget 
the winter drilling is focused on three major areas the deep basin  northeastern british columbia and the northern plains of alberta 
in the deep basin  plans call for wells compared with wells last winter 
in northeastern bc  wells are planned  compared with the previous winter 
in the northern plains  we expect to drill more than wells this winter  compared with wells a year ago 
the anderson acquisition in significantly strengthened devon s holdings in the deep basin of western alberta 
devon had sought for years to obtain a significant acreage position in the deep basin  but other operators  including anderson  already controlled most of the acreage 
as a result of the anderson acquisition  devon now holds over  net acres in the deep basin 
the profitability of devon s operations in the deep basin is enhanced by its ownership in nine gas processing plants in the area 
devon plans to drill about total wells in the deep basin in deep basin reservoirs tend to be rich in liquids  producing up to barrels of ngls with each mmcf of gas 
in  devon commenced production from the first of several wells it has drilled in the grizzly valley area of the foothills region of northeastern british columbia 
due to gas pipeline and processing limitations  initial production was limited to about mmcf of gas per day 
however  a pipeline extension completed in allowed devon to increase production from this area to about mmcf per day 
with 
table of contents the pipeline extension complete  devon can continue to tie in additional wells in the area 
net production from the entire foothills region is approximately mmcf of gas per day 
devon also acquired from anderson approximately million net acres in the mackenzie delta region and the shallow waters of the beaufort sea in northern canada 
in  a devon well in the mackenzie delta encountered over feet of natural gas pay 
production of this gas awaits an export pipeline to markets in canada and the united states 
various industry proposals suggest that a pipeline could be built later in the decade 
devon also drills for and produces cold flow heavy oil in the lloydminster area of alberta and saskatchewan where oil is found in multiple horizons generally at depths of  to  feet 
in  devon drilled wells in the lloydminster area 
average net daily production from the area is approximately mmcf of natural gas and  bbls of crude oil 
devon also owns a working interest in the conocophillips operated surmont thermal heavy oil project 
surmont  located north of jackfish  is designed to produce up to  barrels of heavy oil per day by surmont will also apply sagd recovery technology 
international the ocean merger more than doubled devon s oil and gas reserves outside north america 
at december   these international countries accounted for of devon s worldwide proved reserves 
most significant was ocean s working interest in the exxon mobil operated zafiro field  offshore equatorial guinea in west africa 
during  production from zafiro increased significantly due to the addition of the southern expansion area sea in july 
production from the sea increased total field capacity to  barrels of oil per day 
devon s net share increased by about  barrels to more than  barrels per day 
devon s production from zafiro is expected to decline by about  barrels per day in the second quarter of the decline will occur when devon reaches payout of a portion of its investment in the project and the government s share of production increases 
devon experienced another boost in international production in when its panyu project offshore china commenced production late in the year 
panyu  in the pearl river mouth of the south china sea  was discovered in in early  production from the first eight of planned wells reached  barrels per day 
devon has a working interest in the project and expects its share of production to average about  barrels per day in in azerbaijan in the caspian sea  devon has a carried working interest in the azeri chirag gunashli  or acg  oil development project 
devon estimates that the acg field contains over billion barrels of gross proved oil reserves 
oil production from the acg field will increase dramatically upon completion of the baku t bilisi ceyhan pipeline  which is planned for devon s net share is expected to peak at about  barrels per day in or devon also acquired minor producing properties in the ocean merger in cote d ivoire  egypt  indonesia and russia 
ocean also held exploratory blocks in angola  brazil  equatorial guinea  nigeria and syria 
devon plans to drill exploratory wells in each of the aforementioned countries  except cote d ivoire and indonesia  in devon also produces oil and holds exploratory blocks in gabon 
title to properties title to properties is subject to contractual arrangements customary in the oil and gas industry  liens for current taxes not yet due and  in some instances  other encumbrances 
devon believes that such burdens do not materially detract from the value of such properties or from the respective interests therein or materially interfere with their use in the operation of the business 
as is customary in the industry in the case of undeveloped properties  little investigation of record title is made at the time of acquisition other than a preliminary review of local records 
investigations  
table of contents generally including a title opinion of outside counsel  are made prior to the consummation of an acquisition of producing properties and before commencement of drilling operations on undeveloped properties 
item legal proceedings royalty matters numerous gas producers and related parties  including devon  have been named in various lawsuits alleging violation of the federal false claims act 
the suits allege that the producers and related parties used below market prices  improper deductions  improper measurement techniques and transactions with affiliates which resulted in underpayment of royalties in connection with natural gas and natural gas liquids produced and sold from federal and indian owned or controlled lands 
the principal suit in which devon is a defendant is united states ex rel 
wright v 
chevron usa  inc et al 
the wright case 
the suit was originally filed in august in the united states district court for the eastern district of texas  but was consolidated in october with the other suits for pre trial proceedings in the united states district court for the district of wyoming 
on july   the district of wyoming remanded the wright case back to the eastern district of texas to resume proceedings 
devon believes that it has acted reasonably  has legitimate and strong defenses to all allegations in the suit  and has paid royalties in good faith 
devon does not currently believe that it is subject to material exposure in association with this lawsuit and no liability has been recorded in connection therewith 
devon is a defendant in certain private royalty owner litigation filed in wyoming regarding deductibility of certain post production costs from royalties payable by devon 
the plaintiffs in these lawsuits propose to expand them into county or state wide class actions relating specifically to transportation and related costs associated with devon s wyoming gas production 
a significant portion of such production is  or will be  transported through facilities owned by thunder creek gas services  llc  of which devon owns a interest 
devon believes that it has acted reasonably and paid royalties in good faith and in accordance with its obligations under its oil and gas leases and applicable law  and devon does not believe that it is subject to material exposure in association with this litigation
