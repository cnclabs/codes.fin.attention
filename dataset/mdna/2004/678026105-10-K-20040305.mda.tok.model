item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis together with selected financial data and our financial statements and the notes to those statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements based on our current expectations  assumptions  estimates and projections about us and our industry 
these forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those indicated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  as more fully described under cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements in this form k 
except to the extent required by law  we undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward looking statements  even if new information becomes available or other events occur in the future 
critical accounting policies in our selection of critical accounting policies  our objective is to properly reflect our financial position and results of operations in each reporting period in a manner that will be understood by those who utilize our financial statements 
often we must use our judgment about uncertainties 
there are several critical accounting policies that we have put into practice that have an important effect on our reported financial results 
we have contingent liabilities and future claims for which we have made estimates of the amount of the eventual cost to liquidate these liabilities or claims 
these liabilities and claims sometimes involve threatened or actual litigation where damages have been quantified and we have made an assessment of our exposure and recorded a provision in our accounts to cover an expected loss 
other claims or liabilities have been estimated based on our experience in these matters and  when appropriate  the advice of outside counsel or other outside experts 
upon the ultimate resolution of these uncertainties  our future reported financial results will be impacted by the difference between our estimates and the actual amounts paid to settle a liability 
examples of areas where we have made important estimates of future liabilities include litigation  taxes  postretirement benefits  warranty claims and contract claims 
the determination of impairment on long lived assets  including goodwill  is conducted when indicators of impairment are present 
if such indicators were present  the determination of the amount of impairment would be based on our judgments as to the future operating cash flows to be generated from these assets throughout their estimated useful lives 
our industry is highly cyclical and our estimates of the period over which future cash flows will be generated  as well as the predictability of these cash flows  can have a significant impact on the carrying value of these assets and  in periods of prolonged down cycles  may result in impairment charges 
we recognize revenue and profit as work progresses on long term  fixed price contracts using the percentage of completion method  which relies on estimates of total expected contract revenue and costs 
we follow this method since reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and costs applicable to various stages of a contract can be made 
recognized revenues and profit are subject to revisions as the contract progresses to completion 
revisions in profit estimates are charged to income or expense in the period in which the facts and circumstances that give rise to the revision become known 
provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which losses are determined 
our valuation allowances  especially related to potential bad debts in accounts receivable and to obsolescence or market value declines of inventory  involve reviews of underlying details of these assets  known trends in the marketplace and the application of historical factors that provide us with a basis for recording these allowances 
if market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  or if our historical experience is materially different from future experience  additional allowances may be required 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not likely be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to expense in the period such determination was made 
the selection of the useful lives of many of our assets requires the judgments of our operating personnel as to the length of these useful lives 
should our estimates be too long or short  we might eventually report a disproportionate number of losses or gains upon disposition or retirement of our long lived assets 
we believe our estimates of useful lives are appropriate 
overview we provide a broad range of products and services to the oil and gas industry through our offshore products  well site services and tubular services business segments 
demand for our products and services is cyclical and substantially dependent upon activity levels in the oil and gas industry  particularly our customers willingness to spend capital on the exploration for and development of oil and gas reserves 
demand for our products and services by our customers is highly sensitive to current and expected oil and natural gas prices 
our offshore products segment provides highly engineered and technically designed products for offshore oil and gas development and production systems and facilities 
sales of our offshore products and services depend upon the development of offshore production systems  repairs and upgrades of existing drilling rigs and construction of new drilling rigs 
in this segment  we are particularly influenced by deepwater drilling and production activities 
in our well site services business segment  we provide hydraulic well control services  pressure control equipment and rental tools  drilling rigs and work force accommodations  catering and logistics services 
demand for our well site services depends upon the level of worldwide drilling and workover activity 
through our tubular services segment  we distribute a broad range of casing and tubing 
sales of tubular products and services depend upon the overall level of drilling activity and the types of wells being drilled 
energy and oilfield service activities are highly cyclical  depending upon crude oil and natural gas pricing  among other things 
beginning in late and continuing through the early part of  stabilization of oil and gas prices led to increases in drilling activity as well as the refurbishment and new construction of drilling rigs 
in the second half of  crude oil prices declined substantially and reached levels below per barrel in early with this decline in pricing  many of our customers substantially reduced their capital spending and related activities 
this industry downturn continued through most of the price of crude oil and natural gas increased over levels in and due to improved demand for oil  supply reductions by opec member countries and reductions in natural gas storage levels 
crude oil and natural gas prices decreased significantly from levels reached in early by the end of the economic slowdown in the united states and the rest of the world  moderate weather and the resultant increased inventories of oil and gas  especially in the united states  contributed to those price declines 
with those price reductions  our customers responded with decreased drilling activity and spending on exploration and development 
in early  oil and gas prices began to increase and they are currently at relatively high historic levels 
we have a diversified product and service offering which has exposure throughout the oil and gas cycle 
demand for our tubular services and well site services is highly correlated to movements in the rig count in the united states 
the table below sets forth a summary of north american rig activity  as measured by baker hughes incorporated  as of and for the periods indicated 
average rig count for the year ended rig count as of december  january  us    canada north america      canadian rig counts typically increase during the peak winter drilling season 
the rig count in the united states and canada  as measured by baker hughes incorporated  fell from  rigs in february to rigs in april the downturn in activity in and had a material adverse effect on demand for our products and services  and the results of our operations decreased significantly 
our business benefited from the improvement in crude oil and natural gas pricing in and early and the resulting increases in the rig count in and the first half of during  the us rig count decreased in the first half of the year 
the us rig count reached its lowest level since when it totaled rigs on april  since then  the us rig count has risen and totaled  as of december  we believe that our offshore products segment lagged the general market recovery in and because its sales primarily relate to offshore construction and production facility development which generally occur later in the exploration and development cycle 
worldwide offshore construction and development activity improved in  and backlog in our offshore products segment increased to million at december   compared to million at december  we reported record results for our offshore product segment in and as a result of this increased backlog 
our backlog has decreased to million as of december  reflecting decreased activity in support of offshore construction and production facility development 
as a result  we expect activity in the offshore products segment to result in reduced revenues compared to with smaller projects and lower margin work 
throughout  north american oilfield activity levels  as measured by rig counts  increased as exploration and production companies spent additional cash flows resulting from higher oil and gas prices 
however  the rig count increase resulted primarily from shallow land drilling activity while the us offshore gulf of mexico rig count remained relatively flat in our tubular services and well site services businesses results of operations are impacted by activity levels in the us gulf of mexico 
the lack of increased drilling in the us gulf of mexico and other more service oriented areas  versus the shallow land wells being drilled  has resulted in a lower than anticipated increase in oil service revenue and profitability in we expect strong canadian and us land drilling activity to continue in in addition  contributions from late and early acquisitions should favorably impact results of operations in our well site services segment in management believes that fundamental oil and gas supply and demand factors will lead to increased drilling activity in north america over time 
the combination of declining us natural gas production  relatively high cash flow for exploration and production companies  solid demand growth for both oil and natural gas and expected continued opec discipline should lead to continued rise in oilfield activity levels 
however  there can be no assurance that these expectations will be realized or that increased activity will be in regions that will benefit our business segments 
we view the recent increases in oil and natural gas prices and reduction in related supplies as important steps toward increased demand for oilfield service activity 
the combination prior to our initial public offering in february  scf iii  lp owned majority interests in oil states  hwc and pti  and scf iv  lp owned a majority interest in sooner 
l 
e 
simmons associates  incorporated is the ultimate general partner of scf iii  lp and scf iv  lp lp simmons  the chairman of our board of directors  is the sole shareholder of le simmons associates  incorporated 
immediately prior to the closing of our initial public offering  the combination closed and hwc  pti and sooner merged with wholly owned subsidiaries of oil states 
as a result  hwc  sooner and pti became our wholly owned subsidiaries 
the financial results of oil states  hwc and pti have been combined from the beginning of calendar until february  using reorganization accounting  which yields results similar to the pooling of interests method 
the combined results of oil states  hwc and pti form the basis for the discussion of our results of operations for those periods 
the operations of oil states  hwc and pti represent two of our business segments  offshore products and well site services 
concurrently with the closing of our initial public offering in february  oil states acquired sooner  and the acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
the pro forma financial statement for the year ended december  reflects the acquisition of sooner effective as of january  following the acquisition of sooner  we reported under three business segments 
consolidated and pro forma results of operations year ended december  consolidated proforma revenues well site services offshore products tubular services total gross margin well site services offshore products tubular services corporate other total gross margin as a percent of revenues well site services offshore products tubular services total operating income loss well site services offshore products tubular services corporate other total year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues 
revenues increased million  or  to million during the year ended december  compared to revenues of million during the year ended december  well site services revenues increased million  or  and offshore products revenues increased million  or  during the same period 
well site services revenues increased compared to the prior year primarily due to increased drilling activity in canada and the united states  favorable canadian dollar exchange rates  which strengthened compared to the us dollar in compared to resulting in an increase of approximately million  and the impact of acquisitions completed in the third quarter of canadian expenses were also impacted by exchange rate movements in compared to and offset some of these revenue gains 
offshore products revenues increased primarily as a result of greater activity supporting offshore production facility construction  primarily in the us gulf of mexico  and the impact of acquisitions completed in the third quarter of tubular services revenues increased million  or  in the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
this revenue increase resulted from greater quantities shipped caused by higher rig counts partially offset by lower international sales and reduced revenue per ton shipped caused by product mix oriented to shallow land drilling 
gross margin 
our gross margins  which we calculate before a deduction for depreciation expense  increased million  or  from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december well site services gross margins increased million  or  to million in the year ended december  within our well site services segment  shallow drilling and specialty rental tool businesses gross margins increased million  or  and million  or  respectively  during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  primarily as a result of rigs added to the fleet and the rental tool acquisitions completed 
also in the well site services segment  our work force accommodations  catering and logistics services and modular building construction services gross margins increased by million  or  during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  because of increased camp and catering activity in canada and work supporting the canadian military in afghanistan and bosnia 
our hydraulic workover gross margins decreased by million  or  as a result of decreased activity in venezuela and a reclassification of certain field expenses  formerly classified as selling  general and administrative expenses  to operating expense 
these decreases were almost fully offset by increased gross margin from work in algeria  which commenced in late gross margin as a percent of revenues in well site services increased from in to in primarily because of more profitable accommodations operations caused by higher activity levels 
offshore products gross margins increased million  or  from million in the year ended december  to million during primarily due to increased revenues from shipments and work in progress 
our offshore products gross margin percentage declined by due primarily to a greater percentage of lower margin fabrication work compared to the prior period and to certain project losses incurred in our subsea pipeline operations and to reduced margins in our winch and crane businesses 
tubular services gross margins decreased to million  or of tubular services revenues in the year ended december  compared to million  or of tubular services revenues  in the year ended december  as a result of higher margin sales during  especially in the fourth quarter  and foreign sales  which occurred primarily in the first half of  and did not reoccur in selling  general and administrative expenses 
during the year ended december   selling  general and administrative expenses sg a totaled million  or of revenues  compared to sg a of million  or of revenues  for the year ended december  increased sg a expense primarily resulted from acquisitions completed in the third quarter of this increase was only partially offset by lower post employment benefit costs caused by the settlement of certain plan liabilities during the current year as explained in footnote to the consolidated and combined financial statements contained in this annual report on form k 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense increased million in compared to due primarily to acquisitions of businesses completed in and capital expenditures made in and operating income 
our operating income represents revenues less i cost of sales  ii selling  general and administrative expenses and iii depreciation and amortization expense plus other operating income 
our operating income increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million during well site services operating income increased by million  or  while offshore products operating income increased by million  or 
tubular services operating income was million during the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
corporate and other charges increased by million in compared to interest expense 
interest expense increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  increased interest expense was attributable to higher debt levels resulting from acquisitions completed during the third quarter of  capital expenditures made during and and the write off of million  after taxes  of unamortized debt issue costs in the fourth quarter of upon the closing of a new bank credit agreement 
income tax expense 
income tax expense totaled million  or of pretax income  during the year ended december  compared to million  or of pretax income  during the year ended december  decreased amounts of net operating loss carryforwards available to offset currently taxable income has resulted in a higher annual effective tax rate for the year compared to year ended december  compared to pro forma year ended december  revenues 
revenues decreased million  or  during the year ended december  to million compared to the year ended december  revenues in our well site services segment decreased million  or  in the year ended december  compared to the previous year 
within well site services  comparing the year to the year  our work force accommodations  catering and logistics services and modular building construction services revenues decreased million  or  due to lower activity in canada and the us gulf of mexico  our land drilling revenues decreased million  or  due to lower activity and drilling rates  primarily in west texas  our rental tool services revenues decreased million  or  because lower activity in our us gulf of mexico locations was partially offset by the impact of acquisitions made by the company in march and august and our workover services revenues decreased million  or  as activity  especially in the us gulf of mexico  decreased compared to our offshore products segment revenues increased million  or  in the year compared to the year  due to significantly increased activity supporting offshore production facility construction  primarily in deepwater locations 
our tubular services segment revenues in the year were million  or  lower than in the year because of decreased drilling activity in the united states and significantly lower foreign sales in compared to gross margins 
our gross margins  which we calculate before a deduction for depreciation and amortization expense  decreased million  or  to million in the year compared to the year our gross margin as a percent of revenue improved from in the year to in due to a more favorable mix of our revenues consisting of higher margin offshore products and well site services activities with less of our revenues consisting of tubular sales 
our offshore products gross margins increased million  or  in the year compared to the year and our gross margin percentage increased to in the year compared to in the year as higher volumes of product shipments lead to increased operating efficiencies in the year our well site services gross margins decreased million  or  to million in the year compared to the year the gross margin percentage for well site services declined to in the year compared to in within our well site services segment  our land drilling business gross margins decreased million  or  to million in compared to total gross margin of million in because of decreased drilling activity and lower prices obtained for drilling services  our rental tool business reported gross margins totaling million  or of revenue  compared to gross margins totaling million  or of revenue in as we saw increased price competition for rental tools which offset the positive effect of our rental tool business acquisitions  our workover services gross margins in the year totaled million  or of revenues  compared to gross margins of million  or of revenues  as decreased us gulf of mexico margins and activity more than offset the positive effect of higher international activity  and our work force accommodations  catering and logistics services and modular building construction services businesses gross margin decreased in to million  or of revenue  compared to million  or of revenue  in the previous year because of the impact of lower drilling activity in in canada and the us gulf of mexico and because a greater percentage of revenues resulted from relatively low margin construction activity 
our tubular services margins in the year totaled million  a decrease of million  or  compared to the year while tubular services gross margins were approximately the same in each of the last two years  the volume of tubular products shipped in decreased by approximately compared to selling  general and administrative expense 
during the year  selling  general and administrative expenses sg a increased million  or  to million from million in the year as a percent of revenues  sg a increased to in compared to in increased costs in the year compared to at our offshore products segment  driven by higher activity and increased employee incentive costs were only partially offset by lower well site services segment costs associated with decreased activity within that segment 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense totaled million in the year compared to million in the million decrease is principally related to the elimination of goodwill amortization in in comparison  we amortized million of goodwill in the year partially offset by additional depreciation and amortization associated with capital additions and intangibles recorded as part of business acquisitions in the years and operating income 
our operating income represents revenues less i cost of sales  ii sg a  and iii depreciation and amortization expense plus other operating income 
our operating income decreased million  or  to million for from million in operating income from our well site services segment decreased million from million for to million for operating income for our offshore products segment increased million to million for compared to million in operating income in our tubular services segment decreased million from million in to million in corporate other operating loss improved from a loss of million in to a loss of million in primarily because of the discontinuance of goodwill amortization in net interest expense 
net interest expense totaled million in the year  a decrease of million  or  compared to net interest expense of million in both interest rates and average debt balances were lower during when compared to additionally  a total of million of unamortized debt issue costs were expensed in upon the execution of a new credit facility 
income tax expense 
our income tax expense totaled million  or of pretax income  in the year compared to million  or of pretax income in the year the increased tax expense is primarily due to the higher effective tax rate which increased in compared to as a result of a lower amount of net operating loss carryforwards available to offset taxable income 
liquidity and capital resources our primary liquidity needs are to fund capital expenditures  such as expanding and upgrading our manufacturing facilities and equipment  increasing and replacing our drilling rig  rental tool and workover assets and our accommodation units  funding new product development and funding general working capital needs 
in addition  capital is needed to fund strategic business acquisitions 
our primary sources of funds have been cash flow from operations and proceeds from borrowings under our bank facilities 
cash was provided by operations during the years ended december  and in the amounts of million and million  respectively 
cash provided by operations in was generated by our net income plus depreciation and amortization which was partially offset by working capital invested in in our offshore products and tubular services businesses 
cash was used in investing activities during the years ended december  and in the amounts of million and million  respectively 
capital expenditures totaled million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
capital expenditures in and consisted principally of purchases of assets for our well site services businesses and for expansion of our offshore products manufacturing capacity 
we completed acquisitions for cash consideration totaling million and million  respectively  during the years ended december  and we currently expect to spend a total of approximately million during to upgrade our equipment and facilities and expand our product and service offerings 
we expect to fund these capital expenditures with internally generated funds and proceeds from borrowings under our revolving credit facilities 
in january  the company completed the acquisition of several related rental tool companies for cash consideration of million 
this acquisition was funded by the company s revolving credit facility 
see note to the consolidated and combined financial statements contained in this annual report on form k 
net cash of million was provided from financing activities during the year ended december   primarily as a result of revolving credit borrowings and proceeds from stock option exercises 
as of december   we had million outstanding under our primary bank credit facility and an additional million of outstanding letters of credit  leaving million available to be drawn under the facility 
our total debt represented of our total capitalization at december  the following summarizes our debt and lease obligations at december  in thousands due in less due in due in due after december  total than year years years years debt and lease obligations long term debt  including capital leases     non cancelable operating leases      total contractual cash obligations      our debt obligations at december  are included in our consolidated balance sheet  which is a part of our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
we have not entered into any material leases subsequent to december  we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
in october  we entered into a new million senior secured revolving credit facility with a group of banks 
up to million of commitments under the credit facility are available in the form of loans denominated in canadian dollars and may be made to our principal canadian operating subsidiaries 
this credit facility replaced the existing facility and matures on october   unless extended for an additional one year period with the consent of the lenders 
the company has the option to expand the facility to million 
amounts borrowed under this facility bear interest  at our election  at either a variable rate equal to libor or  in the case of canadian dollar denominated loans  the bankers acceptance discount rate plus a margin ranging from to  or an alternate base rate equal to the higher of the bank s prime rate and the federal funds effective rate plus or  in the case of canadian dollar denominated loans  the canadian prime rate plus a margin ranging from to  depending upon the ratio of total debt to ebitda as defined in the credit facility 
we pay commitment fees ranging from to per year on the undrawn portion of the facility  depending upon our leverage ratio 
our weighted average interest rate on the company s outstanding borrowings under this facility at december  was 
our credit facility is guaranteed by all of our active domestic subsidiaries and  in some cases  our canadian and other foreign subsidiaries 
our credit facility is secured by a first priority lien on all our inventory  accounts receivable and other material tangible and intangible assets  as well as those of our active subsidiaries 
however  no more than of the voting stock of any foreign subsidiary is required to be pledged if the pledge of any greater percentage would result in adverse tax consequences 
our ability to borrow under the facility is subject to certain customary conditions  including the continuing accuracy of representations and warranties  the lack of material adverse changes  our continuing compliance with laws and the lack of defaults under the facility 
our credit facility contains negative covenants that restrict our ability to borrow additional funds  encumber assets  pay dividends  sell assets except in the normal course of business and enter into other significant transactions 
in addition  our credit facility requires us to maintain a ratio of ebitda  less maintenance capital expenditures  to interest expense and certain current maturities of debt of not less than to  a level of consolidated net worth of not less than million  plus of each quarter s consolidated net income but not loss and of equity offerings  a maximum ratio of total debt to ebitda of not greater than to under our credit facility  the occurrence of specified change of control events involving our company would constitute an event of default that would permit the banks to  among other things  accelerate the maturity of the facility and cause it to become immediately due and payable in full 
we had an aggregate of approximately million of subordinated debt and capital leases outstanding at december  the subordinated debt will become due and payable at various times through september see note to our consolidated and combined financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
we believe that cash from operations and available borrowings under our credit facility will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future 
if our plans or assumptions change or are inaccurate  or we make significant acquisitions  individually or in the aggregate  we may need to raise additional capital 
however  there is no assurance that we will be able to raise additional funds or be able to raise such funds on favorable terms 
tax matters for the year ended december   we had deferred tax liabilities  net of deferred tax assets  of approximately million for federal income tax purposes before application of valuation allowances 
our primary deferred tax assets are net operating loss carry forwards  or nols  which total approximately million 
a valuation allowance is currently provided against the majority of our nols 
the nols expire over a period through our nols are currently limited under section of the internal revenue code due to a change of control that occurred during in  approximately million of nols are available for use if sufficient income is generated 
a successive change in control was triggered in pursuant to section  however it did not significantly lessen the amount of nols available 
our effective tax rate was approximately 
this low effective tax rate was due to the partial utilization of net operating losses which benefited the consolidated group after the combination 
during  we paid cash taxes of million 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statements of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations  and no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets the statements  effective for fiscal years beginning after december  under the new rules  goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives will no longer be amortized but will be subject to annual impairment tests in accordance with the statements 
other intangible assets will continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
we began applying the new rules on accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets in the first quarter of application of the nonamortization provisions of the statements resulted in an increase in net income of approximately million 
per diluted share for year we have performed the required impairment tests of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets as of december  and and there was no impairment of assets indicated 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
we were required to adopt this statement effective january   and it did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in august  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we were required to adopt this statement effective january   and it did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in april  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
which  among other things  rescinded sfas no 
 reporting gains and losses from extinguishment of debt 
we adopted this statement in  and as a result  classified as interest expense a million non cash write off  after taxes  of unamortized debt issue costs resulting from a new financing completed in october we reclassified million of losses incurred in on debt restructuring  formerly classified as an extraordinary loss  to interest expense 
we have adopted the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  issued in december  effective with our december  consolidated and combined financial statements and related footnotes 
in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
fin provides guidance on the identification of entities for which control is achieved through means other than through voting rights  known as variable interest entities vies  and which business enterprise is the primary beneficiary and when it should consolidate a vie 
this new requirement for consolidation applies to entities where the equity investors if any do not have a controlling financial interest  or whose equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entity s activities without receiving additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
in addition  fin requires that both the primary beneficiary and all other enterprises with a significant variable interest in a vie make additional disclosures 
fin is effective for all new vies created or acquired after january  for vies created or acquired prior to february   the provisions of fin must be applied for the first interim or annual period ending after december  certain disclosures are effective immediately 
implementation of fin did not affect the company 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
we have long term debt and revolving lines of credit subject to the risk of loss associated with movements in interest rates 
as of december   we had floating rate obligations totaling approximately million for amounts borrowed under our revolving credit facility 
these floating rate obligations expose us to the risk of increased interest expense in the event of increases in short term interest rates 
if the floating interest rate were to increase by from december  levels  our consolidated interest expense would increase by a total of approximately million annually 
foreign currency exchange rate risk 
our operations are conducted in various countries around the world in a number of different currencies 
as such  our earnings are subject to movements in foreign currency exchange rates when transactions are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  which is our functional currency 
in order to mitigate the effects of exchange rate risks  we generally pay a portion of our expenses in local currencies and a substantial portion of our contracts provide for collections from customers in us dollars 
as of december   we had a foreign currency forward purchase option contract totaling million which served as a cash flow hedge for our uk operations 
we have incurred no material gains or losses from foreign currency hedging activities
