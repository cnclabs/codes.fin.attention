overview the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company and its subsidiaries  which include wholly owned camrose pipe corporation  which owns of columbia structural tubing and through ownership in another corporation holds a interest in camrose pipe company camrose  and owned new cf i  which owns a interest in cf i 
the company also directly owns an additional interest in cf i 
in january  cf i assumed the trade name rocky mountain steel mills 
all significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated 
the company currently has two aggregated operating divisions known as the oregon steel division and the rmsm division 
see note to the consolidated financial statements on discussion of the company s aggregate reporting of its operating units 
the oregon steel division is centered at the portland mill 
in addition to the portland mill  the oregon steel division includes the napa pipe mill  the camrose pipe mill and columbia structural tubing 
the rmsm division consists of the steelmaking and finishing facilities of the pueblo mill  as well as certain related operations 
in may  the company shut down its portland mill melt shop 
the determination to close the melt shop was based on the company s ability to obtain semi finished slab through purchases from suppliers on the open market  and high energy and raw material costs and the yield losses associated with the inefficient casting technology in use at the portland mill 
the company forecasts that future semi finished slab purchases for the portland mill  combined with existing inventory on hand  will meet the production needs of the portland mill finishing operation for the remainder of and into the foreseeable future 
the company intends to maintain the melt shop in operating condition 
in addition  cf i determined in the second quarter of that the new single furnace operation as referenced in note to the consolidated financial statements will not have the capacity to support a two caster operation and therefore cf i has determined that one caster and other related assets have no future service potential 
the company recorded a pre tax charge to earnings of approximately million in the second quarter of related to these asset impairments 
for a discussion of these impairments  see impairment charges section below 
on january  the company announced a tentative agreement to settle the labor dispute between the union and cf i 
the company has recorded a charge of million in the fourth quarter of related to the tentative settlement 
see labor dispute settlement charges section below for further discussion of this tentative agreement

fn product sales and average selling price per ton exclude freight revenues of million  million and million  in   and  respectively  and sale of electricity of million in during  the portland mill was the beneficiary of a committed power supply contract with a local utility company 
under the contract the utility guaranteed to supply an amount of electricity to the mill at a fixed rate 
during the west coast electricity shortage in  the company agreed not to use a daily determined portion of the guaranteed supply and was compensated by the local utility at a daily determined rate per megawatt hour 
the revenue from this was included in operating income because the company made an operational choice to not use power in return for compensation rather than to produce product 
there was no direct cost of sales associated with this transaction and  accordingly  the net revenue compensation in excess of contracted price fully impacted operating income for the period 
the company s operating results were affected in by  among other things  reduced demand and pricing for welded pipe products and increased pricing pressure in plate and coil products and higher scrap and energy costs 
the specialty and commodity plate markets have been impacted by both new sources of domestic supply and continued imports from foreign suppliers  which have adversely affected average selling prices for the company s plate products 
in addition  the company believes that high fixed costs motivate steel producers to maintain high output levels even in the face of falling prices  thereby increasing further downward pressures on selling prices 
operating income was further reduced by the recognition of impairment to fixed assets and by the charge for the tentative settlement of the labor dispute 
the domestic steel industry and the company s business are highly cyclical in nature and these factors have adversely affected the profitability of the company 
on december   president bush lifted the tariffs on imports of steel that were imposed march  the tariffs were designed to give the us steel industry time to restructure and become competitive in the global steel market 
during the time that the tariffs were in effect  the company believes that the tariffs did not materially impact either the supply of  or the cost of  steel slabs purchased by the company on the open market for processing into steel plate and coil 
since the lifting of the tariffs  the steel industry has seen a dramatic increase in both the cost of raw materials and the selling price of most steel products 
the company believes that current market conditions are the result of the combination of a strong steel demand in china  a weak united states dollar  and an increase in ocean freight costs 
the company anticipates that market conditions will remain unsettled until demand in china stabilizes 
during this period of time  the company believes that it will continue to incur increased costs for steel scrap  slabs  and ocean freight  and achieve increased selling prices to offset these higher costs 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
this provides a basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  and these differences may be material 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
employee benefits plans and other post retirement benefits 
annual pension and other post retirement benefits oprb expenses are calculated by third party actuaries using standard actuarial methodologies 
the actuaries assist the company in making estimates based on both historical and current information and estimates about future events and circumstances 
significant assumptions used in the valuation of pension and oprb include expected return on plan assets  discount rate  rate of increase in compensation levels and the health care cost trend rate 
the company accounts for the defined benefit pension plans using statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employer s accounting for pensions 
as a result of continuing declines in interest rates being offset by favorable investment returns of the company s defined benefit pension plans assets  the company reduced the minimum pension liability at december  by million after tax effect 
this adjustment did not impact current earnings 
for further details regarding the company s benefits and post retirement plans  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
environmental liabilities 
all material environmental remediation liabilities for non capital expenditures  which are both probable and estimable  are recorded in the financial statements based on current technologies and current environmental standards at the time of evaluation 
adjustments are made when additional information is available that suggests different remediation methods or when estimated time periods are changed  thereby affecting the total cost 
the best estimate of the probable cost within a range is recorded  however  if there is no best estimate  the low end of the range is recorded and the range is disclosed 
even though the company has established certain reserves for environmental remediation  environmental authorities may require additional remedial measures  and additional environmental hazards  necessitating further remedial expenditures  may be asserted by these authorities or by private parties 
accordingly  the costs of remedial measures may exceed the amounts reserved 
deferred taxes 
deferred income taxes reflect the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities at year end based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates 
tax credits are recognized as a reduction of income tax expense in the year the credit arises 
a valuation allowance is established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount more likely than not to be realized 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
as of december   the allowance of doubtful accounts was approximately million 
in establishing a proper allowance for doubtful accounts  the company evaluates the collectibility of its accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in cases where management is aware of the circumstances that may impair a specific customer s ability to meet its financial obligations  the company records a specific allowance against amounts due from customers  and thereby reduces the net recognized receivable amount the company reasonably believes will be collected 
for all other customers  the company evaluates the allowance for doubtful accounts based on the length of time the receivables are past due  historical collection experience  customer credit worthiness and economic trends 
long lived asset impairments 
long lived asset impairments are recognized when the carrying value of those productive assets exceeds their aggregate projected undiscounted cash flows 
these undiscounted cash flows are based on the company s long range estimates of market conditions  with due consideration to historical  cyclical  operating cash flows and the overall performance associated with the individual asset 
if future demand and market conditions are less favorable than those projected by the company  or if the probability of disposition of the assets differs from that previously estimated by the company  additional asset write downs may be required 
contingencies 
the company is subject to the possibility of loss contingencies arising in the normal course of business 
the company considers the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability  as well as its ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss in determining loss contingencies 
an estimated loss is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
the company regularly evaluates current information available to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of contingencies

the decrease in consolidated product sales and average sales price was primarily due to a reduction in welded pipe sales at the oregon steel division 
during  the oregon steel division sales were higher due to a large pipe contract for the kern river gas transmission company at the napa pipe mill 
no similar large pipe contract was in place in and consequently the oregon steel division s sales  shipments  and sales price per ton were significantly reduced 
the rmsm division s sales  shipments and sales price per ton all increased in due to higher shipments of rod and bar products as a result of higher rod production and a reduction in domestic capacity 
gross profit change change gross profit    the decrease in gross profit was a result of the decreased sales and average sales price of high priced welded pipe from the napa pipe mill  and to an increase in the company s costs due to increased costs in scrap  slab  and energy costs for electricity and natural gas 
selling  general and administrative change change selling  general and administrative    the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses sg a for was the result of a decrease of million in expenses related to the handling and loading of goods for sale  which was due to a decrease in the volume of tons shipped in  a decrease of million in expenses for information technology support and equipment  and a decrease of million in bad debt expense 
interest expense change change interest expense    the decrease in interest expense was primarily due to a decreased borrowing rate during the company issued its first mortgage notes due notes on july  in order to refinance its first mortgage notes due notes 
the company also incurred additional interest expense in due to interest accrued on the notes which were outstanding concurrently with the notes for the period of july to august  income tax benefit expense change change income tax benefit expense    the effective income tax benefit rate was in  compared to the tax expense rate of in the effective income tax rate for varied from the combined state and federal statutory rate principally because the company established a valuation allowance for certain federal and state net operating loss carry forwards  state tax credits  and alternative minimum tax credits 
sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  requires that tax benefits for federal and state net operating loss carry forwards  state tax credits  and alternative minimum tax credits be recorded as an asset to the extent that management assesses the utilization of such assets to be more likely than not  otherwise  a valuation allowance is required to be recorded 
based on this guidance  the company recorded a valuation allowance of million in due to uncertainties regarding the realization of these deferred tax assets 
the company will continue to evaluate the need for valuation allowances in the future 
changes in estimated future taxable income and other underlying factors may lead to adjustments to the valuation allowance

growth in both product sales and related average selling prices were primarily due to higher shipments of welded pipe and rail products and higher rod and bar prices in the increase in sales at the oregon steel division was due to significantly higher shipments of welded pipe resulting from the supply of more than  tons of large diameter pipe to kern river gas transmission company 
the increase in sales at the rmsm division was due to higher shipments of rail products  partially offset by decreased rod and bar shipments  as well as decreased shipments of seamless pipe and semi finished products 
the shift of product mix to rail in was the principal reason for the improvement in average sales price 
in addition  the demand for seamless pipe remained sluggish throughout  and as a result  the seamless mill was temporarily shut down for the periods from november to april and from mid august to mid september of gross profit change change gross profit    the increase of million in gross profit was due to increased sales of high priced welded pipe from the napa pipe mill and increased sales of rail products and higher rod and bar prices at the rmsm division 
selling  general and administrative change change selling  general and administrative    sg a decreased as a percentage of total sales to in from in the decrease was due to higher general administrative costs in  including million of seamless pipe commission fees and million of environmental and other legal expenses 
interest expense change change interest expense   total interest expense increased as a result of refinancing activities in the company issued its notes on july  in order to refinance its outstanding notes 
although the company s notes bear a lower interest rate than the notes  the company incurred increased interest expense primarily attributable to the additional interest accrued on the notes which were outstanding concurrently with the notes for the period of july to august  this was partially offset by the lower average borrowing levels on the company s credit facility in in  interest expense included additional expensed loan fees due to an amendment of the company s credit facility 
income tax expense benefit change change income tax expense benefit    the effective income tax expense rate was for versus an effective income tax benefit rate of for the effective income tax rate for varied principally from the combined state and federal statutory rate due to a million increase in the valuation allowance for state tax credit carryforwards 
impairment charges in may  the company shut down its portland mill melt shop 
the determination to close the melt shop was based on the company s ability to obtain semi finished slab through purchases from suppliers on the open market  and high energy and raw material costs and the yield losses associated with the inefficient casting technology in use at the portland mill 
the company believes that future semi finished slab purchases for the portland mill will meet the production needs of the portland mill finishing operation for the remainder of and into the foreseeable future 
the company intends to maintain the melt shop in operating condition 
in connection with the melt shop closure  the company has determined the value of the related assets to be impaired 
accordingly  the company recorded a pre tax impairment charge to earnings of million for the melt shop and other related assets in the quarter ended june  of this impairment charge recognized  million represented impairment of fixed assets and million pertained to reduction of dedicated stores and operating supplies to net realizable value 
following the impairment charge  the carrying value of the fixed assets was approximately million 
the fair value of the impaired fixed assets was determined using the company s estimate of market prices for similar assets 
as part of the settlement with the cdphe and the epa  cf i is required to install one new electric arc furnace  and thus the two existing furnaces with a combined melting and casting capacity of approximately million tons through two continuous casters will be shut down 
cf i has determined that the new single furnace operation will not have the capacity to support a two caster operation and therefore cf i has determined that one caster and other related assets have no future service potential 
accordingly  the company recorded a pre tax impairment charge to earnings of million in the quarter ended june  of the impairment charge recognized  million represented impairment of fixed assets and million pertained to reduction of related stores items to net realizable value 
because it is believed the caster has no salvage value  the carrying value of the fixed assets was zero after the effect of the impairment charge 
labor dispute settlement charges on january  the company announced a tentative agreement to settle the labor dispute between the union and cf i settlement 
the settlement is conditioned on  among other things  its approval by shareholders of new cf i  ratification of a new collective bargaining agreement being executed between cf i and the union  approval of the settlement by the nlrb and the dismissal of cases pending before the nlrb related to the labor dispute and various pending legal actions between the company  new cf i and cf i and the union being dismissed 
the settlement  if approved  will provide remedies for all outstanding unfair labor practices between cf i and the union and sets the stage for the ratification of a new five year collective bargaining agreement

the beneficiaries of the trust are those individuals who as of october  were employees of cf i and represented by the union  as of december  had not separated  as defined  from cf i and are entitled to an allocation as defined in the trust 
the settlement  certain elements of which will be effected through the new five year collective bargaining agreement  also includes early retirement with immediate enhanced pension benefit where cf i will offer bargaining unit employees an early retirement opportunity based on seniority until a maximum of employees have accepted the offer  the benefit will include immediate and unreduced pension benefits for all years of service including the period of the labor dispute and for each year of service prior to march  including service with predecessor companies an additional monthly pension of  pension credit for the period of the labor dispute whereby cf i employees who went on strike will be given pension credit for both eligibility and pension benefit determination purposes for the period beginning october  and ending on the latest of said employees actual return to work  termination of employment  retirement or death  pension credit for service with predecessor companies whereby for retirements after january   effective january  for each year of service prior to march  including service with predecessor companies  cf i will provide an additional monthly benefit to employees of  and for retirements after january   effective january  for each year of service between march  and march  including service with predecessor companies  cf i will provide an additional monthly benefit of and individuals who are members of the bargaining units as of october  will be immediately eligible to apply for and receive qualified long term disability ltd benefits on a go forward basis  notwithstanding the date of the injury or illness  service requirements or any filing deadlines 
the settlement also includes the company s agreement to nominate a director designated by the union on its board of directors  and to a broad based neutrality clause for certain of the company s facilities in the future 
cf i labor dispute settlement accounting the company has recorded a charge of million in the fourth quarter of related to the settlement  the final amount of which is dependant upon the price of the company s common stock on the effective date of the settlement

the company will adjust the amount of the common stock charge  either up or down  for the change in the price of the common stock between december  and the effective date of the settlement 
the accrual for the ltd benefits may also change  as better claims information becomes available 
as employees accept the early retirement benefits  the company will record an additional charge totaling approximately million related to these benefits 
the enhancements to pension and post retirement medical benefits for non early retirees will be accounted for prospectively on the date at which plan amendments occur pursuant to the new five year collective bargaining agreement in accordance with sfas and sfas liquidity and capital resources at december   the company s liquidity  comprised of cash  cash equivalents  and funds available under its million revolving credit agreement credit agreement  totaled approximately million  compared to million at december  the reduction in liquidity is primarily the result of a reduction in cash on hand of million  a reduction in the credit facility of million  as well as increased outstanding letters of credit of million

the decrease in current assets was primarily due to decreased cash  accounts receivable  and inventories million  million  and million  respectively 
an offset to the decrease in current assets was an increase in the deferred tax asset of million and an increase in other assets of million 
the accounts receivable turnover for the year ended december   as measured in average daily sales outstanding  decreased to days  as compared to days for the year ended december  the decrease was attributable to a faster turnover of product receivables from customers paying earlier in order to utilize cash discounts  and an increased effort on collections of receivables 
the change in current liabilities was due primarily to accrued sales taxes for welded pipe sales of million in the following table summarizes the company s contractual obligations at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on liquidity and cash flow in future periods
