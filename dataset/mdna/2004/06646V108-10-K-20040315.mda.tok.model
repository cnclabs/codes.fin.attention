overview bankrate  inc owns and operates an internet based consumer banking marketplace 
our flagship site  bankrate 
com  is the internet s leading aggregator of information on more than financial products  including mortgages  credit cards  new and used automobile loans  money market accounts  certificates of deposit  checking and atm fees and home equity loans

bankrate 
com provides the tools and information that can help consumers make better financial decisions 
we regularly survey more than  financial institutions in all states in order to provide the most current objective  unbiased rates 
hundreds of print and online partner publications depend on bankrate 
com as the trusted source for financial rates and information 
over two decades ago  we began as a print publisher of the newsletter bank rate monitor 
our rate tables provide  at no cost to the consumer  a detailed list of lenders by market and include relevant details to help consumers compare loan products 
we continue to enhance our offerings in order to provide bankrate 
com users with the most complete experience 
features such as financial calculators and e mail newsletters allow users to interact with our site 
our rate trend index is a weekly poll of industry insiders designed to help consumers forecast interest rate trends 
we also broadened our offerings to include channels on investing  taxes  small business  financial advice and insurance 
each channel offers a unique look at its particular topic 
bankrate 
com users can find advice and tips from the tax channel  obtain business ideas from the small business channel and ask a financial expert a question in the advice channel 
prior to  and dating back to  our principal business was the publication of print newsletters  the syndication of unbiased editorial bank and credit product research to newspapers and magazines  and advertising sales of the consumer mortgage guide 
we currently syndicate editorial research to newspapers that have combined single day circulation in excess of million copies  and to two national magazines with combined monthly circulation in excess of million copies 
the consumer mortgage guide is a weekly newspaper advertising table consisting of product and rate information from local mortgage companies and financial institutions 
the consumer mortgage guide appears weekly in approximately us metropolitan newspapers with combined single day circulation in excess of million copies  including our first tv consumer mortgage guide with a reach of million 
together  these bankrate 
com branded print activities have the potential of reaching million readers according to editor publisher international year book 
in  we began our online operations by placing our editorially unbiased research on our web site  bankrate 
com 
by offering our information online  we created new revenue opportunities through the sale of graphical and hyperlink advertising associated with our rate and yield tables 
in fiscal  we implemented a strategy to concentrate on building these online operations 
we believe that the recognition of our research as a leading source of independent  objective information on banking and credit products is essential to our success 
as a result  we have sought to maximize distribution of our research to gain brand recognition as a research authority 
we are seeking to build greater brand awareness of our web site and to reach a greater number of online users 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations and critical accounting policies  and note to the financial statements below for a discussion of our two reportable business segments online publishing  and print publishing and licensing 

table of contents our opportunity many financial services customers are relatively uninformed with respect to financial products and services and often rely upon personal relationships when choosing such products and services 
many of these products and services are not well explained  and viable  equivalent alternatives typically are not presented when marketed to consumers through traditional media 
as the sale of many of these products and services moves to the internet  where there is little personal contact  we believe that consumers will seek sources of independent objective information such as bankrate 
com to facilitate and support their buying decisions 
the interactive nature of the internet allows us to display extensive research on financial products and services that was previously unavailable to consumers 
we believe the majority of financial information available on the web is oriented toward investment advice and providing business news and stock market information  rather than personal and consumer finance data 
our publications are targeted to fulfill the less competitive  but equally important niches of consumer banking and finance information 
as a result  we believe we can maintain a loyal base of users comprised of targeted audiences that are attractive to advertisers 
despite weakness in advertising spending on the internet  we have seen steady interest in our primary niches mortgages  automobile loans  home equity loans and cd savings products 
in addition  we believe our faith in the long term benefits of the internet is well founded 
the ability of the internet to provide a platform for frictionless communication between consumers and businesses has not changed 
we believe bankrate  inc is positioned to benefit from any growth in internet usage and the return of the internet advertising market 
restructuring we spent much of and refocusing the company s business efforts into our primary web site  bankrate 
com  while actively controlling expenses and pursuing additional sources of revenue 
in addition  we sold or curtailed development of under performing web sites and business units 
the following steps were taken as a direct result of our strategic reorganization initiatives 
we substantially reduced marketing expenditures beginning in january in may  we sold cpnet 
com  our online advertising network that provided content and advertising management to college newspaper web sites 
in june  we reduced employment levels of continuing operations by and began consolidating our physical locations 
in june  we shut down our broadcast operations that produced cost of life personal finance video segments distributed to television stations 
in june  we shut down ilife 
com  our vertical personal finance portal  and incorporated intelligenttaxes 
com  our personal income tax information web site  as a channel of bankrate 
com 
in july  we sold pivot 
com  our virtual insurance agency and fulfillment call center 
in august  we shut down and sold certain assets of consejero 
com  our spanish language personal finance web site  and garzarelli 
com  a subscription web site for investment advisor elaine garzarelli 
in december  we shut down greenmagazine 
com  our alternative personal finance web site  and the print publication green magazine 
in  we terminated unprofitable distribution and advertising agreements  formed a telemarketing group in our advertising sales staff to focus primarily on hyperlink sales  and focused our marketing efforts on non cash intensive marketing programs such as sweepstakes  promotions and barter transactions 

table of contents strategy we believe that the consumer banking sector holds significant opportunities for growth and expansion 
as we grow  we are seeking to consolidate our position as the industry leader in the gathering of rate data and to expand our brand recognition with consumers and partners 
elements of our strategy include continuing to provide advertisers with high quality  ready to transact consumers by advertising on our site  either through purchasing graphic ads  hyperlinks  or sponsorships  banks  brokers and other advertisers are tapping into our strongest resource  consumers on the verge of engaging in a transaction 
by allowing advertisers to efficiently access these in market consumers  we are helping advertisers lower their own costs of acquiring new customers  and ultimately creating a transaction that is beneficial for the advertiser  the consumer and us 
remaining the dominant brand in consumer bank rate data and content we are continuing our strong push to remain the dominant player in our market 
we believe we are the number one competitor in our market on a number of levels  including revenue  the number of banks surveyed  the number of pages viewed by consumers and the number of unique visitors 
continued  low risk growth through partnering with top web sites our partner network provides bankrate 
com with a steady stream of visitors  with little to no advertising risk to the company 
as the bulk of these agreements are revenue sharing  we only pay out a percentage of what we actually bring in 
zealously guarding our limited resources our greatest assets are our people  our partners and our brand 
we carefully weigh every decision for the potential impact on these three resources 
distribution arrangements our distribution or syndication arrangements with other web site operators fall into two categories co branding  in which we establish a co branded site with another web site operator  licensing  in which we provide content to the other operator s web site together with a hyperlink to our own site 
we have found co branding to be more effective in driving traffic to our site 
co branded sites are created pursuant to agreements with other web site operators 
generally  agreements relating to co branded sites provide for us to host the co branded web pages  sell and serve the graphical advertising  and collect advertising revenues  which are shared with the third party web site 
under licensing arrangements  we provide content to other web sites in exchange for a fee 
the content identifies bankrate 
com as its source and typically includes a hyperlink to the bankrate 
com web site 
our largest partners in terms of driving traffic to our site as of december  included america online  usa today  dollar stretcher  netscape  and yahoo during  approximately of the traffic to bankrate 
com was attributable to the distribution partners compared to in the decline results from the heightened consumer demand for mortgage products data during driving more traffic directly to bankrate 
com 
we expect traffic from distribution partners to be between and of total site traffic in financial product research our research staff is made up of employees who track comparative information on more than financial products and services  including checking accounts  consumer loans  lines of credit  mortgages  certificates of deposit  savings accounts  credit cards  money market accounts and online accounts 
we cover both personal and small business accounts offered through branch offices and on the internet by banks  thrifts  credit unions  credit card issuers  mortgage bankers and mortgage brokers 
we estimate that over  items of data are gathered each week for more than markets across the united states from over  financial institutions 
the information obtained includes not only interest rates and yields  but also related data such as lock periods  fees  points  and loan sizes for mortgages and grace periods  late penalties  cash advance fees  cash advance annual percentage rates  annual percentage yields  minimum payments  and terms and conditions of credit cards 
we adhere to a strict methodology in developing our markets and our institutional survey group 
the market survey includes the largest us markets  as defined by the us census bureau s metropolitan statistical area categories  along with the largest market in each state that does not include one of the largest markets and other selected communities that represent areas of growth 
we provide a comparative analysis of data by market and state as well as on a national basis 

table of contents institutions in the survey group include the largest banks and thrifts within each market area based on total deposits 
the number of institutions tracked within a given market is based on the types of financial products available and number of institutions in the market area 
in each of the largest markets  we track at least institutions 
in each of the smaller markets  we track three or more institutions 
we verify and adjust  if necessary  the institutions included in the survey group on an annual basis using fdic deposit data from year end call reports 
we do not include credit unions in the market survey group because product availability is based upon membership 
however  we track the largest us credit unions as a separate survey group for comparison purposes 
all products included in our database have narrowly defined criteria so that information provided by institutions is comparable 
collected data undergoes four levels of quality control prior to being accepted for inclusion in the database 
the first level is automatically performed by our editing software  which identifies unusual changes 
the second level is visual proofing  which is performed by a researcher who gathers rates from institutions  reviews the surveys to determine whether there have been any changes in the data on a weekly basis  and verifies unusual changes or other questionable data by contacting the institution 
the third level is a second visual check by a senior researcher 
the fourth level is performed by a dedicated quality control staff consisting of senior researchers who verify that the information has been correctly updated and entered into our databank 
our quality control staff reviews each listing in relation to regional and national trends and for overall accuracy and consistency fees and related information prior to disclosure of the information to consumers 
the staff also reviews the comparability of products  institutional accuracy and survey accuracy 
in addition  the quality control team performs anonymous shopping on a weekly basis  whereby we place calls to institutions in order to validate the data in a consumer setting 
institutions providing invalid data are contacted by our quality control staff to ensure that future information will be accurate 
the criteria for product listings consist of specific attributes  such as loan size and term that are used to define each type of financial instrument in order to ensure uniformity in the products that are compared 
with the exception of the internet banking deals table  no special offers are listed on our site 
institutions listed in our bankrate 
com online tables that purchase hyperlinks to their own sites or purchase other advertising must comply with the same criteria for product listings that apply to other institutions or they will be removed 
all of our new research employees are provided with a four week program of on the job training to ensure consistency of data gathering and validation techniques 
follow up refresher training is provided to our research employees on an ongoing basis to ensure that skill levels are maintained 
at the end of each weekly survey  data are archived as part of our year old cumulative historical data file 
this file provides a unique resource for our financial analysts and editorial team in developing trend graphs  charts and narrative analysis that is used by national and local media 
we are aware of the potential conflict of interest resulting from the sale of advertising to financial institutions while providing independent and objective research 
however  we believe that no potential conflicts of interest have ever compromised our ability to provide independent and objective research  and we are committed to continue to provide such research in the future 
editorial content in addition to our research department  as of december   we maintained an editorial staff of editors  writers and researchers  and graphic designers who create original stories and content for our web site 
we also have relationships with more than free lance writers 
most of our editorial staff members are experienced journalists with newspaper or broadcast experience 
for example  the reporters and editors of bankrate 
com have professional journalistic work experience ranging from three to years  with an average of years of experience 
we believe the quality of our original content plays a critical role in attracting visitors to our web site and to our co branded partners web sites 
most of the content within our web site is original and produced internally 
there is a very limited amount of third party content  acquired under advertising revenue sharing agreements or licenses  which allows us to incorporate relevant information on our web site that would otherwise require additional resources to produce 
an example of this type of arrangement is the incorporation in bankrate 
com of currency conversion functionality from oanda 
com 

table of contents print publications we continue to produce traditional print publications to absorb part of the cost of producing research and original editorial content 
additionally  we believe that print publishing activities contribute to greater exposure and branding opportunities for our internet web site 
our print publications activities include the following consumer mortgage guide we generate revenue through the sale of mortgage rate and product listings in metropolitan newspapers across the united states with combined sunday circulation of million copies 
we enter into agreements with the newspapers for blocks of print space  which is in turn sold to local mortgage lenders and we share the revenue with the newspapers on a percentage basis 
syndication of editorial content and research we syndicate editorial research to newspapers  which have a combined sunday circulation of more than million copies  and two national magazines with combined monthly circulation in excess of million copies 
newsletters we publish three newsletters highest yields and jumbo flash report  which target individual consumers  and bank rate monitor  which targets an institutional audience 
these newsletters provide bank deposit  loan and mortgage interest rate information with minimal editorial content 
consumer marketing we have determined that our resources are best leveraged by emphasizing non cash intensive marketing programs 
this gives us the opportunity to reach consumers using multiple advertising vehicles with a minimal depletion of our marketing budget 
we continued this successful strategy in by expanding our barter effort  purchasing a series of strategic  highly targeted online and print campaigns  and pay per performance campaigns on search engines 
in addition  we have used sweepstakes and promotions efforts to drive site traffic and grow our e mail newsletter subscriber base 
all consumer marketing efforts are designed  implemented  and tracked by our employees 
advertising sales our advertising sales staff consisted of salespeople and support staff as of december  it is divided into two groups the graphic ad team gat and the telemarketing group telemarketing 
the gat focuses on selling graphic ads to national advertisers  while telemarketing primarily sells hyperlinks to regional and local advertisers 
most of our salespersons are located in our north palm beach corporate headquarters 
we also maintain two satellite offices in new york  new york and in irvine  california 
each salesperson is responsible for a designated geographic region of the united states 
our gat salespeople present advertising solutions to potential advertisers using inventory created by our web site as well as co branded web sites 
we believe this combined network of sites enhances value for advertisers and direct marketers by alleviating the need to purchase a series of advertising campaigns from numerous web sites  providing advertisers and direct marketers with advertising opportunities on a wide variety of web pages containing business and personal finance content  and providing targeted access to internet users with desirable demographics 
advertisers and direct marketers can enhance the effectiveness of their campaigns by customizing advertising delivery on our networks within a particular content channel or across an entire network 
advertising alternatives our advertisers can target prospective customers using several different approaches targeting specific geographic and product areas  for example  mortgage shoppers in atlanta  georgia  or just one of these all consumers interested in mortgages  or all consumers from atlanta 
focusing on consumers in specific situations  such as those who are first time home buyers  or those actively shopping for cds 
general rotation throughout our site 

table of contents our most common graphic advertisement sizes are banners  which are prominently displayed at the top or bottom of a page x pixels and badges  which are smaller than banners x pixels 
we offer banners and badges which can be targeted to specific areas of our site  or on a general rotation basis 
advertising rates may vary depending upon the quantity of advertisements purchased by an advertiser and the length of time an advertiser runs an advertisement on our site 
discounts are available based upon the volume of advertisements purchased 
we also sell posters  which are oversized advertisements that contain more information than traditional advertisements 
we position posters on certain pages so that they dominate the page 
advertisers may also purchase sponsorship positions on the bankrate 
com home page and the main page for each product channel 
in addition  we offer product special issues that are available for single sponsorships 
rates for product special issues are based on expected impression levels and additional content requirements 
providing effective tools for managing advertising campaigns is essential to maintaining advertising relationships 
we use a state of the art program under license from a third party that allows our advertisers to monitor their spending on our web sites in real time for impressions received and click through ratios generated 
we also accept impression counts from other third party servers 
hyperlinks financial institutions that are listed in our rate tables have the opportunity to hyperlink their listings 
by clicking on the hyperlink  users are taken to the institution s web site 
a substantial benefit to advertisers with the hyperlink rate listing is that the hyperlinks are in fixed placement on the rate pages and are shown every time a user accesses a page 
in contrast  banner advertisements are rotated based on the number of impressions purchased 
hyperlinks are sold under contracts that range primarily between three and twelve months 
the number of hyperlinked rate listings that can be added to a rate page is limited only by the number of institutions listed  while banner positions are limited by available space 
we also sell text links on our rate pages to advertisers on a cost per click cpc basis 
advertisers enter an auction bidding process on a third party web site for placement of their text link based on the amount they are willing to pay for each click through to their web site 
we recognize revenue monthly for each text link based on the number of clicks at the cpc contracted for during the auction bidding process 
e mail sponsorships we publish more than a dozen e mail newsletters ranging from specific topics such as cds  credit cards  and mortgages  to broader topics such as frugal living  monthly checkups and weekly news to alert newsletters e mails alerting subscribers every time a rate changes in mortgages or cds  or when stories are published on a particular topic 
these newsletters offer another marketing and sales outlet for us 
with over million e mail subscriptions  we believe our e mail newsletters represent attractive advertising space for our customers 
advertisers can sponsor e mails with both text and graphic ads 
advertisers we market to local advertisers targeting a specific audience in a city or state and also to national advertisers targeting the entire country 
as of december   we had graphic advertisers and hyperlink advertisers  some of which are both graphic and hyperlink advertisers 
among our larger advertisers are getsmart recently acquired by lending tree  inc providian financial corporation  mortgage expo cyber financial network  ihomeowners  inc  e loan  inc  peoplefirst finance  llc  lending tree  inc  e trade bank  a at homebound mortgage  werloans 
com  ing direct  washington mutual and bank of america 
we had one online customer  getsmart providian financial corporation  who accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of total revenue for the years ended december   and sales to no other customer exceeded of total revenue for the periods presented 
no revenues were generated outside of the united states 

table of contents competition we compete for advertising revenues across the broad category of personal finance information  both in traditional media such as newspapers  magazines  radio  and television  and in the developing market for online financial information 
there are many competitors that have substantially greater resources than we do 
our online competition includes the following personal finance sections of general interest sites such as msn money and excite  personal finance destination sites such as forbes 
com  the motley fool  smartmoney 
com  kiplinger 
com and cnnmoney 
com  e commerce sites that provide banking and credit products and information such as e loan and lendingtree  rate listing sites  such as monstermoving  and key word search engine sites such as ask jeeves and findwhat 
competition in the online segment is generally directed at growing users and revenue using marketing and promotion to increase traffic to web sites 
we believe that our original content  focus and objective product information differentiate us from our competitors 
operations we currently host our web site on proprietary servers at a secure third party co location facility in atlanta  georgia 
this facility is manned  and our equipment is monitored continuously  hours daily 
the facility is powered continuously with multiple sources  including uninterruptible power supplies and internal power generators 
the facility is connected to the internet with redundant high speed digital data lines that are diversely routed 
our web site pages are served from an independent content distribution network for performance and redundancy 
much of the information presented on our web site is stored on a dual node database server cluster also housed in the co location facility 
our systems are protected by a multi layered security system including dual high speed inspection state firewalls 
all of our systems are controlled remotely via an encrypted virtual private network vpn from our network operations center noc in our principal office in north palm beach  florida 
content on our web site is created and initially stored on systems located at the noc  then transferred at scheduled intervals during the day via the vpn to the systems at the georgia co location facility 
the north palm beach facility systems are also powered redundantly by uninterruptible power supply units and an lp gas powered electric generator 
proprietary rights our proprietary intellectual property consists of our unique research and editorial content 
we rely primarily on a combination of copyrights  trademarks  trade secret laws  our user policy and restrictions on disclosure to protect this content 
in addition  we license some of our data and content from other parties 
our copyrights  trademarks and licenses expire at various dates  and none is individually significant 
employees as of december   we had full time employees  of which were in web site and content operations  in sales  business development and marketing  in content and data research  in advertising revenue operations  in product development and information technology  in finance and accounting  and in administration 
we have never had a work stoppage and none of our employees are represented under collective bargaining agreements 
we consider our employee relations to be favorable 

table of contents risk factors risks related to our business our success depends on internet advertising revenue we expect to derive approximately of our revenue in the foreseeable future through the sale of advertising space and hyperlinks on our internet web pages 
any factors that limit the amount advertisers are willing to spend on advertising on our web site could have a material adverse effect on our business 
these factors may include a lack of standards for measuring web site traffic or effectiveness of web site advertising  a lack of established pricing models for internet advertising  the failure of traditional media advertisers to adopt internet advertising  the introduction of alternative advertising sources  and a lack of significant growth in web site traffic 
continuing to demonstrate the effectiveness of advertising on our web site is critical to our ability to generate advertising revenue 
currently  there are no widely accepted standards to measure the effectiveness of internet advertising  and we cannot be certain that such standards will develop sufficiently to support our growth through internet advertising 
a number of different pricing models are used to sell advertising on the internet 
pricing models are typically either cpm based or performance based 
we predominantly utilize the cpm based model  which is based upon the number of advertisement impressions 
the performance based  or per click  model generates payments on each individual click even though it may take multiple advertisement impressions to generate one click through 
we cannot predict which pricing model  if any  will emerge as the industry standard 
therefore  it is difficult for us to project our future advertising rates and revenues 
for instance  banner advertising  which is one of our primary sources of online revenue  may not be an effective advertising method in the future 
if we are unable to adapt to new forms of internet advertising and pricing models  our business could be adversely affected 
financial services companies account for a majority of our advertising revenues 
we will need to sell advertising to customers outside of the financial services industry in order to significantly increase our revenues 
to date  relatively few advertisers from industries other than the technology and financial services industries have devoted a significant portion of their advertising budgets to internet advertising 
if we do not attract advertisers from other industries  revenue growth could be adversely affected 
we have a history of losses we have incurred net losses in six of our last eight fiscal years  resulting in an accumulated deficit of approximately million as of december  we have succeeded in managing our cash by actively controlling expenses and pursuing additional sources of revenue 
for instance  since early  we have substantially reduced marketing expenditures and sold or shut down under performing  non core business units 
we sold cpnet 
com and professional direct insurance agency  inc in may and july  respectively  shut down and sold certain assets of consejero 
com in august  and shut down greenmagazine 
com in december these transactions yielded approximately  in cash and reduced operating expenses 
we have also reduced employment levels of continuing operations and consolidated our physical locations 
in february  we completed the early repayment of our  convertible subordinated note payable  including accrued interest  for  we have generated cash from operations for consecutive quarters and have been profitable for consecutive quarters through december  based on these actions and our current plan  we believe our existing capital resources will be sufficient to satisfy our cash requirements through at least the next months 

table of contents we use barter transactions  which do not generate cash we enter into barter transactions to promote our brand and generate traffic to our web site without spending any of our cash resources 
barter transactions represent the exchange by the company of advertising space on the company s web site for reciprocal advertising space on other web sites 
revenue from barter transactions is recognized as income when advertisements are delivered on the company s web site 
barter expenses are recognized when the company s advertisements are run on the other companies web sites  which typically are in the same period in which barter revenues are recognized 
barter transactions  however  do not generate cash 
limited cash flow may adversely affect our ability to expand our operations and satisfy liabilities 
revenue from barter transactions represented approximately   and of total revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we expect barter revenue to represent approximately of our total revenue in our success depends on interest rate volatility we provide interest rate information for mortgages and other loans  credit cards and savings accounts 
visitor traffic to bankrate 
com tends to increase with interest rate movements and decrease with interest rate stability 
factors that have caused significant visitor fluctuations in the past have been federal reserve board actions and general market conditions affecting home mortgage interest rates 
additionally  the level of traffic to bankrate 
com can be dependent on interest rate levels as well as mortgage re financing activity 
accordingly  a slowdown in mortgage production volumes could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we believe that as we continue to develop our web site with broader personal finance topics  the percentage of overall traffic seeking mortgage information will remain stabilized at current levels 
to accelerate the growth of traffic to bankrate 
com  we are working with our syndication partners to program more intensively  and we are aggressively promoting bankrate 
com products not related to mortgage activity 
we cannot be certain that we will be successful in these efforts 
our success depends on establishing and maintaining distribution arrangements our business strategy includes the distribution of our content through the establishment of co branded web pages with high traffic business and personal finance sections of online services and web sites 
a co branded site is typically a custom version of our web site with the graphical look  feel  and navigation  of the co branded partner s web site 
providing access to these co branded web pages is a significant part of the value we offer to our advertisers 
we compete with other internet content providers to maintain our current relationships with other web site operators and establish new relationships 
in addition  as we expand our personal finance content  some of these web site operators may perceive us as a competitor 
as a result  they may be unwilling to promote distribution of our banking and credit content 
we cannot guarantee that our distribution arrangements will attract a sufficient number of users to support our current advertising model 
in addition  our business could be adversely affected if we do not establish and maintain distribution arrangements on favorable economic terms 
risks related to our industry  the internet and our technology infrastructure our future success is dependent upon increased acceptance of the internet by consumers as a medium for obtaining financial product information our success will depend in large part on continued and expanded widespread consumer acceptance of obtaining rate information regarding financial products such as mortgages  credit cards  money market accounts  certificates of deposit  checking and atm fees  home equity loans  online banking fees and new and used auto loans online 
increased consumer use of the internet to provide for their lending needs is subject to uncertainty 
the development of an online market for obtaining rate information regarding the above listed financial products has only recently begun  is rapidly evolving and likely will be characterized by an increasing number of market entrants 
if consumer acceptance of the internet as a source for such information does not increase  our business  results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected 
as a result  we cannot be sure that we will be able to compete effectively with traditional methods of obtaining such rate information 
our markets are highly competitive we compete for internet advertising revenues with the personal finance sections of general interest sites such as yahoo and america online  personal finance destination sites such as forbes 
com  the motley fool  smartmoney 
com  kiplinger 
com and cnnmoney 
com  e commerce sites that provide banking and credit products and information such as 
table of contents e loan and lendingtree  and rate listing sites such as monstermoving 
in addition  new competitors may easily enter this market as there are few barriers to entry 
many of our existing competitors  as well as a number of potential new competitors  have longer operating histories  greater name recognition  larger customer bases and significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources than us 
many competitors have complementary products or services that drive traffic to their web sites 
increased competition could result in lower web site traffic  advertising rate reductions  reduced margins or loss of market share  any of which would adversely affect our business 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors 
our web site may encounter technical problems and service interruptions in the past  our web site has experienced significant increases in traffic in response to interest rate movements and other business or financial news events 
the number of our users has continued to increase over time  and we are seeking to further increase our user base 
as a result  our internet servers must accommodate spikes in demand for our web pages in addition to potential significant growth in traffic 
our web site has in the past  and may in the future  experience slower response times or interruptions as a result of increased traffic or other reasons 
these delays and interruptions resulting from failure to maintain internet service connections to our site could frustrate users and reduce our future web site traffic  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
all of our communications and network equipment is co located at our corporate headquarters in north palm beach  florida and at a secure third party co location facility in atlanta  georgia 
multiple system failures at these locations could lead to interruptions or delays in service for our web site  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our systems against damage from fires  hurricanes  earthquakes  power losses  telecommunications failures  break ins  computer viruses  hacker attacks and other events beyond our control 
although we maintain business interruption insurance  it may not adequately compensate us for losses that may occur due to failures of our systems 
we rely on the protection of our intellectual property our intellectual property consists of the content of our web site and print publications 
we rely on a combination of copyrights  trademarks  trade secret laws and our user policy and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property 
we also enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and consultants and seek to control access to and distribution of our proprietary information 
despite these precautions  it may be possible for other parties to copy or otherwise obtain and use the content of our web sites or print publications without authorization 
a failure to protect our intellectual property in a meaningful manner could have a material adverse effect on our business 
because we license some of our data and content from other parties  we may be exposed to infringement actions if such parties do not possess the necessary proprietary rights 
generally  we obtain representations as to the origin and ownership of licensed content and obtain indemnification to cover any breach of any these representations 
however  these representations may not be accurate and the indemnification may not be sufficient to provide adequate compensation for any breach of these representations 
any future infringement or other claims or prosecutions related to our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business 
defending against any of these claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel or require us to introduce new content or trademarks  develop new technology or enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
these royalty or licensing agreements  if required  may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
we may face liability for information on our web site much of the information published on our web site relates to the competitiveness of financial institutions rates  products and services 
we may be subjected to claims for defamation  negligence  copyright or trademark infringement or other theories relating to the information we publish on our web sites 
these types of claims have been brought  sometimes successfully  against online services as well as print publications 
our insurance may not adequately protect us against these types of claims 

table of contents future government regulation of the internet is uncertain and subject to change as internet commerce continues to evolve  increasing regulation by federal or state agencies or foreign governments may occur 
such regulation is likely in the areas of user privacy  pricing  content and quality of products and services 
additionally  taxation of internet use or electronic commerce transactions may be imposed 
any regulation imposing fees for internet use or electronic commerce transactions could result in a decline in the use of the internet and the viability of internet commerce  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we may be limited or restricted in the way we establish and maintain our online relationships by laws generally applicable to our business state and federal lending laws and regulations generally require the accurate disclosure of the critical components of credit costs so that consumers can readily compare credit terms from various lenders 
in addition  these laws and regulations impose certain restrictions on the advertisement of these credit terms 
because we are an aggregator of rate and other information regarding many financial products online  we may be subject to some of these laws and regulations 
we believe that we have structured our web site to comply with these laws and regulations 
however  if these laws and regulations are changed  or if new laws or regulations are enacted  these events could prohibit or substantially alter the content we provide on our web site 
moreover  such events could materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
risks related to corporate control and our stock price our ownership is heavily concentrated at december   approximately of our outstanding common stock was beneficially owned by our officers and directors  including peter c 
morse  a director and our largest shareholder  who beneficially owns approximately of our outstanding common stock 
as a result  our officers and directors will be able to exercise control over all matters requiring shareholder approval 
in particular  these controlling shareholders will have the ability to elect all of our directors and approve or disapprove significant corporate transactions 
this control could be used to prevent or significantly delay another company or person from acquiring or merging with us and could inhibit our liquidity and affect trading in our common stock 
our success may depend on management and key employees our success may depend largely upon retaining the continued services of our executive officers and other key management  developing personnel as well as hiring and training additional employees 
we have a number of key employees on whom we depend and who may be difficult to replace 
a failure to retain our current key employees or to hire enough qualified employees to sustain our growth could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we may encounter difficulties with future acquisitions we may acquire complementary web sites and other content providers as a part of our business strategy 
any acquisitions may present a number of potential risks that could have a material adverse effect on our business 
these risks include the following failure to integrate the technical operations and personnel in a timely and cost effective manner  failure to retain key personnel of the acquired company  and assumption of unexpected material liabilities 
in addition  we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates that are available for sale at reasonable prices 
we may finance future acquisitions with debt financing  which would increase our debt service requirements  or through the issuance of additional common or preferred stock  which could result in dilution to our shareholders 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to arrange adequate financing on acceptable terms 
our results of operations may fluctuate significantly our results of operations are difficult to predict and may fluctuate significantly in the future as a result of several factors  many of which are beyond our control 
these factors include changes in fees paid by advertisers  traffic levels on our web site  which can fluctuate significantly  
table of contents changes in the demand for internet products and services  changes in fee or revenue sharing arrangements with our distribution partners  our ability to enter into or renew key distribution agreements  the introduction of new internet advertising services by us or our competitors  changes in our capital or operating expenses  general economic conditions  and changes in banking or other laws that could limit or eliminate content on our web site 
our future revenue and results of operations are difficult to forecast due to these factors 
as a result  we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations may not be meaningful  and you should not rely on past periods as indicators of future performance 
in future periods  our results of operations may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors  which could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 
our stock price may be particularly volatile because of the industry we are in the stock prices and trading volume of internet related companies have been extremely volatile 
accordingly  our stock price can be volatile as well 
in january  we announced that our common stock had been removed from the nasdaq national market and had become eligible for trading on the otc bulletin board 
on january   we announced that our common stock had begun trading on the nasdaq smallcap market and on august   we announced that our common stock had again begun trading on the nasdaq national market under our existing stock symbol rate 
if our common stock price drops significantly  we may be delisted from the nasdaq national market  which could eliminate the trading market for our common stock our common stock is listed on the nasdaq national market 
in order to continue to be included on the nasdaq national market  a company must meet certain maintenance criteria 
as of december   we were in compliance with all such criteria 
however  we cannot assure you that we will continue to meet these listing criteria 
if our common stock were to be delisted  we would be required to meet the criteria for initial listing if we wanted to be listed on the nasdaq national market again 
the initial listing standards are more stringent than the maintenance standards 
accordingly  we cannot provide assurances that if we were delisted we would be able to have our common stock relisted on the nasdaq national market 
further  if our common stock were to be delisted  it may become more difficult for us to raise funds through the sale of our common stock or securities convertible into our common stock

advertising sales are invoiced monthly based on the number of advertisement impressions or the number of times the advertisement is viewed by users of our web site 
revenue is recognized monthly based on the percentage of actual impressions to the total number of impressions contracted 
revenue for impressions invoiced but not delivered is deferred 
additionally  we generate revenue on a per action basis ie  a purchase or completion of an application when a visitor to our web site transacts with one of our advertisers after viewing an advertisement 
revenue is recognized monthly based on the number of actions reported by the advertiser 
we are also involved in revenue sharing arrangements with our online partners where the consumer uses co branded sites hosted by us

the increase in over was due to higher graphic advertisement and hyperlink sales 
graphic advertisement sales were  or  higher in as approximately million  or  more advertisements were sold in compared to this increase is a direct result of serving approximately million  or  more page views in compared to however  graphic advertisements were sold at approximately lower cpm as we monetized the increase in page views albeit at lower rates

hyperlink sales were  or  higher in due to a increase in the number of average monthly hyperlink advertisers over during  there were approximately more hyperlink advertisers on average each month than in consumer demand for our mortgage related services heightened during and continued into late due to the declining interest rate environment 
our advertisers increased their spending in efforts to capitalize on this demand and we expect this demand to continue in a majority of our advertising customers purchase advertising under short term contracts 
customers have the ability to stop  and have on occasion stopped  advertising on relatively short notice 
online publishing revenue would be adversely impacted if we experienced contract terminations  or if we were not able to renew contracts with existing customers or obtain new customers 
the market for internet advertising is intensely competitive and has  in the past  experienced significant downturns in demand that could impact advertising rates 
future revenue could be adversely affected if we were forced to reduce our advertising rates or if we were to experience lower cpm s 

table of contents historically  our first calendar quarter has been our highest in terms of page views  and we have typically experienced a slowdown in traffic during our third and fourth quarters 
during  certain traffic initiatives and expanded commitments from our distribution partners as well as the activity in mortgage lending caused increases in traffic inconsistent with our historical trends that continued through the second quarter of based on historical trends and current economic conditions  we believe we will experience an increase in traffic and online publishing revenue during the first quarter of and a relative slowdown during our third and fourth quarters
