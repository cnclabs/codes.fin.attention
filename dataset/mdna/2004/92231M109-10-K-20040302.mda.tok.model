these forward looking statements and other forward looking statements made elsewhere in this document are made in reliance upon safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of the following discussion sets forth certain factors the company believes could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by the forward looking statements 
overview we are a medical device company focused on bringing solutions to interventional cardiologists and interventional radiologists 
as a vertically integrated medical device company  we generate ideas and create new interventional medical devices  and then deliver those products directly to the physician through our direct domestic sales force and international distribution network 
we continue to develop new products and applications for our existing products 
during  we received regulatory clearance for sales of four new interventional products vari lase endovenous laser procedure kit 
we launched this product in the third quarter of the vari lase product is a treatment for superficial venous reflux  otherwise known as varicose veins 
pronto extraction catheter 
we launched this product in international markets at the end of the third quarter of  and received regulatory clearance for united states sales in december the pronto extraction catheter consists of a catheter with a proprietary atraumatic distal tip and large extraction lumen for the removal of soft thrombus from arteries 
d stat dry hemostatic bandage 
we launched this product on september  the d stat dry hemostatic bandage consists of a freeze dried pad of our d stat procoagulant which can be applied to topical bleeding with a custom adhesive bandage 
d stat radial hemostatic band 
we received regulatory clearance for this product in september and launched this product in the first quarter of the d stat radial hemostat band is a customized compression device with the power of the d stat procoagulant for sealing the arterial puncture following catheterization procedures 
we believe these four new products  together with sales of our existing duett  d stat flowable and acolysis products  will result in substantial revenue growth in we also believe that these new products will increase our gross margin percent to between and during results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales decreased modestly to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  approximately of our net sales for the year ended december  were to customers in the united states and of the net sales were to customers in international markets 
net sales by product category were as follows net sales of the d stat dry were  for the year ended december   compared to no sales in our d stat dry product was launched at the end of the third quarter of through december   we have sold our d stat dry to of the estimated  cardiac and interventional radiology labs in the us we expect to increase our d stat dry net sales to between  and  in net sales of the pronto were  for the year ended december   all from international sales  compared to no sales in our pronto product was launched at the end of the third quarter of in international markets  and we received fda approval in december but did not commence sales in the united states until we expect to increase pronto net sales to between  and  in net sales of vari lase kits and accessories were  for the year ended december   compared to no sales in our vari lase procedure kit was launched during the third quarter of in january we launched our vari lase laser console  and as a result we now offer a full line of endovenous laser products to our customers for the treatment of varicose veins 
we expect to increase our vari lase console  kits and accessory net sales to over  in net sales of d stat flowable increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended  a increase 
our reorder rate for the d stat flowable in compared to has remained steady at 
we expect to modestly increase our d stat flowable net sales to  in net sales of acolysis products were  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  we received the ce mark approval for our own manufacturing activities for the acolysis probe during the fourth quarter of  which will allow us to begin to expand our sales and marketing activities internationally in we expect to modestly increase acolysis net sales to  in net sales of our duett sealing device were  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  our duett sales in were negatively affected by the intense competitive environment in the united states invasive sealing device market and our new focus on new products 
the decrease  year over year  in duett net sales also was in line with our decrease in sales and marketing expenses from the year prior period 
we expect duett sales to continue to decline at a rate of between to  year over year  in as we continue to focus on our new higher margin and more competitive products 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  we added higher margin products to our selling mix during  particularly our d stat dry which has gross margins greater than 
we expect gross margins to increase in to to as our selling mix changes to favor the higher margin products and we continue to make slight gains in manufacturing efficiencies 
research and development expenses increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  the increase was directly related to our increased activity in launching four new products in and our continued work on our long term research and development projects 
research and development expenses fluctuate due to outside project spending 
we expect our research and development expenses to remain relatively steady during as we continue to pursue additional new products at an expected rate of approximately two new products per year and we continue to move our longer term development projects forward 
clinical and regulatory expenses increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  the expected increase was the result of the approval of our four new products in the second half of as well as our pocket protector clinical study for a new indication of our d stat flowable product 
clinical and regulatory expenses fluctuate due to the timing of clinical and marketing studies 
we expect clinical and regulatory expenses to increase by approximately in as we complete our pocket protector study  conduct clinical marketing studies related to our existing products and advance new products through the regulatory system 
sales and marketing expenses decreased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  during and we reviewed our sales and marketing expenditures and focused our spending in the areas that drive sales and provide an adequate financial return 
as of december   our direct sales force consisted of approximately employees compared to approximately as of december  we expect to add approximately field sales employees during to advance our new products 
as a result  we expect our sales and marketing expenses to increase by approximately in compared to general and administrative expenses decreased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily the result of lower legal fees in compared to  as we incurred legal fees in relating to the datascope litigation which was settled in the fourth quarter of the reduction in legal fees was partially offset by an increase in the cost of business insurance 
we currently anticipate that general and administrative expenses will remain relatively constant in legal settlement expenses were  for the year ended december  we entered into an agreement that settled all existing intellectual property litigation with datascope corporation in the fourth quarter of see legal proceedings in item of part i of this form k 
as part of the settlement  datascope released us from any claim of patent infringement based on past or future sales of the duett sealing device 
in exchange  we paid datascope a single lump sum of  in the fourth quarter of amortization of purchased technology was  for the year ended december  and  for the year ended december  the increase is the result of a full year of amortization in compared to the amortization resulted from our acquisition of the acolysis assets from the secured creditors of angiosonics  inc we allocated  from the acquisition to purchased technology and are amortizing the amount over four years 
interest income decreased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  primarily as a result of a reduced cash balance and lower interest rates 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales increased modestly to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  approximately of our net sales for the year ended december  were to customers in the united states and of the net sales were to customers in international markets 
net sales in were negatively affected by the intense competitive environment for our duett sealing device in the united states market 
net sales during benefited from the early sales of our d stat flowable hemostat  which we launched in february gross profit as a percentage of net sales was unchanged at for the year ended december  and we added the diagnostic duett  d stat and acolysis products to our selling mix during  which all have gross margins greater than 
the introduction of the higher margin products in was offset by a growth in the lower margin international sales 
research and development expenses decreased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  the decrease was attributable to more focused development work on the product line extensions and new products during research and development expenses can fluctuate due to outside project spending 
clinical and regulatory expenses increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  clinical and regulatory expenses fluctuate due to the timing of clinical and marketing studies 
sales and marketing expenses decreased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  we reviewed our sales and marketing expenditures and focused our spending in the areas that drove sales and provided an adequate financial return 
as of december   our direct sales force consisted of approximately employees compared to approximately as of december  general and administrative expenses decreased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  the decrease was the result of lower headcount in compared to legal settlement expenses were  for the year ended december  and  for the year ended december  we entered into an agreement that settled all existing intellectual property litigation with datascope corporation in see legal proceedings in item of part i of this form k 
as part of the settlement  datascope released us from any claim of patent infringement based on past or future sales of the duett sealing device 
in exchange  we paid datascope a single lump sum of  in the fourth quarter of we entered into an agreement that settled all existing intellectual property litigation with st 
jude medical in see legal proceedings in item of part i of this form k 
as a result of the settlement  we agreed to pay st 
jude medical a royalty of of our duett sales up to a maximum amount over the remaining life of the st 
jude medical patents 
we paid  to st 
jude medical in representing the past royalty on net sales of our duett device since under the settlement agreement 
amortization of purchased technology was  for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  the amortization was the result of our acquisition of the acolysis assets from the secured creditors of angiosonics  inc we allocated  from the acquisition to purchased technology and are amortizing the amount over four years 
interest income decreased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  primarily as a result of a reduced cash balance and lower interest rates 
income taxes we have not generated any pre tax income to date and therefore have not paid any federal income taxes since inception in december no provision or benefit for federal and state income taxes has been recorded for net operating losses incurred in any period since our inception 
as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately  for us federal income tax purposes which begin to expire in the year as of december   we also had federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately  which begin to expire in the year as of december   we also had a foreign tax loss carryforward of approximately  which does not expire 
under the tax reform act of  the amounts of and benefits from net operating loss carryforwards may be impaired or limited in certain circumstances  including significant changes in ownership interests 
future use of our existing net operating loss carryforwards may be restricted due to changes in ownership or from future tax legislation 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed all of our operations since inception through the issuance of equity securities and  to a lesser extent  sales of our products 
through december   we have sold common stock and preferred stock generating aggregate net proceeds of approximately million 
at december   we had  in cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities on hand compared to  at december during the year ended december   we used  to fund operating activities 
the cash used in operating activities was primarily used to fund our net loss for the period of  and an increase in inventory of  which was offset by depreciation and amortization of  the increase in inventory is due to the additon of four new products and our preparation for our expected increase in sales in during we generated proceeds of  in investing activities  primarily from the net sales of investment securities of  offset by net equipment purchases of  also during we generated  in financing activities  primarily from  we received through the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans  offset by our repurchase of our common stock for  in august  the board of directors adopted a stock repurchase program to acquire up to one million shares of our common stock in open market transactions 
the board of directors cancelled the program in july after purchasing a total of  shares 
during  we repurchased  shares under this stock repurchase program for  during the fourth quarter of  we entered into a million credit facility with silicon valley bank 
the line of credit has a month term  bears interest at the rate of prime plus and is secured by a first security interest on all of our assets 
the line of credit includes two covenants minimum tangible net worth of  and a liquidity coverage of not less than to 
we were in compliance with these covenants at december  as of december   we had no outstanding balance on the line of credit balance and the availability was million 
we purchase our requirements for thrombin a component in the duett and all of the d stat products under a purchase agreement dated june  with a subsidiary of king pharmaceuticals  inc the agreement provides for a fixed price  with adjustments based on the supplier s manufacturing costs and the supplier s annual percentage increase in the wholesale price of thrombin 
the agreement expires on may  during and the first five months of  we intend to increase our purchases of thrombin to benefit from the pricing provisions of the agreement  which we expect will substantially increase our inventory of thrombin 
we believe that these purchases will satisfy our thrombin requirements for  and most of we are currently exploring a new thrombin supply agreement and evaluating alternative potential suppliers  although there currently is no other source of commercially available thrombin approved for use in the united states 
we signed a purchase agreement with medart corporation on september  for the manufacture of our vari lase laser console 
under that agreement  we are obligated to purchase laser consoles with an aggregate purchase price of  for our vari lase business during the first year of the agreement  which commenced in december we do not have any other significant cash commitments related to supply agreements  nor do we have any significant commitments for capital expenditures 
the following table summarizes our contractual cash commitments as of december  payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years after years facility operating lease    medart purchase commitment   total contractual cash obligations   we currently anticipate that we will continue to experience a negative cash flow until at least the fourth quarter of at which time we project that we will become cash flow neutral 
we currently believe that our working capital of million and anticipated cash from product sales will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital requirements until we reach cash flow neutral in the fourth quarter of however  our actual liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors  including the costs and timing of expansion of sales and marketing activities  the amount of revenues from sales of our existing and new products  the cost of maintaining  enforcing and defending patents and other intellectual property rights  competing technological and market developments  developments related to regulatory and third party reimbursement matters  the cost and progress of our research and development efforts  and other factors 
in the event that additional financing is needed and depending on market conditions  we may seek to raise additional funds for working capital purposes at any time through the sale of equity or debt securities 
if cash generated from operations is insufficient to satisfy our cash needs  we may be required to raise additional funds 
we currently have no commitments for additional funding and so our ability to meet our long term liquidity needs is uncertain 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity securities  our shareholders may experience significant dilution 
furthermore  additional financing may not be available when needed or  if available  financing may not be on terms favorable to us or our shareholders 
if financing is not available when required or is not available on acceptable terms  we may be unable to develop or market our products or take advantage of business opportunities or may be required to significantly curtail our business operations 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations addresses our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of our financial statements requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate these estimates and judgments 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our accounting policies are described in note to the financial statements 
we set forth below those material accounting policies that we believe are the most critical to an investor s understanding of our financial results and condition  and require complex management judgment 
inventory we state our inventory at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market 
we record reserves for inventory shrinkage and for potentially excess  obsolete and slow moving inventory based upon historical experience and forecasted demand 
at december   this reserve was  compared to  at december  our reserve requirements could be materially different if demand for our products decreased because of competitive conditions or market acceptance  or if products become obsolete because of advancements in the industry 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue upon shipment of products to customers  net of estimated returns 
we analyze the rate of historical returns when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for sales returns  which is included with the allowance for doubtful accounts on our balance sheet 
at december   this reserve was  compared to  at december  if the historical data we use to calculate these estimates does not properly reflect future returns  revenue could be overstated 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
this allowance is regularly evaluated by us for adequacy by taking into consideration factors such as past experience  credit quality of the customer base  age of the receivable balances  both individually and in the aggregate  and current economic conditions that may affect a customer s ability to pay 
at december   this reserve was  compared to  at december  if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
income taxes the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets assumes that we will be able to generate sufficient taxable income in the united states and to a lesser extent germany  based on estimates and assumptions 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce the carrying value of our net deferred tax asset to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
for the year ended december   we recorded a million valuation allowance related to our net deferred tax assets of million 
in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase net income in the period such determination is made 
on a quarterly basis  we evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets and assess the requirement for a valuation allowance 
new accounting pronouncements in january  the financial accounting standards board issued fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
 or fin no 
fin no 
requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
fin no 
is effective immediately for all new variable interest entities created or acquired after january  for variable interest entities created or acquired prior to february   the provisions of fin no 
must be applied for the first interim or annual period beginning after december  the adoption of fin no 
did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
risk factors the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing our company 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations 
if any of the following risks occur  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be seriously harmed 
we will not be successful if the interventional medical device community does not adopt our new products during the third quarter of we commenced sales of our first product  the duett sealing device  in the united states  which we believe represents the largest market for interventional medical devices 
we have not become profitable with our sales of the duett 
in the second half of  we received clearance to commence sales of four new interventional products in the united states 
our success will depend on the medical community s acceptance of our new products 
we cannot predict how quickly  if at all  the medical community will accept our new products  or  if accepted  the extent of their use 
our potential customers must believe that our products offer benefits compared to the methodologies and or devices that they are currently using  use our products and obtain acceptable clinical outcomes  believe that our products are worth the price that they will be asked to pay  and be willing to commit the time and resources required to change their current methodology 
because we have only very recently commenced sales of our d stat dry hemostatic bandage  pronto extraction catheter  vari lase endovenous laser and d stat radial hemostat band products  we have no ability to predict the level of sales of these products 
if we encounter difficulties in growing our sales of our new medical devices in the united states  our business will be seriously harmed 
we have limited working capital to pursue our business on december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities and a working capital of million 
during  our operating activities resulted in the use of million of cash 
while we believe that during our working capital requirements will decrease due to sales of our new products  there can be no assurance that our existing working capital will be sufficient to satisfy our working capital needs 
if our sales do not increase  or if we encounter unexpected expenses  we will need to raise additional working capital 
we have no commitments for additional funding and so our ability to meet our long term liquidity needs is uncertain 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity securities  our shareholders may experience significant dilution 
furthermore  additional financing may not be available when needed or  if available  financing may not be on terms favorable to us or our shareholders 
if financing is not available when required or is not available on acceptable terms  we may be unable to develop or market our products or take advantage of business opportunities or may be required to significantly curtail our business operations 
we have incurred losses and we may not be profitable in the future since we commenced operations in february  we have incurred net losses primarily from costs relating to the development and commercialization of our duett sealing device and new products 
at december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we expect to continue to significantly invest in our sales and marketing  and research and development activities 
because of our plans to introduce new products and expand our commercialization  we expect to incur significant net losses through at least the first half of our business strategies may not be successful  and we may not become profitable in any future period or at all 
if we do become profitable  we cannot be certain that we can sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
we may face additional intellectual property claims in the future which could prevent us from manufacturing and selling our products or result in our incurring substantial costs and liabilities the interventional medical device industry is characterized by numerous patent filings and frequent and substantial intellectual property litigation 
companies in the interventional medical device industry have employed intellectual property litigation in an attempt to gain a competitive advantage 
we have been subject to two intellectual property lawsuits concerning our duett sealing device 
although we have settled both of these intellectual property lawsuits  it is possible that additional claims relating to the duett could be brought in the future 
in addition  while we do not believe that any of our new products infringes any existing patent  it is highly likely that we will become subject to intellectual property claims with respect to our new products in the future 
intellectual property litigation in recent years has proven to be very complex  and the outcome of such litigation is difficult to predict 
an adverse determination in any intellectual property litigation or interference proceedings could prohibit us from selling a product  subject us to significant liabilities to third parties or require us to seek licenses from third parties 
the costs associated with these license arrangements may be substantial and could include ongoing royalties 
furthermore  the necessary licenses may not be available to us on satisfactory terms  if at all 
adverse determinations in a judicial or administrative proceeding or failure to obtain necessary licenses could prevent us from manufacturing and selling a product 
our defense of intellectual property claims filed in the future  regardless of the merits of the complaint  could divert the attention of our technical and management personnel away from the development and marketing of our products for significant periods of time 
the costs incurred to future claims could be substantial and seriously harm us  even if our defense is ultimately successful 
the loss of  or interruption of supply from  key vendors  including our single source supplier of thrombin  could limit our ability to manufacture our products we purchase components used in our products from various suppliers and rely on a single source for the thrombin component of our duett sealing device and d stat products 
there are currently no fda approved alternative suppliers of thrombin 
our current supply agreement with our thrombin vendor extends through may  and there are no assurances that a future agreement can be negotiated  or that any future agreement would be on similar terms 
because it requires fda approval  establishing additional or replacement suppliers for thrombin would require a lead time of at least two years and would involve significant additional costs 
any supply interruption from our vendor of thrombin or from any other key vendor  or the failure by us to engage alternative vendors may limit our ability to manufacture our duett and d stat products and could therefore seriously harm our business 
our future operating results are difficult to predict and may vary significantly from quarter to quarter  which may adversely affect the price of our common stock the limited history of our sales and our history of losses make prediction of future operating results difficult 
you should not rely on our past revenue growth as any indication of future growth rates or operating results 
the price of our common stock will likely fall in the event that our operating results do not meet the expectations of analysts and investors 
comparisons of our quarterly operating results are an unreliable indication of our future performance because they are likely to vary significantly based on many factors  including the level of sales of our products in the united states market  our ability to introduce new products and enhancements in a timely manner  the demand for and acceptance of our products  the success of our competition and the introduction of alternative products  our ability to command favorable pricing for our products  the growth of the market for our devices  the expansion and rate of success of our direct sales force in the united states and our independent distributors internationally  actions relating to ongoing fda compliance  the effect of intellectual property disputes  the size and timing of orders from independent distributors or customers  the attraction and retention of key personnel  particularly in sales and marketing  regulatory  manufacturing and research and development  unanticipated delays or an inability to control costs  general economic conditions as well as those specific to our customers and markets  and seasonal fluctuations in revenue due to the elective nature of some procedures 
we may face product liability claims that could result in costly litigation and significant liabilities the manufacture and sale of medical products entail significant risk of product liability claims 
the medical device industry in general has been subject to significant medical malpractice litigation 
any product liability claims  with or without merit  could result in costly litigation  reduced sales  cause us to incur significant liabilities and divert our management s time  attention and resources 
because of our limited operating history and lack of experience with these claims  we cannot be sure that our product liability insurance coverage is adequate or that it will continue to be available to us on acceptable terms  if at all 
the market for interventional medical devices is highly competitive and will likely become more competitive  and our competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements that may render our products obsolete the existing market for interventional medical devices is intensely competitive 
we expect competition to increase further as companies develop new products and or modify their existing products to compete directly with ours 
the primary competitors for our duett sealing device are abbott laboratories through its subsidiary abbott vascular  datascope corp 
and st 
jude medical  inc  which sells a product developed by kensey nash corporation 
each of our new products encounters competition from at least several medical device companies  including medtronic inc and angiodynamics corporation 
each of these companies has better name recognition  broader product lines  greater sales  marketing and distribution capabilities  significantly greater financial resources  larger research and development staffs and facilities  and existing relationships with some of our potential customers 
we may not be able to effectively compete with these companies 
in addition  broad product lines may allow our competitors to negotiate exclusive  long term supply contracts and offer comprehensive pricing for their products 
broader product lines may also provide our competitors with a significant advantage in marketing competing products to group purchasing organizations and other managed care organizations that are increasingly seeking to reduce costs through centralized purchasing 
greater financial resources and product development capabilities may allow our competitors to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements that may render our products obsolete 
our international sales are subject to a number of risks that could seriously harm our ability to successfully commercialize our products in any international market our international sales are subject to several risks  including the ability of our independent distributors to sell our products  the impact of recessions in economies outside the united states  greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable and longer collection periods  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs or other trade barriers  weaker intellectual property rights protection in some countries  potentially adverse tax consequences  and political and economic instability 
the occurrence of any of these events could seriously harm our future international sales and our ability to successfully commercialize our products in any international market 
we have limited manufacturing experience and may encounter difficulties in our manufacturing operations which could seriously harm our business we have limited experience in manufacturing our products 
in particular  we have very limited experience in lyophilization  which is a key manufacturing step for our d stat dry hemostatic bandage 
we believe our facilities are adequate for our projected production of our products for the foreseeable future  but future facility requirements will depend largely on future sales of our products in the united states 
we may encounter unforeseen difficulties in expanding our production of our new products  including problems involving production yields  quality control and assurance  component supply and shortages of qualified personnel  compliance with fda regulations and requirements regarding good manufacturing practices  and the need for further regulatory approval of new manufacturing processes 
difficulties encountered by us in expanding and maintaining our manufacturing capabilities could seriously harm our business 
our business and results of operations may be seriously harmed by changes in third party reimbursement policies we could be seriously harmed by changes in reimbursement policies of governmental or private healthcare payors  particularly to the extent any changes affect reimbursement for catheterization procedures in which our products are used 
failure by physicians  hospitals and other users of our products to obtain sufficient reimbursement from healthcare payors for procedures in which our products are used or adverse changes in governmental and private third party payors policies toward reimbursement for such procedures would seriously harm our business 
in the united states  healthcare providers  including hospitals and clinics that purchase medical devices such as our products  generally rely on third party payors  principally federal medicare  state medicaid and private health insurance plans  to reimburse all or part of the cost of catheterization procedures 
any changes in this reimbursement system could seriously harm our business 
in international markets  acceptance of our products is dependent in part upon the availability of reimbursement within prevailing healthcare payment systems 
reimbursement and healthcare payment systems in international markets vary significantly by country 
our failure to receive international reimbursement approvals could have a negative impact on market acceptance of our products in the markets in which these approvals are sought 
our products and our manufacturing activities are subject to extensive governmental regulation that could prevent us from selling our products in the united states or introducing new and improved products our products and our manufacturing activities are subject to extensive regulation by a number of governmental agencies  including the fda and comparable international agencies 
we are required to obtain the clearance of the fda and international agencies before we can market and sell our products  satisfy these agencies content requirements for all of our labeling  sales and promotional materials  and undergo rigorous inspections by these agencies 
compliance with the regulations of these agencies may delay or prevent us from introducing any new model of our existing products or other new products 
furthermore  we may be subject to sanctions  including temporary or permanent suspension of operations  product recalls and marketing restrictions if we fail to comply with the laws and regulations pertaining to our business 
we are also required to demonstrate compliance with the fda s quality system regulations 
the fda enforces its quality system regulations through pre approval and periodic post approval inspections 
these regulations relate to product testing  vendor qualification  design control and quality assurance  as well as the maintenance of records and documentation 
if we are unable to conform to these regulations  the fda may take actions which could seriously harm our business 
in addition  government regulation may be established that could prevent  delay  modify or rescind regulatory clearance or approval of our products 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents  available for sale securities and accounts receivables 
we maintain our accounts for cash and cash equivalents and available for sale securities principally at one major bank and one investment firm in the united states 
we have a formal written investment policy that restricts the placement of investments to issuers evaluated as creditworthy 
we have not experienced any losses on our deposits of our cash and cash equivalents 
with respect to accounts receivable  we perform credit evaluations of our customers and do not require collateral 
there have been no material losses on accounts receivables 
in the united states and germany  we sell our products directly to hospitals and clinics in the local currency 
revenue is recognized upon shipment of products to customers 
in all other international markets  we sell our products to independent distributors who  in turn  sell to medical clinics 
we sell our product in these countries through independent distributors denominated in united states dollars 
loss  termination or ineffectiveness of distributors to effectively promote our product would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we do not believe our operations are currently subject to significant market risks for interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices or other relevant market price risks of a material nature
