overview we provide financial products and services through the following segments o us asset management and accumulation  which consists of our asset accumulation operations which provide products and services  including retirement savings and related investment products and services  and our asset management operations conducted through principal global investors 
we provide a comprehensive portfolio of asset accumulation products and services to businesses and individuals in the us  with a concentration on small and medium sized businesses  which we define as businesses with fewer than  employees 
we offer to businesses products and services for defined contribution pension plans  including k and b plans  defined benefit pension plans  non qualified executive benefit plans  and employee stock ownership plan consulting services 
we also offer annuities  mutual funds and bank products and services to the employees of our business customers and other individuals 
o international asset management and accumulation  which consists of principal international  offers retirement products and services  annuities  long term mutual funds and life insurance through subsidiaries in argentina  chile  mexico  hong kong and india and joint ventures in brazil  japan  and malaysia 
prior to october   the operating segment included bt financial group  an australia based asset manager 
we sold substantially all of bt financial group  effective october  see transactions affecting comparability of results of operations 
o life and health insurance  which provides life insurance  health insurance as well as disability insurance throughout the us our life insurance products include universal and variable universal life  traditional life  and group life 
our health insurance products include medical insurance  dental and vision insurance  and administrative services 
our disability insurance products include individual and group disability insurance 
o mortgage banking  which engages in originating  purchasing  selling and servicing residential mortgage loans in the us corporate and other  which manages the assets representing capital that has not been allocated to any other segment 
financial results of the corporate and other segment primarily reflect our financing activities including interest expense  income on capital not allocated to other segments  intersegment eliminations  income tax risks and certain income  expenses and other after tax adjustments not allocated to the segments based on the nature of such items 
economic factors and trends the declining interest rate environment and poor performance in the equity markets in slowed our growth in asset accumulation account values for that year in our us asset management and accumulation segment 
improvements in the equity markets in contributed to a significant increase in account values by the end of in our international asset and accumulation segment  we continued to grow our existing business through organic growth in our existing subsidiaries and a combination of joint ventures and strategic acquisitions 
during and  sales of life insurance have continued to shift from traditional insurance products to universal and variable universal products in our life and health insurance segment 
while health insurance membership has declined over the past few years  premium revenue has grown due to price increases and  to some degree  due to the impact of reinsurance 
declining interest rates in resulted in increases in the production of both purchase and refinance mortgage loans in our mortgage banking segment 
this trend continued through all of and much of however  interest rates increased during the third and fourth quarters resulting in a decrease in mortgage loan production in the fourth quarter of profitability our profitability depends in large part upon our o amount of assets under management  o spreads we earn on our policyholders general account balances  o ability to generate fee revenues by providing administrative and investment management services  o ability to price our life and health insurance products at a level that enables us to earn a margin over the cost of providing benefits and the expense of acquiring and administering those products  which is primarily a function of competitive conditions  persistency  our ability to assess and manage trends in mortality and morbidity experience  our ability to generate investment earnings and our ability to maintain expenses in accordance with pricing assumptions  o ability to effectively monitor and price residential mortgage loans we originate  purchase  and sell and to manage the expenses we incur in servicing residential mortgage loans  o ability to effectively hedge the effect of interest rate changes on our residential mortgage servicing rights  o ability to manage our investment portfolio to maximize investment returns and minimize risks such as interest rate changes or defaults or impairments of invested assets  o ability to effectively hedge fluctuations in foreign currency to us dollar exchange rates  and o ability to manage our operating expenses 
critical accounting policies and estimates the increasing complexity of the business environment and applicable authoritative accounting guidance requires us to closely monitor our accounting policies 
we have identified five critical accounting policies that are complex and require significant judgment and estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 
a summary of our critical accounting policies is intended to enhance the reader s ability to assess our financial condition and results of operations and the potential volatility due to changes in estimates and changes in guidance 
we have discussed the identification  selection and disclosure of critical accounting estimates and policies with the audit committee of the board of directors 
valuation of invested assets fixed maturities  available for sale 
fixed maturity securities include bonds  mortgage backed securities and redeemable preferred stock 
we classify our fixed maturity securities as either available for sale or trading and  accordingly  carry them at fair value 
since many of the fixed maturity securities that we invest in are private market assets  there are not readily available market quotes to determine the fair market value 
these assets are valued using a spread pricing matrix 
when utilizing a spread pricing matrix  securities are valued through a discounted cash flow method where each bond is assigned a credit and liquidity spread  which is added to the current us treasury rate to discount the cash flows of the security 
our spread pricing matrix uses the otr treasury curve  which is pulled from bloomberg as of the valuation date 
capital management sciences cms has been contracted to serve as an independent source of credit spreads to be used in the corporate private placement valuation process 
the credit spreads are based on weekly indices of the public bond market and vary by industry  credit quality  and average investment life 
the liquidity spread is based on the average pick up a private placement can expect to earn over a comparable public bond because of illiquidity 
the spreads assigned to each security change from month to month based on changes in the market 
an interest rate increase in the range of to basis points  and holding credit spreads constant  produces total values of billion and billion  as compared to the recorded amount of billion related to our fixed maturity  available for sale assets held by the principal life general account 
when evaluating a fixed maturity security for impairment  we consider relevant facts and circumstances in evaluating whether the impairment is other than temporary 
relevant facts and circumstances considered include the length of time the fair value has been below cost  the financial position and access to capital of the issuer  including the current and future impact of any specific events  and our ability and intent to hold the security to maturity or until it recovers in value 
to the extent we determine that a security is deemed to be other than temporarily impaired  the difference between amortized cost and fair value is charged to net income 
there are a number of significant risks and uncertainties inherent in the process of monitoring impairments and determining if an impairment is other than temporary 
these risks and uncertainties include the risk that our assessment of an issuer s ability to meet all of its contractual obligations will change based on changes in the credit characteristics of that issuer  the risk that the economic outlook will be worse than expected or have more of an impact on the issuer than anticipated  the risk that our investment professionals are making decisions based on fraudulent or misstated information in the financial statements provided by issuers  and the risk that new information obtained by us or changes in other facts and circumstances lead us to change our intent to hold the security to maturity or until it recovers in value 
any of these situations could result in a charge to net income in a future period 
at december   we had  million in available for sale fixed maturity securities with gross unrealized losses totaling million 
included in the gross unrealized losses are losses attributable to both movements in market interest rates as well as temporary credit issues 
also included in the million is million in unrealized losses that are attributable to fixed maturity securities that are part of a fair value hedging relationship 
as such  the million has been recorded in net income versus other comprehensive income 
net income would be reduced by approximately million  on an after tax basis  if all the non hedged securities were deemed to be other than temporarily impaired 
in  we recognized million in gains on the sales of impaired securities and an additional million in impairment losses on assets that had previously been impaired 
mortgage loans 
mortgage loans consist primarily of commercial mortgage loans on real estate 
at december   commercial mortgage loans represented  million 
commercial mortgage loans are generally reported at cost adjusted for amortization of premiums and accrual of discounts  computed using the interest method  and net of valuation allowances 
commercial mortgage loans held for sale are carried at the lower of cost or fair value  less cost to sell  and reported as mortgage loans in the statements of financial position 
commercial mortgage loans on real estate are considered impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to contractual terms of the loan agreement 
when we determine that a loan is impaired  a provision for loss is established for the difference between the carrying amount of the mortgage loan and the estimated value 
estimated value is based on either the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  the loan s observable market price or fair value of the collateral 
the provision for losses is reported as a net realized unrealized capital loss on our consolidated statements of operations 
mortgage loans deemed to be uncollectible are charged against the allowance for losses  and subsequent recoveries are credited to the allowance for losses 
the allowance for losses is maintained at a level believed adequate by us to absorb estimated probable credit losses 
the determination of the calculation and the adequacy of the mortgage loan reserve and mortgage impairments are subjective 
our periodic evaluation and assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for losses and the need for mortgage impairments is based on known and inherent risks in the portfolio  adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay  the estimated value of the underlying collateral  composition of the loan portfolio  current economic conditions and other relevant factors 
our reserving methodology looks at several factors that define five current economic conditions or states ranging from best to worst with positive and negative biases 
the determination of the current economic state looks at factors including industry delinquency statistics  portfolio drift based on an internal rating model  the growth in our internal watch list  national real estate space absorption  vacancy levels  national employment growth expectations  projected gross domestic product  projected consumer spending growth  and the capital market assessment and outlook 
at december   our determination of the current economic state was average with a negative bias 
this economic state coupled with the current portfolio statistics produced a reserve for the principal life general account totaling million 
holding all other portfolio criteria constant  if the economic state had been determined to be the best one at december   principal life s general account reserve would have been million and if the economic state had been determined to be the worst one  the principal life general account mortgage loan reserve would have totaled million 
the evaluation of our loan specific reserve component is also subjective  as it requires estimating the amounts and timing of future cash flows expected to be received on impaired loans 
our financial position is sensitive to changes in estimated cash flows from mortgages  the value of the collateral  and changes in the economic environment in general 
insurance reserves reserves are liabilities representing estimates of the amounts that will come due  at some point in the future  to our contractholders 
us gaap  allowing for some degree of managerial judgment  prescribes the methods of establishing reserves 
future policy benefits and claims include reserves for certain insurance products that are computed using assumptions of mortality  morbidity  lapse  investment performance and expense 
these assumptions are based on our experience and are periodically reviewed against industry standards to ensure actuarial credibility 
once these assumptions are made for a given policy or group of policies  they will not be changed over the life of the policy unless we recognize a loss on the entire line of business 
our reserve levels are reviewed throughout the year using internal analysis  the annual audit  and annual statutory asset adequacy analysis 
to the extent experience indicates potential loss recognition  we recognize losses on certain lines of business 
the ultimate accuracy of the assumptions on these long tailed insurance products cannot be determined until the obligation of the entire block of business on which the assumptions were made is extinguished 
short term variances of actual results from the assumptions used in the computation of the reserves are reflected in current period net income and can impact quarter to quarter net income 
future policy benefits and claims also include reserves for incurred but unreported health claims 
we record this liability and corresponding benefit expense for claims that are incurred but not yet reported 
we recognize claims costs in the period the service was provided to our members 
however  claims costs incurred in a particular period are not known with certainty until after we receive  process and pay the claims 
we determine the amount of this liability using actuarial methods based on historical claim payment patterns as well as emerging medical cost trends to determine our estimate of claim liabilities 
we also look back to assess how our prior periods estimates developed 
to the extent appropriate  changes in such development are recorded as a change to current period claim expense 
for the years ending  and  the amount of the claim reserve adjustment made in that period for prior period estimates was within a reasonable range given our normal claims fluctuations 
deferred policy acquisition costs dpac commissions and other costs underwriting  issuance and agency expenses  premium credits  conversion bonuses and first year bonus interest that vary with and are primarily related to the acquisition of new and renewal insurance policies and investment contract business are capitalized to the extent recoverable 
maintenance costs and acquisition costs that are not deferrable are charged to operations as incurred 
deferred policy acquisition costs for universal life type insurance contracts and participating life insurance policies and investment contracts are being amortized over the lives of the policies and contracts in relation to the emergence of estimated gross profit margins 
this amortization is adjusted retrospectively when estimates of current or future gross profits and margins to be realized from a group of products and contracts are revised 
the deferred policy acquisition costs of non participating term life insurance policies are being amortized over the premium paying period of the related policies using assumptions consistent with those used in computing policyholder liabilities 
deferred policy acquisition costs are subject to recoverability testing at the time of policy issue and loss recognition testing at the end of each accounting period 
deferred policy acquisition costs would be written off to the extent that it is determined that future policy premiums and investment income or gross profit margins would not be adequate to cover related losses and expenses 
excluding non participating term life insurance policies  the deferred policy acquisition cost asset is amortized in relation to the gross profits of the underlying policies  over the expected lifetime of these policies 
at issue  we develop an estimate of the expected future gross profits 
these estimated gross profits contain assumptions relating to mortality  morbidity  investment yield and expenses 
as actual experience emerges  the gross profits may vary from those expected either in magnitude or timing 
for our universal life and investment contracts  we are required by accounting practice to reflect the actual gross profits of the underlying policies 
in addition  we are required to revise our assumptions regarding future experience as soon as the current assumptions become no longer actuarially credible 
both actions  reflecting actual experience and changing future estimates  can cause changes in the amount of the asset and the pattern of future amortization 
we utilize a mean reversion method reversion to the mean assumption  a common industry practice  to determine the future equity market growth rate assumption used for the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs on investment contracts pertaining to individual variable annuities and group annuities which have separate account equity investment options 
this practice assumes that the expectation for long term appreciation is not changed by minor short term market fluctuations 
we periodically update these estimates and evaluate the recoverability of deferred policy acquisition costs 
when appropriate  we revise our assumptions of the estimated gross profits of these contracts  and the cumulative amortization is re estimated and adjusted by a cumulative charge or credit to current operations 
the total dpac asset balance as of december   was billion 
the impact of a reduction in the long term investment performance rate assumption on separate accounts in our deferred policy acquisition cost models is an estimated million reduction in the deferred policy acquisition cost asset as of december  also  removing the mean reversion methodology from the deferred policy acquisition cost asset calculation has no impact on the december   asset 
positive equity market performance during resulted in an observed reversion to the mean as of the end of benefit plans the reported expense and liability associated with these plans requires the use of assumptions 
we annually review our retirement and other post retirement benefit plan assumptions for the discount rate  the long term rate of return on plan assets  and the compensation increase rate 
the assumed discount rate is determined by projecting future benefit payments and discounting those cash flows using rates based on the bloomberg aa finance yield to maturity curves 
for year end  we set the discount rate at 
a decrease in the discount rate would increase pension benefits projected benefit obligation pbo and the net periodic pension cost nppc by approximately million and million  respectively 
a decrease in the discount rate would increase other post retirement benefits accumulated postretirement benefit obligation apbo and the net periodic benefit cost npbc by approximately million and million  respectively 
a increase in the discount rate would result in decreases in benefit obligations and expenses at a level generally commensurate with that noted above 
the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets is generally set at the long term rate expected to be earned based on the long term investment policy of the plans and the various classes of the invested funds 
historical returns of multiple asset classes were analyzed to develop a risk free real rate of return and risk premiums for each asset class 
the risk premiums take into account the long term level of risk of the asset class 
the overall long term rate for each asset class was developed by combining a long term inflation component  the risk free real rate of return  and the associated risk premium 
a weighted average rate was developed based on long term returns for each asset class  the plan s target asset allocation policy  and the tax structure of the trusts 
for nppc and npbc for other post retirement benefits  an and weighted average long term rate of return assumption will be used  respectively 
a decrease in the long term rate of return would increase nppc by approximately million and the npbc by approximately million 
a increase in this rate would result in a decrease to expense at the same levels 
the expected return on plan assets is based on the fair market value of plan assets as of september  the target asset mix of the pension plan is minimum maximum asset class ranges us us fixed income real estate non us non us non us fixed non us other the compensation increase rate assumption is generally set at a rate consistent with current and expected long term compensation and salary policy  including inflation 
the pension plans gains losses are amortized using a straight line amortization method over the average remaining service period of employees 
actuarial gains losses are amortized over approximately years for pension costs and over approximately years for benefit costs 
prior service costs are amortized on a weighted average basis over approximately years for pension costs and over approximately years for benefit costs 
mortgage loan servicing rights mortgage loan servicing rights represent the value of purchasing or originating the right to receive cash flows from servicing mortgage loans 
servicing rights are recorded at the time of sale of the underlying mortgage loans where the related servicing is retained 
the total cost of the mortgage loans  which includes the cost to acquire the servicing rights  is allocated to the mortgage loans and the servicing rights based on their relative estimated fair values at the date of sale 
to reduce the impact of interest rate fluctuations on net income  we hedge changes in the estimated fair value of our mortgage servicing rights with derivative financial instruments 
for mortgage servicing rights designated as a hedged item in a fair value hedge under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas  as amended  the carrying value of the mortgage servicing rights is adjusted for changes in fair value resulting from the application of hedge accounting 
capitalized servicing rights are carried at the lower of cost or estimated fair value 
the capitalized value is amortized in proportion to  and over the period of  estimated net servicing income 
amortization is analyzed periodically and is adjusted to reflect changes in prepayment speeds 
capitalized mortgage loan servicing rights are periodically assessed for impairment based on the estimated fair value of those rights under sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities sfas 
for purposes of performing our impairment evaluation  we stratify the servicing portfolio on the basis of certain predominant risk characteristics  including loan type  note rate  and rate type 
to the extent that the carrying value of the servicing rights exceeds estimated fair value for any stratum  a valuation allowance is established  which may be adjusted in the future as the estimated fair value of the servicing rights increase or decrease 
changes in the valuation allowance are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations during the period in which the impairment or recovery occurs 
fair values are estimated using estimates of discounted future net cash flows over the expected lives of the underlying loans using loan prepayment  discount rate  ancillary fee income and other assumptions we believe market participants would use to value such assets 
the reasonableness of our assumptions is confirmed through comparisons against qualified mortgage servicing rights trades that were completed in the prior quarter and quarterly independent surveys 
independent appraisals of the fair value of our servicing portfolio are obtained periodically during the year and are used to evaluate the reasonableness of our fair value conclusions 
due to the continuing lack of an active servicing market  we obtained additional evidence to support our estimated fair value at december  based on this information  we performed an analysis of our mortgage servicing rights portfolio  which resulted in an additional impairment charge of million in december during the second quarter of  we established a policy of further evaluating our mortgage servicing rights valuation allowance by identifying portions of the allowance that represent a permanent impairment ie  direct write downs 
each quarter  we will recognize a direct write down when the gross carrying value is not expected to be recovered in the foreseeable future 
we estimate the amount of direct write downs based on an analysis of the mortgage servicing rights valuation allowance related to loans that have prepaid 
direct write downs reduce the gross carrying value and the valuation allowance of the mortgage servicing rights  thereby precluding subsequent recapture of previous valuation allowances 
the direct write downs have no impact on net income or financial position in the period of adjustment but may result in a reduction of amortization expense and reduced recovery of impairments in periods subsequent to adjustment 
we must exercise certain judgments and make estimates in the application of this policy 
we have some discretion in determining interest rate assumptions to use in its estimates  but we are guided by the benchmark curve of libor swap term structure  the volatility of interest rates derived from historical volatility in libor swap rates  and the addition of mortgage spread to the modeled year swap rate to derive the mortgage refinancing rate 
we develop prepayment models internally by examining the historical prepayment experience of our portfolio  given the historical interest rate environment 
servicing cost assumptions are derived from budgeted costs  interest differential  and foreclosure losses based on historical evidence  and amortization based on expected non discounted cash flows 
servicing revenue assumptions are derived from historical experience and include principal and interest float  escrow float  prepayment float  late charges collected  and ancillary income 
the key economic assumptions used in estimating the fair value of mortgage servicing rights at the date of loan sale for sales completed in  and were as follows weighted average life years weighted average prepayment speed yield to maturity discount rate prepayment speed is the constant prepayment rate that results in the weighted average life disclosed above 
at december   key economic assumptions and the sensitivity of the current estimated fair value of the mortgage servicing rights to immediate and adverse changes in those assumptions were as follows dollars in millions estimated fair value of mortgage servicing rights  expected weighted average life in years prepayment speed decrease in estimated fair value of adverse change decrease in estimated fair value of adverse change yield to maturity discount rate decrease in estimated fair value of adverse change decrease in estimated fair value of adverse change represents the weighted average prepayment speed and discount rate for the life of the mortgage servicing rights asset using our option adjusted spread monte carlo simulation of interest rate paths 
these sensitivities are hypothetical and should be used with caution 
as the figures indicate  changes in estimated fair value based on a variation in assumptions generally cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in the assumption to the change in estimated fair value may not be linear 
also  in the above table  the effect of a variation in a particular assumption on the estimated fair value of the servicing rights is calculated independently without changing any other assumption 
in reality  changes in one factor may result in changes in another  which might magnify or counteract the sensitivities 
for example  changes in prepayment speed estimates could result in changes in the discount rate

dispositions we entered into disposition agreements or disposed of the following businesses  among others  during the past three years bt financial group 
on october   we sold substantially all of bt financial group to westpac banking corporation westpac 
as of december   we have received proceeds of a million australian dollars a us million from westpac  with future contingent proceeds in of up to a million approximately us million 
the contingent proceeds will be based on westpac s future success in growing retail funds under management 
we do not anticipate receiving the contingent proceeds 
excluding contingent proceeds  our total after tax proceeds from the sale were approximately us million 
this amount includes cash proceeds from westpac  expected tax benefits  and gain from unwinding the hedged asset associated with our investment in bt financial group 
as of december   we accrued for an estimated after tax loss on disposal of million 
for the year ended december   we recognized an after tax gain of million  primarily due to additional tax benefits and additional proceeds received upon completion of the sale to westpac 
these gains were recorded in the income loss from discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations 
bt financial group is accounted for as a discontinued operation and therefore  the results of operations excluding corporate overhead and cash flows have been removed from our results of continuing operations for all periods presented 
corporate overhead allocated to bt financial group does not qualify for discontinued operations treatment under sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  and therefore is still included in our results of continuing operations 
the results of operations excluding corporate overhead for bt financial group are reported as other after tax adjustments in our international asset management and accumulation segment 
selected financial information for the discontinued operations is as follows for the year ended december  in millions  except as indicated total assets under management in billions total revenues loss from continuing operations  net of related income taxes corporate overhead income loss from discontinued operations income loss before income taxes income taxes benefits income loss from discontinued operations income loss on disposal  net of related income taxes income loss from discontinued operations  net of related income taxes cumulative effect of accounting changes  net of related income taxes net income loss the summary results of operations information is for the ten months ended october   the date of sale of bt financial group and  accordingly  there is no statement of operations data to present for net of related income tax benefits of million and million in and  respectively 
in connection with the sale of bt financial group  we agreed to indemnify the purchaser  westpac for  among other things  the costs associated with potential late filings made by bt financial group in new zealand prior to westpac s ownership  up to a maximum of a million australian dollars approximately us million as of december  
new zealand securities regulations allow australian issuers to issue their securities in new zealand provided that certain documents are appropriately filed with the new zealand registrar of companies 
specifically  the regulations require that any amendments to constitutions and compliance plans be filed in new zealand 
in april  the new zealand securities commission the commission opined that such late filings would result in certain new zealand investors having a right to return of their investment plus interest at per annum from the date of investment 
consequently  the commission has advised that it has initiated an inquiry into the matter  both with regard to bt financial group and other similar issuers 
we view these potential late filings as a technical matter as we believe investors received the information that is required to be provided directly to them 
in addition  we believe this technical issue may affect many in the industry and result in a favorable legislative or judicial solution 
a relevant legislative solution and judicial action are both pending in new zealand 
although we cannot predict the outcome of this matter or reasonably estimate losses  we do not believe that it would result in a material adverse effect on our business or financial position 
it is possible  however  that it could have a material adverse effect on net income in a particular quarter or annual period

us asset management and accumulation segment asset accumulation trends our sales of pension and other asset accumulation products and services in the us have been affected by overall trends in the us retirement services industry  as our customers have begun to rely less on defined benefit retirement plans  social security and other government programs 
recent trends in the work environment include a more mobile workforce and the desire of employers to shift the market risk of retirement investments to employees by offering defined contribution plans rather than defined benefit plans 
these trends are increasing the demand for defined contribution pension arrangements such as k plans  mutual funds or variable annuities 
the baby boom generation of us workers has reached an age at which saving for retirement is critical and it continues to seek tax advantaged investment products for retirement 
also  the economic growth and tax relief reconciliation act of had many of its provisions become effective in  which increased allowed contribution limits and a number of other opportunities to save for retirement 
considering these trends  asset accumulation account values increased as of december   primarily due to significant additional gross new deposits  strong performance of the equity markets and retention of assets from existing clients 
the declining interest rate environment and poor performance in the equity markets in slowed our growth in asset accumulation account values for that year

following is a simplified organizational structure 
principal financial group  inc principal financial services  inc principal life principal international other insurance company entities subsidiaries principal residential other mortage  inc subsidiaires the holding companies principal financial group  inc 
and principal financial services  inc 
liquidity describes the ability of a company to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the cash requirements of business operations 
our parent holding company  principal financial group  inc  is a delaware business corporation  whose assets primarily consist of the outstanding capital stock of its subsidiaries 
as a holding company  principal financial group inc s ability to meet cash requirements  including the payments of dividends on common stock and the repurchase of stock  substantially depends upon dividends from subsidiaries  primarily principal life 
the payment of stockholder dividends by principal life to its parent company is limited by iowa laws 
under iowa laws  principal life may pay dividends only from the earned surplus arising from its business and must receive the prior approval of the insurance commissioner of the state of iowa the commissioner to pay a stockholder dividend if such a stockholder dividend would exceed certain statutory limitations 
the current statutory limitation is the greater of o of principal life s statutory policyholder surplus as of the previous year end  or o the statutory net gain from operations from the previous calendar year 
iowa law gives the commissioner discretion to disapprove requests for dividends in excess of these limits 
based on this limitation and statutory results  principal life could pay approximately million in stockholder dividends in without exceeding the statutory limitation 
principal life was able to pay approximately million in statutory dividends in based on its statutory financial results without being subject to the restrictions on payment of extraordinary stockholder dividends 
total stockholder dividends paid by principal life to its parent company in were million 
principal life did not pay a dividend in another source of liquidity is issuance of our common stock 
proceeds from the issuance of our common stock were million and million in and  respectively

the remaining  million was contributed to principal life principally to fund demutualization compensation to policyholders in the form of policy credits and cash  and to cover certain expenses related to our demutualization 
in addition  net proceeds from the issuance of additional shares for the exercise of the over allotment options granted to the underwriters in the ipo  totaled million  all of which we retained for repurchase of shares issued in the exercise of the over allotment options

in the last two years  our board of directors has authorized various repurchase programs under which we are allowed to purchase shares of our outstanding common stock 
shares repurchased under these programs are accounted for as treasury stock  carried at cost and reflected as a reduction to stockholders equity 
the repurchases are made in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions  from time to time  depending on market conditions 
in may  our board of directors authorized a repurchase program of up to million of our outstanding common stock 
this program began after the completion of the november repurchase program  which authorized the repurchase of up to million of our outstanding common stock 
we acquired million and million shares in the open market at an aggregate cost of million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively

sources of liquidity also include facilities for short term and long term borrowing as needed  arranged through our intermediate holding company  principal financial services inc pfsi  and its subsidiaries 
see contractual obligations and commercial commitments below 
although we generate adequate cash flow to meet the needs of our normal operations  periodically the need may arise to issue debt to fund internal expansion  acquisitions  investment opportunities and the retirement of existing debt and equity

the shelf registration totals billion  with the ability to issue debt securities  preferred stock  common stock  warrants  stock purchase contracts and stock purchase units of principal financial group  inc pfg and trust preferred securities of three subsidiary trusts 
if we issue securities  we intend to use the proceeds from the sale of the securities offered by this prospectus  including the corresponding junior subordinated debentures issued to the trusts in connection with their investment of all the proceeds from the sale of preferred securities  for general corporate purposes  including working capital  capital expenditures  investments in subsidiaries  acquisitions and refinancing of debt  including commercial paper and other short term indebtedness 
pfsi unconditionally guarantees our obligations with respect to one or more series of debt securities described in the shelf registration statement 
principal life historically  the principal cash flow sources for principal life have been premiums from life and health insurance products  pension and annuity deposits  asset management fee revenues  administrative services fee revenues  income from investments  proceeds from the sales or maturity of investments  long term debt and short term borrowings 
cash outflows consist primarily of payment of benefits to policyholders and beneficiaries  income and other taxes  current operating expenses  payment of dividends to policyholders  payments in connection with investments acquired  payments made to acquire subsidiaries  payment of dividends to parent  and payments relating to policy and contract surrenders  withdrawals  policy loans  interest expense and repayment of short term borrowings and long term debt 
principal life maintains investment strategies generally intended to provide adequate funds to pay benefits without forced sales of investments 
products having liabilities with longer lives  such as life insurance and full service payout pension products  are matched with assets having similar estimated lives such as mortgage loans  long term bonds and private placement bonds 
shorter term liabilities are matched with investments such as short and medium term fixed maturities 
in addition  highly liquid  high quality short term investments are held to fund anticipated operating expenses  surrenders  withdrawals and development and maintenance expenses associated with new products and technologies 
our privately placed fixed maturity securities  commercial mortgage loans and real estate investments are generally less liquid than our publicly traded fixed maturity securities 
as of december  and  these asset classes represented approximately and  respectively  of the value of our consolidated invested assets 
see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk for a discussion of duration matching 
life insurance companies generally produce a positive cash flow from operations  as measured by the amount by which cash inflows are adequate to meet benefit obligations to policyholders and normal operating expenses as they are incurred 
the remaining cash flow is generally used to increase the asset base to provide funds to meet the need for future policy benefit payments and for writing and acquiring new business 
it is important to match the investment portfolio maturities to the cash flow demands of the type of annuity  investment or insurance product being provided 
principal life continuously monitors benefits  surrenders and maturities to provide projections of future cash requirements 
as part of this monitoring process  principal life performs cash flow testing of many of its assets and liabilities under various scenarios to evaluate the adequacy of reserves 
in developing its investment strategy  principal life establishes a level of cash and securities which  combined with expected net cash inflows from operations  maturities of fixed maturity investments and principal payments on mortgage backed securities and commercial mortgage loans  are believed adequate to meet anticipated short term and long term benefit and expense payment obligations 
there can be no assurance that future experience regarding benefits and surrenders will be similar to historic experience since withdrawal and surrender levels are influenced by such factors as the interest rate environment and the claims paying ability and financial strength ratings of principal life 
principal life takes into account asset liability management considerations in the product development and design process 
contract terms of and of principal life s universal and variable universal life insurance products as of december  and  respectively  include surrender and withdrawal provisions which mitigate the risk of losses due to early withdrawals 
these provisions generally do one or more of the following limit the amount of penalty free withdrawals  limit the circumstances under which withdrawals are permitted  or assess a surrender charge or market value adjustment relating to the underlying assets 
the market value adjustment feature in principal life s fixed annuity products adjusts the surrender value of a contract in the event of surrender prior to the end of the contract period to protect principal life against losses due to higher interest rates at the time of surrender 
our gics and funding agreements contain provisions limiting early surrenders  including penalties for early surrenders and minimum notice requirements 
put provisions give customers the option to terminate a contract prior to maturity  provided they give a minimum notice period 
we no longer issue puttable gics

international operations we have received approximately us million of total proceeds from our sale of substantially all of bt financial group to westpac 
this amount includes cash proceeds from westpac  expected tax benefits  and a gain from unwinding the hedged asset associated with our investment in bt financial group 
an additional future contingent receipt of approximately us million may be received in  if westpac experiences growth in their retail assets under management 
we do not anticipate receiving the contingent proceeds 
our brazilian  chilean and mexican operations produced positive cash flow from operations for the years ended december   and these cash flows have been historically maintained at the local country level for strategic expansion purposes and local capital requirements 
our international operations have required infusions of capital of million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  primarily to fund acquisitions and to a lesser extent  to meet the cash outflow and capital requirements of certain operations 
these other international operations are primarily in the start up stage or are expanding in the short term 
our capital funding of these operations is consistent with our long term strategy to establish viable companies that can sustain future growth from internally generated sources 
sources and uses of cash of consolidated operations net cash provided by operating activities was  million   million and  million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease in cash provided in as compared to is primarily due to a reduction in funds collected on behalf of investors in our residential mortgage loans and on behalf of our borrowers  related to mortgage banking services 
the increase in compared to is primarily related to an increase in mortgage banking servicing and production fees  an increase in funds collected on behalf of investors in our residential mortgage loans and on behalf of our borrowers  related to mortgage banking services  as well as decreases in income tax payments and cash paid for benefits  claims and settlement expenses 
net cash used in investing activities was  million   million and  million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease in cash used in for investing activities compared to is due to an increase in net cash received from mortgage loans and available for sale securities activity 
offsetting this was a reduction of cash received from the sale of subsidiaries  due to the sale in of substantially all of bt financial group  as well as the sale of our shares of coventry stock 
the increase in cash used in compared to was primarily due to an increase during in the volume of net mortgage loans purchased and sold 
also contributing to the increase in cash used was the decline in real estate sales from the prior year 
offsetting these increases in cash used was the sale of substantially all of bt financial group  as well as the sale of our shares of coventry stock 
net cash used in financing activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to an increase in investment contract deposits  net of withdrawals  an increase in bank deposits as well as a reduced amount of cash paid for the repurchase of shares of our common stock  compared to the prior year 
partially offsetting the decreases was an increase in repayment of short term debt  resulting from prmcr which was consolidated in due to fin  and an increase in the dividend payment to shareholders 
the increase in net cash used in compared to is primarily from the non recurrence of the impact from the prior year s ipo  in addition to the repurchase of shares of our common stock and payments of dividends in partially offsetting the increases in cash used was an increase in investment contract deposits  net of withdrawals 
given the historical cash flow of our subsidiaries and the financial results of these subsidiaries  we believe the cash flow from our consolidated operating activities over the next year will provide sufficient liquidity for our operations  as well as satisfy interest payments and any payments related to debt servicing 
ratio of earnings to fixed charges the ratio of earnings to fixed charges is a measure of our ability to cover fixed costs with current period earnings 
a high ratio indicates that earnings are sufficiently covering committed expenses 
the following table sets forth  for the years indicated  our ratios of o earnings to fixed charges before interest credited on investment products  and o earnings to fixed charges 
we calculate the ratio of earnings to fixed charges before interest credited on investment products by dividing the sum of income from continuing operations before income taxes bt  interest expense i  interest factor of rental expense if less undistributed income from equity investees e by the sum of interest expense i  interest factor of rental expense if and dividends on majority owned subsidiary redeemable preferred securities non intercompany d

we no longer issue puttable gics 
funding agreements include those issued domestically directly to nonqualified institutional investors  as well as to three separate programs where the funding agreements are  or will be  issued directly or indirectly to unconsolidated special purpose entities 
claims for principal and interest under funding agreements are afforded equal priority to claims of life insurance and annuity policyholders under insolvency provisions of iowa insurance laws 
we are authorized to issue up to billion of funding agreements under a program to support the prospective issuance of medium term notes by an unaffiliated entity in non us markets 
due to our adoption of fin in july  we are no longer required to consolidate this program 
as of december  and   million and  million  respectively  are outstanding under this program 
in addition  we are authorized to issue up to billion of funding agreements under another program to support the prospective issuance of medium term notes by an unaffiliated entity in both domestic and international markets 
the billion represents a billion increase over the authorization amount we had at the end of the unaffiliated entity is an unconsolidated qspe 
as of december  and   million and  million  respectively  are outstanding under this program 
principal life and we have filed a registration statement for a billion retail medium term note program with the sec  under which newly established separate and distinct trusts will issue nonrecourse medium term notes to institutional and retail investors 
under the program  the proceeds of each note issuance will be used to purchase a funding agreement from principal life  which will be used to secure that particular series of notes 
the payment terms of any particular series of notes will match the payment terms of the funding agreement that secures that series 
principal life s payment obligations under the funding agreement relating to the applicable series of notes will be fully and unconditionally guaranteed by a guarantee issued by us 
as of december  and  there were no issued or outstanding notes under this program 
purchase obligations include material contracts where we have a non cancelable commitment to purchase goods and services 
other long term liabilities include other balance sheet liabilities that are contractual  non cancelable and long term in nature 
contractual commitments in connection with our banking business  we make commitments to extend credit  which are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any conditions established in the contract 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
we evaluate each customer s creditworthiness on a case by case basis 
the total commitments to fund loans were million as of december we also have commitments to originate mortgage loans 
these commitments amounted to billion as of december  short term debt the components of short term debt as of december  and  are as follows as of december  in millions prmcr secured liquidity notes prmcr fixed term notes mortgage servicing rights financing commercial paper other recourse short term debt non recourse short term debt total short term debt  as of december   we had credit facilities with various financial institutions in an aggregate amount of billion  which consisted of a billion prmcr credit facility and billion in other credit facilities

off balance sheet arrangements the fasb issued fin in january fin established new accounting guidance relating to the consolidation of vies 
the guidance was effective immediately for all vies created after january   and effective july   for all vies created before february  in october  the fasb released staff position fin  effective date of fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  that allows the deferral of fin for all vies created or acquired prior to february   until the end of the first interim or annual period ending after december   if certain conditions are met 
we invested in one vie in april  and  effective july   consolidated vies created or acquired prior to february   for which we are the primary beneficiary 
as a result  we have consolidated prmcr  which previously had provided an off balance sheet source of funding for our residential mortgage loan production 
delinquent residential mortgage loan funding in october  our mortgage banking segment created a wholly owned  special purpose entity  principal residential mortgage funding  llc prmf  to provide an off balance sheet source of funding for up to million of qualifying delinquent mortgage loans 
the limit was increased to million in december and to billion in august we sell qualifying delinquent fha and va mortgage loans to prmf which then transfers the loans to principal residential mortgage ebo trust trust  an unaffiliated delaware business trust and a qspe 
the trust funds its acquisitions of mortgage loans by selling participation certificates  representing an undivided interest in the trust  to commercial paper conduit purchasers  who are not affiliated with us or any of our affiliates  directors or officers 
at december  and  the trust held million and million in mortgage loans  respectively  and had outstanding participation certificates of million and million  respectively 
residential mortgage loans typically remain in the trust until they are processed through the foreclosure claim process  are paid off or reinstate 
mortgage loans that reinstate are no longer eligible to remain in the trust and are required to be removed at fair market value at the monthly settlement date following reinstatement 
we are retained as the servicer of the mortgage loans and also perform accounting and various administrative functions on behalf of prmf  in our capacity as the managing member of prmf 
as the servicer  we receive a servicing fee pursuant to the pooling and servicing agreement 
we may also receive a successful servicing fee only after all other conditions in the monthly cash flow distribution are met 
we received million and million in servicing and successful servicing fees from prmf in and  respectively 
at december  and  our estimated residual interest in such cash flows was million and million  respectively  and was recorded in other assets on the consolidated statements of financial position 
the value of the residual interest was estimated based on the net present value of expected cash flows from prmf 
we are required to advance funds for payment of interest on the participation certificates and other carrying costs  if sufficient cash is not available in the trust collection account to meet this obligation 
we and the trust are parties to a cost of funds hedge agreement 
we pay the weighted average cost of funds on the participation certificates plus fees and expenses and receive weighted average coupon of mortgage loans in the trust less a spread 
guarantees and indemnifications in the normal course of business  we have provided guarantees to third parties primarily related to a former subsidiary  joint ventures and industrial revenue bonds 
these agreements generally expire from through the maximum exposure under these agreements as of december   was approximately million  however  we believe the likelihood is remote that material payments will be required and therefore have not accrued for a liability on our consolidated statements of financial position 
should we be required to perform under these guarantees  we generally could recover a portion of the loss from third parties through recourse provisions included in agreements with such parties  the sale of assets held as collateral that can be liquidated in the event that performance is required under the guarantees or other recourse generally available to us  minimizing the impact to net income 
the fair value of such guarantees issued after january   was insignificant 
in connection with the sale of bt financial group  we agreed to indemnify the purchaser  westpac  for among other things  the costs associated with potential late filings made by bt financial group in new zealand prior to westpac s ownership  up to a maximum of a million australian dollars approximately us million as of december  
new zealand securities regulations allow australian issuers to issue their securities in new zealand provided that certain documents are appropriately filed with the new zealand registrar of companies 
specifically  the regulations require that any amendments to constitutions and compliance plans be filed in new zealand 
in april  the new zealand securities commission the commission opined that such late filings would result in certain new zealand investors having a right to return of their investment plus interest at per annum from the date of investment 
consequently  the commission has advised that it has initiated an inquiry into the matter  both with regard to bt financial group and other similar issuers 
we view these potential late filings as a technical matter as we believe investors received the information that is required to be provided directly to them 
in addition  we believe this technical issue may affect many in the industry and result in a favorable legislative or judicial solution 
a relevant legislative solution and judicial action are both pending in new zealand 
although we cannot predict the outcome of this matter or reasonably estimate losses  we do not believe that it would result in a material adverse effect on our business or financial position 
it is possible  however  that it could have a material adverse effect on net income in a particular quarter or annual period 
in the normal course of business  we are subject to indemnification obligations related to the sale of residential mortgage loans 
under these indemnifications  we are required to repurchase certain mortgage loans that fail to meet the standard representations and warranties included in the sales contracts 
the amount of our exposure is based on the potential loss that may be incurred if the repurchased mortgage loans are processed through the foreclosure process 
based on historical experience  total mortgage loans repurchased pursuant to these indemnification obligations are estimated to be approximately of annual mortgage loan production levels 
total losses on the mortgage loans repurchased are estimated to approximate of the unpaid principal balance of the related mortgage loans 
as of december   million has been accrued for representing the fair value of such indemnifications issued after january   in accordance with fasb s interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
we are also subject to various other indemnification obligations issued in conjunction with certain transactions  primarily the sale of bt financial group and other divestitures  the sale of servicing rights in our mortgage banking business  acquisitions and financing transactions whose terms range in duration and often are not explicitly defined 
certain portions of these indemnifications may be capped  while other portions are not subject to such limitations 
generally  a maximum obligation is not explicitly stated  therefore  the overall maximum amount of the obligation under the indemnifications cannot be reasonably estimated 
while we are unable to estimate with certainty the ultimate legal and financial liability with respect to these indemnifications  we believe the likelihood is remote that material payments would be required under such indemnifications and therefore such indemnifications would not result in a material adverse effect on our business  financial position or net income 
the fair value of such indemnifications issued after january   was insignificant 
investments we had total consolidated assets as of december   of billion  of which billion were invested assets 
the rest of our total consolidated assets are comprised primarily of separate account assets for which we do not bear investment risk 
because we generally do not bear any investment risk on assets held in separate accounts  the discussion and financial information below does not include such assets 
of our invested assets  billion were held by our us operations and the remaining billion were held by our international asset management and accumulation segment 
us investment operations our us invested assets are managed by principal global investors  a subsidiary of principal life 
our primary investment objective is to maximize after tax returns consistent with acceptable risk parameters 
we seek to protect policyholders benefits by optimizing the risk return relationship on an ongoing basis  through asset liability matching  reducing the credit risk  avoiding high levels of investments that may be redeemed by the issuer  maintaining sufficiently liquid investments and avoiding undue asset concentrations through diversification 
we are exposed to three primary sources of investment risk o credit risk  relating to the uncertainty associated with the continued ability of a given obligor to make timely payments of principal and interest  o interest rate risk  relating to the market price and or cash flow variability associated with changes in market yield curves  and o equity risk  relating to adverse fluctuations in a particular common stock 
our ability to manage credit risk is essential to our business and our profitability 
we devote considerable resources to the credit analysis of each new investment 
we manage credit risk through industry  issuer and asset class diversification 
our investment committee  appointed by our board of directors  is responsible for establishing all investment policies  reviewing and approving all investments 
as of december   there are nine members on the investment committee  one of whom is a member of our board of directors 
the remaining members are senior management members representing various areas of our company 
we also seek to reduce call or prepayment risk arising from changes in interest rates in individual investments 
we limit our exposure to investments that are prepayable without penalty prior to maturity at the option of the issuer  and we require additional yield on these investments to compensate for the risk that the issuer will exercise such option 
we assess option risk in all investments we make and  when we take that risk  we price for it accordingly 
our fixed income securities committee  consisting of fixed income securities senior management members  approves the credit rating for the fixed maturity securities we purchase 
teams of security analysts organized by industry focus either on the public or private markets and analyze and monitor these investments 
in addition  we have teams who specialize in residential mortgage backed securities  commercial mortgage backed securities and public below investment grade securities 
we establish a credit reviewed list of approved public issuers to provide an efficient way for our portfolio managers to purchase liquid bonds for which credit review has already been completed 
issuers remain on the list for one year unless removed by our analysts 
our analysts monitor issuers on the list on a continuous basis with a formal review documented annually or more frequently if material events affect the issuer 
the analysis includes both fundamental and technical factors 
the fundamental analysis encompasses both quantitative and qualitative analysis of the issuer 
the qualitative analysis includes an assessment of both accounting and management aggressiveness 
in addition  technical indicators such as stock price volatility and credit default swap levels are monitored 
our fixed income securities committee also reviews private transactions on a continuous basis to assess the quality ratings of our privately placed investments 
we regularly review our investments to determine whether we should re rate them  employing the following criteria o material declines in the issuer s revenues or margins  o significant management or organizational changes  o significant uncertainty regarding the issuer s industry  o debt service coverage or cash flow ratios that fall below industry specific thresholds  o violation of financial covenants  and o other business factors that relate to the issuer 
a dedicated risk management team is responsible for centralized monitoring of the commercial mortgage portfolio 
we apply a variety of strategies to minimize credit risk in our commercial mortgage loan portfolio 
when considering the origination of new commercial mortgage loans  we review the cash flow fundamentals of the property  make a physical assessment of the underlying security  conduct a comprehensive market analysis and compare against industry lending practices 
we use a proprietary risk rating model to evaluate all new and a majority of existing loans within the portfolio 
the proprietary risk model is designed to stress projected cash flows under simulated economic and market downturns 
our lending guidelines are designed to encourage or less loan to value ratios and a debt service coverage ratio of at least times 
we analyze investments outside of these guidelines based on cash flow quality  tenancy and other factors 
the weighted average loan to value ratio at origination for brick and mortar commercial mortgages in our portfolio was and the debt service coverage ratio at loan inception was times as of december  we have limited exposure to equity risk in our common stock portfolio 
equity securities accounted for only of our us invested assets as of december  our investment decisions and objectives are a function of the underlying risks and product profiles of each primary business operation 
in addition  we diversify our product portfolio offerings to include products that contain features that will protect us against fluctuations in interest rates 
those features include adjustable crediting rates  policy surrender charges and market value adjustments on liquidations 
for further information on our management of interest rate risk  see item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
overall composition of us invested assets us invested assets as of december   were predominantly of high quality and broadly diversified across asset class  individual credit  industry and geographic location 
asset allocation is determined based on cash flow and the risk return requirements of our products 
as shown in the following table  the major categories of us invested assets are fixed maturity securities and commercial mortgages 
the remainder is invested in real estate  equity securities and other assets 
in addition  policy loans are included in our invested assets

prmcr held billion in mortgage loans held for sale as of december  we actively manage public fixed maturity securities  including our portfolio of residential mortgage backed securities  in order to provide liquidity and enhance yield and total return 
our residential mortgage backed securities are managed to reduce the risk of prepayment 
this active management has resulted in the realization of capital gains and losses with respect to such investments 
us investment results the following tables present the yield and investment income  excluding net realized unrealized gains and losses for our us invested assets 
the annualized yield on us invested assets and on cash and cash equivalents was for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  we calculate annualized yields using a simple average of asset classes at the beginning and end of the reporting period 
during  certain seed money investments were reclassified from equity securities to other investments

included in the privately placed category as of december   were billion of securities eligible for resale to qualified institutional buyers under rule a under the securities act of fixed maturity securities were diversified by category of issuer as of december   and december   as shown in the following table us invested assets fixed maturity securities by type of issuer as of december  as of december  carrying of carrying of amount total amount total in millions us government and us states and political subdivisions non us non us corporate public   corporate private   residential pass through securities   commercial mbs   collateral mortgage obligations asset backed securities   total fixed maturities   we held  million of mortgage backed and asset backed securities as of december   and  million as of december  we believe that it is desirable to hold residential mortgage backed securities due to their credit quality and liquidity as well as portfolio diversification characteristics 
our portfolio is comprised of gnma  fnma and fhlmc pass through securities and is actively managed to reduce the risk of prepayment 
commercial mortgage backed securities provide high levels of credit protection  diversification  reduced event risk and enhanced liquidity 
commercial mortgage backed securities are predominantly comprised of rated large pool securitizations that are individually and collectively diverse by property type  borrower and geographic dispersion 
we purchase asset backed securities  abs  to diversify the overall credit risks of the fixed maturity securities portfolio and to provide attractive returns 
the principal risks in holding asset backed securities are structural and credit risks 
structural risks include the security s priority in the issuer s capital structure  the adequacy of and ability to realize proceeds from the collateral and the potential for prepayments 
credit risks involve issuer servicer risk where collateral values can become impaired in the event of servicer credit deterioration 
our abs portfolio is diversified both by type of asset and by issuer 
we actively monitor holdings of asset backed securities to ensure that the risk profile of each security improves or remains consistent 
if we are not receiving an adequate yield for the risk  relative to other investment opportunities  we will attempt to sell the security 
prepayments in the abs portfolio are  in general  insensitive to changes in interest rates or are insulated to such changes by call protection features 
in the event that we are subject to prepayment risk  we monitor the factors that impact the level of prepayment and prepayment speed for those asset backed securities 
to the extent we believe that prepayment risk increases  we may attempt to sell the security and reinvest in another security that offers better yield relative to the risk 
in addition  we diversify the risks of asset backed securities by holding a diverse class of securities  which limits our exposure to any one security 
the international exposure in our us fixed maturity securities totaled  million  or  as of december   comprised of corporate and foreign government fixed maturity securities 
of the  million as of december   investments totaled  million in the united kingdom   million in the continental european union  million in asia  million in south america  million in australia and million in japan 
the remaining million is invested in other countries 
all international fixed maturity securities held by our us operations are either denominated in us dollars or have been swapped into us dollar equivalents 
our international investments are analyzed internally by country and industry credit investment professionals 
we control concentrations using issuer and country level exposure benchmarks  which are based on the credit quality of the issuer and the country 
our investment policy limits total international fixed maturity securities investments to of total statutory general account assets with a limit in emerging markets 
exposure to canada is not included in our international exposure due to its treatment by the naic 
as of december   our investments in canada totaled  million 
as of december   our top ten corporate bond exposures were rated an a equivalent or better by the rating agencies and represented  million  or of our fixed maturity securities portfolio and of total us invested assets 
as of december   no individual non government issuer represented more than of us invested assets 
valuation techniques for the fixed maturity securities portfolio vary by security type and the availability of market data 
pricing models and their underlying assumptions impact the amount and timing of unrealized gains and losses recognized  and the use of different pricing models or assumptions could produce different financial results 
interactive data corporation idc or direct broker quotes are our sources for external prices for our public bonds and those private placement securities that are actively traded in the secondary market 
in cases where quoted market prices are not available  a spread pricing matrix is used 
when utilizing a spread pricing matrix  securities are valued through a discounted cash flow method where each bond is assigned a credit and liquidity spread  which is added to the current us treasury rate to discount the cash flows of the security 
our spread pricing matrix uses the otr treasury curve  which is pulled from bloomberg as of the valuation date 
capital management science cms has been contracted to serve as an independent source of credit spreads to be used in the corporate private placement valuation process 
the credit spreads are based on weekly studies of the public bond market and vary by industry  credit quality and average investment life 
the liquidity spread is based on the average yield pick up a private placement can expect to earn over a comparable public bond because of illiquidity 
the spreads assigned to each security change from month to month based on changes in the market 
certain market events that could impact the valuation of securities include issuer credit ratings  business climate  management changes  litigation  and government actions among others 
the resulting prices are then reviewed by pricing analysts 
all loans placed on the watchlist are valued individually by the investment analysts or the workout group 
although we believe our estimates reasonably reflect the fair value of those securities  the key assumptions about risk premiums  performance of underlying collateral if any and other factors involve significant assumptions and may not reflect those of an active market 
to the extent that bonds have longer maturity dates  management s estimate of fair value may involve greater subjectivity since they involve judgment about events well into the future 
every month  there is a comprehensive review of all impaired securities and problem loans by a group consisting of the chief investment officer  the portfolio managers  and the workout group 
the valuation of impaired bonds for which there is no quoted price is typically based on the present value of the future cash flows expected to be received 
if the company is likely to continue operations  the estimate of future cash flows is typically based on the expected operating cash flows of the company that are available to make payments of the bonds 
if the company is likely to liquidate  the estimate of future cash flows is based on an estimate of the liquidation value of its net assets 
the securities valuation office svo of the naic evaluates most of the fixed maturity securities that we and other us insurance companies hold 
the svo evaluates the bond investments of insurers for regulatory reporting purposes and assigns securities to one of six investment categories 
the naic designations closely mirror the nationally recognized securities rating organizations credit ratings for marketable bonds 
naic designations and include bonds considered investment grade by such rating organizations 
bonds are considered investment grade when rated baa or higher by moody s  or bbb or higher by standard poor s 
naic designations through are referred to as below investment grade 
bonds are considered below investment grade when rated ba or lower by moody s  or bb or lower by standard poor s 
as of december   the percentage  based on estimated fair value  of total publicly traded and privately placed fixed maturity securities that were investment grade with an naic designation or was 
we also monitor the credit drift of our corporate fixed maturity securities portfolio 
credit drift is defined as the ratio of the percentage of rating downgrades  including defaults  divided by the percentage of rating upgrades 
we measure credit drift once each fiscal year  assessing the changes in our internally developed credit ratings that have occurred during the year 
standard poor s annual credit ratings drift ratio measures the credit rating change  within a specific year  of companies that have been assigned ratings by standard poor s 
the annual internal credit drift ratio on corporate fixed maturity securities we held in our general account was times compared to the standard poor s drift ratio of times  as of december  the following table presents our total fixed maturity securities by naic designation and the equivalent ratings of the nationally recognized securities rating organizations as of december   and december   as well as the percentage  based on estimated fair value  that each designation comprises us invested assets fixed maturity securities by credit quality as of december  as of december  of of rating total total naic agency amortized carrying carrying amortized carrying carrying rating equivalent cost amount amount cost amount amount in millions aaa aa a     baa     ba     b caa and lower in or near default 
total fixed maturities     includes securities with an amortized cost of  million  gross gains of million  gross losses of million and a carrying amount of  million as of december   that are still pending a review and assignment of a rating by the svo 
due to the timing of when fixed maturity securities are purchased  legal documents are filed  and the review by the svo  there will always be securities in our portfolio that are unrated over a reporting period 
in these instances  an equivalent rating is assigned based on our fixed income analyst s assessment 
we believe that our long term fixed maturity securities portfolio is well diversified among industry types and between publicly traded and privately placed securities 
each year we direct the majority of our net cash inflows into investment grade fixed maturity securities 
our current policy is to limit the percentage of cash flow invested in below investment grade assets to of cash flow 
as of december   we had invested of new cash flow for the year in below investment grade assets 
while the general account investment returns have improved due to the below investment grade asset class  we manage its growth strategically by limiting it to of the total fixed maturity securities portfolios 
we invest in privately placed fixed maturity securities to enhance the overall value of the portfolio  increase diversification and obtain higher yields than are possible with comparable quality public market securities 
generally  private placements provide broader access to management information  strengthened negotiated protective covenants  call protection features and  where applicable  a higher level of collateral 
they are  however  generally not freely tradable because of restrictions imposed by federal and state securities laws and illiquid trading markets 
the following table shows the carrying amount of our corporate fixed maturity securities by salomon industry category  as well as the percentage of the total corporate portfolio that each salomon industry category comprises as of december   and december  us invested assets corporate fixed maturity securities by salomon industry as of december  as of december  carrying of carrying of amount total amount total in millions industry class finance bank   finance insurance   finance other   industrial consumer industrial energy   industrial manufacturing   industrial other industrial service   industrial transport  utility electric   utility other utility telecom   total   we monitor any decline in the credit quality of fixed maturity securities through the designation of problem securities  potential problem securities and restructured securities 
we define problem securities in our fixed maturity portfolio as securities i as to which principal and or interest payments are in default or where default is perceived to be imminent in the near term ii issued by a company that went into bankruptcy subsequent to the acquisition of such securities 
we define potential problem securities in our fixed maturity portfolio as securities included on an internal watch list for which management has concerns as to the ability of the issuer to comply with the present debt payment terms and which may result in the security becoming a problem or being restructured 
the decision whether to classify a performing fixed maturity security as a potential problem involves significant subjective judgments by our management as to the likely future industry conditions and developments with respect to the issuer 
we define restructured securities in our fixed maturity portfolio as securities where a concession has been granted to the borrower related to the borrower s financial difficulties that would not have otherwise been considered 
we determine that restructures should occur in those instances where greater economic value will be realized under the new terms than through liquidation or other disposition and may involve a change in contractual cash flows 
if at the time of restructure  the present value of the new future cashflows is less than the current cost of the asset being restructured  a realized capital loss is recorded in net income and a new cost basis is established 
we have a process in place to identify securities that could potentially have an impairment that is other than temporary 
this process involves monitoring market events that could impact issuers credit ratings  business climate  management changes  litigation and government actions  and other similar factors 
this process also involves monitoring late payments  pricing levels  downgrades by rating agencies  key financial ratios  financial statements  revenue forecasts and cash flow projections as indicators of credit issues every month  a group of individuals including the chief investment officer  our portfolio managers  members of our workout group  and representatives from investment accounting review all securities where market value is less than seventy five percent of amortized cost to determine whether impairments need to be taken 
the analysis focuses on each issuer s ability to service its debts in a timely fashion and the length of time the security has been trading below cost 
formal documentation of the analysis and the company s decision is prepared and approved by management 
we consider relevant facts and circumstances in evaluating whether the impairment of a security is other than temporary 
relevant facts and circumstances considered include the length of time the fair value has been below cost  the financial position and access to capital of the issuer  including the current and future impact of any specific events  and our ability and intent to hold the security to maturity or until it recovers in value 
to the extent we determine that a security is deemed to be other than temporarily impaired  the difference between amortized cost and fair value would be charged to earnings 
there are a number of significant risks and uncertainties inherent in the process of monitoring impairments and determining if an impairment is other than temporary 
these risks and uncertainties include the risk that our assessment of an issuer s ability to meet all of its contractual obligations will change based on changes in the credit characteristics of that issuer  the risk that the economic outlook will be worse than expected or have more of an impact on the issuer than anticipated  the risk that our investment professionals are making decisions based on fraudulent or misstated information in the financial statements provided by issuers and the risk that new information obtained by us or changes in other facts and circumstances lead us to change our intent to hold the security to maturity or until it recovers in value 
any of these situations could result in a charge to earnings in a future period

the us issuer filed chapter bankruptcy protection during june  after taking large accounting write offs that precipitated a severe liquidity crisis 
the remaining losses were incurred as part of our general portfolio repositioning activities 
we generally intend to hold securities in unrealized loss positions until they mature or recover 
however  we do sell bonds under certain circumstances such as when new information causes us to change our assessment of whether a bond will recover or perform according to its contractual terms  in response to external events such as a merger or a downgrade that result in investment guideline violations such as single issuer or overall portfolio credit quality limits  in response to extreme catastrophic events such as september  that result in industry or market wide disruption  or to take advantage of tender offers

as a result of our implementation of fin  effective july   residential mortgage loans include the full consolidation of prmcr  which provides a source of funding for our residential mortgage loan production 
prmcr held billion in mortgage loans held for sale as of december  commercial mortgage loans 
commercial mortgages play an important role in our investment strategy by o providing strong risk adjusted relative value in comparison to other investment alternatives  o enhancing total returns  and o providing strategic portfolio diversification 
as a result  we have focused on constructing a solid  high quality portfolio of mortgages 
our portfolio is generally comprised of mortgages with conservative loan to value ratios  high debt service coverages and general purpose property types with a strong credit tenancy 
our commercial loan portfolio consists of primarily non recourse  fixed rate mortgages on fully or near fully leased properties 
the mortgage portfolio is comprised of general purpose industrial properties  manufacturing office properties and credit oriented retail properties 
california accounted for of our commercial mortgage loan portfolio as of december  we are  therefore  exposed to potential losses resulting from the risk of catastrophes  such as earthquakes  that may affect the region 
like other lenders  we generally do not require earthquake insurance for properties on which we make commercial mortgage loans 
with respect to california properties  however  we obtain an engineering report specific to each property 
the report assesses the building s design specifications  whether it has been upgraded to meet seismic building codes and the maximum loss that is likely to result from a variety of different seismic events 
we also obtain a report that assesses by building and geographic fault lines the amount of loss our commercial mortgage loan portfolio might suffer under a variety of seismic events 
our commercial loan portfolio is highly diversified by borrower 
as of december   of the us commercial mortgage loan portfolio was comprised of mortgage loans with principal balances of less than million 
the total number of commercial mortgage loans outstanding as of december  and december  was  and  respectively 
the average loan size of our commercial mortgage portfolio was million as of december  we actively monitor and manage our commercial mortgage loan portfolio 
substantially all loans within the portfolio are analyzed regularly  based on a proprietary risk rating cash flow model  in order to monitor the financial quality of these assets and are internally rated 
based on ongoing monitoring  mortgage loans with a likelihood of becoming delinquent are identified and placed on an internal watch list 
among criteria which would indicate a potential problem are imbalances in ratios of loan to value or contract rents to debt service  major tenant vacancies or bankruptcies  borrower sponsorship problems  late payments  delinquent taxes and loan relief restructuring requests 
we state commercial mortgage loans at their unpaid principal balances  net of discount accrual and premium amortization  valuation allowances and write downs for impairment 
we provide a valuation allowance for commercial mortgage loans based on past loan loss experience and for specific loans considered to be impaired 
mortgage loans are considered impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement may not be collected 
when we determine that a loan is impaired  we either establish a valuation allowance or adjust the cost basis of that loan and record a loss for the excess of the carrying value of the mortgage loan over its estimated fair value 
estimated fair value is based on either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s original effective interest rate  the loan s observable market price or the fair value of the collateral 
we record increases in such valuation allowances as realized investment losses and  accordingly  we reflect the losses in our consolidated results of operations 
such decreases in valuation allowances aggregated million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  we review our mortgage loan portfolio and analyze the need for a valuation allowance for any loan which is delinquent for days or more  in process of foreclosure  restructured  on the watch list  or which currently has a valuation allowance 
we categorize loans  which are delinquent  loans in process of foreclosure  and loans to borrowers in bankruptcy as problem loans 
potential problem loans are loans placed on an internal watch list for which management has concerns as to the ability of the borrower to comply with the present loan payment terms and which may result in the loan becoming a problem or being restructured 
the decision whether to classify a performing loan as a potential problem involves significant subjective judgments by management as to the likely future economic conditions and developments with respect to the borrower 
we categorize loans for which the original terms of the mortgages have been modified or for which interest or principal payments have been deferred as restructured loans 
we also consider matured loans that are refinanced at below market rates as restructured 
we charge mortgage loans deemed to be uncollectible against the allowance for losses and credit subsequent recoveries to the allowance for losses 
we maintain the allowance for losses at a level management believes to be adequate to absorb estimated probable credit losses 
management bases its periodic evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for losses on known and inherent risks in the portfolio  adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay  the estimated value of the underlying collateral  composition of the loan portfolio  current economic conditions and other relevant factors 
the evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimating the amounts and timing of future cash flows expected to be received on impaired loans that may change 
as a result of a change in estimates  we evaluated the adequacy of our commercial mortgage loan allowance at december  and released million from the allowance

equity real estate is categorized as either real estate held for investment or real estate held for sale 
real estate held for investment totaled  million as of december   and  million as of december  the carrying value of real estate held for investment is generally adjusted for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
such impairment adjustments are recorded as realized investment losses and accordingly  are reflected in our consolidated results of operations 
for the periods ended december  and december   there were no such impairment adjustments

once we identify a real estate property to be sold and commence a plan for marketing the property  we classify the property as held for sale 
we establish a valuation allowance subject to periodical revisions  if necessary  to adjust the carrying value of the property to reflect the lower of its current carrying value or the fair value  less associated selling costs

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk exposures and risk management market risk is the risk that we will incur losses due to adverse fluctuations in market rates and prices 
our primary market risk exposure is to changes in interest rates  although we also have exposures to changes in equity prices and foreign currency exchange rates 
the active management of market risk is an integral part of our operations 
we manage our overall market risk exposure within established risk tolerance ranges by using the following approaches o rebalance our existing asset or liability portfolios  o control the risk structure of newly acquired assets and liabilities  or o use derivative instruments to modify the market risk characteristics of existing assets or liabilities or assets expected to be purchased 
interest rate risk interest rate risk is the risk that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in interest rates 
our exposure to interest rate risk stems largely from our substantial holdings of guaranteed fixed rate liabilities in our us asset management and accumulation segment 
we manage the interest rate risk inherent in our assets relative to the interest rate risk inherent in our liabilities 
one of the measures we use to quantify this exposure is duration 
to calculate duration  we project asset and liability cashflows 
these cashflows are discounted to a net present value basis using a spot yield curve  which is a blend of the spot yield curves for each of the asset types in the portfolio 
duration is calculated by re calculating these cashflows and redetermining the net present value based upon an alternative level of interest rates  and determining the percentage change in fair value 
as of december   the difference between the asset and liability durations on our primary duration managed portfolio was 
years 
this duration gap indicates that as of this date the sensitivity of the fair value of our assets to interest rate movements is greater than that of the fair value of our liabilities 
our goal is to minimize the duration gap 
currently  our guidelines indicate that total duration gaps between the asset and liability portfolios should be within years 
the value of the assets in this portfolio was  million as of december  for products such as whole life insurance and term life insurance that are less sensitive to interest rate risk  and for other products such as individual single premium deferred annuities  we manage interest rate risk based on a modeling process that considers the target average life  maturities  crediting rates and assumptions of policyholder behavior 
as of december   the weighted average difference between the asset and liability durations on these portfolios was 
years 
this duration gap indicates that as of this date the sensitivity of the fair value of our assets to interest rate movements is less than that of the fair value of our liabilities 
we attempt to monitor this duration gap consistent with our overall risk reward tolerances 
the value of the assets in the duration monitored portfolios was  million as of december  we also have a block of participating general account pension business that passes the actual investment performance of the assets to the customer 
the investment strategy of this block is to maximize investment return to the customer on a best efforts basis  and there is little or no attempt to manage the duration of this portfolio since there is little or no interest rate risk 
the value of the assets in the non duration managed portfolios was  million as of december  using the assumptions and data in effect as of december   we estimate that a basis point immediate  parallel increase in interest rates increases the net fair value of our portfolio by million 
the following table details the estimated changes by risk management strategy as of risk management december  net fair value strategy value of total assets change in millions primary duration managed  duration monitored  non duration managed  n a total  we are also exposed to interest rate risk in our mortgage banking segment 
we manage this risk by striving to balance our loan origination and loan servicing operations  the two of which are generally counter cyclical 
in addition  we use various financial instruments  including derivatives contracts  to manage the interest rate risk specifically related to committed loans in the pipeline and mortgage servicing rights 
the overall objective of our interest rate risk management policies is to offset changes in the values of these items resulting from changes in interest rates 
we do not speculate on the direction of interest rates in our management of interest rate risk 
we manage interest rate risk on our mortgage loan pipeline by using cash forward sale commitments  mortgage backed securities in the forward markets  over the counter options on mortgage backed securities  us treasury and eurodollar futures contracts  options on futures contracts  interest rate swaps  options on interest rate swaps  private investor contracts to buy or sell residential mortgage loans  and servicing released loans sales programs 
we also use interest rate floors  futures contracts  options on futures contracts  swaps and swaptions  mortgage backed securities and principal only strips in hedging a portion of our portfolio of mortgage servicing rights from prepayment risk associated with changes in interest rates 
we measure pipeline interest rate risk exposure by adjusting the at risk pipeline in light of the theoretical optionality of each applicant s rate price commitment 
the at risk pipeline  which consists of closed loans and rate locks  is then refined at the product type level to express each product s sensitivity to changes in market interest rates in terms of a single current coupon mbs duration benchmark interest rate 
suitable hedges are selected and a similar methodology applied to this hedge position 
the variety of hedging instruments allows us to match the behavior of the financial instrument with that of the different types of loans originated 
financial risk is limited by requiring that the net position value will not change in excess of an amount established by senior management of the mortgage banking segment given an instantaneous pre determined price change in the benchmark security 
price sensitivity analysis is performed at least once daily 
the pre determined risk limits will be reviewed periodically and updated as needed 
the face amount of the loans in the pipeline as of december   was billion 
due to the impact of our hedging activities  we estimate that a basis point immediate and sustained increase in the benchmark interest rates decreases the december   net position value by million 
the financial risk associated with our mortgage servicing operations is the risk that the fair value of the servicing asset falls below its us gaap book value 
to measure this risk  we analyze each servicing risk tranche s us gaap book value in relation to the then current fair value for similar servicing rights 
we perform this valuation using option adjusted spread valuation techniques applied to each risk tranche 
we produce tranche fair values at least monthly and model our net servicing hedge position at least daily 
the fair value of the servicing asset declines as interest rates decrease due to possible mortgage loan servicing rights impairment that may result from increased current and projected future prepayment activity 
the change in value of the servicing asset due to interest rate movements is partially offset by the use of financial instruments  including derivative contracts that typically increase in aggregate value when interest rates decline 
financial risk is limited by requiring that the net position value will not change in excess of an amount established by senior management of the mortgage banking segment given an instantaneous pre determined change in the level of interest rates 
price sensitivity analysis is performed at least once weekly 
the pre determined risk limits will be reviewed periodically and updated as needed 
based on values as of december   a basis point immediate parallel and sustained decrease in interest rates produces a million decline in value of the servicing asset of our mortgage banking segment  net of the impact of these hedging vehicles  due to the differences between fair values and us gaap book values 
cash flow volatility cash flow volatility arises as a result of several factors 
one is the inherent difficulty in perfectly matching the cash flows of new asset purchases with that of new liabilities 
another factor is the inherent cash flow volatility of some classes of assets and liabilities 
in order to minimize cash flow volatility  we manage differences between expected asset and liability cash flows within pre established guidelines 
we also seek to minimize cash flow volatility by restricting the portion of securities with redemption features held in our invested asset portfolio 
these asset securities include redeemable corporate securities  mortgage backed securities or other assets with options that  if exercised  could alter the expected future cash inflows 
in addition  we limit sales liabilities with features such as puts or other options that may change the cash flow profile of the liability portfolio 
derivatives we use various derivative financial instruments to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates  including interest rate swaps  principal only swaps  interest rate floors  swaptions  us treasury futures  treasury rate guarantees  interest rate lock commitments and mortgage backed forwards and options 
we use interest rate futures contracts and mortgage backed forwards to hedge changes in interest rates subsequent to the issuance of an insurance liability  such as a guaranteed investment contract  but prior to the purchase of a supporting asset  or during periods of holding assets in anticipation of near term liability sales 
we use interest rate swaps and principal only swaps primarily to more closely match the interest rate characteristics of assets and liabilities 
they can be used to change the sensitivity to the interest rate of specific assets and liabilities as well as an entire portfolio 
occasionally  we will sell a callable liability or a liability with attributes similar to a call option 
in these cases  we will use interest rate swaptions or similar products to hedge the risk of early liability payment thereby transforming the callable liability into a fixed term liability 
we also seek to reduce call or prepayment risk arising from changes in interest rates in individual investments 
we limit our exposure to investments that are prepayable without penalty prior to maturity at the option of the issuer  and we require additional yield on these investments to compensate for the risk that the issuer will exercise such option 
an example of an investment we limit because of the option risk is residential mortgage backed securities 
we assess option risk in all investments we make and  when we assume such risk  we seek to price for it accordingly to achieve an appropriate return on our investments 
we have increased our credit exposure through credit default swaps by investing in subordinated tranches of a synthetic collateralized debt obligation 
the outstanding notional amount as of december  was million and the mark to market value was million 
we also invested in credit default swaps creating replicated assets with a notional of million and mark to market value of million as of december  we also offer a guaranteed fund as an investment option in our defined contribution plans in hong kong 
this fund contains an embedded option that has been bifurcated and accounted for separately in realized gains losses 
we recognized a million pre tax loss for the year ended december  the obligation to deliver the underlying securities of certain consolidated grantor trusts to various unrelated trust certificate holders contains an embedded derivative of the forecasted transaction to deliver the underlying securities 
in conjunction with our use of derivatives  we are exposed to counterparty risk  or the risk that counterparty fails to perform the terms of the derivative contract 
we actively manage this risk by o establishing exposure limits which take into account non derivative exposure we have with the counterparty as well as derivative exposure  o performing similar credit analysis prior to approval on each derivatives counterparty that we do when lending money on a long term basis  o diversifying our risk across numerous approved counterparties  o limiting exposure to a credit or better  o conducting stress test analysis to determine the maximum exposure created during the life of a prospective transaction  o implementing credit support annex collateral agreements with selected counterparties to further limit counterparty exposures  and o daily monitoring of counterparty credit ratings 
all new derivative counterparties are approved by the investment committee 
we believe the risk of incurring losses due to nonperformance by our counterparties is manageable 
the notional amounts used to express the extent of our involvement in swap transactions represent a standard measurement of the volume of our swap business 
notional amount is not a quantification of market risk or credit risk and it may not necessarily be recorded on the balance sheet 
notional amounts represent those amounts used to calculate contractual flows to be exchanged and are not paid or received  except for contracts such as currency swaps 
actual credit exposure represents the amount owed to us under derivative contracts as of the valuation date

equity risk equity risk is the risk that we will incur economic losses due to adverse fluctuations in a particular common stock 
as of december   the fair value of our equity securities was million 
a decline in the value of the equity securities would result in an unrealized loss of million 
as of december   a immediate and sustained decline in the equity markets would result in a decrease of asset based fee revenues of million over the next year 
foreign currency risk foreign currency risk is the risk that we will incur economic losses due to adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
this risk arises from our international operations and foreign currency denominated funding agreements issued to non qualified institutional investors in the international market 
the notional amount of our currency swap agreements associated with foreign denominated liabilities as of december   was  million 
we also have fixed maturity securities that are denominated in foreign currencies 
however  we use derivatives to hedge the foreign currency risk  both interest payments and the final maturity payment  of these funding agreements and securities 
as of december   the fair value of our foreign currency denominated fixed maturity securities was million 
we use currency swap agreements of the same currency to hedge the foreign currency exchange risk related to these investments 
the notional amount of our currency swap agreements associated with foreign denominated fixed maturity securities as of december   was million 
with regard to our international operations  we attempt to do as much of our business as possible in the functional currency of the country of operation 
at times  however  we are unable to do so  and in these cases  we use foreign exchange derivatives to hedge the resulting risks 
we estimate that as of december   a immediate unfavorable change in each of the foreign currency exchange rates to which we are exposed would result in no material change to the net fair value of our foreign currency denominated instruments identified above  including the currency swap agreements 
the selection of a immediate unfavorable change in all currency exchange rates should not be construed as a prediction by us of future market events  but rather as an illustration of the potential impact of such an event 
effects of inflation we do not believe that inflation  in the united states or in the other countries in which we operate  has had a material effect on our consolidated operations over the past five years 
in the future  however  we may be affected by inflation to the extent it causes interest rates to rise
