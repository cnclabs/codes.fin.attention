item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations dollars in millions overview strategic actions during the past year  we made significant moves to sharpen the strategic focus of our business on the light vehicle  commercial vehicle and off highway original equipment marketplace 
divestitures a number of businesses that we deemed non strategic were divested in and in june  we completed the sale of our engine management aftermarket business with annual sales of approximately more recently  in december  we announced plans to divest substantially all of our automotive aftermarket group  which had sales of more than  in and employed approximately  people 
these businesses are now classified as discontinued operations in our financial statements 
upon completion of the divestiture of the automotive aftermarket business  when combined with the other divestitures closed during the last three years  we will have divested businesses that previously reported annual sales of more than  additionally  in we commenced the divestiture of a major portion of our leasing operation  dana credit corporation dcc 
to date  divestitures and normal run off have reduced dcc s portfolio assets by approximately  we expect continued asset dispositions over the next few years 
outsourcing non core manufacturing within our core businesses  we have looked closely at the manufacturing processes that are key to the product technology and service value package we supply our customers 
in this regard  we have divested non core product manufacturing to third parties or  in some cases  transferred such manufacturing to our international affiliates who consider it core to their business 
strategic partnerships strategic alliances continue to be an important component of our strategy  either in supporting our global expansion  enhancing our technology or improving our cost competitiveness 
during  we signed a new joint venture agreement with getrag one of our european partners and volvo car corporation to produce all wheel drive systems in europe  and we announced plans to form a joint venture with dongfeng to develop and produce commercial vehicle axles in china 
another important strategic partnership entered this past year was our agreement with the united auto workers 
this agreement established collective bargaining and representation principles governing our automotive assembly and manufacturing facilities in the united states that serve daimlerchrysler ag  ford motor company and general motors corporation 
the cooperative approach embodied in this agreement is expected to contribute to our business growth  improve our productivity and enhance our operational cost efficiency 

table of contents market outlook our industry is prone to fluctuations in demand over the business cycle 
production levels in our key markets for the past three years  along with dana s outlook for  are shown below 
production in units dana s outlook light vehicle in millions north america europe asia pacific south america commercial vehicle in thousands north america class class north american light duty production levels have been relatively stable the past few years 
a significant development in this market since has been the increased use of incentives by our customers to stimulate and maintain demand levels 
reasonable levels of vehicle inventories at the end of and generally positive trends in key macroeconomic indicators suggest stronger overall production in a challenge that we and others in the light vehicle market face is the continued price reduction pressure from our customers 
our largest customers in this market the us based original equipment manufacturers have experienced market share erosion to other international light vehicle manufacturers over the past few years  thereby putting additional pressure on their profitability 
to the extent this trend continues  we expect the price reduction demands to continue 
our restructuring  divestitures and outsourcing initiatives have helped position us for this increasingly competitive landscape 
ongoing cost reduction programs  like our lean manufacturing and six sigma blackbelt programs  will continue to be important to sustaining and improving our margins 
the commercial vehicle market has been at the bottom of its business cycle during the past two years 
orders in both the medium and heavy duty north american markets have been strengthening in recent months with inventories remaining stable 
consequently  the recovery in these markets appears to be underway  supporting our improved production outlook for in our other markets off highway  european commercial vehicles and light vehicles in the asia pacific and south american regions we expect either stable or improving production demand in other key factors in our markets  concentration of business with certain customers is common  so our efforts to achieve additional diversification are important 
in the light vehicle market  we have been successful in gaining new business with several international manufacturers over the past few years 
we expect greater customer diversity as more of this business comes on stream and we gain additional business with these customers 
broadening our global presence will also be increasingly important in the months ahead 
global sourcing presents opportunities to improve our competitive cost position  as well as take advantage of higher expected growth in emerging markets such as china and india 
a number of our steel suppliers implemented a price surcharge during the fourth quarter of because this is a recent development  we have been unable to project the duration of these price surcharges or estimate the impact on our future results of operations 
another key factor in our future success is technology 
we are continuing to invest in advanced product and process technologies as we believe that they  as much as any factor  are critical to improving our competitive position and profitability 
in keeping with these efforts  our recent moves to focus even 
table of contents more on our core original equipment markets will enable us to capitalize on the continuing trends toward modularity and systems integration in these markets 
new business in the oe vehicular business  new programs are generally awarded to suppliers well in advance of the expected start of production 
the amount of lead time varies based on the nature of the product  size of the program and required start up investment 
the awarding of new business often coincides with model changes on the part of vehicle manufacturers 
given the cost and service concerns associated with changing suppliers  we expect to retain any awarded business over the vehicle life  which is typically several years 
during  more than of our sales increase resulted from the addition of net new business new business in excess of lost business 
as of december   we expected net new business to contribute a minimum of to our sales 
beyond  based on business already awarded or lost  we expect net new business contributions through summary over the last three years  we have repositioned the organization through divestitures  restructuring  outsourcing and strategic partnerships to be more strategically focused and more competitive 
in the process  we have downsized from a company with sales in excess of  before adjustments to reflect discontinued businesses to a company with sales of just under  reported by our continuing operations 
at the same time  we have improved our overall profitability and financial position 
with a more focused strategy and improved financial situation  we are better positioned to grow the business in our core markets

table of contents the amount of impairment charges added back as a non cash item was lower in as our restructuring program neared its conclusion 
our recent success in reducing working capital did not continue in as working capital increased by more than amounts invested in tooling and not yet recovered from customers and increases in accounts receivable and inventory  only partially offset by an income tax refund  pushed working capital higher

expenditures have been focused on opportunities to leverage technology and support new customer programs 
we expect to see capital spending in increase to levels approximating depreciation expense 
divestiture activities were limited in in terms of proceeds received  but those proceeds were supplemented by the cash generated on asset sales  many of which were related to consolidation or outsourcing efforts 
within our leasing operations  we continued to make progress on reducing the lease investment portfolio 
overall  we generated more than in connection with our net investing activities 
dollar change cash flows from financing activities net change in short term debt issuance of long term debt payments on and repurchases of long term debt dividends paid other cash flows from financing activities we used the cash generated by our operating and investing activities to meet scheduled debt payments and reduce the amount outstanding under our short term facilities 
we also spent to repurchase notes having a face amount of  generating a pre tax gain of after considering the unamortized issuance costs and original issuance discount 
cash collected upon the termination of interest rate swaps accounted for a substantial majority of the remaining inflows in both and managing our cash remains a high priority 
our estimate of cash outlays related to restructuring activities is for and we expect to reduce working capital  exclusive of our restructuring activities  by based on the projected levels of production for within our investing activities  we expect the proceeds from the divestiture of the automotive aftermarket business to exceed its book value 
achieving these targets would enable us to reduce debt  invest in other business opportunities and contribute to our pension plans

the non cash impact of impairment charges on operating cash flows resulted from a higher level of restructuring announcements in compared to  each of which related to the overall restructuring program announced during the fourth quarter of operating working capital decreased significantly in as we addressed the high levels of working capital in our aag sbu 
working capital  especially inventory  was abnormally high in in certain of the aag units that were in the process of consolidating distribution centers and had built bridge inventories to meet customer demand during the consolidation 
these inventories were reduced in the pace of improvement in working capital levels slowed in in large part due to cash payments associated with our restructuring plans 
dollar change cash flows from investing activities purchases of property  plant and equipment divestitures proceeds from sales of leasing subsidiary assets proceeds from sales of other assets other cash flows from investing activities cash flows from investing activities in benefited from cash generated by divestitures of non core businesses during the year  including fte  boston weatherhead division and certain smaller business units 
in addition  sales of dcc assets were significantly higher in as a result of sale transaction activity occurring subsequent to our announcement in the fourth quarter of of our intention to sell a substantial portion of dcc s assets 
investing cash flows also benefited from reduced capital spending in as compared to

some of the cash available to accomplish this was made available due to lower amounts paid out in cash dividends in as compared to financing activities committed and uncommitted credit lines enable us to make borrowings to supplement the cash flow generated by our operations 
excluding dcc  we had committed and uncommitted borrowing lines of  at december  this amount included our long term credit facility in the amount of  which matures in november the interest rates under this facility equal the london interbank offered rate libor or the prime rate  plus a spread that varies depending on our credit ratings 
under this facility  we may borrow amounts up to on an unsecured basis  provided such amounts are not outstanding for more than five business days or borrowed within a five day period after repayment of all previous advances 
for any other borrowings  we must provide certain inventory and other collateral  as permitted within the limits of our indentures 
these provisions of the facility terminate if our credit ratings reach baa by moody s and bbb by s p 
we also have an accounts receivable securitization program that provides up to to meet our periodic demands for short term financing 
the amounts available under the program are subject to reduction based on adverse changes in the credit ratings of our customers  customer concentration levels or certain characteristics of the underlying accounts receivable 
this program is subject to possible termination by the lenders in the event our credit ratings are lowered below b by moody s investor service moody s and b by standard and poor s s p 
as of february   we were rated ba by moody s and bb by s p 
in anticipation of the sale of substantially all of our automotive aftermarket group  we will seek to arrange an additional financing facility to augment the accounts receivable securitization program 
our preliminary assessment  based on an average historical volume of aag receivables  indicated that the withdrawal of aag would decrease the amount available under the existing program by approximately at the end of  borrowings outstanding under the various dana lines consisted of drawn by non us subsidiaries against uncommitted lines 
no amounts were outstanding under the accounts receivable program or the long term credit facility 
dana s long term credit facility requires us to improve upon specified financial ratios as of the end of certain specified quarters  including the ratio of net senior debt to tangible net worth  the ratio of earnings before interest  taxes and depreciation and amortization ebitda less capital spend to interest expense  and the ratio of net senior debt to ebitda 
specifically  the ratios are i net senior debt to tangible net worth of not more than at december  and thereafter  ii ebitda as defined in the facility minus capital expenditures to interest expense of not less than at december   at march  and at june  and thereafter  and iii net senior debt to ebitda of not greater than at december  and at march  and thereafter 
the ratio calculations are based on dana s consolidated financial statements with dcc accounted for on an equity basis 
we were in compliance with all of these ratio requirements at december  in addition  dcc has a revolving credit facility 
the amount available under the facility was reduced by in as a result of renegotiating the facility and applying a provision that calls for reducing the line by two thirds of the net cash proceeds from any sales of dcc assets 
the facility had a maximum 
table of contents borrowing capacity of at december  and is subject to further proceeds based reductions until its june maturity 
interest rates under the facility equal libor or the prime rate  plus a spread that varies depending on dcc s credit ratings 
at december   there was outstanding under dcc s revolving credit facility 
because our financial performance is impacted by various economic  financial and industry factors  we cannot say with certainty whether we will satisfy the covenants under these long term bank facilities in the future 
noncompliance with these covenants would constitute an event of default  allowing the lenders to accelerate the repayment of any borrowings outstanding under the facilities 
while no assurance can be given  we believe that we would be able to successfully negotiate amended covenants or obtain waivers if an event of default were imminent  however  we might be required to provide additional collateral to the lenders or make other financial concessions 
default under the credit facilities or any of our significant note agreements may result in defaults under our other debt instruments 
our business  results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected if we were unable to successfully negotiate amended covenants or obtain waivers on acceptable terms 
based on our rolling six quarter forecast  we expect our cash flows from operations  combined with these credit facilities and the accounts receivable securitization program  to provide sufficient liquidity to fund our debt service obligations  projected working capital requirements  restructuring obligations and capital spending for a period that includes the next twelve months 
hedging activities at december   we had a number of open forward contracts to hedge against certain anticipated net purchase and sale commitments 
these contracts are for a short duration and none extends beyond the first quarter of the aggregate fair value of these contracts is a favorable amount approximating these contracts have been valued by independent financial institutions using the exchange spot rate on december   plus or minus quoted forward basis points  to determine a settlement value for each contract 
in order to provide a better balance of fixed and variable rate debt  we have interest rate swap agreements in place to effectively convert the fixed interest rate on certain of our notes to variable rates 
these swap agreements have been designated as fair value hedges and the impact of the change in their value is offset by an equal and opposite change in the carrying value of the notes 
in may  we received in connection with terminating two of the swap agreements 
because these agreements had been designated as fair value hedges of the corresponding notes  the carrying value of the notes had been adjusted to offset the recent increases in the fair value of the swap agreements 
this valuation adjustment will be amortized as a reduction of interest expense over the remaining life of the notes 
the terminated agreements were replaced with new swap agreements 
under the current agreements  we receive an average fixed rate of interest of on notional amounts of and and we pay a variable rate based on either libor  plus a spread  or euribor  plus a spread  respectively 
as of december   the average variable rate under these agreements approximated 
the swap agreements expire in august and and march  coinciding with the terms of the hedged notes 
based on the aggregate fair value of these agreements at december   we recorded a noncurrent liability of and offset the carrying value of long term debt 
this adjustment of long term debt  which does not affect the scheduled principal payments  will fluctuate with the fair value of the swap agreements and will not be amortized if the swap agreements remain open 
dcc was party to interest rate swaps which provided for dcc to receive payments based on prevailing short term market rates and pay a fixed rate on a notional amount of these agreements expired in the second half of coincident with the maturity of the medium term notes which they hedged 
the fair values of the dana swap agreements were an aggregate liability of at december  the fair values of all swap agreements were determined by obtaining pricing estimates from independent financial institutions 

table of contents cash obligations under various agreements  we are obligated to make future cash payments in fixed amounts 
these include payments under our long term debt agreements  rent payments required under operating lease agreements and payments for equipment  other fixed assets and certain raw materials 
the following table summarizes our fixed cash obligations over various future periods 
payments due by period less than after contractual cash obligations total year years years years principal of long term debt operating leases unconditional purchase obligations other long term liabilities total contractual cash obligations the unconditional purchase obligations presented are comprised principally of commitments for procurement of fixed assets and the purchase of raw materials 
we have a number of sourcing arrangements with suppliers for various component parts used in the assembly of certain of our products 
these arrangements include agreements to procure certain outsourced components that we had manufactured ourselves in earlier years 
these agreements do not contain any specific minimum quantities that we must order in any given year  but generally require that we purchase the specific component exclusively from the supplier over the term of the agreement 
accordingly  our cash obligation under these agreements is not fixed 
however  if we were to estimate volumes to be purchased under these agreements based on our forecasts for and assume that the volumes were constant over the respective contract periods  the annual purchases from those agreements where we estimate the annual volume would exceed would be as follows for our continuing operations in   in and combined   in and combined and  thereafter 
other long term liabilities include estimated obligations under our retiree healthcare programs and the estimated contribution to our us defined benefit pension plans 
obligations under the retiree healthcare programs are not fixed commitments and will vary depending on various factors  including the level of participant utilization and inflation 
our estimates of the payments to be made through considered recent payment trends and certain of our actuarial assumptions 
we have not estimated pension contributions beyond due to the significant impact that return on plan assets  changes in discount rates and a potential additional contribution in might have on such amounts 
in addition to fixed cash commitments  we may have future cash payment obligations under arrangements where we are contingently obligated if certain events occur or conditions are present 
we have guaranteed of short term borrowings of a non us affiliate accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
in addition  dcc has guaranteed portions of the borrowings of its affiliates that are accounted for under the equity method 
dcc s aggregate exposure under one of the guarantees is under another guarantee  dcc s exposure for changes in interest rates resulting from specific events described in the financing arrangements would vary but should not exceed we procure tooling from a variety of suppliers 
in certain instances  in lieu of making progress payments on the tooling  we may guarantee a tooling supplier s obligations under its credit facility secured by the specific tooling purchase order 
our board authorization permits us to issue tooling guarantees up to for these programs 
at december   we had an guarantee outstanding in connection with a tooling order for one of our oe programs 
we do not expect such guarantees for this program to exceed at december   we maintained cash balances of on deposit with financial institutions  of which may not be withdrawn  to support stand by letters of credit  surety bonds or trusteed certificate accounts amounting to issued on our behalf by financial institutions 
these financial instruments  
table of contents which are used principally for the purpose of meeting various states requirements in order to self insure our workers compensation obligations  are expected to be renewed each year 
we accrue the estimated liability for workers compensation claims  including incurred but not reported claims 
accordingly  no significant impact on our financial condition would result if the letters of credit were drawn or the surety bonds or certificate accounts were called 
in connection with certain of our divestitures  there may be future claims and proceedings instituted or asserted against us relative to the period of our ownership or pursuant to indemnifications or guarantees provided in connection with the respective transactions 
the estimated maximum potential amount of payments under these obligations is not determinable due to the significant number of divestitures and lack of a stated maximum liability for certain matters 
in some cases  we have insurance coverage available to satisfy claims related to the divested businesses 
we believe that payments  if any  in excess of amounts provided or insured related to such matters are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our liquidity  financial condition or results of operations 
contingencies we are a party to various pending judicial and administrative proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business 
these include  among others  proceedings based on product liability claims and alleged violations of environmental laws 
we have reviewed our pending judicial and legal proceedings  including the probable outcomes  reasonably anticipated costs and expenses  availability and limits of our insurance coverage and our established reserves for uninsured liabilities 
we do not believe that any liabilities that may result from these proceedings are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our liquidity  financial condition or results of operations 
asbestos related product liabilities since the mid s  we have been a defendant in asbestos bodily injury litigation 
for most of this period  our asbestos related claims were administered by the center for claims resolution ccr  which settled claims for its member companies on a shared settlement cost basis 
in february  the ccr was reorganized and discontinued negotiating shared settlements 
since then  we have independently controlled our legal strategy and settlements 
in august  we retained peterson asbestos consulting enterprise pace  a subsidiary of peterson consulting  inc  to administer our claims  bill our insurance carriers and assist us in claims negotiation and resolution 
at december   we had approximately  pending asbestos related product liability claims  consisting of approximately  unresolved claims and approximately  claims settled pending payment including  claims remaining from when we were a member of the ccr and  claims we have settled subsequently 
this compares to approximately  pending claims that we reported at december   consisting of approximately  unresolved claims and approximately  claims settled pending payment including  claims remaining from when we were a member of the ccr and  claims we have settled subsequently 
we believe that we are now being named in more claims because claimants are routinely naming many former ccr members in individual claims  and that more of our claims are now pending for longer periods because we are aggressively defending claims which might previously have been settled by the ccr 
we attribute the increase in the number of claims which occurred in the first half of in large part to the delayed service of numerous complaints that had been filed in mississippi in advance of the january  effective date of new laws limiting the filing of tort claims in that state 
many of these were amended claims that had not originally named dana as a defendant 
the number of pending claims declined by  in the fourth quarter of the overall increase in the number of pending claims has not materially affected our aggregate loss estimate for such claims 
at december   we had accrued for indemnity and defense costs for contingent asbestos related product liability claims and recorded as an asset for probable recoveries from insurers for such claims  compared to accrued for such liabilities and recorded as an asset at december  we review our claims database annually and make adjustments to our loss estimates if appropriate 
while we expect our legal defense costs will continue at higher levels than when we were a member of the ccr  we believe that our litigation strategy has reduced and will continue to reduce our indemnity costs 
we have agreements with our insurance carriers providing for the payment 
table of contents of a significant majority of the defense and indemnity costs for the pending claims  as well as claims which may be filed against us in the future 
we cannot estimate possible losses in excess of those for which we have accrued because we cannot predict how many additional claims may be brought against us in the future  the allegations in such claims or their probable outcomes 
at december  and  we had amounts receivable from our insurers and others of and  respectively  representing reimbursements for settled claims and related defense costs 
these receivables include billings in progress and amounts subject to alternate dispute resolution proceedings with certain of our insurers 
substantial progress has been made in those proceedings and we expect the outcome to be favorable 
however  the amount receivable may increase until the proceedings are ultimately concluded 
during  we received from the ccr as a refund of previous settlement advances and from our insurers as reimbursement for defense and indemnity costs 
additional amounts were billed to our insurers for amounts we paid in in defense and indemnity costs 
other product liabilities at december   we had accrued for contingent non asbestos product liability costs  compared to at december   with no recovery expected from third parties at either date 
if there is a range of equally probable outcomes  we accrue the lower end of the range 
the difference between our minimum and maximum estimates for these liabilities was at both dates 
environmental liabilities we estimate contingent environmental liabilities based on the most probable method of remediation  current laws and regulations and existing technology 
estimates are made on an undiscounted basis and exclude the effects of inflation 
if there is a range of equally probable remediation methods or outcomes  we accrue the lower end of the range 
dana is a potentially responsible party at the hamilton avenue industrial park superfund site in new jersey 
the site has three operable units 
we have estimated our potential financial exposure for operable units and at the site as ranging between and based on our view as to the most likely remediation method and allocation of costs between dana and other potentially responsible parties 
however the epa has identified an array of remedial alternatives for operable unit that includes a range from lower to substantially higher than our estimate 
we have not included any estimate for operable unit in our cost projections as the site investigation for this aspect of the site has not yet been conducted 
currently  it is impossible to predict which remedial alternative for operable unit will be selected by the epa  or whether there will be a need for remedial action related to operable unit at december   we had accrued for contingent environmental liabilities  compared to accrued at december   with no recovery expected from other parties at either date 
the difference between our minimum and maximum estimates for these liabilities was at december   compared to at december  other liabilities some former ccr members have defaulted on the payment of their shares of some of the ccr negotiated settlements and some of the settling claimants are now seeking payment of the unpaid shares from dana and the other companies that were members of the ccr at the time of the settlements 
we have been working with the ccr  other former ccr member companies  our insurers and the claimants to resolve these issues 
at december   we had estimated our total exposure to these matters to be approximately compared to our estimate of at december  at december   we had recorded an estimated recoverable of compared to recorded at december  the change in both amounts during reflects the favorable renegotiation of a portion of unpaid amounts with the plaintiffs 
in addition  we have increased our reserve against the recoverable by to take into account the current status of negotiations with our insurers  including the status of alternate dispute resolution proceedings and consultations with outside counsel 
assumptions the amounts recorded for contingent asbestos related liabilities and recoveries are based on assumptions and estimates derived from our historical experience and current information 
if our assumptions about the nature of the pending unresolved bodily injury claims and the claims relating to the ccr negotiated settlements  the costs to resolve those claims and the amount of available insurance and surety bonds prove to be incorrect  the actual amount of our liability for asbestos related claims and the effect on the company could differ materially from our current expectations 

table of contents restructuring in october  we announced the largest restructuring initiative in our history 
these restructuring actions were designed to quicken our pace of reducing our capacity and fixed cost structure to generate improved margins at lower expected levels of production 
as well  certain actions positioned us to complete the aforementioned divestiture of non strategic businesses 
the restructuring actions called for in the plan have been substantially completed 
the cost associated with these actions was upon completion  we will have closed facilities and reduced the workforce by more than  people 
see a discussion of these restructuring actions and the related costs in our consolidated financial statements under note restructuring of operations 
critical accounting estimates the following discussion of accounting estimates is intended to supplement the summary of significant accounting policies presented as note to the consolidated financial statements 
these estimates were selected because they are broadly applicable within our operating units 
in addition  these estimates are subject to a range of amounts because of inherent imprecision that may result from applying judgment to the estimation process 
the expenses and accrued liabilities or allowances related to certain of these policies are initially based on our best estimates at the time of original entry in our accounting records 
adjustments are recorded when our actual experience differs from the expected experience underlying the estimates 
these adjustments could be material if our experience were to change significantly in a short period of time 
we make frequent comparisons of actual experience and expected experience in order to mitigate the likelihood of material adjustments 
asset impairment we perform periodic impairment analyses on our long lived assets such as property  plant and equipment  carrying amount of investments and goodwill 
we also evaluate the carrying amount of our inventories on a recurring basis for impairment due to lower of cost or market issues  and for excess or obsolete quantities 
we perform impairment analyses of our recorded long lived assets whenever events and circumstances indicate that they may be impaired 
when the undiscounted cash flows  without interest or tax charges  are less than the carrying value of the assets being reviewed for impairment  the assets are written down to fair market value 
during  and we recorded long lived tangible asset impairment provisions of  and  respectively which resulted in part from excess capacity caused by the downturn in our markets and the resulting restructuring of our operations 
on january   we adopted sfas no 
and  in connection with the adoption  discontinued the amortization of goodwill 
under our previous accounting policy for goodwill  we amortized goodwill on a straight line basis over the periods of expected benefit which ranged from to years 
in  we recognized of goodwill amortization 
in lieu of amortization of goodwill in  we tested goodwill for impairment as of the date of adoption and we also tested for impairment in the factors that would cause a more frequent test for impairment include  among other things  a significant negative change in the estimated future cash flows of a reporting unit that has goodwill because of an event or a combination of events 
our initial impairment test indicated that the carrying amounts of some of our reporting units exceeded the corresponding fair values  which were determined based on the discounted estimated future cash flows of the reporting units 
the implied fair value of goodwill in these reporting units was then determined through the allocation of the fair value to the underlying assets and liabilities 
the january  carrying amount of the goodwill in these reporting units exceeded its implied value by  accordingly  the recorded goodwill was written down by this amount 
the goodwill included in our december  financial statements  which included the  was supported by the undiscounted estimated future cash flows of the related operations 
our periodic tests for impairment subsequent to the adoption of sfas no 
have not resulted in further impairment charges 

table of contents sfas no 
also applies to other intangible assets 
we did not have a significant amount of intangible assets other than goodwill at december  and inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
cost is generally determined on the last in  first out basis for us inventories and on the first in  first out or average cost basis for non us inventories 
where appropriate  standard cost systems are utilized for purposes of determining cost  the standards are adjusted as necessary to ensure they approximate actual costs 
estimates of lower of cost or market value of inventory are determined at the reporting unit level and are based upon the inventory at that location taken as a whole 
these estimates are based upon current economic conditions  historical sales quantities and patterns and  in some cases  the specific risk of loss on specifically identified inventories 
we also evaluate inventories on a regular basis to identify inventory on hand that may be obsolete or in excess of current and future projected market demand 
for inventory deemed to be obsolete  we provide a reserve on the full value of the inventory 
inventory that is in excess of current and projected use is reduced by an allowance to a level that approximates our estimate of future demand 
warranty estimated costs related to product warranty are accrued at the time of sale and included in cost of sales 
estimated costs are based upon past warranty claims and sales history 
these costs are then adjusted  as required  to reflect subsequent experience 
warranty expense related to continuing operations totaled  and in  and  respectively 
our expense included provisions of that related to adjustments of estimates made in prior years 
accrued liabilities for warranty obligations at december  and were and  respectively 
pension and postretirement benefits other than pensions annual net periodic expense and benefit liabilities under our defined benefit plans are determined on an actuarial basis 
each year  we compare the actual experience to the more significant assumptions used  if warranted  we make adjustments to the assumptions 
the healthcare trend rates are reviewed with our actuaries based upon the results of their review of claims experience 
discount rates are based upon an expected benefit payments duration analysis and the equivalent average yield rate for high quality fixed income investments 
pension benefits are funded through deposits with trustees and the expected long term rates of return on fund assets are based upon actual historical returns modified for known changes in the market and any expected changes in investment policy 
postretirement benefits are not funded  with our policy to pay these benefits as they become due 
certain accounting guidance  including the guidance applicable to pensions  does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between actual and assumed experience or the revision of an estimate 
this approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted 
although this netting occurs outside the basic financial statements  the net amount is disclosed as an unrecognized gain or loss in the footnotes to our financial statements 
at december   we had an unrecognized loss related to our pension plans of compared to an unrecognized loss of at the end of the reduction in the unrecognized actuarial loss in is primarily related to our return on pension plan assets  which was in excess of our long term estimated rate of return 
a small portion of the unrecognized loss was also recognized in expense  further reducing the balance 
a portion of the december  unrecognized loss will be amortized into earnings in the effect on years after will depend in large part on the actual experience of the plans in and beyond 
our pension plan discount rate assumption is evaluated annually 
long term interest rates on high quality debt instruments  which are used to determine the discount rate  declined in and accordingly  we reduced the discount rate used to determine our pension benefit obligation on our us plans in both years 
we utilized a discount rate of at december  compared to a rate of at december  our discount rate assumption at december  was 
in addition  the weighted average discount rate utilized by our non us plans was also reduced to at december  from at december  the discount rate used at december  for our non us plans was comparable to the rate used at december  overall  a downward movement in the discount rate of basis points would result in an increase in our us obligation of approximately  whereas an equal upward movement in the rate would result in a decrease of a 
table of contents basis point decrease in the discount rate would increase pension expense by while a basis point increase in the rate would decrease pension expense by besides evaluating the discount rate used to determine our pension obligation  we also evaluated our assumption in relating to the expected return on us plan assets 
this rate  which was used in the determination of pension expense for the year ended december   was lowered to from 
we revised our expected rate of return on plan assets  in part  because the rate of return on pension assets had declined significantly in the decreased rate of return assumption used for determining pension expense was based on the fact that higher returns achieved by our fixed income security portfolios in did not offset negative returns on our equity security portfolios  and our view of the intermediate future expected investment returns on us plan assets 
the rate of return assumption for us plans as of december   which will be used for determining pension expense for  is unchanged based on an evaluation performed during the fourth quarter of the weighted average expected rate of return assumption used for determining pension expense of our non us plans in and was and  respectively 
the weighted average expected rate of return assumption to be used to determine pension expense for non us plans in will be 
lastly  in  we revised the assumed interest crediting rate applied to participants balances in our cash balance pension plans from to 
the impact of this change was to reduce pension expense by we expect that the pension expense of us plans  after considering all relevant assumptions  will increase by approximately when compared to the amount recognized in notwithstanding the decline in the discount rates used to determine both our us and us pension obligations at december  from those used at december   the minimum pension liability decreased by during this decrease is largely attributable to the increases in pension plan assets  principally in the us and united kingdom  resulting from favorable investment returns 
this reversed a trend of increases in the minimum pension liability in each of the three years preceding  including increases of and in and  respectively 
these increases were the result of actual returns on pension plan assets being significantly lower than assumed earnings and the lowering of discount rates used to determine the amount of our obligations under the plans in each year 
we made contributions of to our pension plans in  including to us plans  compared to in  including to us plans 
assumptions are also a key determinant in the amount of the obligation and expense recorded for postretirement benefits other than pension opeb 
nearly of the total obligation for postretirement benefits relates to us plans 
the discount rate used to determine the obligation for these benefits decreased to at december  from at december  if there were a basis point decrease in the discount rate  our opeb expense would increase by and our obligation would increase by if there were a basis point increase in the discount rate  our opeb expense would decrease by and our obligation would decrease by the healthcare costs trend rate is also an important assumption in determining the amount of the opeb obligation 
we increased the initial weighted healthcare cost trend rate from at december  to at december  to reflect higher rates of inflation in medical costs  particularly inflation in prescription drug costs 
in  we lowered the initial trend rate slightly to 
these assumption changes had a direct influence on the opeb obligation increasing from  at december  to  at december  and to  at december  the increase in the opeb obligation between and was whereas the increase between and was 
the two factors that reduced the rate of increase related to a plan amendment that reduced our obligation by in and a reduction in the amount of actuarial loss from to opeb expense was in  in and in  representing an increase of over the period 
if there were a basis point increase in the assumed healthcare trend rates  our opeb expense would increase by and our obligation would increase by if there were a basis point decrease in the trend rates  our opeb expense would decrease by and our obligation would decrease by 
table of contents income taxes accounting for income taxes involves matters that require estimates and the application of judgment 
these include an evaluation of the realizability of recorded deferred tax benefits and assessment of potential tax liability relating to areas of potential dispute with various tax regulatory agencies 
we have operations in numerous jurisdictions around the world each with its own unique tax laws and regulations 
this adds further complexity to the process of accounting for income taxes 
our income tax estimates are adjusted in light of changing circumstances  such as the progress of our tax audits and our evaluations of the realizability of our tax assets 
at december   we had net operating loss nol carryforwards in a number of tax jurisdictions  including the us we also have net deferred tax assets  primarily related to our us opeb liability  which will be deductible on our tax returns when they are paid in the future 
we have evaluated the potential realization of these deferred tax benefits on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis 
our standard of realization is one of whether it is more likely than not that we will recognize the benefit of the nol over the carryforward period and also realize the tax benefits from the opeb deductions in the future 
our analysis of the realization considers the probability of generating taxable income over the permitted carryforward period in each jurisdiction 
where we have determined under the more likely than not standard that we do not have a better than probability of realization  we establish a valuation allowance against that portion of the deferred tax asset where our analysis and judgment indicates a less than probability of realization 
see additional discussion of nol carryforwards and an analysis of our deferred tax assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements under note income taxes and herein under results of operations 
in addition  we had a capital loss carryforward of  at december  that arose from the sale of a subsidiary in whose tax basis significantly exceeded its book basis 
this capital loss carryforward resulted in a deferred tax asset of at december  this capital loss carryforward will expire in as discussed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements  the realization of this carryforward is dependent on the generation of capital gain income 
our manufacturing and leasing operations generally produce income that is characterized as ordinary income 
because of the short carryover period allowed for unused capital losses in combination with the specific nature of income that may be used against the capital loss carryforward  we have established a valuation allowance against most of the deferred tax asset at december  our methodology for evaluating the level of allowance necessary includes an assessment of the likelihood of completion of specific transactions that will give rise to capital gain income during the carryforward period 
the impact of those transactions that have a more likely than not probability of closing are considered in determining whether a reduction in the allowance is appropriate 
these assessments are made at least quarterly 
see additional discussion of capital loss carryforwards in our consolidated financial statements under note income taxes and herein under results of operations 
at december   we had excess foreign tax credits ftcs of included in our deferred tax assets that will expire in various amounts beginning in and ending in the realization of these foreign tax credits is dependent on achieving the proper mix of us and non us sources of income 
we employ various modeling techniques in order to determine the likelihood of realizing the benefits of the ftc carryforwards 
because of the short carryforward period currently permitted for the utilization of ftcs and the mix of income required we have established an allowance for all but of the ftc carryforwards at december  see additional discussion of ftc carryforwards in our consolidated financial statements under note income taxes and herein under results of operations 
contingency reserves we have numerous other loss exposures  such as environmental claims  product liability and litigation 
establishing loss reserves for these matters requires the use of estimates and judgment in regards to risk exposure and ultimate liability 
we estimate losses under the programs using consistent and appropriate methods  however  changes to our assumptions could materially affect our recorded liabilities for loss 
see contingencies herein under liquidity and capital resources above for additional discussion 

table of contents results of operations versus our manufacturing operations are organized into market focused strategic business units 
our sbus are automotive systems group asg  engine and fluid management group efmg  and heavy vehicle technologies and systems group hvtsg 
in december  we announced our intention to sell substantially all of our automotive aftermarket business unit  which had been reported in prior periods as the automotive aftermarket group aag business segment 
we have classified this business as a discontinued operation 
the results of the discontinued operations are discussed more fully in a subsequent section 
the clevite engine hard parts aftermarket business that had been a part of the aag is not a part of the planned aftermarket sale transaction 
clevite obtains a significant portion of the products it sells from efmg 
accordingly  we have added clevite to the efmg 
our segment reporting for all periods has been restated to reflect these changes

in europe  the euro and the british pound strengthened  while in asia pacific the increase was led by the australian dollar 
overall light vehicle production in north america declined from million vehicles in to million vehicles in this reduction in light duty production was the primary factor in the year over year organic decline in our north american sales organic change being the residual change after excluding the effects of acquisitions  divestitures and currency movements 
the class commercial vehicle market in north america also experienced a slight drop in production  units in versus  units in lower sales due to these declines in production levels were partially offset by higher sales from net new business gains in each of our manufacturing sbus 
elsewhere in the world  overall light vehicle production demands in europe and south america were comparable in and  while production in the asia pacific region was higher 
the organic sales growth in south america and asia pacific relates primarily to net new business gains in the light vehicle market by asg

as previously mentioned  production levels in asg s largest market the north american light duty market were down in with more than of its sales to this market  the lower production levels caused asg s sales to decline in that market 
more than offsetting the overall market decline in north america were new business gains by asg that came on stream in new business gains came principally from new structures business with ford on the f series pickup  expedition navigator suvs and freestar minivan 
other new programs contributing to sales in were axle business with general motors on the express savannah full size van and system integration business with ford in australia 
like asg  our efmg unit sells primarily to the light vehicle segment of the market 
by comparison to asg  however  more of efmg s sales are to the commercial vehicle and engine parts aftermarket segments 
approximately of efmg s sales are in north america and europe 
as the production levels were down or stable in these two regions  compared to  efmg experienced lower sales due to overall market conditions 
this group experienced higher sales from the addition of net new programs commencing in however  the impact of sales gains from net new business was more than offset by lower production volumes  thereby resulting in a net organic sales reduction 
hvtsg focuses on the commercial vehicle and off highway markets 
more than of hvtsg s sales are in north america and europe 
in the commercial vehicle segment in both north america and europe  production levels were relatively stable  with the north american class segment being down  as previously noted 
overall  off highway production demands were also down in the net increase in organic sales in hvtsg was primarily due to new business commencing with certain off highway customers in other income was in both and other income in included  among other items  gains on note repurchases  divestitures and asset sales of  gains from the favorable settlement of sales tax obligations in india of  favorable resolution of a contingency relating to the fte business sold in of  australian export credits of and commission income of these items were partially offset by expense incurred in connection with an unsolicited tender offer for our common stock

gross and operating margin analysis as a percentage of sales increase decrease change gross margin asg efmg hvtsg consolidated selling  general and administrative expense asg efmg hvtsg consolidated operating margin asg efmg hvtsg consolidated in asg  gross margins have been significantly affected by start up costs in our structures business 
significant front end costs are typical in this business 
this past year was atypical in that we had a greater number of programs launching in the same year than is normal 
as well  some of these programs were large volume programs including the new ford f pick up the highest selling pick up in north america and the general motors colorado canyon full size pick up 
additionally  certain of these major programs experienced launch difficulties that resulted in higher than planned start up costs 
incremental start up costs in our structures business in approximated  we also incurred other launch related costs 
this factor alone negatively impacted asg gross margins by about 
adjusted for the effects of structures start up costs  asg gross margins in were comparable to other factors that reduced gross margins were higher steel costs  higher pension and healthcare costs and customer price reductions 
these margin reductions were largely offset by the benefits realized from prior restructuring initiatives  outsourcing of non core manufacturing and other cost reduction initiatives 
gross margins in our efmg unit improved slightly year over year despite an organic sales decline 
like asg  higher pension and healthcare costs and customer price reductions reduced margins in more than offsetting these factors were the benefits accruing from past restructuring actions  outsourcing non core engine liner manufacturing to a mexican equity affiliate and other cost reduction initiatives 
the hvtsg business  similar to efmg  experienced a slight improvement in gross margins 
as did our other two manufacturing sbus  hvtsg margins benefits from restructuring actions taken the past few years and other continuous improvement endeavors 
selling  general and administrative expenses consolidated selling  general and administrative s  g a expenses of in were lower than expenses 
the decrease in s  g a is attributable to recently completed restructuring actions and other cost reduction initiatives at both the manufacturing sbus and in the corporate expense area 
additionally  s  g a expenses associated with our dcc operation continues to come down as we divest the assets of this operation 

table of contents dollar change income loss before taxes the matters presented earlier on discussions relating to sales  cost of sales and selling  general and administrative expenses have virtually no impact on the change in income loss before income taxes between and because of their overall offsetting nature 
the improvement from a pre tax loss in to pre tax income in was also impacted by lower restructuring charges from continuing operations of and lower interest expense in the reduction in restructuring charges is attributable mainly to the winding down of the restructuring program announced in the fourth quarter of the reduction in interest expenses is due to both lower average interest rates and lower average debt outstanding 
dollar change income tax benefits we experienced income tax benefits in both and that resulted in a net tax benefit significantly greater than the tax provision normally expected at a customary effective tax rate equal to the us federal rate of 
net tax benefits greater than that expected by applying a rate to income loss before taxes were in and in a capital loss was generated in in connection with the sale of one of our subsidiaries 
we recognized a benefit of in in connection with the utilization of a portion of this capital loss 
since the benefit of these losses can only be realized by generating capital gains  a valuation allowance was recorded against the deferred tax asset representing the unused capital loss benefit 
the valuation allowance is released upon the occurrence of transactions generating capital gains  or the determination that the occurrence of the transaction is probable 
during  income tax benefits of were recognized through the release of the valuation allowance against our capital loss carryforward 
similarly  deferred tax assets relating to ordinary not capital operating losses generated in certain jurisdictions where realization is not assured also have valuation allowances recorded against them 
as income is generated in these jurisdictions  income tax benefits are recognized through the release of valuation allowances 
tax benefits of were recognized in as a result of releasing valuation allowances

currency movements in the british pound and other european currencies made up the remainder of 
table of contents the european currency impact 
south american sales suffered from weak local currencies throughout the region in particular the argentine peso and the brazilian real 
corporate restructuring strategies designed to enhance core business activities led to a number of divestitures of businesses that did not meet revised core strategies 
some of these divestitures did not result in discontinued operations treatment in our financial statements 
accordingly  those divestitures have had an impact on the comparison of sales in and all regions except for south america were impacted by net divestitures 
north american sales were impacted by four divestitures  the most significant of which was the power take off business that represented of the total sales decrease 
the divestiture impact in asia pacific was wholly attributable to the sale of taiway ltd in january the divestiture impact in europe was primarily related to the sales of thermoplast apparatabau gmbh  a manufacturer of molded interior trim parts and the carryover impact of the september sale of our glacier industrial polymer bearings business 
the european divestiture impact on sales was partially offset by the august acquisition of gkn ayra cardan  a spanish manufacturer of light duty driveshafts 
in south america  we realized a net increase in sales from acquisition and divestiture activities resulting from the carryover effect of our june acquisition of an additional interest in danaven  inc in which we previously held sales by segment for and are presented in the following table

nearly all of the net divestiture impact on hvtsg sales in is attributable to the sale of the chelsea power take off business in july hvtsg s organic growth in is primarily attributable to higher commercial vehicle class production in  units versus  units

the improvement in gross margin in compared to the pro forma margin is attributable in part to our restructuring program announced in the fourth quarter of the restructuring program achieved substantial progress in and included the consolidation of a number of operations and the outsourcing of certain non core production 
margin improvement in asg and efmg were also driven by higher levels of light vehicle production in million units as compared to million units

dollar change income tax benefits the effective tax rate of our continuing operations for the year ended december  approximated a benefit rate compared to a benefit rate for the year earlier period 
the two primary items affecting the effective income tax rate in relate to the recognition of a capital loss  which has been largely offset by a valuation allowance 
the capital loss arose from the sale in of a subsidiary whose tax basis substantially exceeded the book basis 
this capital loss was used to offset certain capital gains generated in from sales of other subsidiaries and assets  primarily real estate 
these sales resulted in book gains for which only a relatively small amount of tax was recorded because of the available capital loss 
at december   we had an unused capital loss carryforward of  that expires in  and a deferred tax benefit of associated with this carryforward 
we established a valuation allowance of against this deferred tax asset 
see our discussion of results of operations versus for the reasons for establishing this valuation allowance 
our effective tax rate of in represented a rate much closer to the statutory rate 
minority interest in net income of consolidated subsidiaries increased in when compared to the previous year due to the gain realized by a majority owned subsidiary in taiwan on the sale of a portion of an affiliate 
equity in earnings of affiliates for was higher than in dcc recorded a increase in income from its affiliates accounted for under the equity method  rebounding from the decline experienced in when one time charges related to the telecommunications industry were recorded by its equity affiliates 
this comparison is impacted unfavorably by in due to losses incurred by danaven  a venezuelan affiliate that became a consolidated subsidiary in july we also experienced increases of from our equity investments in germany in we reported a net loss of for compared to a net loss of for comparison of these annual amounts is difficult due to the change in accounting in and the unusual charges and credits in both years

the engine management business component also serves the automotive aftermarket and was also affected by excess inventory in the distribution chain 
table of contents income from discontinued operations relating to the automotive aftermarket business component increased in compared to despite flat sales 
the increase is attributable to a significant reduction in restructuring charges in when compared to the automotive aftermarket business component returned to profitability in after a loss in as it began to benefit from the restructuring actions that were completed during and and lower selling  general and administrative expenses 
restructuring expenses plus related amounts charged to cost of sales totaled in and in gross margin for the automotive aftermarket business component was in  in and in the low gross margin in was partially due to restructuring related costs charged to cost of sales for impairment charges taken on inventory of discontinued product lines

engine management s loss in included a pre tax charge of after tax in connection with the agreement to sell this business component 
excluding this charge  loss from discontinued operations decreased significantly in both and the operating improvement in both years is attributable in large measure to the effects of restructuring actions taken to consolidate manufacturing operations and distribution facilities
