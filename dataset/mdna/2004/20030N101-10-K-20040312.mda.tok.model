item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview comcast is principally involved in the management and operation of cable communications networks and in the management of programming content over cable and satellite television networks 
in  we received over of our revenue from our cable operations  primarily through monthly subscriptions to our video  high speed internet and phone services  and advertising 
subscribers typically pay us monthly  based on rates and related charges that vary according to their chosen level of service and the type of equipment they use 
revenue from our national television networks is derived from the sale of advertising time and affiliation agreements with cable and satellite television companies 
highlights for the year included the following integration of broadband acquisition we improved the profitability of the broadband systems  increasing revenues and operating margins 
we increased the number of basic subscribers in the broadband systems  reversing their three year trend of losses prior to our acquisition 
we accelerated our upgrade program 
by the end of  of our acquired systems have been upgraded to provide two way digital cable and high speed internet service 
continued growth in our new services such as digital cable and high speed internet 
digital cable grew to million subscribers while high speed internet grew to million subscribers 
we reduced our total debt outstanding by billion primarily with proceeds received from the sale of qvc and related liberty notes  the twe restructuring and other transactions 
the following provides the details of these highlights and insights into our company s financial statements  including critical accounting judgments and estimates used in preparing the financial statements  our liquidity and capital resources  and a discussion of our results of operations 
business developments we have grown significantly in recent years through both strategic acquisitions and growth in our existing businesses 
on november   we completed the acquisition of at t corp 
s broadband business  which we refer to as broadband 
the broadband acquisition substantially increased the size of our cable operations and caused significant changes in our capital structure  including a substantially higher amount of debt 
as a result  direct comparisons of our results of operations for periods prior to november  to subsequent periods are not meaningful 
see 
results of continuing operations for a discussion of the effects of the broadband acquisition on our results of operations 
on september  we completed the sale to liberty media corporation of our approximate interest in qvc  inc for approximately billion 
we received from liberty billion of three year senior unsecured floating rate notes  approximately million shares of liberty series a common stock valued at billion and cash of billion 
qvc has been presented as a discontinued operation in our financial statements 
refer to 
note to our consolidated financial statements included in item for more information on the sale of qvc 
refer to general developments of our business in part i and note to our financial statements included in item for a discussion of our acquisitions and other significant events 
critical accounting judgments and estimates we believe our judgments and related estimates associated with the impairment testing and valuation of our cable franchise rights  and the valuation of acquisition related assets  liabilities and legal contingencies  to be critical in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting judgments and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to them presented below 
impairment testing and valuation of cable franchise rights our cable systems are constructed and operated under non exclusive franchises granted by state or local governmental authorities for varying lengths of time 
as of december   we served approximately  franchise areas in the united states 
we have concluded that our cable franchise rights have an indefinite useful life since there are no legal  regulatory  contractual  competitive  economic or other factors limiting the period over which these rights will contribute to our cash flows 
accordingly  our cable franchise rights are not subject to amortization but are assessed periodically for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
we have acquired these franchise rights either directly from local franchise authorities or through many separate cable system acquisitions that include multiple franchise territories 
upon acquisition  we integrate the individual franchise territories into our national footprint  typically by incorporating the management of those territories into our existing geographic regions 
we control the sourcing of content  pricing  marketing and branding  and capital deployment throughout the company  as if our cable franchise rights were a single asset 
therefore  we have concluded the franchise rights are operated as a single asset within our cable segment 
from time to time  however  the franchise rights are separated and sold in units below the cable segment level 
we have concluded that emerging issues task force  unit of accounting for testing impairment of indefinite lived intangible assets  supports the testing of our cable franchise rights for impairment at a level no higher than where the assets both are operated together and are essentially inseparable 
during and  we tested our cable franchise rights for impairment at the cable segment level 
effective in the first quarter of  we will change the unit of accounting used for testing impairment to geographic regions and will perform impairment testing on our cable franchise rights 
we do not anticipate recording any impairment charge in connection with the impairment testing 
we assess the recoverability of our cable franchise rights annually or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
we estimate the fair value of our cable franchise rights primarily based on multiples of operating income before depreciation and amortization generated by the underlying assets  discounted cash flow analyses  analyses of current market transactions  and profitability information  including estimated future operating results  trends or other determinants of fair value 
if the value of our cable franchise rights determined by these evaluations is less than its carrying amount  an impairment charge would be recognized for the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying value of the assets 
future adverse changes in market conditions or in the operating results of the related business may indicate an inability to recover the carrying value of the assets  thereby possibly requiring a future impairment charge 
the carrying amount of cable franchise rights related to some of our historical cable systems is significantly less than their current estimated fair value largely because we acquired many of these rights directly from local franchise authorities rather than through separate cable system acquisitions 
conversely  the carrying amount of cable franchise rights for our more recent cable system acquisitions has not been significantly reduced through amortization and has not been reduced at all for acquisitions made subsequent to the adoption of sfas no 

nevertheless  testing for impairment at a level higher than the individual franchise agreement or cable system level reduces the likelihood of a future impairment charge related to our cable franchise rights 
as more fully described in note to our financial statements included in item see acquisition of broadband  the fair value of the shares issued for broadband was based on the date the non equity  or other  consideration being paid was substantively changed from the terms of the original merger agreement 
the fair value of the shares issued for broadband based on the new measurement date was approximately one half the fair value of the shares as of the date of the original merger agreement 
accordingly  the effect of the modification was to reduce by approximately one half approximately billion the value assigned to the equity consideration issued in connection with the broadband acquisition 
the reduction in the fair value of the equity consideration reduces the likelihood of a future impairment charge related to our goodwill 
fair value of acquisition related assets  liabilities and legal contingencies we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values 
in determining fair value  management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the recorded amounts 
to assist in this process  third party valuation specialists are engaged to value certain of these assets and liabilities 
estimates used in valuing acquired assets and liabilities include but are not limited to expected future cash flows  market rate assumptions for contractual obligations  actuarial assumptions for benefit plans  settlement plans for litigation and contingencies  and appropriate discount rates 
our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable  but that are inherently uncertain 
in addition  estimated liabilities to exit activities of the acquired operations  including the exiting of contractual obligations and the termination of employees  are subject to change as we complete the implementation of the plan 
the assets and assumed liabilities related to the broadband acquisition that required significant judgment in estimating fair value included investments  cable franchise rights  franchise related customer relationships  assumed contractual and other obligations  and costs related to terminating certain of broadband s contractual obligations and employees 
in addition  we are party to certain legal contingencies  including those described in item  legal proceedings 
if  based on information available  a potential loss arising from the lawsuits  claims and actions involving at t or broadband was deemed probable and reasonably estimable or the fair value of the contingency could be determined  we recorded the liability in the purchase price allocation 
for certain other cases  we are awaiting additional information to determine if a liability should be recorded 
in addition  the inherent limitations in the estimation process may cause future actual losses to exceed expected losses 
significant and subjective estimates the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and contingent liabilities such as income taxes and litigation 
we base our judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making estimates about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions

liquidity and capital resources during  we significantly strengthened our balance sheet and increased our liquidity through the repayment and refinancing of debt  and through the sales or restructurings of certain of our investments  which are more fully described below see 
financing on page 
anticipated sources of liquidity we believe that we will be able to meet our current and long term liquidity and capital requirements  including fixed charges  through our cash flows from operating activities  existing cash  cash equivalents and investments  through available borrowings under our existing credit facilities  and through our ability to obtain future external financing 
cash and cash equivalents we have traditionally maintained significant levels of cash and cash equivalents to meet our short term liquidity requirements 
as of december   our cash and cash equivalents totaled billion  substantially all of which is unrestricted 
investments investments that we determine to be non strategic  highly valued or both  are considered by us to be a source of liquidity 
as of december   we consider our investments in the following to be potential sources of liquidity billion in time warner inc common equivalent preferred stock  billion in liberty common stock  interest in time warner cable inc  and interests in certain cable television partnerships 
we do not have any significant contractual funding commitments with respect to any of our investments 
refer to 
note to our financial statements included in item for a discussion of our investments 
available borrowings under credit facilities we have traditionally maintained significant availability under our lines of credit to meet our short term liquidity requirements 
as of december   amounts available under our lines of credit totaled billion 
on january   we refinanced three of our existing revolving credit facilities with a new billion  five year revolving bank credit facility due january as of january   remaining amounts available under our lines of credit totaled billion see 
debt covenants on page 
anticipated uses of cash capital expenditures our most significant recurring investing activity has been and is expected to continue to be capital expenditures 
during  however  we expect cable capital expenditures to decline compared to as we complete the upgrade of our cable systems 
we expect to incur approximately billion of capital expenditures in our cable and content businesses  substantially all of which will be in our cable business 
as of december   we do not have any significant contractual obligations for capital expenditures 
the amount of our capital expenditures for and for subsequent years will depend on numerous factors  some of which are beyond our control  including competition  changes in technology  and the timing and rate of deployment of new services 
the following table illustrates the capital expenditures we incurred in our cable business during and expect to incur in in millions upgrading of certain cable systems  deployment of cable modems  digital converters  and new service offerings   recurring capital projects total capital expenditures   interest during  we made cash payments for interest totaling billion 
we anticipate that  for the foreseeable future  our cash paid interest will decline modestly as average debt balances decline  but will remain significant 
income taxes during  we made cash payments for income taxes totaling million  primarily as a result of our sale of qvc and certain of our other investments 
we anticipate that our cash paid for income taxes will be significantly reduced in stock repurchases in december  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to billion of our outstanding common equity securities 
we expect such repurchases to occur from time to time  in the open market or in private transactions  subject to market conditions 
affiliation agreements certain of our content subsidiaries enter into multi year affiliation agreements with various cable and satellite television system operators for carriage of their respective programming 
in connection with these affiliation agreements  we generally pay a launch fee to the cable or satellite television operator based upon the number of subscribers 
during  we expect to incur fees of no more than million related to these affiliation agreements  excluding amounts applicable to our cable systems 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any significant off balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
contractual obligations our unconditional contractual obligations as of december   which consist primarily of our debt obligations  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods  are summarized in the table below

our purchase obligations include payments under the employment agreements that we  through comcast spectacor  have with both players and coaches of our professional sports teams that are guaranteed regardless of employee injury or termination 
certain of these agreements may be covered by disability insurance if certain conditions are met 
also included are payments under license agreements that our programming networks have entered into for programs and sporting events that will be available for telecast subsequent to december  also included are the minimum guaranteed payments under programming contracts that our cable segment enters into for the purchase of programming from cable network providers 
we have also included commitments to purchase cable related equipment 
we did not include contracts with immaterial future commitments 
acquisition related obligations consist primarily of costs related to terminating employees  costs relating to exiting contractual obligations  and other assumed contractual obligations of the acquired entity 
other long term obligations consist principally of our prepaid forward transactions on equity securities we hold  subsidiary preferred shares  deferred compensation obligations  pension  post retirement and post employment benefit obligations  and program rights payable under license agreements 
financing as of december  and  our debt  including capital lease obligations  was billion and billion  respectively 
the billion decrease from december  to december  results from our net debt repayments and non cash financing transactions during included in our debt as of december  and was short term debt and current portion of long term debt of billion and billion  respectively 
we have  and may from time to time in the future  depending on certain factors including market conditions  make optional repayments on our debt obligations  which may include open market repurchases of our outstanding public notes and debentures

as of december   billion of our debt was included in the cross guarantee structure 
comcast holdings is not a guarantor and none of its debt is guaranteed under the cross guarantee structure 
as of december   billion of our debt was outstanding at comcast holdings 
debt covenants we and our cable subsidiaries that have provided guarantees are subject to the covenants and restrictions set forth in the indentures governing our public debt securities and in the credit agreement governing our bank credit facilities 
we and the guarantors are in compliance with the covenants and we believe that neither the covenants nor the restrictions in our indentures or loan documents will limit our ability to operate our business or raise additional capital 
the two financial covenants in our bank credit facility are tested on an ongoing basis and measure our leverage and interest coverage 
we have significant headroom under these financial covenants 
the entire amount of our new billion bank credit facility is currently available for our use  and future compliance with our financial covenants is not dependent on further debt reduction or on improved operating results 
exchangeable notes we have outstanding notes exchangeable into the common stock of cablevision ny group cablevision class a common stock  microsoft corporation microsoft common stock  vodafone adrs and comcast class a special common stock together  the exchangeable notes 
at maturity the exchangeable notes are mandatorily redeemable at our option into i a number of shares of common stock or adrs equal to the underlying shares multiplied by an exchange ratio as defined  or ii its cash equivalent 
the maturity value of the exchangeable notes varies based upon the fair market value of the security to which it is indexed 
the exchangeable notes are collateralized by our investments in cablevision  microsoft and vodafone  respectively 
the comcast exchangeable notes are collateralized by our class a special common stock held in treasury 
we have and intend in the future to settle the comcast exchangeable notes using cash 
during  we settled billion of our obligations relating to certain of our exchangeable notes by delivering the underlying shares of common stock or cash to the counterparty upon maturity of the instruments  and the equity collar agreements related to the underlying shares expired or were settled 
as of december   our debt includes an aggregate of billion of exchangeable notes  including billion and billion within current portion of long term debt and long term debt  respectively 
as of december   the securities held by us collateralizing the exchangeable notes were sufficient to satisfy the debt obligations associated with the outstanding exchangeable notes 
interest rate risk management we are exposed to the market risk of adverse changes in interest rates 
we maintain a mix of fixed and variable rate debt and enter into various derivative transactions pursuant to our policies to manage the volatility relating to these exposures 
we monitor our interest rate risk exposures using techniques including market value and sensitivity analyses 
we do not hold or issue any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes and are not a party to leveraged instruments 
we manage the credit risks associated with our derivative financial instruments through the evaluation and monitoring of the creditworthiness of the counterparties 
although we may be exposed to losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties  we do not expect such losses  if any  to be significant 
we use the following derivative financial instruments to manage the market risk of adverse changes in interest rates interest rate exchange agreements swaps to exchange  at specified intervals  the difference between fixed and variable interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed upon notional principal amount  interest rate lock agreements rate locks to hedge the risk that cash flows related to the interest payments on an anticipated issuance or assumption of fixed rate debt may be adversely affected by interest rate fluctuations  interest rate cap agreements caps to lock in a maximum interest rate should variable rates rise  but enable us to otherwise pay lower market rates  and interest rate collar agreements collars to limit our exposure to and benefits from interest rate fluctuations on variable rate debt to within a certain range of rates 
while swaps  rate locks  caps and collars represent an integral part of our interest rate risk management program  their effect on interest expense for the years ended december   and was not significant 
however  swaps  rate locks  caps and collars may have a significant effect on our interest expense in the future 
the table set forth below summarizes the fair values and contract terms of financial instruments subject to interest rate risk maintained by us as of december  dollars in millions thereafter total fair value at debt fixed rate        average interest rate variable rate    average interest rate interest rate instruments variable to fixed swaps notional amounts  average pay rate average receive rate fixed to variable swaps notional amounts   average pay rate average receive rate the notional amounts of interest rate instruments  as presented in the table above  are used to measure interest to be paid or received and do not represent the amount of exposure to credit loss 
the estimated fair value approximates the proceeds to settle the outstanding contracts 
we estimate interest rates on variable debt using the average implied forward london interbank offer rate libor rates for the year of maturity based on the yield curve in effect at december   plus the borrowing margin in effect for each credit facility at december  we estimate the floating rates on our swaps using the average implied forward libor rates for the year of maturity based on the yield curve in effect at december  excluding the effects of interest rate risk management instruments  of our total debt as of december  was at variable rates  compared to at december  the decrease from december  in the percentage of our variable rate debt was due to the repayment of substantially all of our variable rate bank debt during as a matter of practice  we typically do not structure our financial contracts to include credit ratings based triggers that could affect our liquidity 
in the ordinary course of business  certain of our swaps could be subject to termination provisions if we do not maintain investment grade credit ratings 
as of december   the fair value of the liability related to those swaps was approximately million 
the amount due upon termination  if any  would be based upon the fair value of those outstanding contracts at that time 
equity price risk management we are exposed to the market risk of changes in the equity prices of certain of our investments accounted for as trading securities 
we enter into various derivative transactions pursuant to our policies to manage the volatility relating to these exposures 
we monitor our equity price risk exposures to ensure that the instruments are matched with the underlying assets or liabilities  reduce our risks relating to equity prices  and through market value and sensitivity analyses  maintain a high correlation to the risk inherent in the hedged item

notes 
and to our financial statements included in item for more information about these components of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
statement of cash flows cash and cash equivalents increased billion as of december  from december  the increase in cash and cash equivalents resulted from cash flows from operating  financing and investing activities as explained below 
net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations amounted to billion for the year ended december   due principally to our operating income before depreciation and amortization see 
results of continuing operations  the effects of interest and income tax payments  and changes in operating assets and liabilities as a result of the timing of receipts and disbursements 
net cash used in financing activities from continuing operations consists primarily of borrowings and repayments of debt 
net cash used in financing activities from continuing operations was billion for the year ended december  during  we borrowed billion  consisting principally of billion of senior notes  billion under revolving credit facilities  and billion under a term loan due during  we repaid billion of our debt  consisting principally of billion of our term loans  billion on certain of our revolving credit facilities  billion of short term debt  billion of our senior and medium term notes  million of trust preferred securities  and million of exchangeable debt 
net cash provided by investing activities from continuing operations was billion for the year ended december  during  proceeds from investing activities include sales  settlements and restructuring of investments as listed in the table under 
financing on page  offset  in part  by capital expenditures of billion 
results of continuing operations revenues consolidated revenues for the years and increased billion and billion  respectively  from the previous year 
of these increases  billion and billion  respectively  relate to our cable segment  which is discussed separately below 
the remaining increases are primarily the result of our content businesses  which achieved combined revenue growth of and  during the years and  respectively 
such increases in the content businesses were primarily the result of increases in distribution revenues  increases in advertising revenues and the effects of our acquisitions 
operating  selling  general and administrative expenses consolidated operating  selling  general and administrative expenses for the years and increased billion and billion  respectively  from the previous year 
of these increases  billion and billion  respectively  relate to our cable segment  which is discussed separately below 
the remaining increases are primarily the result of growth in our content businesses and increases in corporate overhead 
depreciation the increases in depreciation expense for the years and are primarily attributable to our cable segment 
the increases in our cable segment are principally due to the effects of the broadband acquisition  as well as our increased levels of capital expenditures 
amortization the increase in amortization expense for the year is primarily attributable to our cable segment 
the increase in our cable segment is principally due to the effects of the broadband acquisition 
as a result of the broadband acquisition  we recorded approximately billion of franchise related customer relationship intangible assets  which we are amortizing over their average estimated useful life of approximately four years 
the decrease in amortization expense for the year is primarily attributable to our cable segment  principally due to the effects of the adoption of sfas no 
on january  as we no longer amortize goodwill or franchise rights intangible assets 
this decrease is partially offset by the effects of the broadband acquisition 
cable segment operating results the discussion of our cable segment historical operating results is presented as a comparison of the  and periods  which only include the broadband results subsequent to november  in order to provide additional information relating to our cable segment operating results  we also present a comparison of actual results to results on a pro forma basis 
management uses pro forma data to evaluate performance when significant acquisitions or dispositions occur 
historical data reflects results of acquired businesses only after the acquisition dates while pro forma data enhances comparability of financial information between periods by adjusting the data as if the acquisitions or dispositions occurred at the beginning of the prior year 
our pro forma data is only adjusted for the timing of acquisitions and does not include adjustments for costs related to integration activities  cost savings or synergies that have or may be achieved by the combined businesses 
in the opinion of management  this information is not indicative of what our results would have been had we operated broadband since january   nor of our future results amounts in millions 
to pro forma comparisons our cable operating results reflect revenue growth of and operating income before depreciation and amortization growth of compared to the pro forma year 
the growth in revenue is primarily the result of growth in basic  digital cable and high speed internet subscribers  and rate increases 
the increase in high speed internet subscribers reflects increased consumer demand for the faster and more reliable internet service provided over our cable networks 
the increase in our video subscribers was driven by an increase of approximately  subscribers in in the broadband systems that reversed a loss of approximately  subscribers in the growth in digital cable subscribers reflects increased demand for additional programming choices and enhancements in digital service packages 
rate increases occurred in our traditional video service  as well as from the repricing and repackaging of the digital and premium channel products in the broadband systems 
the operating income before depreciation and amortization results reflect the significant operating trends and efficiencies achieved in integrating the broadband operations 
the integration of broadband involved changing the organizational structure and refocusing priorities including focusing on selling video and high speed internet services  and emphasizing profitability over subscriber growth in phone 
accelerating our upgrade of broadband systems to deploy and market expanded services sooner 
in  we upgraded over  miles versus  miles in pro forma renegotiating programming contracts or achieving synergies in existing programming contracts 
the impact of these initiatives was to reduce the growth in our programming costs 
reducing redundant broadband overhead functions 
increase decrease increase decrease video   high speed internet   phone advertising sales   other franchise fees revenues    programming expenses   other operating  selling  general and administrative expenses   operating income before depreciation and amortization a   video subscribers   high speed internet subscribers    phone subscribers   monthly average revenue per video subscriber monthly average revenue per high speed internet subscriber monthly average revenue per phone subscriber a operating income before depreciation and amortization is defined as operating income before depreciation and amortization  impairment charges  if any  related to fixed and intangible assets and gains or losses from the sale of assets  if any 
as such  it eliminates the significant level of non cash depreciation and amortization expense that results from the capital intensive nature of our businesses and intangible assets recognized in business combinations  and is unaffected by our capital structure or investment activities 
our management and board of directors use this measure in evaluating our consolidated operating performance and the operating performance of all of our operating segments 
this metric is used to allocate resources and capital to our operating segments and is a significant component of our annual incentive compensation programs 
we believe that this measure is also useful to investors as it is one of the bases for comparing our operating performance with other companies in our industries  although our measure may not be directly comparable to similar measures used by other companies 
because we use operating income before depreciation and amortization as the measure of our segment profit or loss  we reconcile it to operating income  the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  in the business segment footnote to our financial statements 
this measure should not be considered as a substitute for operating income loss  net income loss  net cash provided by operating activities or other measures of performance or liquidity reported in accordance with gaap 
revenues video revenue consists of our basic  expanded basic  premium  pay per view  equipment and digital cable services 
the increase in video revenue from to is primarily due to increases in monthly average revenue per video subscriber as a result of rate increases in our traditional video service  growth in digital subscribers  and repricing and repackaging of the digital and premium channel services in the broadband systems 
from december  to december   we added approximately  basic subscribers and over million digital subscribers  or a increase in digital subscribers 
we expect continued growth in our video services revenue 
the increase in high speed internet revenue from to is primarily due to the addition in of approximately million high speed internet subscribers  or a increase in high speed internet subscribers  as well as to the effects of an increase in monthly average revenue per subscriber 
we expect continued revenue growth as overall demand for our services continues to increase 
the decrease in phone revenue from to is primarily as a result of our focus on operating efficiencies to drive profitability in the phone business  rather than focusing on subscriber growth 
as a result  during our phone subscribers decreased by approximately  subscribers 
the increase in advertising sales revenue from to is primarily due to the effects of growth in regional national advertising as a result of the continuing success of our regional interconnects  offset by reduced growth in a soft local advertising market 
other revenue includes installation revenues  guide revenues  commissions from electronic retailing  revenue from our regional sports programming networks and reduced revenue from other product offerings 
the increase in franchise fees collected from our cable subscribers from to is primarily attributable to the increase in our revenues upon which the fees apply 
expenses total expenses decreased million or in from  which is primarily the result of the effects of approximately million of acquisition and employee termination related costs recorded by broadband in excluding the effects of these costs  total expenses were nearly level with the amounts 
this is a result of cost efficiencies generated from the integration of broadband 
programming costs represent our single largest operating expense and represent fees paid to license programming from cable and broadcast networks that we distribute  package and sell to our video subscribers 
programming expenses are impacted by changes in programming rates  the number of subscribers and programming channels 
in  programming costs increased as compared to during  we were able to negotiate reductions in programming rates  primarily in premium channels 
we anticipate our programming costs will increase in the future primarily as a result of increased cost to produce and purchase programming and additional programming channels provided to our subscribers 
these increases are mitigated  to some extent  by additional volume discounts associated with our increased size and future growth in subscribers receiving such programming channels 
other operating  selling and general and administrative expenses decreased from to primarily due to the effects of approximately million of acquisition and employee termination related costs recorded by broadband in additionally  in  customer service expenses slightly declined because we no longer outsource broadband s customer service operations 
we also reduced administrative and overhead expenses through reductions in headcount and the elimination of redundancies 
offsetting these decreases were increases in labor and other volume related operating expenses associated with the growth in our high speed internet and digital cable services
