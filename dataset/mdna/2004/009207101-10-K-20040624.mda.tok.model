item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company s most significant component of revenue  which accounted for of revenue in fiscal  was generated through its air cargo subsidiaries  mountain air cargo  inc mac and csa air  inc csa 
mac and csa are short haul express air freight carriers 
mac and csa s revenue contributed approximately  and  to the company s revenues in fiscal and  respectively  a current year increase of 
approximately  or of the increase in revenue in fiscal was related to maintenance services  which were primarily attributed to customer fleet modernization  associated with conversion of atr aircraft from passenger to cargo configuration  and route expansion 
the remainder of the increase was attributable to administration and other direct operating revenue associated with route expansion 
under the terms of the dry lease service agreements  which currently cover approximately of the revenue aircraft operated  the company passes through to its customer certain cost components of its operations without markup 
the cost of fuel  flight crews  landing fees  outside maintenance  parts and certain other direct operating costs are included in operating expenses and billed to the customer as cargo and maintenance revenue  at cost 
separate agreements cover the four types of aircraft operated by mac and csa for their customer cessna caravan  atr  fokker f  and short brothers sd cessna caravan  atr and fokker f aircraft a total of aircraft at march  are owned by and dry leased from customer  and short brothers sd and king air aircraft respectively  two and one aircraft at march  are owned by the company 
the sd s are operated periodically under wet lease arrangements with the customer 
pursuant to such agreements  the customer determines the type of aircraft and schedule of routes to be flown by mac and csa  with all other operational decisions made by the company 
agreements are renewable annually and may be terminated by the customer at any time upon to days notice 
the company believes that the short term and other provisions of its agreements with the customer are standard within the air freight contract delivery service industry 
the company is not contractually precluded from providing such services to other firms  and has done so in the past 
loss of its contracts with the customer would have a material adverse effect on the company 
global manufactures  services and supports aircraft deicers and ground support equipment on a worldwide basis 
global s revenue contributed approximately  and  to the company s revenues in fiscal and  respectively 
the increase in revenues in was primarily due to increased commercial and military equipment orders and the near completion of a large scale airport deicer system contract by march during fiscal  the company decided to discontinue and dispose of its aircraft component parts brokerage and repair services business operated by its mountain aircraft services  llc mas subsidiary and accordingly  the company s financial statements have been reclassified to reflect the results of mas as a discontinued operation 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company s continuing operations operate in two business segments  providing overnight air cargo services to the express delivery services industry and aviation ground support equipment products to passenger and cargo airlines and airports 
each business segment has separate management teams and infrastructures that offer different products and services 
the subsidiaries make up the following reportable segments air cargo and ground equipment in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the following table summarizes the changes and trends in the company s operating expenses for continuing operations as a percentage of revenue fiscal year ended march  operating revenue in thousands    expense as a percentage of revenue flight operations maintenance ground equipment general and administrative depreciation and amortization total costs and expenses as indicated in item principal accountants and accounting fees  the company incurred greater professional fees in fiscal than in fiscal the company anticipates that as additional requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of become effective  in particular the requirements under section b of that act with respect to auditor attestation with respect to internal controls which will apply to the company in fiscal  professional fees will continue to increase and may materially reduce the company s net income 
under applicable federal law  section b and certain other requirements of the sarbanes oxley act and other federal regulations would not apply to the company if the number of stockholders is reduced below and  upon application to the securities and exchange commission  the company elects to cease filing annual and quarterly reports with the sec 
the board of directors has considered  and may likely consider in the future  corporate transactions that would have the effect of reducing the number of stockholders below  including a reverse split of the company s common stock in which holders of fewer than a specified number of shares would receive cash for their shares  while holders of greater amounts of shares would continue to hold equity interests in the company in the same approximate relative proportion 
if the number of stockholders is reduced below and the company elects to cease filing periodic reports with the sec  the company s common stock would no longer be eligible for listing on the nasdaq small cap market and any alternative trading system for the common stock may not provide the same liquidity as the nasdaq small cap market 
the board of directors has not approved  and may not in the future approve  any such corporate transaction to effect a reduction in the number of stockholders below outlook the company s current forecast for fiscal suggests that  due to higher fuel cost and losses sustained since september   the commercial aviation market will grow at a rate that is substantially less than the rest of the economy 
increased military and homeland security budgets  pending funding approvals  may help offset the expected lower than normal order levels from commercial customers 
company management currently anticipates that its air cargo segment will continue to benefit from its customer s aircraft fleet modernization and route expansion through fiscal  however  future terrorist attacks  competition or inflation may cause delays or termination of the certain projects 
given the uncertainties associated with the above factors  the company continues to operate in a highly unpredictable environment 
as stated above  during the third quarter of fiscal  company management closed on its agreement to sell mas assets and to discontinue the operations of the company s aviation service sector business 
the completion of this sale and resulting decrease in losses experienced by this business segment is expected to substantially improve the company s future operating results and financial position 
however  there is no guarantee that this improvement can be sustained due to the other external factors described above 
based on the current general economic and industry outlook and cost cutting measures implemented over the past twenty four months  the company believes its existing cash and cash equivalents  cash flow from operations  and funds available from current and renewed credit facilities will be adequate to meet its current and anticipated working capital requirements through if these sources are inadequate or become unavailable  then the company may pursue additional funds through the financing of unencumbered assets  although there is no assurance these additional funds will be sufficient to replace the sources that are inadequate or become unavailable 
actual results for fiscal will depend upon a number of factors beyond the company s control  including  in part  future significant increases in rate of inflation  including fuel prices  the timing  speed and magnitude of the economic recovery  military funding of pending future equipment orders  future levels of commercial aviation capital spending  future terrorists acts and weather patterns 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of the company s financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires the use of estimates and assumptions to determine certain assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
management bases these estimates and assumptions upon the best information available at the time of the estimates or assumptions 
the company s estimates and assumptions could change materially as conditions within and beyond our control change 
accordingly  actual results could differ materially from estimates 
the most significant estimates made by management include allowance for doubtful accounts receivable  reserves for excess and obsolete inventories  deferred tax asset valuation  retirement benefit obligations  valuation of revenue recognized under the percentage of completion method and valuation of long lived assets 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  company management agreed to a plan to sell mas assets and to discontinue the operations of the company s aviation service sector business 
in august  the company completed the sale of certain assets of mas totaling  for consideration of  the loss associated with this disposition is reflected in discontinued operations 
the operations of mas have been reclassified as discontinued operations and  therefore  are not included in the results of continuing operations discussed below 
following is a discussion of critical accounting policies and related management estimates and assumptions 
a full description of all significant accounting policies is included in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable in the amount of  and  respectively  in fiscal and  was established based on management s estimates of the collectability of accounts receivable 
the required allowance is determined using information such as customer credit history  industry information  credit reports and customer financial condition 
the estimates can be affected by changes in the financial strength of the aviation industry  customer credit issues or general economic conditions 
inventories 
the company s parts inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
provisions for excess and obsolete inventories in the amount of  and  respectively  in fiscal and  are based on assessment of slow moving and obsolete inventories 
historical part usage  current period sales  estimated future demand and anticipated transactions between willing buyers and sellers provide the basis for estimates 
estimates are subject to volatility and can be affected by reduced equipment utilization  existing supplies of used inventory available for sale  the retirement of aircraft or ground equipment and changes in the financial strength of the aviation industry 
deferred taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities  net of valuation allowance in the amount of  in fiscal and  reflect the likelihood of the recoverability of these assets 
company judgment of the recoverability of these assets is based primarily on estimates of current and expected future earnings and tax planning 
retirement benefits obligation 
the company currently determines the value of retirement benefits assets and liabilities on an actuarial basis using a discount rate 
long term deferred retirement benefit obligations amounted to  and  respectively  in fiscal and values are affected by current independent indices  which estimate the expected return on insurance policies and the discount rates used 
changes in the discount rate used will affect the amount of pension liability as well as pension gain or loss recognized in other comprehensive income 
revenue recognition 
cargo revenue is recognized upon completion of contract terms and maintenance revenue is recognized when the service has been performed 
revenue from product sales is recognized when contract terms are completed and title has passed to customers 
revenues from overhaul contracts on customer owned parts  certain labor service contracts and long term fixed price manufacturing projects are recognized on the percentage of completion method 
billings in excess of cost and estimated earnings for contracts under percentage of completion in the amount of  and  respectively  in fiscal and revenues are measured by the percentage of cost incurred to date  to estimated total cost for each contract or work order  unanticipated changes in job performance  job conditions and estimated profitability may result in revisions to costs and income  and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined 
valuation of long lived assets 
the company assesses long lived assets used in operations for impairment when events and circumstances indicate the assets may be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than their carrying amount 
in the event it is determined that the carrying values of long lived assets are in excess of the fair value of those assets  the company then will write down the value of the assets to fair value 
the company has applied the discontinued operations provisions of sfas no 
for the mas operations and has reflected any remaining long lived assets associated with the discontinued mas subsidiary at zero fair market value at march  resignation of executive officer effective december   an executive officer and director of the company resigned his employment with airt 
in consideration of approximately  payable in three installments over a one year period starting january   the executive agreed to forgo certain retirement and other contractual benefits for which the company had previously accrued aggregate liabilities of  the company has accounted for the resignation as a settlement under the provisions of sfas no 
employers accounting for settlements and curtailments of defined benefit plans and for termination benefits 
the above mentioned cancellation of contractual retirement benefits reduced recorded liabilities by  the difference between the recorded liability and ultimate cash payment of  resulted in the recording of a  reduction in actuarial losses  recorded in other comprehensive loss  a  reduction in intangible assets and a net  reduction in executive compensation charges included in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations 
the company also agreed to purchase from the former executive officer  shares of airt common stock held by him representing approximately of the outstanding shares of common stock at december  for per share of the january  closing price 
the stock repurchase will take place in three installments over a one year period  starting january   and will total approximately  the repurchase of the former executive s stock will be recorded in the period that the repurchase occurs as treasury stock transactions 
all installment payments required to be made on january   have been made 
seasonality global s business has historically been highly seasonal 
due to the nature of its product line  the bulk of global s revenues and earnings have typically occurred during the second and third fiscal quarters in anticipation of the winter season  and comparatively little has occurred during the first and fourth fiscal quarters 
the company has continued its efforts to reduce global s seasonal fluctuation in revenues and earnings by broadening its product line to increase revenues and earnings in the first and fourth fiscal quarters 
in june  global was awarded a four year contract to supply deicing equipment to the united states air force  and in june global was awarded a three year extension on the contract 
in january and march global received two large scale  fixed stand deicer contracts  which the company believes contributed to management s plan to reduce seasonal fluctuation in revenues during fiscal and however  as these contracts are completed  seasonal trends for global s business may resume 
the remainder of the company s business is not materially seasonal 
fiscal vs 
consolidated revenue from continuing operations increased  to  for the fiscal year ended march  compared to the prior fiscal year 
the increase in revenue primarily resulted from an increase in global revenue of  to  combined with a  increase in air cargo revenue to  in fiscal  as described in the overview section of item operating expenses from continuing operations increased  to  for fiscal compared to fiscal the net increase in operating expenses consisted of the following changes cost of flight operations increased  as a result of customer schedule changes and route expansion which increased pilot cost and costs associated with pilot travel  and increases in landing fees  maintenance expenses increased  primarily as a result of increases associated with additional maintenance personnel and the cost of travel  contract service cost  and cost of parts and supplies related to customer fleet modernization and route expansion  ground equipment costs increased   as a result of higher cost of parts and labor associated with increased sales at global  depreciation and amortization decreased  as a result of purchases of capital assets  general and administrative expense increased  primarily as a result of increased profit sharing accruals  settlement of an executive employment contract as discussed above  staffing  facilities cost and professional fees 
on a continuing operations segment basis  significant impacts on the company s operating results comparing the fiscal year ended march  to its prior fiscal year resulted from changes in both the ground equipment and air cargo sectors 
in the fiscal year ended march   global had operating income of  compared to prior period income of  several factors contributed to the increases in global s operating results 
global s current fiscal year operating income increased compared to its prior fiscal year primarily due to progress on a large scale airport contract  higher sales volume due to increased delivery of units on its us air force contract and a increase in increased commercial equipment orders 
unless replaced by an additional large scale airport contract or increased commercial equipment orders  the pending completion of global s current large scale airport contract would result in decreased revenues in fiscal operating income for the company s overnight air cargo operations was  in the fiscal year ended march   an increase of from  in the prior fiscal year 
the increase primarily resulted from increased levels of aircraft maintenance revenue and administrative fees related to the customer s atr aircraft fleet modernization program and route expansion  which is expected to continue through fiscal  as  described in the overview section of item non operating income increased a net  due to current year gain on sale of marketable securities and decreased interest expense as a result of the pay down of approximately  in debt from the proceeds from the sale of mas assets and increased cash flow from operations 
provision for income taxes increased  primarily due to increased earnings 
the provision for income taxes for the fiscal years ended march   and were different from the federal statutory rates primarily due to state tax provisions 
fiscal vs 
consolidated revenue from continuing operations decreased  to  for the fiscal year ended march  compared to the prior fiscal year 
the decrease in revenue primarily resulted from a decrease in global revenue of  to  associated with the completion of a large scale airport contract and decreased deicer orders partially offset by a  increase in air cargo revenue to  related to increased maintenance billings in fiscal the business of global has been adversely affected by reduced orders from commercial airlines and aviation related companies  due principally to the continued severe downturn in the commercial aviation industry  which started in early and significantly increased after september  although this business also derives a significant portion of its revenue from sale of products for military applications  certain military programs that use the company s products were not fully funded in operating expenses from continuing operations decreased  to  for fiscal compared to fiscal the net decrease in operating expenses consisted of the following changes cost of flight operations increased  as a result of decreases in personnel cost and costs associated with pilot travel partially offset by increases in fuel and landing fees  maintenance expenses increased  primarily as a result of increases associated with contract service costs  partially offset by decreases in contract services related to the operations of mac  ground equipment costs decreased   as a result of decreased sales at global  depreciation and amortization increased  as a result of purchases of certain assets  general and administra tive expense decrease of  primarily as a result of decreased profit sharing expense  staffing  contract labor  rent and related facilities cost  partially offset by increases in professional fees 
on a continuing operations segment basis  the most significant impact on the company s operating results comparing the fiscal year ended march  to the prior period resulted from changes in the ground equipment operation at global 
in the fiscal year ended march   global had operating income of  compared to prior period income of  several factors contributed to the changes in global s operating results 
global s fiscal year operating income decreased compared to its prior fiscal year primarily due to completion of a large scale airport contract  lower sales volume on its us air force contract and declines in commercial equipment orders 
operating income for the company s overnight air cargo operations was  in the fiscal year ended march   an increase of from  in the prior fiscal year 
the majority of the increase resulted from increased levels of aircraft maintenance revenue 
non operating expense decreased a net  due to decreased current year interest expense related to decreased borrowing on the company s line of credit  partially offset by an other than temporary impairment charge on marketable securities totaling  provision for income taxes decreased  primarily due to decreased earnings at global 
the provision for income taxes for the fiscal years ended march   and were different from the federal statutory rates primarily due to state tax provisions and a reduction in the company s excise tax accrual due to a favorable tax ruling 
liquidity and capital resources as of march  the company s working capital amounted to  a decrease of  compared to march  the net decrease primarily resulted from a  decrease in accounts receivable due to increased collections  a  decrease in assets held for sale associated with the discontinued operations of mas  partially offset by an  decrease in accounts payable  resulting from increased cash flow from operations 
on august  the company amended its  secured bank financing line to extend its expiration date to august  during fiscal  the company reduced the line of credit balance by  primarily with proceeds from the sale of mas 
the credit facility contains customary events of default  a subjective clause and restrictive covenants that  among other matters  require the company to maintain certain financial ratios 
there is no requirement for the company to maintain a lock box arrangement under this agreement 
under the provisions of the revolving credit line  the sale of mas  as described in note  would be considered an event of default 
however  the company has obtained a waiver under the revolving credit line for the sale of mas 
as of march   the company was in compliance with all of the restrictive covenants under the revolving credit line 
the amount of credit available to the company under the agreement at any given time is determined by an availability calculation  based on the eligible borrowing base  as defined in the credit agreement  which includes the company s outstanding receivables  inventories and equipment  with certain exclusions 
the credit facility is secured by substantially all of the company s assets 
at march  and  the amounts outstanding against the line were  and  respectively

cash used in investing activities for the year ended march  was approximately  less than fiscal  principally due to proceeds from sale of assets associated with discontinued operations of  offset by increased capital expenditures relating to the  purchase of an airplane 
cash used in financing activities was  more in fiscal compared to fiscal principally due to increased repayment of borrowings under the line of credit  and no payment of dividends in the current year 
during the fiscal year ended march  the company repurchased  of its common stock for  as described above 
there are currently no commitments for significant capital expenditures 
the company s board of directors  on august   adopted the policy to pay an annual cash dividend in the first quarter of each fiscal year  in an amount to be determined by the board 
on may   the company declared that  due to losses sustained in fiscal  no common share dividend would be paid in fiscal on may   the company declared a per share cash dividend  to be paid on june  to shareholders of record june  derivative financial instruments as required by sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  the company recognizes all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measures those instruments at fair value 
the company is exposed to market risk  such as changes in interest rates 
to manage the volatility relating to interest rate risk  the company may enter into interest rate hedging arrangements from time to time 
the company does not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
in may  the company entered into two interest rate swaps with notional amounts of million  and million respectively 
these agreements were originally entered into at respective interest rates of and 
on july  the company elected to unwind its  revolving credit line swap in consideration for  the fair market value termination fee as of that date 
on october   the company terminated its remaining credit line swap for  the fair market value termination fee as of that date  the  balance included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss as of march  will be ratably amortized into interest expense over the remaining term of the company s credit line 
the company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
as of march  the company had no derivative financial instruments outstanding 
the company is exposed to changes in interest rates on certain portions of its line of credit  which bears interest based on the day libor rate plus basis points

the company is not currently engaged in the use of any of the arrangements defined above 
impact of inflation the company believes that  due to the currently low levels of inflation  the impact of inflation and changing prices on its revenues and net earnings will not have a material effect on its manufacturing operations  because increased costs can be passed on to its customers  or on its air cargo business since the major cost components of its operations  consisting principally of fuel  crew and other direct operating costs  and certain maintenance costs are reimbursed  without markup  under current contract terms 
significant increases in inflation rates could  however  have a material impact on future revenue and operating income
