write down of other investments other investments include investments made by the company s strategic venture capital group  xr ventures  llc xrv see other investments  for additional information 
each investment represents less than percent of the ownership of the respective portfolio companies 
since the company does not exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of each portfolio company  the investments have been recorded at cost 
the company periodically evaluates the carrying value of each investment to determine whether a decline in fair value below the respective cost has occurred 
if the decline is determined to be other than temporary  the carrying value is adjusted to the then current fair value and a loss is recognized at various times in  and the company performed comprehensive assessments of the continuing value of each xr ventures investment 
based on the continued erosion of the venture capital markets  the technology sectors of the economy and specific reviews of its portfolio  the company concluded that the value of its investments had been permanently impaired 
therefore the company recorded charges of  and million in march  june and december of  respectively  for a total of million for the year 
the company recorded charges of and million in june and december  respectively  for a combined total of million for the year 
in december  the company recorded impairment charges of million 
at january   all venture capital investments have been fully impaired 
although the company continues to hold positions in several xr ventures portfolio companies  no future investments in the remaining portfolio companies will be made  except where necessary to protect any existing investments 
in and  the company concluded that it may not be able to realize certain capital losses it incurred prior to their expiration related to these impairments 
therefore it did not record a tax benefit at that time 
in  the company re evaluated this position and concluded that the execution of certain qualified tax strategies which the company was capable of completing  would allow for the realization of capital gains within the expiration period 
accordingly  a tax benefit of million was recorded in the fourth quarter of related to the prior year s impairments 
income taxes the company recorded a tax benefit of million in against pre tax income of million 
this benefit reflects the reversal of million in deferred tax valuation reserves established in and the first three quarters of these valuation reserves were originally recorded in connection with the write downs of the xrv investment portfolio in and at that time  the company was not assured that these write downs would be fully deductible capital losses and a valuation allowance was established

exclusive of the valuation allowance reversal  the company s effective tax rate would have been percent compared to the us statutory rate of percent

cumulative effect of change in accounting principle effective december   the company adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets

requires companies to discontinue amortizing goodwill and certain intangible assets with an indefinite life 
instead  companies are required to review goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite useful life for impairment annually and as indicators of impairment occur 
as discussed further in note to the consolidated financial statements  during  the company completed steps one and two of the transitional testing required by sfas no 
 as well as  the annual impairment testing requirement 
step two testing was completed with the assistance of an independent valuation firm during the fourth quarter of under sfas no  goodwill impairment exists if the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value 
the company evaluated goodwill using three reporting units  labsphere and optronik combined  coherix  and x rite mediterranee 
upon completion of the step two transitional testing for the labsphere and optronik combined reporting unit  it was determined that an impairment of goodwill had occurred 
therefore  a non cash charge of million  or cents per share  was recorded and classified as a cumulative change in accounting principle as required by sfas no 
in the first quarter of the decline in fair value of the labsphere and optronik reporting unit was primarily attributable to a decline in revenue and profitability for the unit 
this decline led to a reduction in the three to five year projection of operating earnings for the unit 
the fair value of the remaining units exceeded their net book value  therefore  no impairment charges were recorded for these units 
in calculating the impairment charge  the fair value of the reporting unit was determined by using a discounted cash flow analysis 
this methodology was selected over the market value approach  due to a lack of comparable competitor data availability  which is necessary to complete a market value study

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states requires management to adopt accounting policies and make significant judgments and estimates to develop amounts reflected and disclosed in the financial statements 
in some instances there may be alternative policies or estimation techniques that could be used 
management maintains a thorough process to review the application of accounting policies and to evaluate the appropriateness of the many estimates that are required to prepare the financial statements 
however  even under optimal circumstances  estimates routinely require adjustment based on changing circumstances and the receipt of new or better information 
the policies and estimates discussed below include the financial statement elements that are either the most judgmental or involve the selection or application of alternative accounting policies and are material to the financial statements 
management has discussed the development and selection of these accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors 
accounts receivable allowances accounts receivable allowances are based on known customer exposures  historic credit experience  and the specific identification of potentially uncollectible accounts 
in addition to known or judgmental components  a policy that consistently applies reserve rates based on the age of outstanding accounts receivable is followed 
actual collections may differ requiring adjustments to the reserves 
inventory reserves inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
reserves are established for excess and obsolete inventory  based on material movement and a component of judgment for current events such as market conditions or technological advancement 
the amount of reserve required may be adjusted as these underlying factors change 
self insurance reserves the company is self insured up to certain limits for costs associated with benefits paid under employee health care programs 
the measurement of these costs requires the consideration of historic loss experience and judgments about the present and expected levels of costs per claim 
these costs are accounted by developing estimates of the undiscounted liability for claims incurred  including those claims incurred but not reported 
this method provides estimates of future ultimate claim costs based on claims incurred as of the balance sheet date 
long lived assets evaluations are periodically made of long lived assets and the company s venture capital investments for indicators of impairment when events or circumstances indicate that this risk may be present 
judgments regarding the existence of impairment are based on several factors including but not limited to  market conditions  operational performance  technological advancements and estimated future cash flows 
if the carrying value of a long lived asset is considered impaired  an impairment charge is recorded to adjust the asset to its fair value 
goodwill the company has million of goodwill recorded as of january   related to prior acquisitions 
accounting standards adopted in require that goodwill must be reviewed for impairment at least annually and as indicators of impairment occur  and the cessation of amortization 
the annual evaluation of goodwill impairment requires the use of estimates about the future cash flows of each reporting unit to determine estimated fair values 
changes in forecasted operations and changes in discount rates can materially affect these estimates 
however  once an impairment of goodwill has been recorded it cannot be reversed
