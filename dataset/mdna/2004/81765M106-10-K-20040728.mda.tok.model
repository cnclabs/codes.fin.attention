effects of inflation on revenues and operating profits the effects of inflation upon the company s operating results are varied 
inflation in recent years has been modest and has had minimal effect on the company 
the energy and facilities solutions segment generally has contracts that are renewed on an annual basis 
at the time of renewal  contract fees may be adjusted  subject to customer approval 
as inflation impacts the company s costs  primarily labor  the company could seek a price increase for its contracts in order to protect its profit margin 
the energy services segment typically engages in contracts of short duration with fixed prices  which normally will minimize any erosion of its profit margin due to inflation 
as inflation impacts the company s costs  primarily labor and materials  the company could seek a price increase for subsequent contracts to protect its profit margin 
in the real estate segment  many of the anchor tenant leases are long term original terms over years with fixed rents  except for some leases with contingent rent provisions by which the company may earn additional rent as a result of increases in tenants sales over specified targets 
in many cases  however  the contingent rent provisions permit the anchor tenant to offset against contingent rents any increases in ad valorem taxes over a specified amount 
if inflation were to rise  ad valorem taxes would probably increase as well  which  in turn  could cause a decrease in the contingent rents 
furthermore  the company has certain repair obligations  and the costs of repairs generally increase with inflation 
inflation causes interest rates to rise  which has a positive effect on investment income  but could have a negative effect on profit margins  because of the increased costs of contracts and the increase in interest expense on variable rate loans 
overall  inflation could tend to limit the company s markets  and in turn  could reduce revenues as well as operating profits and earnings

critical accounting policies a critical accounting policy is one which is important both to the portrayal of a company s financial position and results of operations  and requires the company to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes 
in preparing these financial statements  the company has made its best estimates and used its best judgments regarding certain amounts included in the financial statements  giving due consideration to materiality 
the application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and the use of assumptions regarding future uncertainties  and as a result  actual results could differ from those estimates 
management believes that the company s most critical accounting policies are discussed and described in note to the consolidated financial statements  and include revenue recognition energy and facilities solutions revenues primarily consist of services and product sales 
revenues are recognized as services are rendered  and depending upon the product type and customer agreement  product sales are recognized when products are shipped or delivered 
energy services and construction revenues are reported on the percentage of completion method  using costs incurred to date in relation to estimated total costs of the contracts  to measure the stage of completion 
original contract prices are adjusted for change orders in the amounts that are reasonably estimated based on the company s historical experience 
the cumulative effects of changes in estimated total contract costs and revenues change orders are recorded in the period in which the facts requiring such revisions become known  and are accounted for using the percentage of completion method 
at the time it is determined that a contract is expected to result in a loss  the entire estimated loss is recorded 
the company leases space in its income producing properties to tenants  and recognizes minimum base rentals as revenue on a straight line basis over the lease terms 
tenants may also be required to pay additional rental amounts based on property operating expenses 
in addition  certain tenants are required to pay incremental rental amounts  which are contingent on their store sales 
these percentage rents are recognized only if and when earned 
revenue from the sale of real estate is recognized when all of the following has occurred a the property is transferred to the buyer  b the buyer s initial and continuing investment is adequate to demonstrate a commitment to pay for the property  and c the buyer has assumed all future ownership risks of the property 
costs of sales of real estate are based on the specific property sold 
when a portion or unit of a development property is sold  a proportionate share of the total cost of the development is charged to cost of sales 
income producing properties and property and equipment income producing properties are stated at cost  and are depreciated for financial reporting purposes using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
property and equipment are recorded at cost  and are depreciated for financial reporting purposes using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets

interest and other carrying costs related to real estate assets under construction are capitalized 
other costs of development and construction of real estate assets are also capitalized 
capitalization of interest and other carrying costs are discontinued when a project is substantially completed or if active development ceases 
impairment of long lived assets  including goodwill  and assets to be disposed of long lived assets and certain intangible assets  including goodwill  are required to be reviewed for impairment on an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if an asset is determined to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the asset s estimated fair value 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of their carrying amount or estimated fair value less costs to sell

table of contents income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method
