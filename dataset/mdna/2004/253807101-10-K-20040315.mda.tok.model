item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements relating to future events or the future financial performance of digimarc  which involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including those set forth under risks related to our business and risks related to our market under item above and elsewhere in the annual report on form k 
we assume no obligation to update this information 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere herein 
overview we believe we are one of the leading suppliers of secure personal identification systems 
we supply the issuance systems for the majority of driver licenses produced in the united states us and provide all or part of the issuance systems for national identifications  voter identifications  and driver licenses in more than international programs 
we estimate that our next closest competitor with regard to driver license issuance systems holds contracts with approximately driver license issuing authorities in the united states as of december  we are developing and marketing enhanced security for personal identification documents enabled by our proprietary digital watermarking technology 
we also believe we are one of the leading providers of patented digital watermarking technologies that allow imperceptible digital codes to be embedded in all forms of media content  including personal identification documents  financial instruments  photographs  movies  music  and product packages 
the embedded codes within various types of media content can be detected and read by software or hardware detectors in personal computers and other digital processing devices 
we provide solutions based on this technology directly and through our licensees 
we believe we have the broadest intellectual property patent portfolio and commercial deployment of watermarking based applications amongst entities of which we are aware  including use of such intellectual property by more than four thousand enterprises and individuals 
our principal administrative  sales  marketing  support  research  development and engineering facility is currently located in tualatin  oregon 
our personal identification systems business is headquartered in burlington  massachusetts  with additional space in fort wayne  indiana for certain administrative and customer support functions 
the majority of our revenue comes from multi year contracts with government agencies  including us state departments of motor vehicles and central banks 
we intend to increase our revenue through increasing adoption of our products and services  marketing new digital watermarking applications  and licensing our intellectual property 
we expect to target  among other sources of revenue  government agencies  commercial printers  packaging companies  publishers  advertisers  proprietors of large image collections  and other producers of printed materials 
our aim is to license our technologies to those content producers so that they may embed our digital watermarks in their printed media  such as identification documents  magazine advertisements and articles  direct mail coupons  catalogs  stationery and envelopes  product packaging  labels and tags  trading cards  credit cards  and business cards 
our current and anticipated products are intended to enable content producers to control reproduction and alteration of their content  as well as to enable their printed materials to provide a link to relevant network services 
revenue from our new applications may include one time license fees  time based or volume based fees  subscription fees  royalties and revenue sharing arrangements 
we anticipate that the calculation of revenue and royalties for these new applications will be based at least in part on the size of the installed base of personal computers  cameras  scanners  digital image capture and output devices  and software carrying our patented reader technology  as well as the nature of the use of  and the nature and amount of licensed content carrying  our digital watermarks 
since inception  we have invested a significant portion of our resources and capital in attracting top senior management  in developing our products and technology  and in building our sales and marketing organizations 
we incurred significant losses from inception through the fiscal year ended december   and as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we intend to continue to expend significant financial and management resources on developing additional products and services  improving sales and marketing activities  advancing our technologies and expanding our operations 
our revenue may not increase or even continue at its current levels and we may not maintain profitability or generate cash from operations in future periods 
our prospects must be considered in light of the risks  expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies with early stage technologies and applications 
major  new contracts in the id systems business during  our id systems business performed well in many respects 
although revenue was flat due to the fact that we are in the pre revenue recognition phases of a number of major contracts  gross margins improved significantly  from to 
the lack of overall growth was due to our inability to book any large international deals  including a voter identification project that slipped into in the domestic market  we competed effectively  gaining extensions and upgrades from a number of customers 
florida awarded its digital driver license contract to us in july 
we expect the system to begin to generate revenue in the second half of and reach full deployment in early we also won a competitive bid in alabama  which had previously been a self issue state in foreign markets  we ended the year with a major contract win in mexico 
the instituto federal electoral ife of mexico awarded digimarc a four year contract to supply voter identification cards that we anticipate will generate more than million in revenue 
implementation is underway and the first cards are expected to be produced prior to mid year digital watermarking strategy on track  new and enhanced products developed our digital watermarking business consists of two prongs digital watermarking solutions that we provide directly to customers  and intellectual property licensing that enables other companies to provide watermarking solutions to their customers while paying patent license fees to digimarc 
the current digimarc solutions business consists of an anti counterfeiting system that we have developed with a consortium of central banks  which has  and continues to  account for a substantial majority of our digital watermarking revenue  and imagebridge  an image asset management and tracking application 
idmarc is the latest addition to our digital watermarking mix 
digital watermarking revenue was down approximately million compared to the prior year 
this decrease was due to lower revenue from our central bank customers for work on the banknote anti counterfeiting system 
the decline in revenue reflected completion of certain development activities that were not completely offset by increasing deployment support requirements 
we expect banknote anti counterfeiting system revenue for to be higher than and levels 
our imagebridge product for copyright communication and tracking monitoring of digital image assets is a healthy part of our business 
revenue has grown every year since margins are high  in the range typically reported for software products 
the primary driver of growth was increased enterprise sales 
the market development strategy for idmarc is to provide the feature to large systems integrators at a nominal price 
our intent is to minimize barriers to adoption and encourage broad based deployment of the technology  then monetize the embedded feature in a variety of aftermarket applications  including border crossing identity verification  law enforcement  airport security  and point of sale document authentication applications 
after successfully proving the model in driver licenses  we intend to license similar embedding and reading applications in the broader secure personal identification document market 
we expect to grow from modest revenue in to significant contributions within the next years 
encouraging signs of industry wide adoption of digital watermarking in entertainment licensing of our digital watermarking patents is a critical element of our long term shareholder value proposition 
the greatest near term interest in digital watermarking is in the entertainment field 
digital watermarking is increasingly being employed for tracking and monitoring of music  movies  and television programs 
the majority of the major music labels are using digital watermarking solutions for forensic tracking of pre release music 
they are obtaining the tracking solutions directly from digimarc and from our licensees 
motion picture studios have begun following suit  using forensic tracking based on digital watermarking as part of increased piracy deterrence measures in the academy award screener program 
in the television business  three companies have licensed our patents and deployed monitoring systems to track radio and television programs and advertisements in major media markets around the world 
renewed interest in print to internet applications  fueled by innovation in mobile imaging certain other market developments are encouraging for our strategy as well 
the influx of imaging in mobile devices mainly cell phones and pdas is inspiring a renewed interest in digital watermarking as a means of linking printed materials to internet services that we launched in we believe that a highly supportive change in market dynamics is underway 
a number of companies  ranging from start ups to industry leaders like intel  microsoft  and ntt have announced initiatives aimed at using various signaling means  including bar codes  rfid  and digital watermarking to simplify the user interface for mobile device access to internet services 
looking ahead continued profitability  focus on growth for the past two years we focused on the bottom line 
these efforts were successful in leading us to profitability 
we are shifting focus to growing the top line while continuing diligent cost management 
we see many signs that our basic business strategy is working 
in  we anticipate continuing improvement in our financial performance and looks strong as well  with the contract for the florida driver license system beginning to generate revenue in the second half of and reaching full deployment in early in addition  the ife program in mexico will be fully operational in in our digital watermarking business  we believe there will be increasing in industry acceptance of our solutions and those of our partners will flourish  which in turn will have a positive impact on digimarc s licensing and solutions business 
our financial performance reflects the interplay of early adoption of our technology of digital watermarking and steady progress that our id systems business continues to make 
we expect even greater improvements in financial performance in and as the trends in all of our markets are encouraging  giving rise to many opportunities to accelerate growth and continue to grow profits 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  income taxes  restructuring  long term service contracts  warranties  investments  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
certain of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application 
these include revenue recognition on long term service contracts  impairments and estimation of useful lives of long lived assets  inventory valuation  and reserves for uncollectible accounts receivable 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition on long term service contracts we recognize revenue and profit as work progresses on long term  fixed price service contracts other than our long term identification and driver license production contracts using the percentage of completion method  which relies on estimates of total expected contract revenue and costs 
we follow the percentage of completion method since reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and costs applicable to various stages of a contract can be made 
revenue is recognized based on the percentage of completion of the contract using budgeted amounts established with the customer at the inception of the contract 
progress towards completion is measured using allowable costs incurred as compared to the budgeted amounts contained in the contract 
recognized revenue and profit are subject to revisions as the contract progresses to completion 
revisions in profit estimates are charged to income in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
any estimation process  including that used in preparing contract accounting models  involves inherent risk 
we reduce the inherent risk relating to revenue and cost estimates in percentage of completion models through our contract approval and budget monitoring processes 
our estimates of revenue and costs on customer contracts change periodically in the normal course of business  occasionally due to modifications of our contractual arrangements 
we recognize revenue on long term identification and driver license production contracts using a price per card method 
we use actual monthly volume amounts  if available  or we estimate the card production volume on a monthly basis for certain of these contracts in order to recognize revenue earned during the period 
in the case of estimates  when the actual production information becomes available  which is typically within four weeks  we bill the customer accordingly and any differences from the estimates are recognized in the month the billing occurs 
these amounts represent our best estimates of cards produced and are based on historical trends  known events during the period  and discussions with contract representatives 
the price per card is known  therefore  these estimates represent the best available information regarding revenue earned during that specific period 
revisions to our estimates have been less than of total revenue in every period reported of and since the acquisition of certain assets and the assumption of certain liabilities from polaroid corporation and its affiliates 
if our estimates of monthly volumes were too high by  there would be no significant impact on the reported revenue recognized because we verify almost all estimated volumes against reported actual volumes prior to disclosing our financial results 
if the differences are material  we adjust our estimates to actual to reflect the difference  thus leaving little or no estimated volumes reflected in our reported results 
the estimated amounts are recorded as unbilled receivables on the balance sheet until the actual production information is available and the billing occurs 
any estimation process involves inherent risk 
we reduce the inherent risk relating to production estimation through our approval and monitoring processes related to accounting estimates 
impairments and estimation of useful lives of long lived assets we periodically review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
we account for long lived assets in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement requires that long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
fair value is determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values  depending on the nature of the asset 
if our estimates of projected future cash flows were too high by  there would be no material impact on the reported value of intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheet 
also  we periodically review the useful lives of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the useful life may have changed 
if the estimated useful lives of such assets do change  we adjust the depreciation or amortization period to a shorter or longer period  based on the circumstances identified 
inventory valuation inventory consists of consumable supplies that are used in the production of driver licenses and products held for resale to customers 
we value inventory at the lower of cost or market value which lower amount is the net realizable value 
we reduce the value of our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
reserves for uncollectible accounts receivable we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we determine the allowance based on historical write off experience and current information 
we review our allowance for doubtful accounts monthly 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
if our estimate of uncollectible accounts were too low by  the difference to the reported earnings would be less than of reported net income 
results of operations the following table presents our consolidated statement of operations data for the periods indicated as a percentage of total revenue 
year ended december  revenue service product and subscription total revenue cost of revenue service product and subscription total cost of revenue gross profit operating expenses sales and marketing research  development and engineering general and administrative restructuring charges  net total operating expenses operating income loss other income expense interest income interest expense other total other income  net income loss before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net income loss years ended december  and revenue for was slightly down from the prior year 
this resulted from a million decrease in watermarking revenue  going from million in to million in  offset by an increase of million in id systems revenue  going from million in to million in within the id business  revenue related to issuances of driver licensees increased  while revenue related to product sales decreased because of an unusually large order received in the third quarter of operating expenses in total decreased by million or for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the overall decrease came as a result of several factors 
one such factor is the lowered cost structure we achieved through restructuring actions taken in a second factor is our focus on responsibly investing in our personnel 
while we have fewer full time employees at the end of compared to  we have more contractors 
we intend to manage our labor costs responsibly through our contractor resources as we incur new projects and programs that need additional resources 
a third factor is our overall focus on spending controls within the company 
for example  we have reduced travel and entertainment spending throughout the company by approximately million and software and hardware expensed items by approximately million 
in addition  we reduced expenses by shutting down facilities for two weeks at the end of the year  operating with only critical employees for that period of time 
by focusing on controlling our spending rate we have been able to reduce our overall spending significantly 
our net income improved by million  from a loss of million in to income of million in despite the slight decrease in revenue 
the improvement came as a result of our cost controls and reduced cost structure experienced during revenue total revenue was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the million or decrease in total revenue resulted from an increase in our overall services revenue related to higher average price per card fees that we collect offset by a greater decrease in our product and subscription revenue due to an unusually large order shipped in the third quarter of in non us markets  where we provide driver licenses  national identification  and voter identification systems  services  and components in partnership with local card producers  security printers  system integrators  and others  we may serve as prime contractor or sub contractor  depending on the circumstances 
as a sub contractor  we are responsible for delivering hardware  software  or consumables to the prime contractor and  as a prime contractor  we are responsible for integrating the components of the system to the customer s specifications 
in non us markets  revenue from international customers was million and million for and  respectively 
international sales for us have typically taken the form of an outright sale of equipment and or consumables to non us government agencies or their prime contractors 
these sales often can be large  one time events 
due to the nature of the international customers  the timing of these sales is somewhat less predictable than in the context of service revenues provided to us by domestic customers and  consequently  international sales can occur unevenly during the course of a year 
we believe that international growth opportunities exist for us and we expect to continue to invest in personnel and resources to support our potential revenue growth outside of the united states 
we had no customer that accounted for more than of our revenue in or service 
service revenue consists primarily of card production on a price per card basis and software development services 
these arrangements are typically structured as price per card product agreements  time and materials consulting agreements  or fixed price consulting agreements 
service revenue is an umbrella category consisting of both service revenue and contract based service revenue 
the distinction between these two subcategories is that service revenue is generated from long term identification and driver license production contracts  while contract based service revenue is generated from other long term  time and materials service contracts 
service revenue was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the million or increase was primarily the result of higher average price per card payments that we receive from our customers 
the higher prices came as a result of several factors  including security upgrades for existing programs  new programs starting that are generally higher in price due to the features requested and level of security included  and existing contracts that have price increases built into the agreement 
the increases in price vary from arrangement to arrangement 
the volumes remained relatively consistent from year to year 
revenue from the consortium of central banks was less than for both and  and is expected to remain lower than historical levels as a percent of total revenue in the future due to the acquisition of lgp 
product and subscription 
product and subscription revenue consists primarily of the sale of equipment and consumables related to identification card production systems  software license sales  and subscriptions related to the imagebridge product 
product and subscription revenue was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the million or decrease was primarily related to an unusually large international order we received and delivered in the third quarter of in the amount of million 
we did not have a similar order in  and consequently experienced a decrease in product and subscription revenue in prices for product and subscription offerings by the company are generally consistent with prior periods 
a portion of our revenue each year is generated from the licensing of technology 
in the competitive environment in which we operate  product generation  development and marketing processes relating to technology are uncertain and complex  requiring accurate prediction of demand as well as successful management of various development risks inherent in technology development 
in light of these dependencies  it is possible that failure to successfully manage future changes in technology with respect to our technology could have a long term impact on our revenue 
cost of revenue service 
cost of service revenue primarily includes compensation for software developers  quality assurance personnel  product managers  field operations personnel  and business development personnel  outside contractors  costs of consumables used in delivering a service  depreciation charges for machinery used specifically for service delivery  and travel costs directly attributable to service and development contracts 
cost of service revenue was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the million or decrease was primarily the result of efforts made by the company to reduce the costs associated with delivering these services 
we have been active in negotiating volume discounts  decreasing storage costs  consolidating operations when necessary  managing inventory levels  improving efficiencies of field management among other actions 
field operations employees totaled and at december  and  respectively 
product and subscription 
cost of product and subscription revenue primarily includes compensation for operations personnel  costs of consumables sold to third parties  costs of machinery sold to third parties  internet service provider connectivity charges and image search data fees to support the services offered to our subscription customers 
cost of product and subscription revenue was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the million or decrease was primarily the result of the associated decrease in product and subscription revenue 
the large order mentioned above  fulfilled in the third quarter of  had very low margins 
as a result  the majority of the decrease in cost of revenue related to costs associated with the million of revenue recognized in operating expenses sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of compensation  benefits and related costs of sales and marketing personnel  product managers and sales engineers  as well as recruiting  travel  market research  and costs associated with marketing programs  such as trade shows  public relations and new product launches 
sales and marketing expenses were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the overall decrease in sales and marketing expenses of million or resulted from managing costs effectively within the group 
we have reduced many of the overhead and variable costs within sales and marketing by improving our purchasing process  identifying improved or alternative options  and consciously making strategic spending decisions 
specifically  the decrease resulted from decreased salaries and other employee related costs of approximately million due to lower headcount  decreased administrative costs of approximately million related to sales and marketing activities  decreased spending for marketing materials and promotional activities of million  and decreased use of outside consulting services of million  and a decrease of approximately million in deferred stock compensation related to sales and marketing personnel  partially offset by increased costs of million due to the decreased use of sales and marketing personnel to provide services for our revenue generating contracts that would have been included in cost of service revenue 
sales and marketing employees totaled and as of december  and  respectively 
we anticipate that we will continue to invest at or slightly above the current run rate in sales and marketing for the foreseeable future 
research  development and engineering 
research  development and engineering expenses consist primarily of compensation  benefits and related costs of software developers and quality assurance personnel and payments to outside contractors 
research  development and engineering expenses were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the overall decrease in research  development and engineering expenses of million or resulted from the general shift we are making as a company from a research  development  and engineering dominated company to a sales and marketing organization  in addition to a focus on managing discretionary spending appropriately 
the shift is evidenced by the decrease of employees within this group 
the net decrease in spending was also attributed to cost control measures taken by us during the year  such as restructuring the business  consolidating operations  centralizing certain services  and standardizing products 
the decrease resulted from decreased salaries and other employee related costs of million  decreased costs related to outside consultants of approximately million associated mainly with decreased use of contractors  decreased administrative costs of million associated with research  development and engineering activities  and a decrease of approximately million of deferred stock compensation charges related to research  development  and engineering personnel  partially offset by million related to decreased use of research  development and engineering personnel to provide services for our revenue generating contracts and to develop internal use software 
research  development and engineering personnel totaled and as of december  and  respectively 
we anticipate that we will continue to invest at the current run rate in product research  development and engineering for the foreseeable future 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation  benefits and related costs of executive  finance and administrative personnel  facilities costs  legal and other professional fees  and depreciation and amortization expense 
general and administrative expenses were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the overall increase in general and administrative expenses of million or was relatively flat from year to year 
specifically  the increase resulted from increased costs of million related to administrative costs  which includes depreciation and amortization  and million related to increased use of general and administrative personnel to provide services for other groups within the company  partially offset by a decrease of million related to salaries and other employee related costs  including travel expenses  decreased spending on consulting and professional fees of million  and a decrease of approximately million of deferred stock compensation charges related to general and administrative personnel 
general and administrative employees totaled and as of december  and  respectively 
expense has been incurred  and will continue to be incurred  with respect to the implementation of the requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of  in particular  with respect to section requiring management to report on  and the independent auditors to attest to  internal controls 
we anticipate that we will continue to invest at or slightly above the current run rate in general and administrative costs for the foreseeable future 
stock based compensation 
stock based compensation expense includes costs relating to stock based employee compensation arrangements 
stock based compensation expense is based on the difference between the fair market value of our common stock and the exercise price of options to purchase that stock on the date of grant  and is being recognized over the vesting periods of the related options  usually four years 
stock based compensation expense of million and million was recorded for the years ended december  and  respectively  and is included in the respective statements of operations expense categories for the employees to which it applies 
at december   no stock based compensation remains deferred 
total other income expense  net 
other income expense  net consists primarily of interest received and paid 
other income expense was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the million or decrease came as a result of lower average cash balances and interest rates during the majority of fiscal provision for income taxes 
due to the company s domestic losses before the provision for income taxes for the years ended december  and  there has been no provision for federal  foreign  or state taxes 
however  for the year ended december   the company was profitable in some foreign jurisdictions 
therefore  during we provided for income taxes expected to be paid on our international operations 
as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state income tax reporting purposes of approximately million and research and experimentation credits of approximately million  which expire through if not utilized 
under the tax reform act of  the amounts of and benefits from net operating loss carryforwards may be impaired or limited in certain circumstances  including a change of more than in ownership 
such a change in ownership occurred with the sales of preferred stock in june  july  and july and in connection with the initial public offering of our common stock in december accordingly  we estimate that approximately million of net operating loss carryforwards are subject to the utilization limitation 
years ended december  and revenue total revenue was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the million or increase in total revenue resulted from the inclusion of a full year of activity for the acquired personal identification systems business the lgp acquisition  which increased revenue by million 
revenue from international customers was million and million for and  respectively 
the consortium of central banks accounted for less than and approximately of our total revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively 
revenue from the consortium of central banks is expected to remain lower than historical levels as a percent of total revenue in the future due to the acquisition of lgp 
service

these restrictions lapse within one year of the balance sheet date  and therefore are classified as a current asset 
working capital at december  was million  compared to working capital of million at december  the majority of the increase in cash and working capital relates to the private placement of common stock and warrants that we consummated in august of  in which we raised approximately million net of expenses 
the million of cash provided by operations for the year ended december  resulted from net income of million which includes non cash items related to depreciation  amortization  and stock based compensation of million  along with a decrease of million of restricted cash as the company renegotiated the terms of its performance bonds during the year  and million related to decreased accounts receivable 
cash provided by operations was negatively impacted by a decrease in accounts payable of million 
the million of cash used in operations for the year ended december  was negatively impacted by a net loss of million and an increase in restricted cash of million 
cash used in operations for the year ended december  was positively impacted by depreciation and amortization of million  an increase in accounts payable of million  an increase in deferred revenue of million  non cash charges related to stock based compensation of million  and a decrease in inventory of million 
the million of cash used in investing activities primarily related to million in net purchases of short term investments  million for the purchase of property and equipment  and million related to the capitalization of software development costs 
we also acquired approximately million of fixed assets during through capital lease arrangements 
the million of cash provided by investing activities for the year ended december  primarily related to the net sale or maturity of million in short term investments offset by million of capitalized software development costs and the addition of million of property and equipment additions 
the million of cash provided by financing activities resulted primarily from the sale of common stock 
in august we sold  units  each of which consisted of one share of common stock and a warrant to purchase of a share of common stock  to sixteen institutional and accredited investors  in a private placement transaction that resulted in million of net proceeds to the company and million related to the issuance of common stock through the employee stock option and employee stock purchase plans 
the million of cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  primarily related to the issuance of stock for million related to the employee stock option and employee stock purchase plans  and offset by million of principal payments under capital leases 
our significant commitments consist of obligations under non cancelable operating leases  which totaled million as of december   and are payable in monthly installments through october our obligations under non cancelable capital leases  which totaled million as of december   are payable in monthly installments through we are contractually obligated to make the following payments as of december  payment due by period total less than year years years more than years capital leases   operating leases      total contractual obligations     our planned operating expenses and capital expenditures may constitute a material use of our cash resources 
in addition  we may utilize cash resources to fund acquisitions or investments in complementary businesses  technologies or product lines 
we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents  and short term investment balances will satisfy our projected working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next months 
thereafter  we anticipate continuing to use cash  cash equivalents  and short term investment balances to satisfy our projected working capital and capital expenditure requirements 
however  because of our concern that currently weak economic conditions may continue through  if not longer  we have taken and continue to take steps to limit our expenses and align our cost structure to our revenues 
these steps include  among other things  considering and or taking steps  as needed  to restructure our business  consolidating our operations  negotiating volume pricing with vendors  centralizing certain services  and standardizing products 
we recognize that our operating expense levels  including research  development  engineering  selling  marketing  general and administrative expenses  depend on anticipated business activity levels 
while research  development  engineering and marketing expenses are based on anticipated investment levels in technology development  product development and market development activities  the appropriate expense levels in selling  general and administrative expenses are dependant on the level of infrastructure required to support our anticipated business volume 
we review our business plans periodically to determine the appropriate level of such expenses based on various business factors 
in the past we have taken appropriate measures to control our expenses based on business circumstances 
in the future we will continue to review our business plans from time to time and make appropriate changes to our expense levels  as we have in the past  to reduce operating expenses where it is advantageous to do so to improve operational efficiencies 
in order to take advantage of opportunities  we may find it necessary to obtain additional equity financing  debt financing  or credit facilities although we do not believe at this time that our long term working capital and capital expenditures will be of such a nature that we would be required to take steps presently to remedy any such potential deficiency 
if it were necessary to obtain additional financings or credit facilities  we may not be able to do so  or if these funds are available  they may not be available on satisfactory terms 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements  as such term is defined in recently enacted rules by the securities and exchange commission  that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenue or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
revised december fin r  consolidation of variable interest entities  which addresses how a business enterprise should evaluate whether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity through means other than voting rights and accordingly should consolidate the entity 
fin r replaces fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  which was issued in january we will be required to apply fin r to variable interests in variable interest entities vies created after december  for variable interests in vies created before january   fin r will be applied beginning on january  for any vies that must be consolidated under fin r that were created before january   the assets  liabilities  and non controlling interests of the vies initially would be measured at their carrying amounts with any difference between the net amount added to the balance sheet and any previously recognized interest being recognized as the cumulative effect of an accounting change 
if determining the carrying amounts is not practicable  fair value at the date fin r first applies may be used to measure the assets  liabilities  and non controlling interest of the vies 
we do not currently have any variable interests in vies  and do not expect the application of fin r to have a material impact on us 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the increase or decrease in the amount of interest income we can earn on our investment portfolio and on the increase or decrease in the amount of any interest expense we must pay with respect to outstanding debt instruments 
the risk associated with fluctuating interest expense is limited  however  to the exposure related to those debt instruments and credit facilities that are tied to market rates

the original maturities of our investment portfolio range from to days with an average interest rate of 
we had capital lease obligations of approximately million at december  if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from levels as of december   the decline of the fair market value of the fixed income portfolio and loans outstanding would not be material
