table of contents impact of inflation the impact of inflation on food  labor  energy and occupancy costs can significantly affect our operations 
many of our employees are paid hourly rates related to federal and state minimum wage laws

seasonality and adverse weather our results of operations have historically been impacted by seasonality  which directly impacts tourism at our coastal locations 
the summer months june through august have traditionally been higher volume periods than other periods of the year 
critical accounting policies we believe the following areas comprise our critical accounting policies accounting for property and equipment and accounting for deferred taxes 
property and equipment accounting requires estimates of the useful lives for the assets for depreciation purposes and selection of depreciation methods 
we believe the useful lives reflect the actual economic life of the underlying assets 
we have elected to use the straight line method of depreciation for financial statement purposes 
renewals and betterments that materially extend the useful life of an asset are capitalized while maintenance and repair costs are charged to operations as incurred 
judgment is often required in the decision to distinguish between an asset which qualifies for capitalization versus an expenditure which is for maintenance and repairs 
we review property and equipment which includes leasehold improvements and intangible assets with finite lives for impairment when events or circumstances indicate these assets might be impaired 
we test impairment using historical cash flows and other relevant facts and circumstances as the primary basis for our estimates of future cash flows 
the analysis is performed at the restaurant level for indicators of impairment 
this process requires the use of estimates and assumptions  which are subject to a high degree of judgment 
if these assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
deferred tax accounting requires that we evaluate net deferred tax assets to determine if these assets will more likely than not be realized in the foreseeable future 
this test requires projection of our taxable income into future years to determine if there will be income sufficient to realize the tax assets future tax deductions and fica tax credit carryforwards 
the preparation of the projections requires considerable judgment and is subject to change to reflect future events and changes in the tax laws 
our net deferred tax asset at december  totaled million

 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas 
sfas provides a model for accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  whereby such costs are initially recognized and measured at fair value in the period in which they are incurred 
under sfas  in many cases  costs will be recognized as liabilities in periods following a commitment to a plan  not at the date of commitment 
sfas is effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  the adoption of sfas did not impact our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows for the year ended december  in december  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure sfas

table of contents accounting policy with respect to stock based employee compensation on reported net income 
sfas does not amend sfas to require companies to account for their employee stock based awards using the fair value method 
however  the disclosure provisions are required for all companies with stock based employee compensation  regardless of whether they utilize the fair value method or the intrinsic value method of accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas s amendment of the transition and annual disclosure provisions of sfas are effective for fiscal years ending after december  we adopted the disclosure provisions of sfas in fiscal year this adoption did not impact our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows for the year ended december in january  the fasb issued interpretation no
