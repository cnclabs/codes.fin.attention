item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations reference is made throughout this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations to footnotes included in notes to consolidated financial statements  which begin on page f of this report 
overview of results of operations and liquidity the company develops and manufactures a broad range of products that are sold worldwide 
the company expands the product lines and services it offers by developing and commercializing its own core technologies and by making strategic acquisitions of complementary businesses 
during and  the company carried out the principal aspects of a major reorganization plan under which it sold or spun off many noncore businesses 
as a result of these actions  the company s continuing operations are comprised solely of its instrument businesses 
the businesses that have been spun off and sold have been presented as discontinued operations in the accompanying financial statements 
the company s continuing operations fall into three principal business segments life and laboratory sciences  measurement and control  and optical technologies 
the company has historically moved a business unit between segments when a shift in strategic focus of either the business unit or a segment more closely aligns the business unit with a segment different than that in which it had previously been reported 
revenues dollars in thousands life and laboratory sciences   measurement and control   optical technologies   intersegment   the company s revenues grew nominally in the strengthening of non us currencies relative to the dollar caused an increase in reported revenues  offset by lower demand in several businesses in the company s measurement and control and optical technologies segments 
in addition to the change in revenues caused by currency translation and divestitures  net of acquisitions  which are discussed below  sales decreased in  primarily due to lower demand 
the company also reported this same percentage revenue decrease in compared with the most recent year in which the company reported positive comparative sales growth was compared with the trend of lower sales has resulted primarily from a slowdown in the worldwide economy that has adversely affected capital spending across most markets addressed by the company 
fourth quarter results suggest the trend of lower sales is reversing 
for example  the life and laboratory sciences segment reported higher fourth quarter sales over the year ago quarter  while the optical technologies segment had sequential sales growth over the third quarter and increased its backlog in the quarter 
the measurement and control segment increased its backlog at year end by over that of a year ago 
the company s strategy over time is to augment internal growth at existing businesses with complementary acquisitions such as those completed in these acquisitions included jouan sa  a manufacturer of products used to prepare and preserve laboratory samples  which was acquired on december   laboratory management services  inc  a supplier of regulatory instrument and consulting services to the pharmaceutical and related industries  and the personal radiation detection instruments product line from siemens plc 
in  the company s operating income and operating income margin improved to million and  respectively  from million and  respectively  in operating income margin is operating income divided by revenues 
during the economic slowdown  the company undertook actions to reduce its cost structure and promote operating efficiency  principally through consolidating real estate locations and reducing related headcount 
the annualized cost savings of actions initiated in and total approximately million 
as these actions were taken during periods of declining revenues  the corresponding income benefit was offset in part by the effect on income of lower sales 
restructuring and other costs  net  reduced pre tax income by million and million in and  respectively 
income from continuing operations declined to million in  from million in the decrease resulted primarily from an million pre tax decrease in gains on sale of investments in the company had a large equity interest in flir systems  inc resulting from shares acquired as part of an acquisition completed in the company sold shares of flir and had significant gains in and  to a lesser extent  in as of the end of  the company no longer owned shares of flir 
the investment gains also included gains from the sale of shares of thoratec corporation 
as of the end of  the company owned million shares of thoratec with a fair market value of million 
the company obtained the shares of thoratec in as consideration for a divestiture 
the company has reduced its effective tax rate over the past two years 
in  the tax rate was  which included some benefits discussed below that the company does not expect to have in several initiatives  however  will continue to provide a benefit in the future  principally a reorganization of the company s non us subsidiary structure that has resulted in a more tax efficient corporate structure 
the company expects its effective tax rate in will be approximately 
during  the company s cash flow from operations totaled million  compared with million in in  cash of million was used to reduce other current liabilities  including tax payments on investment gains 
in  a decrease in other current liabilities used cash of million  resulting in a year over year difference of million 
in addition  decreases in accounts receivable and inventories in generated million more cash than did decreases in these accounts in during  the company used cash of million for financing activities  principally the repayment of short term debt as well as the early redemption of long term obligations with the objective of reducing interest costs 
as of year end  the company s outstanding debt totaled million  of which is due in and thereafter 
the company expects that its existing cash and investments of million as of december   and its future cash flow from operations together with available unsecured borrowings of up to million under its revolving credit agreements are sufficient to meet the capital requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable future  including at least the next months 
critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based upon its financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  warranty obligations  income taxes  pension costs  contingencies and litigation  restructuring  and sale of businesses 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience  current market and economic conditions  and other assumptions that management believes are reasonable 
the results of these estimates form the basis for judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities where the values are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following represent its critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of its financial statements a the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to pay amounts due 
such allowances totaled million at december  the company estimates the amount of customer receivables that are uncollectible based on the age of the receivable  the creditworthiness of the customer  and any other information that is relevant to the judgment 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  reducing their ability to make payments  additional allowances would be required 
b the company writes down its inventories for estimated obsolescence for differences between the cost and estimated net realizable value based on usage in the preceding months  expected demand  and any other information that is relevant to the judgment 
if ultimate usage or demand vary significantly from expected usage or demand  additional writedowns may be required 
c the company periodically evaluates goodwill for impairment using market comparables for similar businesses or forecasts of discounted future cash flows 
goodwill totaled billion at december  estimates of future cash flows require assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth  asset related expenditures  working capital levels  and other factors 
different assumptions from those made in the company s analysis could materially affect projected cash flows and the company s evaluation of goodwill for impairment 
should the fair value of the company s goodwill decline because of reduced operating performance  market declines  or other indicators of impairment  charges for impairment of goodwill may be necessary 
d the company reviews other long lived assets for impairment when indication of potential impairment exists  such as a significant reduction in cash flows associated with the assets 
other long lived assets totaled million at december   including million of fixed assets 
in testing a long lived asset for impairment  assumptions are made concerning projected cash flows associated with the asset 
estimates of future cash flows require assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth and asset related expenditures associated with the asset being reviewed for impairment 
should future cash flows decline significantly from estimated amounts  charges for impairment of other long lived assets may be necessary 
e in instances where the company sells equipment with a related installation obligation  the company generally recognizes revenue related to the equipment when title passes 
the company recognizes revenue related to the installation when it performs the installation 
the allocation of revenue between the equipment and the installation is based on relative fair value at the time of sale 
should the fair value of either the equipment or the installation change  the company s revenue recognition would be affected 
f in instances where the company sells equipment with customer specified acceptance criteria  the company must assess whether it can demonstrate adherence to the acceptance criteria prior to the customer s acceptance testing to determine the timing of revenue recognition 
if the nature of customer specified acceptance criteria were to change or grow in complexity such that the company could not demonstrate adherence  the company would be required to defer additional revenues upon shipment of its products until completion of customer acceptance testing 
g at the time the company recognizes revenue  it provides for the estimated cost of product warranties based primarily on historical experience and knowledge of any specific warranty problems that indicate projected warranty costs may vary from historical patterns 
the liability for warranty obligations totaled million at december  should product failure rates or the actual cost of correcting product failures vary from estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be necessary 
h the company estimates the degree to which tax assets and loss carryforwards will result in a benefit based on expected profitability by tax jurisdiction  and provides a valuation allowance for tax assets and loss carryforwards that it believes will more likely than not go unused 
if it becomes more likely than not that a tax asset or loss carryforward will be used  the company reverses the related valuation allowance 
the company s tax valuation allowance totaled million at december  should the company s actual future taxable income by tax jurisdiction vary from estimates  additional allowances or reversals thereof may be necessary 
i the company provides a liability for future income tax payments in the worldwide tax jurisdictions in which it operates 
accrued income taxes totaled million at december  should tax return positions that the company expects are sustainable not be sustained upon audit  the company could be required to record an incremental tax provision for such taxes 
should disputed positions that are reserved ultimately be sustained  the company would recognize an incremental tax benefit 
j the company estimates losses on contingencies and litigation and provides a reserve for these losses 
should the ultimate losses on contingencies and litigation vary from estimates  adjustments to those reserves may be required 
k one of the company s us subsidiaries and several us subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension plans 
major assumptions used in the accounting for these employee benefit plans include the discount rate  expected return on plan assets  and rate of increase in employee compensation levels 
assumptions are determined based on company data and appropriate market indicators in consultation with the company s actuaries  and are evaluated each year as of the plans measurement date 
net periodic pension costs for defined benefit plans totaled million in should any of these assumptions change  they would have an effect on net periodic pension costs 
l the company records restructuring charges for the cost of vacating facilities based on future lease obligations and expected sub rental income 
the company s accrued restructuring costs for abandoned facilities totaled million at december  should actual cash flows associated with sub rental income from vacated facilities vary from estimated amounts  adjustments may be required 
m the company estimates the expected proceeds from any businesses held for sale and  when necessary  records losses to reduce the carrying value of these businesses to estimated realizable value 
should the actual or estimated proceeds  which would include post closing purchase price adjustments  vary from current estimates  results could differ from expected amounts 
results of operations compared with continuing operations sales in were billion  an increase of million from the favorable effects of currency translation resulted in an increase in revenues of million in sales decreased million due to divestitures  net of acquisitions 
in addition to the changes in revenue resulting from currency translation  acquisitions  and divestitures  revenues decreased million  or  primarily due to lower demand  as described by segment below 
operating income margin life and laboratory sciences measurement and control optical technologies consolidated operating income was million in  compared with million in operating income margin increased to in from in operating income in was reduced by additional charges associated with restructuring actions initiated in  restructuring plans initiated prior to  and certain other costs  net note 
operating income in was reduced by charges associated with restructuring plans initiated during and  and certain other costs  net 
the restructuring and other items totaled million and million in and  respectively  and are discussed by segment below 
operating income increased primarily due to a lower cost base following recent restructuring actions 
among the other actions contributing to a lower cost base is lower spending on research and development activities  which decreased to million in as the company focuses on those projects with the highest estimated returns 
the company expects to continue spending on research and development at a rate of approximately of revenues 
in response to a continued downturn in markets served by the company and in connection with the company s overall reorganization  restructuring actions were initiated in in a number of business units to reduce costs and redundancies  principally through headcount reductions and consolidation of facilities 
these actions resulted in annual cost reductions beginning in mid to late and continuing in early of approximately million  including million in the life and laboratory sciences segment  million in the measurement and control segment  and million in the optical technologies segment 
the company expects to incur an additional million of restructuring costs  primarily in  for charges associated with these actions that cannot be recorded until incurred 
the company believes that restructuring actions undertaken in will be substantially completed in the company does not currently expect to undertake significant restructuring actions in in november  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on eitf no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
the company began applying the consensus prospectively in the first quarter of under eitf no 
 the company recognizes revenue and related costs for arrangements with customers that have multiple deliverables  such as equipment and installation  as each element is delivered or completed based on its fair value 
when a portion of the customer s payment is not due until installation  the company defers that portion of the revenue until completion of installation 
prior to  the company followed staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  adopted in  for multiple element arrangements 
under sab no 
 revenue was recognized at shipment with the estimated cost of installation accrued for most products requiring installation 
for those products requiring installations of longer duration  the company previously deferred revenue until completion of installation 
the adoption of eitf no 
increased revenues and diluted earnings per share by million and  respectively  during the first quarter of where eitf no 
has had an impact  the company has disclosed such impact

in addition to the changes in revenue resulting from currency translation  divestitures  and acquisitions  revenues increased million  or  including from the effect of the adoption of eitf no 
a million increase in sales of clinical diagnostic products was offset in part by decreased sales of bioscience instrumentation  principally due to a downturn in demand from pharmaceutical and industrial markets 
the increase in sales of clinical diagnostic products resulted primarily from higher demand for rapid diagnostic tests during a harsh flu season in the united states and  to a lesser extent  increased demand for a newly released tissue processor used in anatomical pathology laboratories 
operating income margin decreased to in from in operating income margin was affected by restructuring and other costs  net  of million and million in and  respectively 
in addition to the increase in restructuring and other costs in  the decrease in operating income margin resulted from higher marketing and selling expenses due to several key commercial initiatives 
the segment s commercial initiatives include key customer account management  increased advertising costs for a branding transition  and establishment of customer call centers and product demonstration facilities 
these cost increases were offset in part by cost savings from facility consolidations and related productivity measures 
the cost reduction measures in and reduced the segment s cost base by an aggregate of approximately million on an annualized basis

of this amount  million  or  was due to the inclusion in the fourth quarter of of a shipment of explosives detection equipment to the us transportation security administration following a congressional mandate to screen all checked airline baggage in the united states by the end of the balance of the decrease was primarily the result of weaker demand arising from economic conditions facing customers  particularly in the process instruments businesses where approximately of the remaining decrease occurred 
process instruments are generally used in industrial markets such as minerals and mining and petrochemical applications  where capital expenditures have slowed 
in addition  a decrease in sales of equipment used primarily in semiconductor applications was offset in part by higher revenues from equipment used in homeland security 
operating income margin increased to in from in operating income margin was affected by restructuring and other costs  net  of million and million in and  respectively

optical technologies change dollars in thousands revenues   operating income margin sales in the optical technologies segment decreased million  or  to million in the favorable effects of currency translation resulted in an increase in revenues of million in sales decreased million as a result of two product line divestitures 
in addition to the changes in revenue resulting from currency translation and divestitures  revenues decreased million  or  primarily due to weaker demand 
the weaker demand was principally the result of the severe slowdown in the semiconductor and other industrial markets that has adversely affected customers in the segment s businesses 
these industries are highly cyclical and have experienced downturns that began in research funding for the scientific laser market has also remained slow and this  together with the downturn in industrial markets  has heightened competition in sales to academic and research customers 
operating income margin was negative in  compared with negative in operating income margin was affected by restructuring and other costs  net  of million and million in and  respectively 
the decrease in the segment s operating loss was principally due to cost reduction and productivity measures undertaken in and  the suspension of telecommunications activities in the second quarter of and  to a lesser extent  lower restructuring and other costs

forward looking statements in connection with the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of  we caution readers that the following important factors  among others  in some cases have affected  and in the future could affect  our actual results and could cause our actual results in and beyond to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by us 
we must develop new products  adapt to rapid and significant technological change  and respond to introductions of new products in order to remain competitive 
our growth strategy includes significant investment in and expenditures for product development 
we sell our products in several industries that are characterized by rapid and significant technological changes  frequent new product and service introductions  and enhancements and evolving industry standards 
without the timely introduction of new products  services  and enhancements  our products and services will likely become technologically obsolete over time  in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer 
our customers use many of our products to develop  test  and manufacture their own products 
as a result  we must anticipate industry trends and develop products in advance of the commercialization of our customers products 
if we fail to adequately predict our customers needs and future activities  we may invest heavily in research and development of products and services that do not lead to significant revenue 
many of our existing products and those under development are technologically innovative and require significant planning  design  development  and testing at the technological  product  and manufacturing process levels 
these activities require us to make significant investments 
products in our markets undergo rapid and significant technological change because of quickly changing industry standards and the introduction of new products and technologies that make existing products and technologies uncompetitive or obsolete 
our competitors may adapt more quickly to new technologies and changes in customers requirements than we can 
the products that we are currently developing  or those we will develop in the future  may not be technologically feasible or accepted by the marketplace  and our products or technologies could become uncompetitive or obsolete 
we sell our products and services to a number of companies that operate in cyclical industries  which would adversely affect our results of operations when those industries experience a downturn 
the growth and profitability of some of our businesses depend in part on sales to industries that are subject to cyclical downturns 
for example  our optical technologies segment depends in part on sales to the semiconductor industry  and our measurement and control segment depends in part on sales to the steel and cement industries 
slowdowns in these industries would adversely affect sales by these segments  which in turn would adversely affect our revenues and results of operations 
our business is impacted by general worldwide economic conditions and related uncertainties affecting markets in which we operate 
adverse economic conditions worldwide could adversely impact our business in and beyond  resulting in reduced demand for some of our products  increased rate of order cancellations or delays  increased risk of excess and obsolete inventories  increased pressure on the prices for our products and services  and greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable 
changes in governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses 
we compete in many markets in which we and our customers must comply with federal  state  local  and international regulations  such as environmental  health and safety  and food and drug regulations 
we develop  configure  and market our products to meet customer needs created by those regulations 
any significant change in regulations could reduce demand for our products 
for example  many of our instruments are marketed to the pharmaceutical industry for use in discovering and developing drugs 
changes in the us food and drug administration s regulation of the drug discovery and development process could have an adverse effect on the demand for these products 
demand for most of our products depends on capital spending policies of our customers and on government funding policies 
our customers include manufacturers of semiconductors and products incorporating semiconductors  pharmaceutical and chemical companies  laboratories  universities  healthcare providers  government agencies  and public and private research institutions 
many factors  including public policy spending priorities  available resources  and product and economic cycles  have a significant effect on the capital spending policies of these entities 
these policies in turn can have a significant effect on the demand for our products 
our inability to protect our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in addition  third parties may claim that we infringe their intellectual property  and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expense as a result 
we place considerable emphasis on obtaining patent and trade secret protection for significant new technologies  products  and processes because of the length of time and expense associated with bringing new products through the development process and into the marketplace 
our success depends in part on our ability to develop patentable products and obtain and enforce patent protection for our products both in the united states and in other countries 
we own numerous us and foreign patents  and we intend to file additional applications  as appropriate  for patents covering our products 
patents may not be issued for any pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us  and the claims allowed under any issued patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology 
any issued patents owned by or licensed to us may be challenged  invalidated  or circumvented  and the rights under these patents may not provide us with competitive advantages 
in addition  competitors may design around our technology or develop competing technologies 
intellectual property rights may also be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries  which could make it easier for competitors to capture increased market position 
we could incur substantial costs to defend ourselves in suits brought against us or in suits in which we may assert our patent rights against others 
an unfavorable outcome of any such litigation could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 
we also rely on trade secrets and proprietary know how which we seek to protect our products  in part  by confidentiality agreements with our collaborators  employees  and consultants 
these agreements may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach 
in addition  our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently developed by our competitors 
third parties may assert claims against us to the effect that we are infringing on their intellectual property rights 
we could incur substantial costs and diversion of management resources in defending these claims  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
in addition  parties making these claims could secure a judgment awarding substantial damages  as well as injunctive or other equitable relief  which could effectively block our ability to make  use  sell  distribute  or market our products and services in the united states or abroad 
in the event that a claim relating to intellectual property is asserted against us  or third parties not affiliated with us hold pending or issued patents that relate to our products or technology  we may seek licenses to such intellectual property or challenge those patents 
however  we may be unable to obtain these licenses on commercially reasonable terms  if at all  and our challenge of the patents may be unsuccessful 
our failure to obtain the necessary licenses or other rights could prevent the sale  manufacture  or distribution of our products and  therefore  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
we have retained contingent liabilities from businesses that we have sold 
from through  we divested over businesses with aggregate annual revenues in excess of billion 
as part of these transactions  we retained responsibility for some of the contingent liabilities related to these businesses  such as lawsuits  product liability claims  and potential claims by buyers that representations and warranties we made about the businesses were inaccurate 
the resolution of these contingencies has not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition  however  we can not be certain that this favorable pattern will continue 
our results could be impacted if we are unable to realize potential future benefits from new productivity initiatives 
in addition to the real estate consolidations and cost saving initiatives that we have pursued over the past three years  we are instituting practical process improvement ppi programs at our locations to further enhance our productivity  efficiency  and customer satisfaction 
while we anticipate continued benefits from these ppi initiatives as well as our continuing sourcing activities  future benefits are expected to be fewer and smaller in size and may be more difficult to achieve 
our new branding strategy could be unsuccessful 
we historically operated our business largely as autonomous  unaffiliated companies  and as a result  each of our businesses independently created and developed its own brand names 
our new marketing and branding strategy transitions multiple  unrelated brands to two brands  thermo electron and spectra physics 
several of our former brands such as finnigan  nicolet  and oriel commanded strong market recognition and customer loyalty 
we believe the transition to the two new brands enhances and strengthens our collective brand image and brand awareness across the entire company 
our success in promoting our brands depends on many factors  including effective communication of the transition to our customers  acceptance and recognition by customers of these new brands  and successful execution of the branding campaign by our marketing and sales teams 
if we are not successful with this strategy  we may experience erosion in our product recognition  brand image and customer loyalty  and a decrease in demand for our products 
it may be difficult for us to implement our strategies for improving internal growth 
some of the markets in which we compete have been flat or declining over the past several years 
to address this issue  we are pursuing a number of strategies to improve our internal growth  including finding new markets for our products  developing new applications for our technologies  combining sales and marketing operations in appropriate markets to compete more effectively  allocating research and development funding to products with higher growth prospects  continuing key customer initiatives  strengthening our presence in selected geographic markets  and continuing the development of commercial tools and infrastructure to increase and support cross selling opportunities of products and services to take advantage of our breadth in product offerings 
we may not be able to successfully implement these strategies  and these strategies may not result in the growth of our business 
as a multinational corporation  we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates  which could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations 
international revenues account for a substantial portion of our revenues  and we intend to continue expanding our presence in international markets 
in  our international revenues from continuing operations  including export revenues from the united states  accounted for approximately of our total revenues 
the exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates takes on different forms 
international revenues are subject to the risk that fluctuations in exchange rates could adversely affect product demand and the profitability in us dollars of products and services provided by us in international markets  where payment for our products and services is made in the local currency 
as a multinational corporation  our businesses occasionally invoice third party customers in currencies other than the one in which they primarily do business the functional currency 
movements in the invoiced currency relative to the functional currency could adversely impact our cash flows and our results of operations 
in addition  reported sales made in non us currencies by our international businesses  when translated into non us dollars for financial reporting purposes  fluctuate due to exchange rate movement 
should our international sales grow  exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates could have a larger effect on our financial results 
in fiscal and  currency translation had a favorable effect on revenues of our continuing operations of million and million  respectively  while in fiscal  the unfavorable effects of currency translation decreased revenues of our continuing operations by million 
our inability to successfully identify and complete acquisitions or successfully integrate any new or previous acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our business strategy includes the acquisition of technologies and businesses that complement or augment our existing products and services 
promising acquisitions are difficult to identify and complete for a number of reasons  including competition among prospective buyers and the need for regulatory  including antitrust  approvals 
we may not be able to identify and successfully complete transactions 
any acquisition we may complete may be made at a substantial premium over the fair value of the net assets of the acquired company 
further  we may not be able to integrate any acquired businesses successfully into our existing businesses  make such businesses profitable  or realize anticipated cost savings or synergies  if any  from these acquisitions  which could adversely affect our business 
moreover  we previously acquired several companies and businesses 
as a result of these acquisitions  we recorded significant goodwill on our balance sheet  which amounts to approximately billion as of december  we assess the realizability of the goodwill we have on our books annually as well as whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the goodwill may be impaired 
these events or circumstances generally include operating losses or a significant decline in earnings associated with the acquired business or asset 
our ability to realize the value of the goodwill will depend on the future cash flows of these businesses 
these cash flows in turn depend in part on how well we have integrated these businesses 
if we are not able to realize the value of the goodwill  we may be required to incur material charges relating to the impairment of those assets 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates  currency exchange rates  and equity prices  which could affect its future results of operations and financial condition 
the company manages its exposure to these risks through its regular operating and financing activities 
additionally  the company uses short term forward contracts to manage certain exposures to currencies 
the company enters into forward currency exchange contracts to hedge firm purchase and sale commitments denominated in currencies other than its subsidiaries local currencies 
the company does not engage in extensive currency hedging activities  however  the purpose of the company s currency hedging activities is to protect the company s local currency cash flows related to these commitments from fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
the company s forward currency exchange contracts principally hedge transactions denominated in us dollars  euros  british pounds sterling  japanese yen  and swiss francs 
income and losses arising from forward contracts are recognized as offsets to losses and income resulting from the underlying exposure being hedged 
the company does not enter into speculative currency agreements 
interest rates certain of the company s short term available for sale investments and long term obligations are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
interest rate changes would result in a change in the fair value of these financial instruments due to the difference between the market interest rate and the rate at the date of purchase or issuance of the financial instrument 
a decrease in year end and market interest rates would result in a negative impact to the company of million and million  respectively  on the net fair value of its interest sensitive financial instruments 
in addition  interest rate changes would result in a change in the company s interest expense due to variable rate debt instruments 
a basis point increase in day libor at december   and december   would increase the company s annual pre tax interest expense by million and million  respectively 
currency exchange rates the company views its investment in international subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the company s reporting currency as long term 
the company s investment in international subsidiaries is sensitive to fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
the functional currencies of the company s international subsidiaries are principally denominated in euros  british pounds sterling  and japanese yen 
the effect of a change in currency exchange rates on the company s net investment in international subsidiaries is reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive items component of shareholders equity 
a depreciation in year end and functional currencies  relative to the us dollar  would result in a reduction of shareholders equity of million and million  respectively 
the fair value of forward currency exchange contracts is sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates 
the fair value of forward currency exchange contracts is the estimated amount that the company would pay or receive upon termination of the contract  taking into account the change in currency exchange rates 
a depreciation in year end and currency exchange rates related to the company s contracts would result in an increase in the unrealized loss on forward currency exchange contracts of million and million  respectively 
the unrealized gains or losses on forward currency exchange contracts resulting from changes in currency exchange rates are expected to approximately offset losses or gains on the exposures being hedged 
certain of the company s cash and cash equivalents are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the depositor and are sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates 
a depreciation in the related year end and currency exchange rates would result in a negative impact of million and million  respectively  on the company s net income 
equity prices the company s available for sale investment portfolio includes equity securities that are sensitive to fluctuations in price 
in addition  the company s convertible obligations are sensitive to fluctuations in the price of the company s common stock 
changes in equity prices would result in changes in the fair value of the company s available for sale investments and convertible obligations due to the difference between the current market price and the market price at the date of purchase or issuance of the financial instrument 
a decrease in year end and market equity prices would result in a negative impact to the company of million and million  respectively  on the net fair value of its price sensitive equity financial instruments  principally its available for sale investments
