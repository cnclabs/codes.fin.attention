item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our reportable segments are strategic business units that offer different products and services 
the business segments are defined as homebuilding and financial services 
the homebuilding operations include the development of land  the sale and construction of single family attached and detached homes and the occasional sale of lots to third parties 
the homebuilding segment includes similar operations in several geographic regions that have been aggregated for segment reporting purposes 
the financial services operations include the origination and sale of mortgage loans and title services for purchasers of the company s homes 
in conformity with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 disclosure about segments of an enterprise and related information  the company s segment information is presented on the basis that the chief operating decision makers use in evaluating segment performance 
the accounting policies of the segments  in total  are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies 
intersegment revenue primarily represents the elimination of revenue included in financial services for fees paid by the homebuilding operations relating to loan origination fees for its homebuyers and the reclassification of certain amounts from internal reporting classifications to proper presentation in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
homebuilding income before income taxes includes an interest charge on the company s net investment in the segment using an interest rate of for housing and for land  as well as an allocation for programs and services administered centrally 
a management decision was made for that this interest rate will be adjusted to for housing and for land to more closely reflect our actual costs  which will result in a lower allocation of interest to homebuilding  and therefore  higher income before taxes within the homebuilding segment 
corporate and other income before income taxes includes selling  general and administrative costs that are viewed by management as not specifically related to either the homebuilding or financial services segment  income resulting from the allocation of interest and other costs to those segments  the elimination of revenue and cost of sales between the homebuilding and financial services segments and adjustments necessary t o reclassify certain amounts from internal reporting classifications to proper presentation in conformity with gaap

total revenue for was billion  an increase of million over the increase was primarily the result of an increase of million in homebuilding revenue and an increase of million in financial services revenue 
the increase in homebuilding was the result of growth of million and in housing revenue offset slightly by a decrease of million in land revenue 
housing revenue increa sed as a result of a increase in the average sales price of homes delivered  from  in to  in  led by our florida region 
the number of homes delivered remained constant in compared to the decrease in land revenue was primarily due to a decrease in lot sales in our washington  dc and orlando markets of million and million  respectively 
these decreases were partially offset by increases of million in charlotte  million in columbus  and million in raleigh 
land revenue can vary significantly from year to year  given that management opportunistically determines the particular land or lots to be sold directly to third parties 
the increase in financial services revenue was primarily attributable to increases in revenue earned from the sale of loans and the related activities 
gross and operating margins 
gross margin  as a percentage of revenue  increased from to and operating margin increased from to 
the increase in gross margin is partially attributable to higher selling prices  due to homebuyers purchasing more upgrades and options that generally carry higher margins 
financial services also had higher profits as a result of generating more revenues from the sale of loans  primarily because of the full year effect of being able to offer more fixed rate loans to the third parties that purchase the loans 
in addition to the factors described above  the operating margin increase was also attributable to lower g eneral and administrative expenses  mainly due to the million favorable impact over from our interest rate swaps that will mature in there is no assurance that the company will be able to maintain the current margin levels if interest rates were to increase  as homebuyers are usually able to afford to purchase more options when interest rates are low  and more homebuyers select variable rate loans  which may result in lower profits for financial services when the loans are sold to third parties 
income before income taxes 
income before income taxes increased million over  representing a increase 
the increase related to both homebuilding and financial services  which experienced increases of million increase  and million increase  respectively 
the increase in homebuilding income was primarily due to the increase in the average sales price of homes delivered with approximately the same number of total homes delivered  an improvement in housing gross margins from to due primarily to pric ing increases in certain markets and the mix of homes delivered  including the impact of customer s selecting more options  which generally have higher margins 
the increase in financial services income was primarily the result of increased income from the sale of loans and the related activities  with a relatively fixed operating expense base 
in addition  corporate and other income before taxes increased million primarily due to a million increase in the net interest income from allocations to the homebuilding segment  resulting mainly from higher inventory balances within homebuilding  and a million favorable market adjustment on our interest rate swaps in  which was million unfavorable in our interest rate swaps will mature in the third quarter of interest expense 
interest expense for decreased to million from million in interest expense was lower in primarily due to an decrease in the average borrowings outstanding during the year and higher interest capitalization due to higher inventory balances in income taxes 
the effective tax rate increased from to from to the increase is primarily attributed to higher state taxes in year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue 
total revenue for was billion  an increase of million over the increase was the result of an increase of million in homebuilding revenue and an increase of million in financial services revenue 
the increase in homebuilding was the result of million growth in housing revenue and million in land revenue 
housing revenue increased as a result of a increase in the average sales price of homes delivered 
this was offset by a decrease in the number of homes delivered 
the increase in land revenue was primarily due to an increase in lot sales related to our exit from the phoenix market 
we also experienced increases in land sales in our cincinnati  orlando and washington  dc markets 
these increases were partially offset by decreases in columbus and indianapolis 
the increase in financial services revenue was primarily attributable to increases in revenue earned from the sale of loans and increased earnings from title services 
gross and operating margins 
gross margin  as a percentage of revenue  increased from to and operating margin increased from to 
the increase in gross margin is partially attributable to higher selling prices due to homebuyers purchasing more upgrades and options that generally carry higher margins 
financial services also had higher profits as a result of generating more revenues from the sale of loans  primarily because of being able to offer more fixed rate loans to the third parties that purchase the loans 
in addition to the factors described above  the operating margin increase was also attributable to lower general and administrative expenses in  as expenses included amounts relating to exiting the phoenix market that were not incurred in income before income taxes 
income before income taxes increased million over the increase related to both homebuilding and financial services  which experienced increases of million and million  respectively 
the increase in homebuilding income was primarily due to increases in the average sales price of homes delivered and housing gross margins 
the increase in financial services income was primarily the result of increased income from the sale of loans and the favorable interest rate environment during the increase in corpo rate and other amounts from to was primarily due to certain administrative expenses recognized in related to exiting the phoenix market that were not recognized in for the year ended december   the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle resulted in an increase in income of million  net of income taxes 
this accounting change was the result of the january  adoption of sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which required us to record the value of interest rate swaps  certain loan commitments and forward sales of mortgage backed securities at fair value 
interest expense 
interest expense for decreased to million from million in interest expense was lower in primarily due to a decrease in the average borrowings outstanding offset somewhat by a slightly higher interest rate 
income taxes 
the effective tax rate increased from to from to the increase is primarily attributed to higher state taxes in seasonality and variability in quarterly results we have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  significant seasonality and quarter to quarter variability in homebuilding activity levels 
in general  homes delivered increase substantially in the third and fourth quarters 
we believe that this seasonality reflects the tendency of homebuyers to shop for a new home in the spring with the goal of closing in the fall or winter  as well as the scheduling of construction to accommodate seasonal weather conditions 
the following tables reflect this cycle for the company during the four quarters of and three months ended december  september  june  march  dollars in thousands revenue unit data new contracts homes delivered backlog at end of period three months ended december  september  june  march  dollars in thousands revenue unit data new contracts homes delivered backlog at end of period homebuilding segment the following table sets forth certain information related to our homebuilding segment year ended december  dollars in thousands revenue housing land total revenue revenue housing land total revenue land and housing costs gross margin general and administrative expenses selling expenses operating income allocated expenses income before income taxes ohio and indiana region unit data new contracts homes delivered backlog at end of period average sales price of homes in backlog aggregate sales value of homes in backlog number of active subdivisions florida region unit data new contracts homes delivered backlog at end of period average sales price of homes in backlog aggregate sales value of homes in backlog number of active subdivisions north carolina and washington  dc region unit data new contracts homes delivered backlog at end of period average sales price of homes in backlog aggregate sales value of homes in backlog number of active subdivisions total unit data new contracts homes delivered backlog at end of period average sales price of homes in backlog aggregate sales value of homes in backlog number of active subdivisions also includes arizona in and a home is included in new contracts when our standard sales contract is executed 
homes delivered represents homes for which the closing of the sale has occurred and risk has transferred to the buyer 
backlog represents homes for which the standard sales contract has been executed  but which are not included in homes delivered because closings for these homes have not yet occurred as of the end of the period specified 
most cancellations of contracts for homes in backlog occur because customers cannot qualify for financing and usually occur prior to the start of construction 
since we arrange financing with guaranteed rates for some of our customers  the incidence of cancellations after the start of construction is low

year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue 
revenue for the homebuilding segment was billion  an increase of  or million from this increase was due to a increase in housing revenue  offset partially by a decrease in land revenue

land revenue can vary significantly from year to year  given that management opportunistically determines the particular land or lots to be sold directly to third parties 
home sales and backlog 
new contracts recorded in increased over the prior year 
new contracts increased in columbus  tampa  orlando and west palm beach due to both the economic conditions in those markets and the availability of new subdivisions in exclusive or high demand locations 
the number of new contracts recorded in future periods will be dependent on numerous factors  including future economic conditions  timing of land acquisitions and development  consumer confidence  number of subdivisions and interest rates available to potential homebuyers

several other markets showed lower increases in gross margin percentage as a result of changes in mix of homes delivered  including the impact of customer s selecting more options  which generally have higher margins  alon g with operating efficiencies 
the increase in land s gross margin was due primarily to lots sold in charlotte and columbus

critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates such estimates and judgments and makes adjustments as deemed necessary 
actual results could differ from these estimates using different estimates and assumptions  or if conditions are significantly different in the future 
listed below are those policies that we believe are critical and require the use of complex judgment in their application 
segment information 
our reportable business segments consist of homebuilding and financial services 
our homebuilding segment derives a majority of its revenue from constructing single family housing in nine markets in the united states 
the financial services segment generates revenue by originating and selling mortgages and by collecting fees for title services 
segment information included herein is presented in accordance with sfas no 
 and is presented on the basis that the chief operating decision makers use in evaluating segment performance 
revenue recognition 
revenue from the sale of a home is recognized when the closing has occurred and the risk is transferred to the buyer 
all associated homebuilding costs are charged to cost of sales in the period when the revenues from home closings are recognized 
homebuilding costs include land and land development costs  home construction costs including an estimate of the costs to complete construction  previously capitalized indirect costs and estimated warranty costs 
sales commissions are included in selling expense when the closing has occurred 
all other costs are expensed as incurred 
we recognize the majority of the revenues associated with our mortgage loan operations when the mortgage loans and related servicing rights are sold to third party investors 
we defer the application and origination fees  net of costs  and recognize them as revenue  along with the associated gains or losses on the sale of the loans and related servicing rights  when the loans are sold to third party investors  in accordance with sfas the revenue recognized is reduced by the fair value of the related guarantee provided to the investor 
the guarantee fair value is recognized in revenue when the company is released from its obligation under the guarantee 
generally  all of the financial services mortgage loans and related servicing rights are sold to third party inves tors within two weeks of origination 
we recognize financial services revenues associated with our title operations as homes are closed  closing services are rendered and title polices are issued  all of which generally occur simultaneously as each home is closed 
all of the underwriting risk associated with title insurance policies is transferred to third party insurers 
inventories 
we use the specific identification method for the purpose of accumulating costs associated with home construction 
inventories are recorded at cost  unless they are determined to be impaired  in which case the impaired inventories are written down to fair value less cost to sell in accordance with sfas no 
in addition to the costs of direct land acquisition  land development and related costs both incurred and estimated to be incurred and home construction costs  inventories include capitalized interest  real estate taxes and certain indirect costs incurred during land development and home construction 
such costs  other than capitalized intere st  are charged to cost of sales as homes are closed 
when a home is closed  we typically have not yet recorded and paid all incurred costs necessary to complete the home 
as homes close  we compare the home construction budget to actual recorded costs to date to estimate the additional costs to be incurred from our subcontractors related to the home 
we record a liability and a corresponding charge to cost of sales for the amount we estimate will ultimately be paid related to that home 
we monitor the accuracy of such estimate by comparing actual costs incurred in subsequent months to the estimate 
although actual costs to complete in the future could differ from the estimate  our method has historically produced consistently accurate estimates of actual costs to complete closed homes 
guarantees and indemnities 
guarantee and indemnity liabilities are established by charging the applicable income statement line  depending on the nature of the guarantee or indemnity  and crediting a liability 
the company generally provides a limited life guarantee on all loans sold to a third party  and estimates its actual liability related to the guarantee  and any indemnities subsequently provided to the purchaser of the loans in lieu of loan repurchase  based on historical loss experience 
actual future costs associated with loans guaranteed or indemnified could differ materially from our currently estimated amounts 
warranty 
warranty liabilities are established by charging cost of sales and crediting a warranty liability for each home closed 
the amounts charged are estimated by management to be adequate to cover expected warranty related costs for materials and labor required under the company s warranty programs 
our warranty cost accruals are based upon historical warranty cost experience and are adjusted as appropriate 
actual future warranty costs could differ materially from our currently estimated amount 
self insurance 
self insurance accruals are made for estimated liabilities associated with employee health care  workers compensation and general liability insurance 
the accruals related to employee health care and workers compensation are based on historical experience and open cases 
the general liability accrual estimate is based on an actuarial evaluation of our past history of claims and other industry specific factors 
because of the high degree of judgment required in determining these estimated reserve amounts  actual future costs could differ from our currently estimated amounts 
derivative financial instruments 
the company has the following types of derivative financial instruments mortgage loans held for sale  interest rate lock commitments and interest rate swaps 
mortgage loans held for sale consist primarily of single family residential loans collateralized by the underlying property 
all mortgage loans are committed to third party investors at the date of funding and are typically sold to such investors within two weeks of funding 
the commitments associated with funded loans are designated as fair value hedges of the risk of changes in the overall fair value of the related loans 
accordingly  changes in the value of derivative ins truments are recognized in current earnings  as are changes in the value of the loans 
the net gains or losses are included in financial services revenue 
to meet financing needs of our home buying customers  m i financial is party to interest rate lock commitments irlcs  which are extended to customers who have applied for a mortgage loan and meet certain defined credit and underwriting criteria 
in accordance with sfas no 
and related derivatives implementation group conclusions  the company classifies and accounts for irlcs as non designated derivative instruments at fair value with gains and losses recorded to current revenue 
m i financial manages interest rate risk related to its irlc loans through the use of forward sales of mortgage backed securities fmbs  use of best efforts whole loan delivery commitments and the occasional purchase of options on fmbs in accordance with company policy 
these instruments are considered non designated derivatives and are accounted for at fair value with gains or losses recorded in current earnings 
sfas no 
requires interest rate swaps to be recorded in the consolidated balance sheet at fair value 
changes in their value are recorded in the consolidated statement of income 
the fair value of the company s interest rate swap is recorded in other liabilities and the change in their fair value is recorded in general and administrative expense 
off balance sheet arrangements variable interest entities 
in the ordinary course of business  the company enters into arrangements with third parties to acquire land and develop lots 
these arrangements include the creation by the company of joint ventures and limited liability companies  which meet the criteria of variable interest entities vies 
these entities engage in land development activities for the purpose of distributing developed lots to the company and its partners in the entity 
at december   these entities have assets and other liabilities totaling approximately million and million  respectively  with the company s interest in these en tities varying from to 
these entities generally do not hold debt securities  except for seller requested financing arrangements upon purchasing land for the entity 
the company believes its maximum exposure related to any of these entities to be the amount invested of million plus our share of letters of credit of million that serve as completion bonds for the development work in progress 
the company receives its percentage interest in the lots developed in the form of a capital distribution 
the company also owns a interest in one unconsolidated title insurance agency that engages in closing services for m i financial 
the company s maximum exposure related to this investment is limited to the amount investe d of approximately  the company has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of any of these vies and  therefore  these arrangements are recorded using the equity method of accounting 
in addition to the above  the company also enters into option and contingent purchase contracts with third parties to acquire land and developed lots  which may qualify as vies under financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation revised december  consolidation of variable interest entities fin

interest rates and inflation our business is significantly affected by general economic conditions of the united states of america and  particularly  by the impact of interest rates 
higher interest rates may decrease our potential market by making it more difficult for homebuyers to qualify for mortgages or to obtain mortgages at interest rates that are acceptable to them 
the impact of increased rates can be offset  in part  by offering variable rate loans with lower interest rates 
in conjunction with our mortgage banking operations  hedging methods are used to reduce our exposure to interest rate fluctuations between the commitment date of the loan and the time the loan closes 
in recent years  we have generally been able to raise prices by amounts at least equal to our cost increases and  accordingly  have not experienced any detrimental effect from inflation 
when we develop lots for our own use  inflation may increase our profits because land costs are fixed well in advance of sales efforts 
we are generally able to maintain costs with subcontractors from the date construction is started on a home through the delivery date 
however  in certain situations  unanticipated costs may occur between the time of start and the delivery date  resulting in lower gross profit margins

from time to time  forward looking statements also are included in our other periodic reports on forms q and k  in press releases  in presentations  on our web site and in other material released to the public

any forward looking statements that we make herein and in future reports and statements are not guarantees of future performance  and actual results may differ materially from those in such forward looking statements as a result of va rious factors including  but not limited to  those referred to below 
we undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
however  any further disclosures made on related subjects in our subsequent reports on forms k  q and k should be consulted 
the following cautionary discussion of risks  uncertainties and possible inaccurate assumptions relevant to our business includes factors we believe could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results 
other factors beyond those listed below  including factors unknown to us and factors known to us which we have not determined to be material  could also adversely affect us 
this discussion is provided as permitted by the private securities litigation reform act of  and all of our forward looking statements are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referenced in this section 
general real estate  economic and other conditions could adversely affect our business 
the homebuilding industry is significantly affected by changes in national and local economic and other conditions 
many of these conditions are beyond our control 
these conditions include employment levels  changing demographics  availability of financing  consumer confidence and housing demand 
in addition  homebuilders are subject to risks related to competitive overbuilding  availability and cost of building lots  availability of materials and labor  adverse weather conditions which can cause delays in construction schedules  cost overruns  changes in governmental regulati ons and increases in real estate taxes and other local government fees 
availability and affordability of residential mortgage financing could adversely affect our business 
our business is significantly affected by the impact of interest rates 
higher interest rates may decrease our potential market by making it more difficult for homebuyers to qualify for mortgages or to obtain mortgages at interest rates that are acceptable to them 
mortgage rates are currently close to historically low levels 
if mortgage interest rates increase  our business could be adversely affected 
material and labor shortages could adversely affect our business 
the residential construction industry has  from time to time  experienced significant material and labor shortages in insulation  drywall  brick  cement and certain areas of carpentry and framing  as well as fluctuations in lumber prices and supplies 
continued shortages in these areas could delay construction of homes that could adversely affect our business 
at this time  we are not experiencing any significant material or labor shortages and  therefore  do not anticipate a material effect for the year we commit significant resources to land development activities which involve significant risks 
we develop the lots for a majority of our subdivisions 
therefore  our short term and long term financial success will be dependent upon our ability to develop these subdivisions successfully 
acquiring land and committing the financial and managerial resources to develop a subdivision involves significant risks 
before a subdivision generates any revenue  we may make material expenditures for items such as acquiring land and constructing subdivision infrastructure roads and util ities 
we are dependent on a limited number of markets 
we have operations in columbus and cincinnati  ohio  indianapolis  indiana  tampa  orlando and west palm beach  florida  charlotte and raleigh  north carolina  and the virginia and maryland suburbs of washington  dc adverse general economic conditions in these markets could have a material impact on our operations 
for  approximately of our operating income was derived from operations in the columbus market 
competition 
the homebuilding industry is highly competitive 
we compete in each of our local markets with numerous national  regional and local homebuilders  some of which have greater financial  marketing  land acquisition  and sales resources than we do 
builders of new homes compete not only for homebuyers  but also for desirable properties  financing  raw materials and skilled subcontractors 
we also compete with the resale market for existing homes that provide certain attractions for homebuyers over the new home market 
governmental regulation and environmental considerations could adversely affect our business 
the homebuilding industry is subject to increasing local  state and federal statutes  ordinances  rules and regulations concerning zoning  resource protection  building design and construction  and similar matters 
this includes local regulations that impose restrictive zoning and density requirements in order to limit the number of homes that can eventually be built within the boundaries of a particular location 
such regulation also affects construction activities  including construction materials that must be used in certain aspects of building design  as well as sales activities and other dealings with homebuyers 
we must also obtain licenses  permits and approvals from various governmental agencies for our development activities  the granting of which are beyond our control 
furthermore  increasingly stringent requirements may be imposed on homebuilders and developers in the future 
although we cannot predict the impact on us to comply with any such requirements  such requirements could result in time consuming and expensive compliance programs 
in addition  we have been  and in the future may be  subject to periodic delays or may be precluded from developing certain projects due to building moratoriums 
these moratoriums generally relate to insufficient water supplies or sewage facilities  delays in utility hookups or inadequate road capacity within the specific market area or subdivision 
these moratoriums can occur prior to  or subsequent to  commencement of our operations without notice or recourse 
we are also subject to a variety of local  state and federal statutes  ordinances  rules and regulations concerning the protection of health and the environment 
the particular environmental laws that apply to any given project vary greatly according to the project site and the present and former uses of the property 
these environmental laws may result in delays  cause us to incur substantial compliance costs including substantial expenditures for pollution and water quality control and prohibit or severely restrict development in certain environmentally sensitive regions 
although there can be no assurance that we will be successful in all cases  we have a general practice of requiring resolution of environmental issues prior to purchasing land in an effort to avoid major environmental i ssues in our developments 
in addition  m i financial is subject to a variety of laws and regulations concerning the underwriting  servicing and sale of mortgage loans 
significant voting control by principal shareholders 
as of the date of this report  members of the schottenstein family  including the chairman  chief executive officer and president and chief operating officer  owned approximately of the company s outstanding common shares 
therefore  members of the schottenstein family have significant voting power 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary market risk results from fluctuations in interest rates 
we are exposed to interest rate risk through the borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facilities that permit borrowings up to million 
to minimize the effects of interest rate fluctuations  we have interest rate swap agreements with certain banks for a total notional amount of million  for which we pay fixed rates of interest 
our interest rate swaps were not designated as hedges under sfas no 
when it was adopted 
we are exposed to market risk associated with changes in the fair values of the swaps  and such changes are reflected in our income statements 
at december   the fair value adjustment resulted in the company recording a million asset 
additionally  m i financial is exposed to interest rate risk associated with its mortgage loan origination services 
interest rate lock commitments irlcs are extended to home buying customers who have applied for mortgages and who meet certain defined credit and underwriting criteria 
typically  the irlcs will have a duration of less than six months  however  in certain markets  the duration could extend to twelve months 
some irlcs are committed to a specific third party investor through use of best effort whole loan delivery commitments matching the exact terms of the irlc loan 
uncommitted irlcs are considered derivative instruments under sfas no 
and are fair value adjusted with the resulting gain or loss recorded in current earnings 
at december   the notional amount of the uncommitted irlc loans was million 
the fair value adjustment related to these commitments resulting in the company recording a million liability at december  forward sales of mortgage backed securities fmbs are used to protect uncommitted irlc loans against the risk of changes in interest rates between the lock date and the funding date 
fmbs related to uncommitted irlcs are classified and accounted for as non designated derivative instruments  with gains and losses recorded in current earnings 
at december   the notional amount under the fmbs was million and the related fair value adjustment resulted in the company recording a 
million liability 
additionally  immediately prior to or concurrent with funding uncommitted irlc loans  the company enters into a commitment with a third party investor to buy the specific irlc loan 
the following table provides the expected future cash flows and current fair values of our other assets and liabilities that are subject to market risk as interest rates fluctuate  as of december  and weighted average fair interest expected cash flows by period value dollars in thousands rate thereafter total assets mortgage loans held for sale fixed rate variable rate liabilities long term debt fixed rate long term debt variable rate weighted average fair interest expected cash flows by period value dollars in thousands rate thereafter total assets mortgage loans held for sale fixed rate variable rate liabilities long term debt fixed rate long term debt variable rate
