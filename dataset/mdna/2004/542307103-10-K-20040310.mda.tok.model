during fiscal  th e company sold restaurants to a licensee in australia and closed an additiona l seven restaurants in australia 
the company closed five restaurants in australi a in fiscal critical accounting policies dollars in thousands the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordanc e with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  whic h require the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amount s reported in the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company believes that of it s significant accounting policies  the following represent accounting policie s that may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
impairment of long lived assets underperforming restaurants and definite lif e intangibles property and equipment and definite life intangibles are reviewe d for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carryin g amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
the company reviews applicabl e intangible assets and long lived assets related to each restaurant on a periodi c basis 
when events or changes in circumstances indicate an asset may not b e recoverable  the company estimates the future cash flows expected to result fro m the use of the asset 
if the sum of the expected undiscounted future cash flow s is less than the carrying value of the asset  an impairment loss is recognized the impairment loss is recognized by measuring the difference between th e carrying value of the assets and the fair market value of the assets 
th e company s estimates of fair values are based on the best information availabl e and require the use of estimates  judgments  and projections as considere d necessary 
the actual results may vary significantly 
impairment of long lived assets goodwill and indefinite life intangible s goodwill and certain intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives which ar e not subject to amortization are subjected to an annual impairment test  or mor e frequent tests if indicators of impairment exist 
in assessing recoverability o f goodwill  the company may be required to make assumptions regarding estimate d future cash flow and other factors to determine the fair value 
the amount o f fair value for certain intangible assets having indefinite lives are made b y reference to recent market transactions 
an impairment loss is recognized whe n the estimates of fair value are less than the carrying value of the assets 
self insurance reserves during fiscal  the company adopted self insuranc e programs for its worker s compensation  general liability  and medical benefit s programs 
in order to minimize the exposure under the self insurance programs the company has purchased stop loss coverage both on a per occurrence and on a n aggregate basis 
the self insured losses under the programs are accrued base d upon the company s estimate of the ultimate expected liability for both claim s incurred and on an incurred but not reported basis 
the establishment of suc h accruals for self insurance involve certain management judgments and assumption s regarding the frequency or severity of claims  the historical patterns of clai m development and the company s experience with claim reserve management an d settlement practices 
to the extent actual results may differ from th e assumptions used to develop the accrual estimate amounts  such unanticipate d changes may produce significantly different amounts of expense than thos e estimated under the self insurance program 
income taxes deferred income tax deferred tax assets and liabilities ar e recognized for the effect of temporary differences between the carrying amount s of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and amounts used fo r income tax purposes 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance i f it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asse t will not be realized 
the company reviews the recoverability of any deferred ta x assets reflected in the balance sheet and provides any necessary allowances a s required 
any adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income i n the period such determination was made

impact of inflation the primary inflationary factors affecting the company s operation s include food and labor costs 
a number of the company s restaurant personnel ar e paid at the federal and state established minimum wage levels and  accordingly changes in such wage levels affect the company s labor costs 
however  since th e majority of personnel are tipped employees  minimum wage changes generally hav e little effect on overall labor costs 
historically  as costs of food and labo r have increased  the company has been able to offset these increases through men u price increases and economies of scale  however  there may be delays in th e implementation of such menu price increases or in effecting timely economies o f scale  as well as  competitive pressures which may limit the company s abilit y to recover any cost increases in their entirety 
historically  inflation has no t had a material impact on operating margins 
during fiscal  the compan y experienced significant increases in beef prices 
if the price of beef continue s at its recent levels  it will continue to have a material negative impact o n operating margins

i s effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december the company has adopted the provisions of this statement in connectio n with such activities for transactions entered into subsequent to december risk factors changing consumer preferences and discretionary spending patterns  potentia l outbreaks of mad cow disease or foot mouth disease and other factor s affecting the availability of beef could force us to modify our restaurants concept and menu and could result in a reduction in our revenues 
even if we are able to successfully compete with other restauran t companies with similar concepts  we may be forced to make changes in one or mor e of our concepts in order to respond to changes in consumer tastes or dinin g patterns 
consumer preferences could be affected by health concerns about th e consumption of beef  the primary item on our menus  or by specific events suc h as the recently confirmed case of mad cow disease by the department o f agriculture in the state of washington or foot mouth disease which occurred i n the united kingdom 
in addition  these events could reduce the available suppl y of beef or significantly raise the price of beef 
if we change a restauran t concept  we may lose additional customers who do not prefer the new concept an d menu  and we may not be able to attract a sufficient new customer base t o produce the revenue needed to make the restaurant profitable 
in addition  w e may have different or additional competitors for our intended customers as a result of such a concept change and may not be able to successfully compet e against such competitors 
our success also depends on numerous factors affectin g discretionary consumer spending  including economic conditions  the cost o f gasoline  disposable consumer income and consumer confidence 
adverse changes i n these factors could reduce guest traffic or impose practical limits on pricing either of which could reduce revenues and operating income 
unforeseen cost increases could adversely affect our profitability 
our profitability is highly sensitive to increases in food  labo r and other operating costs 
during fiscal  the company experienced a significant increase in beef prices 
if the price of beef continues at it s recent levels  it will continue to have a material negative effect on operatin g margins 
in addition  our dependence on frequent deliveries of fresh foo d supplies means that shortages or interruptions in supply could materially an d adversely affect our operations 
moreover  unfavorable trends or development s concerning the following factors could adversely affect our results o inflation  food  labor  energy and utilities and employee benefi t costs  and o rent increases resulting from rent escalation provisions in ou r leases 
we may be unable to anticipate or react to changing prices 
if w e are unable to modify our purchasing practices or quickly or readily pass o n increased costs to customers  our business could be materially affected 
if we are unable to compete effectively with our competitors  we will not b e able to increase revenues or generate profits 
our inability to increas e revenues is directly related to our ability to compete effectively with ou r competitors 
key competitive factors include o the quality and numbers of employees needed to adequately staff ou r restaurants  o the quality and value of the food products offered  o the quality of service  o the cost of our raw products  o the price of the food products offered  o the restaurant locations  and o the ambiance of facilities 
we compete with other steakhouse restaurants specifically and wit h all other restaurants generally 
we compete with national and regional chains as well as individually owned restaurants 
the restaurant industry has fe w non economic barriers to entry  and as our competitors expand operations competition from steakhouse restaurants with concepts similar to ours can b e expected to intensify 
many of our competitors are well established in th e upscale and mid scale steak segments and certain competitors have substantiall y greater financial  marketing and other resources than us 
such increase d competition could adversely affect our revenues 
failure to comply with government regulations could adversely affect ou r operating performance 
our restaurant operations are subject to certain federal  state an d local laws and government regulations  such as o obtaining of licenses for the sale of food and alcohol beverages  o national and local health sanitation laws and regulations  o national and local employment and safety laws and regulations  and o local zoning  building code and land use regulations 
while we have never experienced any significant difficulties i n obtaining necessary governmental approvals  the failure to obtain or retain foo d and liquor licenses or any other governmental approvals could have a materia l adverse effect on our operating results 
we may be subjected to dram shop liability  which generall y provides a person injured by an intoxicated person with the right to recove r damages from an establishment that wrongfully served alcoholic beverages to th e intoxicated person 
although we carry liquor liability coverage as part of ou r comprehensive general liability insurance  if we lost a lawsuit related to thi s liability  our business could be materially harmed 
the restaurant industry is affected by a number of trends  as well as b y competition 
the restaurant industry is affected by changes in consumer taste s and by national  regional  and local economic conditions and demographic trends the performance of individual restaurants may be affected by factors such a s traffic patterns  demographic considerations and the type  number and locatio n of competing restaurants 
in addition  factors such as inflation  increase d food  labor and employee benefit costs and the availability of experience d management and hourly employees to successfully operate the restaurants may als o adversely affect the restaurant industry in general and our restaurants i n particular 
our business depends on a limited number of key personnel  the loss of who m could adversely affect us 
some of our senior executives are important to our success becaus e they have been instrumental in setting the strategic direction of our company operating our business  identifying  recruiting and training key personnel identifying areas for expansion and arranging necessary financing 
these ke y personnel include jamie b 
coulter  our chief executive officer  td o connell our president of lone star restaurants  and certain of our other executiv e officers 
although we believe there is a significant pool of talented personne l in the restaurant industry  if these members of our senior management tea m become unable or unwilling to continue in their present positions  it coul d adversely affect our business and development 
shareholders may not be able to resell their stock or may have to sell at a price substantially lower than the price they paid for it 
the trading price for our common stock has been highly volatile an d could continue to be subject to significant fluctuations in response t o variations in our quarterly operating results  general conditions in th e restaurant industry or the general economy  and other factors 
in addition  th e stock market is subject to price and volume fluctuations affecting the marke t price for public companies generally  or within broad industry groups  whic h fluctuations may be unrelated to the operating results or other circumstances o f a particular company 
such fluctuations may adversely affect the liquidity o f our common stock  as well as the price that holders may achieve for their share s upon any future sale 
staggered board  blank check preferred stock 
our current certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide fo r three classes of directors to be elected on a staggered basis 
this enable s existing directors to exercise significant control over our affairs  and may ac t as an impediment to any future attempts by third parties to take control of ou r board of directors 
in addition  our board of directors has the authorit y without further action by the stockholders to issue shares of preferred stock i n one or more series and to fix the rights  preferences  privileges an d restrictions thereof 
the exercise of this authority may act as a furthe r impediment to any future attempts by third parties to take control of our boar d of directors 
a single vendor distributes most of our consumable products 
approximately of the consumable products used in our restaurant s are distributed through and delivered by a single vendor 
while we believe w e could replace this vendor  any disruption of services by this vendor or an y change to a new vendor could adversely affect our restaurants 
the risk of future terrorist attacks may adversely impact our revenue 
as a result of the terrorist attacks on the united states o n september   a number of our restaurants  particularly our del frisco s and sullivan s restaurants  were negatively affected 
additionally  recen t terrorist warnings  both in the united states and internationally  suggest th e possibility of future terrorist attacks  which together with th e unpredictability of future military action and other responses to such terroris t attacks has resulted in economic uncertainty 
the occurrence of future terroris t attacks may adversely affect our business and make it more difficult to forecas t our future results of operation
