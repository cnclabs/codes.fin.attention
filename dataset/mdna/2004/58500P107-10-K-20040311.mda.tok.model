item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction our primary business focus is on the development  manufacturing  marketing and distribution of direct liquid fuel cell products for portable electronic devices  for the consumer personal and professional and military markets 
we are also working to develop and commercialize other technologies we own or own the rights to  including the cellscan  inherently conductive polymers  stirling cycle system  toroidal technologies and rankin cycle linear compressor 
based upon our decision to devote more resources to developing our fuel cell technologies and commercializing fuel cell based products  in recent years we have increased funding of our fuel cell related efforts  which increases we expect will continue until such time as we successfully commercialize our first fuel cell products  of which we can give no assurance  and perhaps thereafter 
this presentation includes the operations of our wholly and majority owned subsidiaries  unless we tell you otherwise 
results of operations from our inception in april through december  we have generated an accumulated deficit of approximately  including approximately  from amortization expense 
we expect to incur additional operating losses during and possibly thereafter  principally as a result of our continuing anticipated research and development costs  selling  general and administrative expenses and the uncertainty of bringing our fuel cell technology or any of our other technologies to commercial success 
since our inception  we have relied principally on outside sources of funding to finance our operations  as our revenues have been minimal 
we expect this to continue until we are able to successfully commercialize our fuel cell or any of our other products or technologies  of which we can give no assurance 
our research and development costs have increased from approximately  in to approximately  in  however  we anticipate that our failure to successfully commercially develop our fuel cell technology or any of our other technologies will force us to curtail our spending levels until such time  if ever  as we generate revenues or otherwise receive funds from third party sources 
if we begin to market and sell any of our technologies  we will increase such expenses to the extent necessary  which we expect to fund out of revenues 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  we sustained net losses of  during the year ended december   compared to  during the year ended december  the decrease in the net losses can primarily be attributed to decreases in amortization of certain intangible assets as such intangible assets become fully amortized  somewhat offset by an increases in research and development costs as we increase funding of our fuel cell related efforts  and selling  general and administrative expenses 
we recognized revenues of approximately  and gross profit of approximately  during the year ended december   compared to revenues of approximately  and gross profit of approximately  during the year ended december  the revenue in is attributable to a january agreement to develop for a third party an application for the use of our inherently conductive polymers in its fuel cell products 
in october  such agreement was terminated by the other party to the agreement prior to its scheduled termination date  for reasons unrelated to our technology or performance 
since the inception of such agreement in january  we received approximately  and expect to receive an additional amount of approximately  on billings for the period prior to the termination 
we do not expect to receive the  balance that would have been due under such agreement had it run through its entire term 
the revenues recognized in were attributed both to  under the january agreement and to  under a one time purchase order in which we designed a direct liquid fuel cell for use in a new energy pack for infantry soldiers 
all of such revenues are non recurring 
research and development costs amounted to  during the year ended december   compared to  during the year ended december  the increases in research and development costs incurred during compared to can be primarily attributed to an increase of approximately  related to our fuel cell technologies  somewhat offset by a decrease of approximately  in costs related to our cellscan and a decrease of approximately  in costs related to our toroidal technologies  stirling cycle system and linear compressor 
the research and development activities for the periods presented include fuel cell technologies 
we incurred costs relating to our fuel cell technologies of approximately  during the year ended december  net of credits aggregating approximately  recognized pursuant to our contracts with general dynamics  compared to costs of approximately  during the year ended december  the net increases in our research and development expenses relating to our fuel cell technologies of approximately  in compared to reflects our decision to continue to devote substantial and increasing amounts of resources to the further development of our fuel cell technologies and products 
cellscan 
we incurred costs relating to the refinement of the desktop cellscan system and on various cellscan research activities of approximately  during the year ended december   compared to costs of approximately  during the year ended december  the decrease in compared to can be primarily attributed to decreases in costs incurred related to the retention of third party researchers in the development and testing of new cellscan applications  labor costs and material costs  partially offset by an increase in other costs 
toroidal technologies  stirling cycle system and linear compressor 
we incurred aggregate costs relating to our toroidal engine and compressor  stirling cycle system and linear compressor of approximately  during the year ended december   compared to costs of approximately  during the year ended december  the decrease in compared to can be primarily attributed to decreases in costs incurred from the use of consultants and subcontractors  labor costs  and other costs reflecting management s decision to allocate more of our research and development resources to fuel cell development 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses during the year ended december  amounted to approximately  compared to approximately  during the year ended december  the increase of  during compared to is primarily attributable to an increase in non cash charges relating to stock options and warrants of approximately  an increase in insurance costs of approximately  and an increase in selling and marketing expenses of approximately  somewhat offset by a decrease in executive and other consulting expenses of approximately  and a net decrease in various other sg a cost categories aggregating to approximately  amortization of intangible assets amounted to  during the year ended december   compared to  during the year ended december  the decrease is primarily attributable to intangible assets acquired in our june exchange offer for shares of medis el that we did not already own becoming fully amortized during the year ended december   partially offset by amortization of intangible assets acquired in our march acquisition of the remaining of more energy that we did not already own 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  we sustained net losses of  during the year ended december   compared to  during the year ended december  the decrease in the net losses can primarily be attributed to the discontinuation of the amortization of goodwill pursuant to our adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 resulting in a reduction in amortization expense of approximately  for the year ended december  and a decrease in costs related to stock options and warrants of  for the year ended december  we recognized revenues of approximately  and gross profit of approximately  during the year ended december   compared to none during the same periods in an aggregate of  of such revenues are attributable to a january agreement to develop for a third party an application for the use of our hecps in its fuel cell products 
the remaining  of such revenues are attributable to work performed under a completed january purchase order in which we designed a direct liquid fuel cell for use in a new energy pack for infantry soldiers 
all of such revenues are non recurring 
research and development costs amounted to  during the year ended december   compared to  during the year ended december  although total research and development costs incurred during the year ended december  decreased slightly compared to  costs relating to our fuel cell technologies increased by approximately  during the year ended december   compared to this increase in costs related to our fuel cell technologies were offset by reductions in costs related to our cellscan of approximately  during the year ended december   compared to  and to our toroidal technologies  stirling cycle system and linear compressor of approximately  during the year ended december   compared to the research and development activities for the periods presented include fuel cell technologies 
we incurred costs relating to our fuel cell technologies of approximately  during the year ended december   compared to costs of approximately  during the year ended december  this increases in our research and development expenses relating to our fuel cell technologies of approximately  during the year ended december  reflect management s decision to continue to devote substantial resources to the development of our fuel cell technologies 
cellscan 
we incurred costs relating to the refinement of the next generation cellscan system and on various cellscan research activities of approximately  during the year ended december   compared to costs of approximately  during the year ended december  the decrease can be primarily attributed to lower labor  materials and depreciation costs  somewhat offset by increases in costs incurred related to the retention of third party researchers in the development and testing of new cellscan applications 
toroidal technologies  stirling cycle system and linear compressor 
we incurred costs relating to our toroidal engine and compressor  stirling cycle system and linear compressor of approximately  during the year ended december   compared to costs of approximately  during the year ended december  ss 
the decrease during the year ended december  can be primarily attributed to decreases in costs incurred from the use of consultants and subcontractors  as well as decreases in labor costs  with respect to such technologies 
selling  general and administrative expenses during the year ended december  amounted to approximately  compared to approximately  during the year ended december  the decrease of  is primarily attributed to a reduction of approximately  in non cash charges relating to stock options and warrants during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   partially offset by increases in salary and related costs and selling and marketing expenses 
amortization of intangible assets amounted to  during the year ended december   compared to  during the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to our adoption of sfas no 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we discontinued amortization of our goodwill as of january   which resulted in decreases in amortization expense of approximately  for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources we finance our operations primarily through the proceeds of investor equity financing  which we expect will continue until such time as we successfully commercialize our fuel cell products or products derived from any of our other technologies 
furthermore  we currently have available a credit line which has not been drawn upon 
our working capital and capital requirements at any given time depend upon numerous factors  including  but not limited to the progress of research and development programs  the status of our technologies  and the level of resources that we devote to the development of our technologies  patents  marketing and sales capabilities 
another source of revenue or other means to effect our cash expenditures are collaborative arrangements with businesses and institutes for research and development and companies participating in the development of our technologies 
we have entered into a total of five collaborative arrangements with third parties relating to our fuel cell technologies  in which  since january  we have realized revenues of  on costs of sales of  as well as credits against our research and development costs of approximately  there can be no assurance that we will realize additional revenue or credits to our research and development expense from such collaborative arrangements still in existence or that we will enter into additional collaborative arrangements in the future 
there can be no assurance that we will raise additional funds through any financing approach implemented by us 
on march   we completed a rights offering in which we offered to our existing stockholders subscription rights to purchase an aggregate of  shares of our common stock at a purchase price of per share 
we received gross proceeds of approximately  from the rights offering  less related expenses of approximately  on september   we entered into a third amendment to the agreement governing our existing  revolving credit line 
pursuant to the amendment  the termination date of the revolving credit line was extended from july  to july  no other terms of the agreement were changed 
any outstanding balances would be collateralized by all deposits with the lender and an assignment of certain leases owned by a partnership in which our chief executive officer and our president are partners 
additionally  our chief executive officer and our president have personally guaranteed any amounts due under such credit line 
we have not borrowed any funds under this credit line to date 
on november   we completed an offer to exchange and exercise to holders of our approximately  outstanding warrants issued pursuant to our shareholder loyalty program the offer 
in order to participate in the offer  holders of loyalty program warrants who exchanged such warrants for new warrants exercisable at per share were also required to exercise the new warrants at the time of the exchange 
each holder of a new warrant  upon its exercise  received one share of common stock and a one year warrant to purchase an additional share of common stock at for every two new warrants exercised 
pursuant to the offer  we issued in exchange for the loyalty program warrants  shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase  shares of common stock for gross proceeds of approximately  less related costs of approximately  during the year ended december   warrantholders exercised outstanding warrants to acquire  shares of our common stock  at an exercise price of per share  for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately  during the year ended december   options to acquire an aggregate of  shares of our common stock issued under our stock option plan  as amended  were exercised  for proceeds of approximately  proceeds from all of the above financings and option and warrant exercises have been and will continue to be used for working capital  including for the continued development of our direct liquid fuel cell technologies and related products  as well as for selling  general and administrative expenses 
for the year ended december   net cash used in operating activities was  as compared to  for year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to management s decision to continue to increase levels of spending on research and development related to our fuel cell technologies during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  for the year ended december   net cash used in investing activities was  which represented purchases of property and equipment of  and a long term loan of  to gennadi finkelshtain in connection with our march acquisition from mr 
finkelshtain of the remaining of more energy that we did not already own 
this is compared to  for the year ended december   which represented  for the purchase of property and equipment  partially offset by proceeds of  from the disposal of property and equipment 
in  as compared to  we substantially increased the amount of spending on property and equipment related to the further development of our fuel cell technologies 
for the year ended december   cash aggregating  was provided by financing activities  compared to  for the year ended december  during the year ended december   cash was provided by the financing activities described in detail above 
the cash provided by financing activities during the year ended december  related to our march rights offering  which generated gross proceeds of  as discussed above  less costs of such offering incurred during the year ended december  of  the exercise of options to purchase our common stock  which generated gross proceeds of approximately  and the exercise of warrants to purchase our common stock issued pursuant to our shareholder loyalty program  which generated gross proceeds of approximately  as of december   we had approximately  in cash and cash equivalents  as well as an unused  revolving credit line which terminates in accordance with its terms on july  additionally in january  we issued  shares of our common stock in private sales to institutional investors  for gross proceeds aggregating approximately  less related expenses of approximately  from january  through march   options granted under our stock option plan were exercised to acquire an aggregate of approximately  shares of our common stock  for an aggregate exercise price of approximately  from january  through march   warrant holders exercised outstanding warrants to acquire an aggregate of  shares of our common stock  for an aggregate exercise price of  as of december   we believe that our cash resources  since augmented by the net proceeds from our january private placements  and monies available to us from our credit facility  will be sufficient to support our operating and developmental activities for at least the next two years and five months 
beyond such time  we may require capital infusions of cash to continue our operations  whether through debt financing  issuance of shares or from companies or other organizations participating in the development of our technologies 
however  to the extent we are unable to raise or acquire additional other funds  we will curtail research and development of one or more technologies until such time as we have adequate funds available 
commitments and contingencies the following table sets forth our contractual obligations at december  payment due by period contractual obligations total and thereafter operating lease obligation purchase obligations other long term liabilities note total note other long term liabilities represents our accrued severance pay as of december  since we do not expect a high level of employee turnover giving rise to the payment of significant amounts of severance obligations  we have included approximately of the total liability in each of the years through and the remainder in and thereafter 
tax matters as of december   for us federal income tax purposes  we have net operating loss carry forwards of approximately  for israeli income tax purposes  we have net operating loss carry forwards of approximately  since our inception  we have not had any taxable income 
also  neither we nor any of our subsidiaries have ever been audited by the united states or israeli tax authorities since incorporation 
the availability of our us net operating loss carry forwards may be reduced to the extent one or more direct or indirect holders of or greater amount of our common stock increases their equity interest in us by more than in the aggregate 
grants obtained from the state of israel medis el  our indirect wholly owned subsidiary  received approximately  in research and development grants from the office of the chief scientist of the ministry of commerce and industry of the state of israel from its inception to this is based upon a policy of the government of israel to provide grants of between and of qualifying approved research and development expenditures to promote research and development by israeli companies 
medis el received of qualifying approved research and development expenditures  with  of such funds being allotted for the cellscan and  allotted for the neuritor 
pursuant to the grant arrangement  medis el is required to pay of its sales of cellscan and neuritor products developed with the grant funds until the grant amounts are paid in full 
there is no requirement to repay the grants if the products developed with the grant funds are not sold 
if medis el sells the underlying technology prior to repaying the grant funds  it must first seek permission from the israeli government for such sale 
prior to medis el receiving grant funds in  medis el assumed from israel aircraft industries inc  our largest stockholder  its obligation relating to the repayment of grants out of future royalties  if any  of approximately  as of december   medis el s total contingent obligation for the repayment of grants  which includes the  is  neither we nor medis el presently receive any grants from the state of israel 
approved enterprise under the israeli law for the encouragement of capital investments   medis el was issued a certificate of approval as an approved enterprise 
under the law  medis el elected the combined path  pursuant to which medis el had the right to receive a government guaranteed bank loan of of the amount of the approved investment 
in addition  medis el had the right to receive a grant of of the approved investment  in which case the loan would be reduced by the amount of the grant 
medis el received investment grants of approximately  and loans of approximately  the investment grants were used to invest in equipment  furniture and fixtures and commercial vehicles 
the loan proceeds were used for the above as well as to acquire know how  leasehold improvements  marketing and working capital 
the loans were paid off in full during the year ended december  additionally  the tax liability in respect of medis el s income deriving from its approved enterprise activities is calculated at a rate of of income for a ten year period  with tax on dividends distributed of  instead of 
these tax benefits expire in in september  more energy  our fuel cell subsidiary  was granted approved enterprise status 
the benefits from the approved enterprise programs depend upon more energy fulfilling the conditions under the grant and the laws governing the grant 
more energy has chosen not to continue with its approved enterprise program and  thus  is not in compliance with these conditions 
it does not expect to incur any costs relating to not participating in the program 
critical accounting policies the following represents our critical accounting policies which reflect significant judgments and uncertainties and could possibly result in materially different results under different conditions and assumptions 
goodwill and intangible assets we consider accounting policies related to our goodwill and other intangible assets to be critical due to the estimation processes involved and their materiality to our financial statements 
as of december   the net book values of our goodwill and intangible assets were  and  respectively 
our goodwill and other intangible assets arose primarily as a result of three purchase accounting transactions our acquisition of the minority interest in medis inc in  our exchange of our shares for the minority interest in medis el in and our acquisition of the remaining of more energy that we did not already own in in amortizing our goodwill through december  and our intangible assets through december   we made estimates and assumptions regarding the useful lives of such assets 
if our estimates and assumptions change  the useful lives and resulting charges to operations for amortization of such assets would also change 
additionally  with respect to our goodwill and intangible assets  as of january   we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which was issued by the financial accounting standards board in june sfas no 
requires enterprises  effective january   to discontinue amortizing goodwill  and instead requires that goodwill be subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment 
as part of our initial evaluation of our goodwill and intangible assets for any possible impairment  as of january   we were required to use estimates and assumptions with respect to markets for our products  future cash flows  discount rates and timing of commercialization of our technologies in determining the fair value of our reporting units 
we have also performed annual tests for impairment of our goodwill in and the estimates we used assume that our products will be accepted and that we will gain market share in the future and will experience growth in such market share 
if we fail to deliver products or to achieve our assumed revenue growth rates or assumed gross margins  if the products fail to gain expected market acceptance  or if our estimates and or other assumptions change or other circumstances change with respect to future cash flows  discount rates and timing of commercialization of our technologies  we may  in the future  be required to record charges to operations for impairment of our goodwill and or our intangible assets 
stock options and warrants we also consider accounting policies related to stock options and warrants to be critical due to the estimation process involved 
we utilize stock options and warrants as an important means of compensation for employees  directors and consultants and also warrants as an instrument in our fundraising process 
accounting for such options and warrants  in some circumstances  results in significant non cash charges to our operations or accumulated loss 
there are assumptions and estimates involved in determining the value of such stock options and warrants and the timing of related charges to our operations or accumulated loss 
these estimates and assumptions include the expected term of the option  volatility of our stock price and interest rates 
the market price of our stock also has a significant impact on charges we incur related to stock options and warrants 
if these estimates and assumptions change or if our stock price changes  the charges to operations and or accumulated loss could also change significantly 
deferred income taxes we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to zero 
in the event that we were to determine that we are likely to be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be credited to operations in the period such determination was made 
recent accounting pronouncements in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
fin 
in december  the fasb modified fin to make certain technical corrections and address certain implementation issues that had arisen 
fin provides a new framework for identifying variable interest entities vie and determining when a company should include the assets  liabilities  noncontrolling interests and results of activities of a vie in its consolidated financial statements 
in general  a vie is a corporation  partnership  limited liability corporation  trust or any other legal structure used to conduct activities or hold assets that either i has an insufficient amount of equity to carry out its principal activities without additional subordinated financial support  ii has a group of equity owners that are unable to make significant decisions about its activities  or iii has a group of equity owners that do not have the obligations to absorb losses or the right to receive returns generated by its operations 
fin requires a vie to be consolidated if a party with an ownership  contractual or other financial interest in the vie a variable interest holder is obligated to absorb a majority of the risk of loss from the vie s activities  is entitled to receive a majority of the vie s residual returns if no party absorbs a majority of the vie s losses or both 
a variable interest holder that consolidates the vie is called the primary beneficiary 
upon consolidation  the primary beneficiary generally must initially record all of the vie s assets  liabilities and noncontrolling interests at fair value and subsequently account for the vie as if it were consolidated based on a majority voting interest 
fin also requires disclosures about vies that the variable interest holder is not required to consolidate but in which it has a significant variable interest 
we do not believe that we have any interests in any variable interest entities 
risk factors we have had limited revenues since inception and none from through  and we cannot predict when we will achieve profitability 
we have not been profitable and cannot predict when we will achieve profitability 
we have experienced net losses since our inception in april we  on a consolidated basis with our subsidiaries  have had limited revenues since inception and none from through we do not anticipate generating significant revenues until we successfully develop  commercialize and sell products derived from our fuel cell technologies or any of our other technologies  of which we can give no assurance 
we are unable to determine when we will generate significant revenues from the sale of any of such products 
we cannot predict when we will achieve profitability  if ever 
our inability to become profitable may force us to curtail or temporarily discontinue our research and development programs and our day to day operations 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that profitability  if achieved  can be sustained on an ongoing basis 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately  we may never complete the development of commercially viable fuel cells or any of our other technologies into marketable products 
we do not know when or whether we will successfully complete the development of commercially viable fuel cells for any of our target markets  or any of our other technologies 
we continue to seek to improve our fuel cell technologies  particularly in the areas of energy density  stability of power output  operating time  reduction of size and weight  use of the product in any orientation  as well as the temperature conditions under which the fuel cells can operate 
we also seek to improve the engineering design of our fuel cells and refill cartridges and integrate each fuel cell into a primary or auxiliary power source which can power various portable electronic devices  before we are able to produce a commercially viable product 
additionally  we must complete the production model of the converter used in our power pack to step up voltage 
failure to improve on our fuel cell technologies  including the failure of any of the above  could delay or prevent the successful development of commercially viable fuel cell products for any of our target markets 
developing any technology into a marketable product is a risky  time consuming and expensive process 
you should anticipate that we will encounter setbacks  discrepancies requiring time consuming and costly redesigns and changes and that there is the possibility of outright failure 
we may not meet our product development and commercialization milestones 
we have established milestones  based upon our expectations regarding our technologies at that time  which we use to assess our progress toward developing commercially viable fuel cells 
these milestones relate to technology and design improvements as well as to dates for achieving development goals 
if our products exhibit technical defects or are unable to meet cost or performance goals  including levels and stability of power output  useful life and reliability  our commercialization schedule could be delayed and third parties who are collaborating with us to develop our fuel cell technology  as well as potential purchasers of our initial commercial products  may decline to purchase such products or may opt to pursue alternative technologies 
generally  we have made technological advances meeting our milestone schedule with respect to developing commercially viable fuel cells  including the level of power density and longevity of use obtained 
we can give no assurance that our commercialization schedule will continue to be met as we further develop our fuel cells and our fuel cell products  or any of our other technologies or products 
customers will be unlikely to buy our fuel cell products unless we can demonstrate that they can be produced for sale to consumers at attractive prices 
to date  we have focused primarily on research and development of our fuel cell technologies 
consequently  we have no experience in manufacturing fuel cells or fuel cell products on a commercial basis 
we may manufacture our fuel cell products through third party manufacturers 
we can offer no assurance that either we or our manufacturing partners will develop efficient  automated  low cost manufacturing capabilities and processes to meet the quality  price  engineering  design and production standards or production volumes required to successfully mass market our fuel cell products 
even if we or our manufacturing partners are successful in developing such manufacturing capability and processes  we do not know whether we or they will be timely in meeting our product commercialization schedule or the production and delivery requirements of potential customers 
a failure to develop such manufacturing processes and capabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 
the price of fuel cells and fuel cell products is dependent largely on material and other manufacturing costs 
we are unable to offer any assurance that either we or a manufacturing partner will be able to reduce costs to a level which will allow production of a competitive product or that any product produced using lower cost materials and manufacturing processes will not suffer from a reduction in performance  reliability and longevity 
furthermore  although we have estimated a pricing structure for both our proposed power pack charger and our refueling cartridges  we can give no assurance that these estimates will be correct in light of any manufacturing process we adopt or distribution channels we use 
a commercially viable market for our fuel cell products may never develop or may take longer to develop than we anticipate 
a commercially viable market may never develop for our fuel cell products or any of our other technologies  or may develop more slowly than we anticipate 
fuel cells represent a new market  and we do not know whether end users will want to use them 
the development of a commercially viable market for our fuel cell products may be affected by many factors  some of which are out of our control  including the level to which the technology of our fuel cells has advanced  the emergence of newer  more competitive technologies and products  improvements to existing technologies  including existing rechargeable battery technology  the future cost of glycerol  ethanol  or any other hydrogen based fuels or other chemicals used for powering our fuel cells  regulations that affect or limit the use of the components in our fuel cells or our fuel cells in general  consumer perceptions of the safety of our products  and consumer reluctance to try a new product 
if a mass market fails to develop or develops more slowly than we anticipate  we may be unable to recover the losses we will have incurred in the development of our products and may never achieve profitability 
we will be unable to market or sell our fuel cell products or products derived from any of our other technologies if we are unsuccessful in entering into arrangements  alliances  joint ventures or licensing agreements with third parties 
as we do not have nor do we intend to develop our own marketing or wide scale manufacturing infrastructure  our ability to market  manufacture and sell our fuel cell technologies or any of our other technologies is wholly dependent on our entry into manufacturing  sales or distributing arrangements  strategic alliances  joint ventures or licensing agreements with third parties possessing such capabilities 
we can offer no assurance that we will be successful in entering into such arrangements  alliances  joint ventures or agreements or that the terms of which will be entirely beneficial to us 
problems or delays in our collaboration efforts with third parties to develop or market our fuel cell products could hurt our reputation and the reputation of our products 
we have entered into agreements with third parties who have agreed to assist us in developing or marketing our fuel cell products 
we are in discussions with other third parties and may enter into similar agreements with such other parties or others in the future  of which we can give no assurances of success 
these collaboration agreements contemplate that these third parties will work with our scientists to test various aspects of  or assist in developing components of  our fuel cells 
such tests or development efforts may encounter problems and delays for a number of reasons  including  without limitation  the failure of our technology  the failure of the technology of others  the failure to combine these technologies properly and the failure to maintain and service any test prototypes properly 
many of these potential problems and delays are beyond our control 
in addition  collaborative efforts  by their nature  often create problems due to miscommunications and disparate expectations and priorities among the parties involved and may result in unexpected modifications and delays in developing or marketing our fuel cell technologies 
any such problems or perceived problems with these collaborative efforts could hurt our reputation and the reputation of our products and technologies 
our efforts to protect our intellectual property may not offer sufficient protection  which could hinder our growth and success 
we regard our patents  trade secrets  copyrights and similar intellectual property rights as essential to our growth and success 
we rely upon a combination of patent  copyright and trademark laws  trade secret protection  confidentiality and non disclosure agreements and contractual provisions with employees and with third parties to establish and protect our proprietary rights 
we own  directly or indirectly through subsidiaries or companies in which we have an interest  patents for certain technologies and are currently applying for additional patents 
we can offer no assurance that we will succeed in receiving patent and other proprietary protection in all markets we enter  or  if successful  that such protection will be sufficient 
if we successfully develop and market any or all of our technologies  we expect to face efforts by larger companies and other organizations or authorities to undermine our patents by challenging or copying our intellectual property 
moreover  intellectual property rights are not protected in certain parts of the world 
we intend to vigorously defend our intellectual property against any challenges that may arise 
however  any infringement action initiated by us may be very costly and require the diversion of substantial funds from our operations and may require management to expend efforts that might otherwise be devoted to our operations 
claims by third parties that our technology infringes upon their patents may  if successful  prevent us from further developing or selling our technologies 
although we do not believe our business activities infringe upon the rights of others  nor are we aware of any pending or contemplated actions to such effect  we can give no assurance that our business activities will not infringe upon the proprietary rights of others  or that other parties will not assert infringement claims against us 
if we do not obtain additional financing  we may be forced to curtail our research and development efforts 
our ability to sustain our research and development program is dependent upon our ability to secure additional funding 
as of december   on a pro forma basis to give effect to our january private offerings  we believe that our cash resources  including monies available to us from our unused credit facility  will be sufficient to support our operating and developmental activities and requirements for the purchase of capital equipment  for approximately the next two and one half years 
after such time  or earlier if we decide to increase our spending levels  we may need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financing in order to be competitive  to accelerate our sales and marketing programs  to establish a stronger financial position and to continue our operations 
we can offer no assurance that we will be able to secure additional funding  or funding on terms acceptable to us  to meet our financial obligations  if necessary  or that a third party will be willing to make such funds available 
our failure to raise additional funds could require us to delay our research and product development efforts or cause us to default under the repayment terms of our revolving credit facility  if we were to borrow funds under that facility and we are unable to repay such borrowings 
furthermore  our failure to successfully develop or market our fuel cell products or products derived from any of our other technologies may materially adversely affect our ability to raise additional funds 
in any event  it is not possible to make any reliable estimate of the funds required to complete the development of our fuel cell technologies or any of our other technologies 
if we were to lose our technical talent or members of senior management and could not find appropriate replacements in a timely manner  our business could be adversely affected 
our success depends to a significant extent upon zvi rehavi  gennadi finkelshtain and the other scientists  engineers and technicians that seek out  recognize and develop our technologies  as well as our highly skilled and experienced management  including robert k 
lifton  our chief executive officer  and howard weingrow  our president 
the loss of the services of messrs 
rehavi and finkelshtain  of any of our other technical talent or of messrs 
lifton and weingrow could have a material adverse effect on our ability to develop our fuel cell technologies into commercial products or any of our other technologies into commercial products 
we possess key person life insurance of  on mr 
rehavi and  on mr 
finkelshtain 
although to date we have been successful in recruiting and retaining executive  managerial and technical personnel  we can offer no assurance that we will continue to attract and retain the qualified personnel needed for our business 
the failure to attract or retain qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business 
there may be adverse effects on our earnings and our stock price due to the large amount of goodwill and intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheet 
at december   our consolidated balance sheet showed approximately  of goodwill and intangible assets  with estimated useful lives of intangible assets of five years 
commencing january   in accordance with the recently enacted statement of financial accounting standards no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  such goodwill is no longer being charged ratably to expense but is subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment 
our adoption of sfas has resulted in the discontinuation as of january  of amortization of the remaining goodwill balance of approximately  which resulted in a reduction in operating expenses of approximately  for the year ended december  we continue to amortize the remaining unamortized balance of our intangible assets  which was approximately  at december  risks associated with conducting operations in israel could materially adversely affect our ability to complete the development of our fuel cell technology or any of our other technologies 
our research and development facilities  our pilot manufacturing facility for catalyst and electrodes  as well as some of our executive offices and back office functions  are located in the state of israel 
we are  therefore  directly affected by the political  economic and military conditions in israel 
any major hostilities involving israel or the interruption or curtailment of trade between israel and any other country  whether due to the israeli palestinian conflict or america s war against terrorism  among others  could have a material adverse effect on our ability to complete the development of any of our technologies or our ability to supply our technology to development partners  customers or vendors 
furthermore  any interruption or curtailment of trade between israel and any other country in which we have strategic relationships could similarly adversely affect such relationships 
in addition  all male adult permanent residents of israel under the age of  unless exempt  are obligated to perform up to days of military reserve duty annually and are subject to being called to active duty at any time under emergency circumstances 
some of our employees are currently obligated to perform annual reserve duty 
we are unable to assess what impact  if any  these factors may have upon our future operations 
in addition  historically  israel has suffered from high inflation and the devaluation of its currency  the new israeli shekel  or nis  compared to the us dollar 
future inflation or further devaluations of the nis may have a negative impact on our nis based obligations over time upon substantial price increases caused by inflation 
it may be difficult to serve process on or enforce a judgment against our israeli officers and directors  making it difficult to bring a successful lawsuit against us  or our officers and directors  individually or in the aggregate 
service of process upon our directors and officers  many of whom reside outside the united states  may be difficult to obtain within the united states 
furthermore  any judgment obtained in the united states against us may not be collectible within the united states to the extent our assets are located outside the united states 
this could limit the ability of our stockholders to sue us based upon an alleged breach of duty or other cause of action 
we have been informed by our israeli legal counsel that there is doubt as to the enforceability of civil liabilities under the securities act of and the securities exchange act of in original actions instituted in israel 
however  subject to limitation  israeli courts may enforce united states final executory judgments for liquidated amounts in civil matters  obtained after a trial before a court of competent jurisdiction  according to the rules of private international law currently prevailing in israel  which enforce similar israeli judgments  provided that due service of process has been effected and the defendant was given a reasonable opportunity to defend  the obligation imposed by the judgment is executionable according to the laws relating to the enforceability of judgments in israel  such judgment is not contrary to public policy  security or sovereignty of the state of israel and such judgment is executionable in the state in which it was given  such judgments were not obtained by fraud and do not conflict with any other valid judgments in the same manner between the same parties  and an action between the same parties in the same matter is not pending in any israeli court at the time the lawsuit is instituted in the foreign court 
foreign judgments enforced by israeli courts generally will be payable in israeli currency  which can then be converted into united states dollars and transferred out of israel 
the judgment debtor may also pay in dollars 
judgment creditors must bear the risk of unfavorable exchange rates 
we intend to retain all of our future earnings  if any  for use in our business operations and do not expect to pay dividends to our stockholders 
we have not paid any dividends on our common stock to date and do not anticipate declaring any dividends in the foreseeable future 
our board presently intends to retain all earnings  if any  for use in our business operations 
we currently face and will continue to face significant competition 
our fuel cells face and will continue to face significant competition 
a large number of corporations  national laboratories and universities in the united states  canada  europe  japan and elsewhere are actively engaged in the development and manufacture of power sources  including batteries and fuel cells  both for portable electronic devices and other uses 
each of these competitors has the potential to capture market share in various markets  which would have a material adverse effect on our position in the industry and our financial results 
we expect competition to intensify greatly as the need for new energy alternatives becomes more apparent and continues to increase 
some of our competitors are well established and have substantially greater managerial  technical  financial  marketing and product development resources 
additionally  companies  both large and small  are entering the markets in which we compete 
there can also be no assurance that current and future competitors will not be more successful in the markets in which we compete than we have been  or will be in the future 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in such a competitive environment 
we expect to be dependent on third party suppliers for the supply of key materials and components for our products 
if and when either we or our manufacturing  strategic alliance or joint venture partners commence production of our fuel cells or fuel cell products  of which there can be no assurance  we expect to rely upon third party suppliers to provide requisite materials and components 
a supplier s failure to supply materials or components in a timely manner  or to supply materials and components that meet our quality  quantity or cost requirements  or our inability to obtain substitute sources for these materials and components in a timely manner or on terms acceptable to us  could harm our ability to manufacture our fuel cells 
we or our manufacturing  strategic alliance or joint venture partners may be unable to obtain comparable materials or components from alternative suppliers  and that could adversely affect our ability to produce viable fuel cells or significantly raise the cost of producing fuel cells or fuel cell products 
in addition  platinum is a component of our fuel cells 
platinum is a scarce natural resource and we are dependent upon a sufficient supply of this commodity 
while we do not anticipate significant near or long term shortages in the supply of platinum  such shortages could adversely affect our ability to produce commercially viable fuel cells or significantly raise our cost of producing fuel cells

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk impact of inflation and devaluation on results of operations  liabilities and assets in connection with our currency use  we operate in a mixed environment 
payroll is paid in our local currency and the local currency of each of our subsidiaries  such as the new israeli shekel nis with respect to our israeli based operations  as are most of our other operating expenses 
consideration for virtually all sales is either in dollars or dollar linked currency 
as a result  not all monetary assets and all monetary liabilities are linked to the same base in the same amount at all points in time  which may cause currency fluctuation related losses 
in order to help minimize such losses  we currently invest our liquid funds in both dollar based and nis based assets 
for many years prior to  the israeli economy was characterized by high rates of inflation and devaluation of the israeli currency against the united states dollar and other currencies 
since the institution of the israeli economic program in  inflation  while continuing  has been significantly reduced and the rate of devaluation has been substantially diminished 
however  israel effected devaluations of the nis against the dollar as follows in and  the rate of inflation in israel exceeded the rate of devaluation of the nis against the dollar  but in  and the rate of devaluation of the nis against the dollar exceeded the rate of inflation in israel

in  the rate of inflation deflation in israel was and the rate of devaluation appreciation of the nis was  against the dollar 
additionally  in  through january  the rate of inflation in israel was and the rate of devaluation of the nis was against the dollar 
impact of political and economic conditions the state of hostility which has existed in varying degrees in israel since  its unfavorable balance of payments and its history of inflation and currency devaluation  all represent uncertainties which may adversely affect our business
