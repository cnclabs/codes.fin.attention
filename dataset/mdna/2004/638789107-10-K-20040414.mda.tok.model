item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of the results of operations and financial condition of the company should be read in conjunction with the selected consolidated financial data and the audited consolidated financial statements of the company and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this document 
overview natrol  inc and subsidiaries collectively  the company manufactures and markets branded  high quality dietary supplement products  including vitamins  minerals  hormonal supplements  herbal products  specialty combination formulations and sports nutrition supplements 
prior to the fourth quarter of  the company operated three operating segments 
the segments included the natrol operating segment  which manufactures and markets natrol and laci le beau branded products  and which  under the epi name  contract manufactures products and sells raw material ingredients  and which under the tamsol  inc subsidiary which was established in and discontinued in attempted to market natrol products directly to consumers  prolab nutrition  inc prolab  which developed and marketed sports nutrition products  and annasa  inc annasa  which was established in to develop a direct to consumer multi level marketing business and which was discontinued in december beginning in the fourth quarter of  the prolab operating segment was consolidated into the natrol operating segment 
with the annasa segment discontinued  the company currently has one operating segment 
the company also ceased reporting prolab as an independent operating segment  beginning with the fourth quarter of see discussion in footnote to the consolidated financial statements 
in  the company had income before income taxes from continuing operations of  however during the nine months ended september  the company s prolab segment had net a loss before income taxes of million 
the company consolidated its prolab subsidiary into natrol in order to reduce costs thereby improving the prolab brand s contribution to the results of operations 
operating as a separate segment  prolab consistently reported net losses 
with prolab operating as a brand similar to laci le beau  prolab s accounting  sales  marketing  and product development is managed by personnel within the natrol headquarters organization thereby eliminating the need for independent prolab departments in each of these areas 
the company sells its core products under the natrol brand name through multiple distribution channels throughout the united states  including domestic health food stores and mass market drug  retail and grocery store chains 
in addition to the core brand  natrol sells herbal teas under the laci le beau brand name within the same channels of trade as the natrol core brand 
the company markets sports nutrition products under the prolab brand name 
prolab products are sold primarily in health clubs and heath and fitness centers as well as the health food store channel of trade and internationally in select countries through international distributors 
during  the company launched a multi level marketing company using the annasa brand name 
annasa  had limited operations in  with approximately  in revenue 
the full launch of annasa commenced in january the company expected to continue to invest in annasa during however  revenue  profit and cash flow projections failed to meet expectations and the company discontinued annasa s operations at the end of  selling annasa s intellectual property  formulations  and miscellaneous assets to an investment group made up primarily of former distributors 
the company received  for the intellectual property assets and received a commitment from the investor group to purchase annasa s remaining inventory at cost 
also in  the company established tamsol  inc as a wholly owned subsidiary whose purpose was to market natrol products directly to consumers 
the tamsol unit generated only  of revenue in and  in and was discontinued at year end natrol products are sold in most mass market chain drug retail outlets such as walgreens  rite aid  walmart  eckerd  cvs  most health food stores including whole foods markets  vitamin cottage  hi health and wild oats and  to a more limited degree  grocery stores such as kroger and ralphs 
the company is faced with substantial competition from other vendors and private label house brands which are strongly supported by the company s largest mass market customers 
private label business has been a significant growth element within the vms industry 
the growth of private label sales impacts the sales of branded products such as those distributed by natrol 
as noted above  private label sales are  to an ever greater degree  being emphasized by large mass market retailers 
as such  the growth of brands such as natrol  laci le beau  and prolab within food  drug  and general mass market merchants remains both highly competitive and uncertain 
in and  the company focused a large part of its efforts on analyzing the movement of its products within its key customers 
a key goal was to reduce the high level of returns the company was experiencing 
product returns are a recurring part of the company s business 
products may be returned for various reasons including expiration dates or lack of sufficient sales velocity 
during  returns and reimbursements for damages and outdated products amounted to of gross sales  a significant decrease from  when returns represented approximately of gross sales 
the company worked with its customers to eliminate slow moving and unprofitable items and to replace them with products that are in greater demand 
in  the comparable percentage improved to 
in  the company also focused on strengthening its position within key retail accounts as well as in securing additional distribution for its core items at accounts that carried little or no natrol  laci le beau or prolab items 
critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements of the company are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which requires the company to make certain estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
the company sells its products to retail outlets through a direct sales force and a national distributor network 
the company recognizes revenue from sales only after product is shipped and title is transferred 
net sales represent product shipped less actual and estimated future returns  spoilage allowances  allowances for product deemed to be unsaleable by customers  free goods shipped to customers for promotional or other purposes and slotting fees 
estimates and allowances are based upon known claims and an estimate of additional returns  however  the amount of future returns can be reasonably estimated 
the company s recognition of revenue from sales to distributors and retailers is impacted by agreements giving them rights to return damaged and outdated products as well as the fact that as a practical business matter  the company and its customers are constantly working to ensure the profitability of its products within retailers by rotating slow moving items out of stores and replacing those products with what the company and the retailer expect will be more profitable  faster selling items 
the company s obligation to accept returns of slow moving items may or may not be contractually bound 
the company regularly monitors its historical patterns of returns from customers as well as current and ongoing sales to customers and  when information is available  consumer purchases of the company s products from the company s customers 
when historical trends with respect to customer returns are quantifiable  the company will create an allowance for future returns at the time sales are made 
should the company determine that a particular product is slow moving and will eventually result in significant returns  it will provide for those returns at the time such an assessment is made 
in recent years  as a result of a combination of the factors described above  gross sales have been materially reduced to reflect the estimated amount of returns 
it is also possible that returns could increase rapidly and significantly in the future 
accordingly  estimating product returns requires significant management judgment 
in addition  different return estimates that we reasonably could have used would have had a material impact on our reported sales and thus have had a material impact on the presentation of our results of operations 
for those reasons  we believe that the accounting estimate related to product returns is a critical accounting estimate 
in preparing our financial statements  the total amount charged against sales for returns and damages and outdates in  and respectively  was million  million  and million 
our estimate for returns at december  was million less than at december  our estimate at december  was million greater than our estimate at december  the decrease in the estimate of returns at december  is due in part to the million decrease in actual returns in impairment of goodwill 
the determination as to whether goodwill is impaired requires a great deal of judgment 
prior to january   the company evaluated goodwill for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicated that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
in  the company determined that it was appropriate to write down million of goodwill associated with its prolab reporting unit 
the company focused on prolab s declining sales volume  issues surrounding prolab s ephedrine based products  the sports nutrition market as a whole  and cash flows 
based on all of these considerations  the company deemed that in accordance with the then current accounting rules  a million write down of goodwill was appropriate 
on january   the company adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill not be amortized 
in accordance with such adoption  the company identified all reporting units in conjunction with the provisions of sfas no 
and allocated all goodwill accordingly 
beginning in  goodwill is evaluated for impairment annually  or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable 
the company tested goodwill for impairment using the two step process prescribed in sfas no 
the first step is a screen for potential impairment  while the second step measures the amount of the impairment  if any 
the company performed the first step of the impairment test  and determined that the there was no impairment of the prolab segment  but that there was potential impairment of the natrol segment 
the company performed the second step as of january  for the natrol segment and determined that its goodwill balance of  was impaired 
the impairment loss was recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle  net of income tax benefit of approximately million  in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  the remaining goodwill balance at december  and was approximately million 
in the fourth quarter of  the company completed its annual goodwill impairment testing and does not believe that goodwill has been impaired 
additionally  during march  the company settled its litigation with the former owners of prolab nutrition  inc the company received million in cash  which will be reflected in the financial statements for the quarter ending march  as a reduction of goodwill 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 the company will  at a minimum  perform an annual impairment review of the goodwill 
income taxes 
deferred income tax assets have been established for future tax benefits related to deductible goodwill for which the company has recorded an impairment charge and for certain other temporary items 
the aggregate benefit of which is approximately million 
realization of this benefit is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income in future periods 
although it is not assured  management believes it is more likely than not that the carrying value of this benefit will be realized 
the amount of the benefit that is considered realizable  however  could change if estimates of future taxable income are adjusted in future periods 
inventory 
the company monitors its inventory and analyzes it on a regular basis 
cycle counts are taken daily to verify inventory levels 
in addition  the company analyzes the movement of items within its inventory in an effort to determine the likelihood that inventory will be sold or used before expiration dates are reached 
the company provides an allowance against that portion of its inventory that it believes is unlikely to be sold or used before expiration dates are reached 
at december   inventory allowances were approximately million 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales 
net sales in increased  or million  to million from million in net sales in were positively affected by a lower level of returns than in the level of returns was approximately of gross shipments in and as compared to of gross shipments in during  the company worked to rationalize its product offerings in the mass market channel of trade where returns are most likely to occur 
during it became apparent to the company that sales of secondary and tertiary items in this channel of trade were not sufficient to prevent significant product returns 
this rationalization process directly resulted in lower net revenue since the company stopped selling many secondary and tertiary items within mass market accounts 
the company limited the sale of these items to specialty stores where the volume of sales was sufficient to prevent a large volume of returns 
as a result of this rationalization process  the level of returns was reduced substantially in both and the reduction in returns helped increase net revenue since returns reduce gross sales revenue when calculating net sales 
the company did not have any products that represented or more of its gross sales in either or no customer accounted for or more of net sales in one customer  walmart  accounted for of the company s net sales in the company s top customers accounted for approximately and of the company s net sales in and  respectively 
gross profit

selling and marketing expenses 
selling and marketing expenses increased by to in from of net sales in the dollar amount spent for sales and marketing expenses increased or  in  from million in to million in of the  net increase in selling and marketing expenses  approximately  was due to the increased cost of shipping product and approximately  of payroll increases 
these increases were partially offset by decreases in media spending and other forms of promotional support and well as decreases in other expenses 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased or million in from million in to million in of this increase  was due to the establishment of a product development department in the fourth quarter of general insurance expenses increased  relative to in order to reduce these expenditures  the company began to self insure its product liability exposure in july of and it is expected that insurance expenses will be less in than in depreciation expense was  higher in than in  primarily because of the implementation of the company s sap software system in november the company also accrued  more for bad debt expenses in than it did in the company increased its allowances for bad debts due to the larger amount of receivables carried at year end than at year end the remainder of the increase in general and administrative expenses was due to increases in payroll partially offset by miscellaneous decreases in other expenditures 
interest income expense  net 
interest expense was  in versus interest expense of  in interest income in was  versus  in interest expense decreased in as the company had less debt outstanding 
interest income decreased due to the level of interest rates as well as the average level of cash on hand earning interest 
income tax provision benefit 
income taxes were  in as compared to  in the difference in income tax expense was primarily due to the differences in taxable income earned in versus the company s tax rate in was in versus in the difference was due primarily to the fact that the some of the company s expenses cannot be expensed for tax purposes 
when earnings are at a low level  these permanent adjustments to taxable income have a proportionately greater effect on the company s tax rate than when total earnings are at a higher level 
in december  the company discontinued its annasa and tamsol units 
annasa  a subsidiary of natrol  a multi level marketer of proprietary nutritional products began operations in tamsol  was also formed in  to generate direct to consumer sales via radio  television  direct mail and other non retail venues 
annasa had revenue of  in and  in operating losses for annasa in were approximately million and  were approximately million in these losses were higher than anticipated and the company discontinued the operations of annasa at year end during  tamsol had  of net revenue and a loss before income taxes of  during  tamsol failed to meet revenue or profit goals and its operations were discontinued during the fourth quarter of for the year ended december   tamsol had net revenue of  and a loss before income taxes of  the company has reclassified its financial statements to segregate the revenues  direct costs and expenses excluding allocated costs  assets and liabilities and cash flows of the discontinued operations 
the net operating results  net assets and net cash flows of these businesses have been reported as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales 
net sales in decreased  or million  to million from million in net sales in both years were adversely affected by a high level of product returns 
the level of returns was approximately of gross sales in and of gross sales in during  the company worked to rationalize its product offerings in the mass market channel of trade where returns are most likely to occur 
during it became apparent to the company that sales of secondary and tertiary items were not sufficient to prevent significant product returns 
this rationalization process directly resulted in lower net revenue since the company stopped selling many secondary and tertiary items within mass market accounts  instead limiting the sale of these items to specialty stores where the volume of sales was sufficient to prevent a large volume of returns 
as a result of this rationalization process  the level of returns was reduced substantially from that experienced in the company had no products greater than of gross sales in the company s gross sales of the msm line of joint care products comprised in one customer  walmart  accounted for of the company s net sales in no one customer accounted for more than of net sales in the company s top customers accounted for approximately of the company s net sales in and of net sales in gross profit

selling and marketing expenses 
selling and marketing expenses decreased or approximately million to million in from million in as a percentage of net sales  selling and marketing expenses decreased to in from of net sales in this reduction was primarily due to a decrease in the number of promotions and advertisements run during the year

taking this factor into consideration  g a expenses rose million when compared to a majority  or  of the increase was due to legal expenses which increased largely due to the successful defense of label claims and a california proposition matter which the company is resolving and believes will ultimately be resolved in its favor 
depreciation increased approximately  when compared to during  the company invested approximately million in a new sap software system as well as new servers and other peripheral equipment to run the software 
sap is an integrated manufacturing  accounting  and management system 
the sap system was put into service in november general business and product liability insurance expenses also rose  in the company experienced an increase in the price of insurance in november as it sought to renew its policies 
the price of certain types of insurance rose nearly five fold while the amount of coverage offered within the policies was reduced sharply the remaining increase in g a expenses in over was due to general increases in payroll and the other expenses of maintaining the company s business 
impairment of goodwill 
in  the company determined that it was appropriate to write down million of goodwill associated with its prolab reporting unit 
the company focused on prolab s declining sales volume  issues surrounding prolab s ephedrine based products  the sports nutrition market as a whole  and undiscounted cash flows 
based on all of these considerations  the company deemed that in accordance with the then current accounting rules  a million write down of goodwill was appropriate 
on january   the company adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill not be amortized 
in accordance with such adoption  the company identified all reporting units in conjunction with the provisions of sfas no 
and allocated all goodwill accordingly

the company tested goodwill for impairment using the two step process prescribed in sfas no 
the first step is a screen for potential impairment  while the second step measures the amount of the impairment  if any 
the company performed the first step of the impairment test  and determined that the there was no impairment of the prolab segment  but that there was potential impairment of the natrol segment 
the company performed the second step as of january  for the natrol segment and determined that its goodwill balance of  was impaired 
the impairment loss was recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle  net of income tax benefit of approximately million  in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  interest income expense  net 
interest expense in was  versus interest expense of  in interest income in was  versus  in interest expense decreased in as the company had less debt outstanding 
in addition to the debt on its property  during part of  the company also paid interest on outstanding borrowings related to its line of credit 
income tax provision benefit 
income tax expense was  in  and the effective income tax rate was approximately 
in addition  the company recorded an income tax benefit of  related to the cumulative effect of the change in an accounting principle adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the company also received an income tax benefit of  from discontinued operations in although the company had a pretax loss of  in  income tax expense was  as the loss included a charge of million related to non deductible goodwill 
liquidity and capital resources at december   the company had working capital of million  as compared to million in working capital at december  during  the company deposited million with an insurance company as part of the company s self insurance program 
this restricted cash  is classified as a non current asset in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
the restricted cash earns interest a current rate of per annum  and will be returned to the company should the company terminate the policy 
the policy  which is cancelable by the company  is effective through net cash used in operating activities was million for the year ended december  versus net cash provided of million in and million in the use of cash in  consisted of million from discontinued operations  million from changes in operating assets and liabilities  net of million provided by non cash charges 
the primary uses from operating assets and liabilities were increases of million in accounts receivable   in inventory  a decrease of million in accrued expenses offset by an increase in accounts payable of the non cash charges consisted primarily of million of depreciation  an increase in bad debt allowance  net of an increase in net deferred income tax assets 
at december   the company s days sales outstanding in its trade receivable was approximately days versus days in and days in net cash used in investing activities was million in  million in and  in in july  the company deposited million with an insurance company as part of a self insurance program 
the company earns on the million of restricted cash the policy period of the self insurance program is five years 
the company elected to self insure upon completion of a retrospective review and analysis of cost  coverage  litigation asserted by insurers issuing standard general and product liability coverage  litigation expense and claims resolution history 
the company concluded that the use of traditional insurance did not limit the company s exposure to advertising and regulatory claims which traditional coverage refused to cover  and that self insurance would not increase the risk of claims arising out of the normal course of business 
this program has reduced insurance premiums  based on actual payments made in  by approximately million on an annualized basis 
nearly all of the cash used for investing activities in  and  with the exception of the insurance deposit made in  was for the acquisition of property  plant and equipment 
substantially all of the investment in related to the installation of a new integrated sap software system and related computer equipment to manage the company s business 
net cash provided by financing activities was  in versus net cash used of  in and million for the year ended december  during  the company reduced its debt by  this use of cash was offset by  raised through the exercise of employee stock option or the sale of stock to employees through the company s employee stock purchase program

the company believes that its cash balance together with cash generated from operations and the million prolab settlement should be sufficient to fund its anticipated working capital needs and planned capital expenditures for the next months 
however  if the company does not meet its operating plan it may also need additional borrowings to fund working capital needs 
the company currently has no outstanding debt on its books other than the mortgage debt on its properties 
because the company s debt is limited  the company believes that financing for its fixed asset needs will be available at reasonable rates with reasonable terms 
however  there is no guarantee that  should the company need additional capital for capital expansion or for working capital  that financial institutions will be willing to provide capital to the company 
also  in providing the company with additional funds  potential lenders may seek to institute covenants restricting the company from certain activities and if the company deems it necessary to borrow funds with these restrictions in place  it may find that its ability to compete effectively in its market sector is hindered 
in order to meet its long term liquidity needs  the company may be required to incur additional indebtedness or issue additional equity and debt securities  subject to market and other conditions 
there can be no assurance that such additional financing will be available on terms acceptable to the company or at all 
the failure to raise the funds necessary to finance its future cash requirements or consummate future acquisitions could adversely affect the company s ability to pursue new acquisitions and could negatively affect its operations in future periods
