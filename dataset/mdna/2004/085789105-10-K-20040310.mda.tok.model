item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion provides information on the results of operations for each of the three years ended december   and and the financial condition  liquidity and capital resources as of december  and the financial statements and the notes thereto contain detailed information that should be referred to in conjunction with this discussion 
the profitability of the company s operations in any particular accounting period will be directly related to the average realized prices of oil  gas and electricity sold  the type and volume of oil and gas produced and electricity generated and the results of acquisition  development  exploitation and exploration activities 
the average realized prices for natural gas and electricity will fluctuate from one period to another due to regional market conditions and other factors  while oil prices will be predominantly influenced by world supply and demand 
the aggregate amount of oil and gas produced may fluctuate based on the success of development and exploitation of oil and gas reserves pursuant to current reservoir management 
the cost of natural gas used in the company s steaming operations and electrical generation  production rates  labor  maintenance expenses and production t axes are expected to be the principal influences on operating costs 
accordingly  the results of operations of the company may fluctuate from period to period based on the foregoing principal factors  among others 
results of operations in  the company achieved a record year for revenues and its second highest net income 
the company earned million  or per share diluted  in on revenues of million  up from million  or per share diluted  on revenues of million in  and up from million  or

boe d barrels of oil equivalent per day mwh d megawatt hours per day mmbtu million british thermal units in august  the company completed the acquisition of the brundage canyon properties  for approximately million 
the company believes that this property presents a significant opportunity for growth due to the considerable amount of underexploited acreage 
at year end  proved reserves for this property were approximately million boe  or of total reserves 
subsequent to the acquisition  the company pursued a drilling program which included the drilling of wells  of which were producing at year end 
as a result  current production has increased to nearly  barrels per day for brundage canyon 
the company s oil and gas production reached record levels in due primarily to the success of the company s development activities on its california properties  the acquisition of leases in the brundage canyon field in utah in august and the drilling activities on these utah properties in the last four months of oil and gas production boe d for was  up and  respectively  from  in and  in the company primarily is at risk to reductions in operating income as a result of declines in crude oil and electricity prices and increases in natural gas prices 
to assist in mitigating these risks  the company periodically enters into various types of commodity hedges 
see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the average sales price per boe of the company s oil and gas  net of hedging  was  up and from and received in and  respectively 
approximately of the company s sales volumes in were crude oil  with of the crude oil being heavy oil produced in california which is sold under a long term contract based on the higher of wti minus a fixed differential or the company s average posted price plus a premium 
the brundage canyon crude oil is priced at wti less a fixed differential 
during  wti prices per barrel reached a high of  a low of and averaged for the year compared to an average of and in and  respectively 
the company produced  mwh d of electricity in  comparable to  mwh d in  but up from  mwh d produced in the company s cogeneration facilities were shut in for a number of months in due to non payment by the utilities that were contractually obligated to purchase the company s electricity 
during  the company received an average sales price for its electricity per mwh of compared to in and in during  electricity prices were  relative to the cost of natural gas to generate electricity  improved from in january  three standard offer contract terms were reinstated on certain generating capacity of which the output had been sold by the company on the open market during all of and the majority of this volume represented approximately of the company s electricity sales output 
under the terms of the standard offer contracts  the price received for the electricity is based on the cost of natural gas 
the company consumes approximately  mmbtu of natural gas per day for use in generating steam and of this total  approximately is consumed in the company s cogeneration operations 
by maintai ning a correlation between electricity and natural gas prices  the company is able to better control its cost of producing steam 
three of the standard offer contracts expired on december  however  by order of the california public utilities commission cpuc  in december the respective utilities offered extensions of the standard offer contracts for up to one year 
the cpuc issued a decision in january that establishes rules under which the california utilities are required to offer standard offer contracts to certain qualifying facilities qf  such as berry  for a term of five years 
in january  the company accepted one year extensions of these contracts and is evaluating its options beyond the revised termination dates 
operating costs from oil and gas operations were million in  up and from million and million in and  respectively 
on a per barrel basis  operating costs cost were in compared to and in and  respectively 
steam costs were higher in as the cost for natural gas per mmbtu increased to from in although natural gas prices in of were higher than the prices  the company had shut in its cogeneration operations for a portion of due to the california electricity crisis resulting in reduced steam injection volumes and lower total operating costs in the company also injected an average of  bspd in  up from  bspd in and  bspd in this increase in injected steam volumes also contributed to higher operating costs in the company anti cipates operating costs to average between and per boe in dd a in was million  or per boe  up from million  or per boe  in and million  or per boe  in dd a in was higher due to the acquisition of the brundage canyon properties in utah and the cumulative effect of development activities in recent years 
the company anticipates its total dd a charges for will approximate million or range from to per boe 
g a expenses in were million  or per boe  up from million  or per boe in and up from million  or per boe in contributing to the increase in was higher compensation expenses  the expansion into the rocky mountain region  and a higher level of acquisition activity

interest expense in was million  or 
per boe  up from million  or 
per boe  in but down from million  or 
per boe  in the company s borrowings at year end were million  up from million in due to the acquisition of its brundage canyon properties in august in  the company recorded income of million  which represented the recovery of a portion of the million of the receivables from electricity sales that were written off in due to non payment by utilities contractually obligated to purchase the company s electricity 
the company experienced an effective tax rate of in  down from the and reported in and  respectively 
the low effective tax rate is primarily a result of significant eor tax credits earned by the company s continued investment in the development of its thermal eor projects  both through capital expenditures and continued steam injection 
this is the sixth consecutive year that the company has achieved an effective tax rate below versus the combined federal and state statutory rate of 
the company believes it will continue to earn significant eor tax credits and have an effective tax rate in the to range in  based on wti prices averaging between and 
during and early  the company leased a total of approximately  acres in kansas and  acres in illinois to explore for economic concentrations of coalbed methane gas at a total lease cost of approximately million 
a five well pilot was drilled in the wabaunsee county portion of the kansas acreage in the fourth quarter of initial water production was less than expected with no resulting gas pressure buildup and the gas content of the coals was later determined to be significantly lower than anticipated 
the company concluded that this pilot will not produce commercial quantities of natural gas and  therefore  wrote off the cost to drill these wells and the associated acreage in for a pre tax charge to operations of million 
in august  the company completed the sale of approximately  leased acres in jackson county  kansas for approximately million  while retaining an overriding royalty interest in the property 
the company recovered its cost in the property 
the company also drilled a second five well pilot in jasper county  illinois in the fourth quarter of the wells were subsequently re fractured in the third quarter of in an attempt to more efficiently dewater the coal seam and reduce the reservoir pressure to increase eventual gas production 
although reservoir pressure decreased over time  it was determined near year end that gas volumes are not likely to be sufficient to realize commercial production  therefore  the costs to drill these wells and an impairment of the acreage was recorded in the fourth quarter of  which resulted in a pre tax charge of million 
the company s objectives in include the continued evaluation of cbm activities in illinois and further delineation of our cbm acreage in kansas 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources working capital as of december  was negative million  greater than a negative million at december  and million at december  net cash provided by operating activities increased to million  up from million in and up from million in the company s net increase in borrowings on its credit line was million in cash was used to fund million in property acquisitions  for capital expenditures of million and to pay dividends of million 
total capital expenditures in  excluding acquisitions  were million and included the drilling of new wells and completing workovers on its california properties and the drilling of new wells and completion of one workover on its brundage canyon properties in utah 
excluding any future acquisitions in  the company plans to spend approximately million on capital projects including million to drill new wells and perform workovers in california and million to drill new wells and perform workovers in the rocky mountain and mid continent regions 
with this increased development and a full year of production from brundage canyon  the company anticipates that production will average between  and  boe per day in  up over from an average  boe per day in the company successfully completed a new million unsecured three year credit facility in july the facility replaced the previous million unsecured facility which was due to mature in january the new facility recognizes the company s strong financial position and should provide significant low cost capital for the company to meet its growth objectives 
in august  the company drew upon this facility to finance the million purchase of the brundage canyon  utah assets 
as of december   the company had million available under the facility 
at year end  the company had no subsidiaries  no special purpose entities and no off balance sheet debt 
the company did not enter into any significant related party transactions in contractual obligations the company s contractual obligations as of december  are as follows in thousands contractual obligations thereafter total long term debt operating lease obligations firm natural gas transportation contract total critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions for the reporting period and as of the financial statement date 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
actual results could differ from those amounts 
a critical accounting policy is one that is important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results  and requires management to make difficult subjective and or complex judgments 
critical accounting policies cover accounting matters that are inherently uncertain because the future resolution of such matters is unknown 
the company believes the following accounting policies are critical policies  accounting for oil and gas reserves  environmental liabilities  income taxes and asset retirement obligations 
oil and gas reserves include proved reserves that represent estimated quantities of crude oil and natural gas which geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
the oil and gas reserves are based on estimates prepared by independent engineering consultants and are used to calculate dd a and determine if any potential impairment exists related to the recorded value of the company s oil and gas properties 
the company reviews  on a quarterly basis  its estimates of costs of the cleanup of various sites including sites in which governmental agencies have designated the company as a potentially responsible party 
when it is probable that obligations have been incurred and where a minimum cost or a reasonable estimate of the cost of remediation can be determined  the applicable amount is accrued 
actual costs can differ from estimates due to changes in laws and regulations  discovery and analysis of site conditions and changes in technology 
the company makes certain estimates in determining its provision for income taxes 
these estimates in determining taxable income  among other things  may include various tax planning strategies  the timing of deductions and the utilization of tax attributes 
management is required to make judgments based on historical experience and future expectations on the future abandonment cost of its oil and gas properties and equipment 
the company reviews its estimate of the future obligation quarterly and accrues the estimated obligation monthly based on sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
recent accounting developments in the fourth quarter of  the company adopted the supplemental disclosure requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  which amended sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
the company continues to record compensation related to employee stock options based on the intrinsic value method per apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas no 
encourages companies to voluntarily elect to record the compensation based on market value either prospectively  as defined in sfas no 
 or retroactively or in a modified prospective method 
the company uses the black scholes model to calculate and disclose the market value of its options granted 
the company does not advocate nor does it believe that the black scholes model can properly determine the val ue of a stock option  like berry s  that vest over a period of time and is not freely tradable upon grant 
therefore  the company has delayed the potential transition to recording stock compensation based on fair market value until required by accounting standards in in november the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin 
this interpretation addresses the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under guarantees 
in addition  the interpretation clarifies the requirements related to the recognition of a liability by a guarantor at the inception of a guarantee for the obligations that the guarantor has undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
the company adopted the disclosure requirements of fin for the fiscal year ended december   and the recognition provisions on january  adoption of this interpretation did not have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
in june the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which addresses accounting for restructuring and similar costs 
sfas no 
supersedes previous accounting guidance  principally eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
the company has adopted  effective january   the provisions of sfas no 
for restructuring activities initiated after december  sfas no 
requires that the liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
under eitf no 
 a liability for an exit cost was recognized at the date of commitment to an exit plan 
sfas no 
also establishes that the liability should initially be measured and recorded at fair value 
accordingly  sfas no 
may affect the timing of recognizing future restructuring costs as well as the amounts recognized 
sfas no 
did not have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
in april the fasb issued sfas no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
amends and clarifies financial reporting for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities under sfas no 
sfas no 
clarifies under what circumstances a contract with an initial net investment meets the characteristic of a derivative  clarifies when a derivative contains a financing component  amends the definition of an underlying to conform it to language used in fin  and amends certain other existing pronouncements 
sfas no 
is effective for contracts entered into or modified after june   and should be applied prospectively  with the exception of certain sfas no 
implementation issues that were effective for all fiscal quarters prior to june  any such implementation issues should continue to be applied in accordance with their respective effective dates 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
during january  the financial accounting standards board issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin  which requires the consolidation of certain entities that are determined to be variable interest entities vie s 
an entity is considered to be a vie when either i the entity lacks sufficient equity to carry on its principal operations  ii the equity owners of the entity cannot make decisions about the entity s activities or iii the entity s equity neither absorbs losses or benefits from gains 
the company has reviewed its financial arrangements and has not identified any material vie s that should be consolidated by the company in accordance with fin impact of inflation the impact of inflation on the company has not been significant in recent years because of the relatively low rates of inflation experienced in the united states 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company enters into various financial contracts to hedge its exposure to commodity price risk associated with its crude oil production  electricity production and net natural gas volumes purchased for its steaming operations 
these contracts related to crude oil and natural gas have historically been in the form of zero cost collars and swaps  however  the company is considering a variety of hedge instruments going forward 
the company generally attempts to hedge between and of its anticipated crude oil production and up to of its anticipated net natural gas purchased each year 
all of these hedges have historically been deemed to be cash flow hedges with the mark to market valuations of the collars provided by external sources  based on prices that are actually quoted 
based on nymex futures prices at december   wti  henry hub hh the company would expect to make pre tax future cash payments over the remaining term of its crude oil and natural gas hedges in place as follows impact of percent change in futures prices on earnings in thousands nymex futures average wti price crude oil gain loss average hh price natural gas gain loss the company sells of its electricity production  net of electricity used in its oil and gas operations  under so contracts to major utilities 
three of the four so contracts representing approximately of the company s electricity for sale originally expired on december  however  as ordered by cpuc  the utilities offered and the company accepted one year extensions on these contracts in january and is evaluating its options beyond the revised termination dates 
among other things  the cpuc issued a decision in january that establishes rules whereby the california utilities are required to offer standard offer contracts to certain qualified facilities  such as berry  for a term of years 
however  the sales price under this contract may not be linked to natural gas prices 
the company sells the remaining mwh to a utility at per mwh plus cap acity through a long term sales contract 
the company attempts to minimize credit exposure to counter parties through monitoring procedures and diversification 
the company s exposure to changes in interest rates results primarily from long term debt 
total debt outstanding at december  and was million and million  respectively 
interest on amounts borrowed is charged at libor plus to 
based on year end borrowings  a change in interest rates would not have a material impact on the company s financial statements

although the company believes that its expectations are based on reasonable assumptions  it can give no assurance that its goals will be achieved 
important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements herein include  but are not limited to  the timing and extent of changes in commodity prices for oil  gas and electricity  a limited marketplace for electricity sales within california  counterparty risk  competition  environmental and weather risks  litigation uncertainties  drilling  development and operating risks  uncertainties about the estimates of reserves  th e availability of drilling rigs and other support services  legislative and or judicial decisions and other government regulations
