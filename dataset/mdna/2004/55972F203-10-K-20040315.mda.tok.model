item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive summary magnum hunter resources  inc is well positioned over the next several years to continue its growth trajectory in reserves  production and its financial performance due principally to its large in house inventory of drilling opportunities both onshore and offshore in the gulf of mexico 
the company has a proved reserve base of bcfe predominantly located in the southwestern united states onshore  where annual production decline rates are less than other regions of the country 
management believes the company has over a five year inventory of  onshore locations and ocs blocks in the gulf of mexico 
this significant inventory of new drilling prospects enhances the capability of the company in meeting its annual goal of replacing reserves and production in any given year 
magnum hunter s drilling success has continued to exceed over the last four years 
all of the company s growth was from the drill bit and that success continued from both exploratory and development projects 
the company drilled a total of wells in and completed of them for an overall success rate 
offshore drilling totals for the year included of offshore wells drilled successfully 
since our initial entry into the gulf of mexico in  the company has completed of wells  for an overall rate of success 
the company s proved reserves increased from bcf at the end of to bcfe at the end of this increase  while small  is significant in light of the fact that we had non core property sales in of approximately bcfe  in addition to the bcfe of production 
reserve additions equaled of production volumes for the year 
no significant property acquisitions were made during magnum hunter s reserves are predominantly long life  stable  onshore reserves with located in the permian basin region  in the mid continent region  on the texas gulf coast and from our offshore properties in the gulf of mexico 
there has been a lot of discussion in the market  as well as at our own board level  concerning the quality of proved reserves reported by publicly traded oil and gas companies 
fortunately  magnum hunter has been very pro active in this area 
we believe our petroleum engineers have used a very conservative approach in booking proved reserves and therefore our risk in this area has been significantly mitigated 
we ve always used the most rigorous level of external reserve evaluation by degolyer macnaughton and cawley gillespie  which are our third party engineering firms  and they evaluate of our proved reserves 
finding and development costs from all sources for was per mcfe  with of our capital budget being spent in the gulf of mexico  a region that typically experiences much higher finding and development costs 
over the last several years  magnum hunter has continued a significant divestiture program of properties deemed to be more expensive to operate  environmentally sensitive  and having minimal  if any  upside exploration or development potential 
total proceeds received from this group of non core assets sold over the last two years was million  including the sale of our ownership interest in ngts and tel offshore trust 
the net proceeds received from these assets sales have been used to reduce the company s overall indebtedness and to fund the capital expenditure program centered around activities in southeastern new mexico and the gulf of mexico 
the company has been working over the last several years to continue a program of reducing overall indebtedness and improving its interest expense per mcfe produced 
actions taken during to redeem the company s million of outstanding high yield bonds that bear interest of in combination with the new placement of million of year libor priced convertible bonds  will create interest savings exceeding million per year 
additionally  the company s overall debt to book capitalization has continued to decrease from a high of at december  to a current level of approximately 
it is management s goal to reach a debt to capitalization level of or better by year end magnum hunter s capital expenditure budget for is currently estimated to be million 
while oil field service costs have continued to be at the lower end of previous cycles  we are beginning to see significant increases in certain sectors of the business such as oil field pipe and tubulars 
should we experience price increases in other areas such as drilling rigs  completion rigs  cementing  fracture stimulation  etc  we plan to then significantly curtail our activities in those regions that would be most effected by these increases in field service costs 
by operating over of our properties  based on the year en pv value  we are in a unique position to better control the timing of our capital expenditure program and these expenses 
a new core area for the company is located on the coal bed methane leased option acreage that we announced back in september of last year  we leased over million acres in northwest new mexico in the san juan basin on extremely favorable lease terms 
we subsequently negotiated an agreement with a private company to drill for this coal bed methane potential on this new acreage 
the program is designed for a large number of test wells using very little of our own capital budget to test the region 
drilling has been underway since last year and  although it s been somewhat slower than anticipated  six wells have been drilled to date 
the first six wells have found some thin coals  but to date  we would not say anything has been found in sufficient quantities to be deemed commercially productive 
however  the conventional coal bed zones will continue to be tested 
since only six wells have been drilled over this entire million acreage position  we re hopeful that some of the remaining wells will find coal thickness and gas content in sufficient amounts that would allow us to justify conducting a pilot project 
therefore  this is still considered a research development effort and it s still way too early to say whether or not we will have something positive or something negative from this program 
due to an unusual period within the energy industry wherein interest rates are low  oil field service costs are relatively low  and commodity prices for both oil and natural gas are at record highs  an opportunity for unforeseen expansion in our profit margins has occurred 
we do not anticipate any significant reductions in the price of crude oil and natural gas over the next several years due to tight supplies and increased demand here in north america and worldwide 
management of magnum hunter believes the company is properly positioned during this period with its existing portfolio of assets  a significantly improved financial condition  and commodity hedge protection  to continue to report record financial results over the next several years 
results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes associated with them contained elsewhere in this report 
this discussion should not be construed to imply that the results discussed herein will necessarily continue into the future or that any conclusion reached herein will necessarily be indicative of actual operating results in the future 
such discussion represents only the best present assessment by management of the company 
throughout this document  we make statements that are classified as forward looking 
please refer to the forward looking statements section of this document for an explanation of these types of assertions 
our results of operations are significantly affected by our ability to maintain or increase oil and natural gas production through exploration and exploitation activities 
fluctuations in oil and gas prices also significantly affect our results of operations 
successful merger and acquisition activities also have a large impact on our results of operations by increasing proved reserves in our core areas which allow us greater exploration and production potential paired with existing operation and production expertise in these areas 
effective july   we acquired proved and unproved oil and gas properties located in southeast new mexico totaling approximately bcfe of reserves for million  net of purchase price adjustments 
the transaction had an effective date of july  on march   we completed our merger with prize energy corp 
prize  a publicly traded oil and gas production company engaged primarily in the acquisition  enhancement  and exploitation of producing oil and gas properties 
for operating and financial reporting purposes  the effective date of the merger was march  as such  the results of operations for include ten months of operating contributions from prize 
the transaction has been accounted for as a purchase of prize by the company in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
under the terms of the merger  we distributed shares of common stock plus in cash for each prize share outstanding 
the following summary  prepared on a pro forma basis  presents the results of operations for the years ended december  and as if the acquisitions occurred as of the beginning of the respective years 
the pro forma information includes the effects of adjustments for interest expense  depreciation  depletion and amortization  and income taxes unaudited in thousands  except for per share amounts revenue   total operating costs and expenses   operating profit   interest expense and other   income before tax   benefit provision for income tax  net income   net income per common share basic diluted subsequent to the prize merger  we sold non strategic proved producing oil and gas reserves for total proceeds of approximately million  net of purchase price adjustments 
substantially all of the properties sold were acquired in the prize merger  and the proceeds have been used to reduce our overall indebtedness and fund our capital expenditure program 
the impact of these non strategic divestitures are described below in our results of operations 
during  we realized million from the sale of non strategic oil and gas reserves 
on july   we exercised our option to sell our interest in ngts  llc ngts 
we reduced the carrying value of our investment by approximately thousand and recorded a charge to equity in earnings of affiliate in that amount to state our investment at its estimated fair value 
the sale closed on september   and we received proceeds of million on that date  which were used to repay indebtedness 
no gain or loss was recorded on the sale 
our results of operations have been significantly affected by our past success in acquiring oil and gas properties at or near the bottom of the commodity price cycles and our ability to maintain or increase oil and natural gas production through our exploration and exploitation activities 
fluctuations in oil and gas prices and commodity hedging activities have also significantly affected the results of operations 
the following table sets forth certain information with respect to our business segments years ended exploration and production operations production oil mbbls    gas mmcf    oil and gas mmcfe    equivalent daily rate mmcfe day average sale prices after hedging oil per bbl gas per mcf oil and gas per mcfe effect of hedging activities per mcfe lease operating expense per mcfe lifting costs production tax and other costs gross margin per mcfe depreciation  depletion  amortization and accretion per mcfe segment profit thousands    gas gathering  marketing and processing operations throughput volumes mcf per day gathering    processing    gross margin in thousands gathering per mcf throughput processing per mcf throughput segment profit thousands   oil field management services segment profit thousands   period to period comparisons for the years ended december  and we reported net income of million for the year ended december  as compared to net income of million for the same period in  an increase of  reflecting the solid performance of both our exploration and production segment and our gathering  marketing and processing segment 
total operating revenues increased to million in from million in a increase in the price received for oil and gas sold on a thousand cubic feet equivalent  or mcfe  basis  combined with a increase in oil and gas production on a million cubic feet equivalent  or mmcfe  basis in our exploration and production segment  as well as a increase in revenues in our gas gathering  marketing and processing segment due to the prize merger and product price increases  were primarily responsible for the improvement in revenues 
the production increase in our exploration and production segment was impacted by the merger with prize  the success of our drilling program  and the sale of non strategic oil and gas properties 
total operating costs and expenses increased to million in from million in  principally due to higher depreciation  depletion  amortization and accretion expense  lease operating expense  gas gathering  marketing and processing expense  and general administrative expense due to the merger with prize 
operating profit increased to million in from million in  due primarily to a increase in our exploration and production segment profit from million in to million in and a increase in our gas gathering  marketing and processing segment profit from million in to million in segment profit for our oil field management service segment declined approximately from million in to million in due to higher depreciation expense 
net income before income tax and cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle increased to million in from million in  primarily due to the prize merger and the increase in crude oil  natural gas  and natural gas liquids prices in the period compared to the period 
additionally  the period included costs associated with early retirement of debt of million from the redemption of our senior notes  discussed in further detail below in other income and expenses 
we recorded income tax expense of million for  of which million was deferred tax expense  versus a deferred tax benefit of million for the period income tax benefit resulted from the elimination of the million valuation allowance that had been carried against deferred tax assets derived from net operating loss carryovers generated by magnum hunter in prior years 
as a result of the prize merger  we believe that this tax asset can be fully realized 
additionally  the period includes the cumulative effect on prior years of a change in accounting principle due to the adoption of sfas no 
relating to asset retirement obligations 
the cumulative effect was a gain of thousand  net of income tax expense of thousand  or per share  both basic and diluted 
basic and diluted earnings per share in were and  respectively  versus basic and diluted earnings per share of in the period 
basic and diluted shares outstanding increased in the period compared to the period  primarily as a result of new shares issued in the prize merger 
the gain in diluted earnings per share in compared to was primarily the result of the increase in net income 
exploration and production operations for the year ended december   we reported oil production of approximately million barrels and natural gas production of approximately billion cubic feet  which represents no change in oil produced and an increase of in natural gas produced from the billion cubic feet reported in the period 
our reported equivalent daily rate of production on a million cubic feet per day basis mmcfe per day increased to mmcfe per day in the period from mmcfe per day in the period 
these increases were primarily the result of the prize merger and the success of our drilling program offsetting both normal production declines and the effect of the sale of non strategic oil and gas properties subsequent to the prize merger 
the impact of these non strategic property sales on reported production was a decrease of mmcfe per day in the period compared to the period 
removing the effect of sold properties from both the and periods  our daily equivalent production grew from to oil revenues increased to million in the period compared to million in the period 
the oil price received  after hedging effects  was per bbl in the period compared to per bbl in the period  an increase of 
gas revenues increased to million in the period versus million in the period 
the gas price received  after hedging effects  was per mcf in the period compared to per mcf for the same period in  an increase of 
we also recorded thousand in oil and gas sales in the period from business interruption insurance proceeds resulting from claims filed in due to hurricane lili 
total oil and gas sales increased to million in from million in from time to time  we enter into various commodity hedging contracts in order to reduce our exposure to the possibility of declining oil and gas prices which provide a basic level of cash flow to fund capital expenditures 
during the period  hedging decreased the average price we received for oil by per bbl and decreased the average price we received for gas by per mcf 
during the period  we had approximately mmcf per day of gas hedged through fixed price swaps with a weighted average price of per mmbtu and approximately mmcf per day of gas hedged through cost less collars with a weighted average floor price of per mmbtu and a weighted average ceiling price of per mmbtu 
approximately of natural gas production was hedged 
on the crude side  we had approximately  bbls per day hedged through fixed price swaps with a weighted average price of per barrel and approximately  bbls per day hedged through cost less collars with a weighted average floor price of per bbl and a weighted average ceiling price of per bbl 
approximately of crude oil production was hedged 
lease operating expense consists of lifting costs and production taxes and other costs 
for the period  lifting costs were million versus million in the period  an increase of 
production taxes and other costs were million in the period versus million in the period  an increase of 
both increases were primarily attributable to the prize merger 
for the period  lifting costs  on a unit of production basis  were per mcfe as compared to per mcfe in the period  an increase of 
the increase in lifting costs per mcfe produced in the period was due to higher power and fuel costs and increased remedial and workover expense 
the increased workover expense is due to remedial work on older properties acquired in the prize merger as well as workovers done at our discretion to enhance current production 
production taxes and other costs were per mcfe produced in the period compared to per mcfe produced in the period  an increase of 
the increase in production taxes per mcfe produced was caused by an increase in crude oil and natural gas prices received during the period 
our gross margin realized from exploration and production operations oil and gas revenues less lease operating expenses for the period was million  or per mcfe  compared to million  or per mcfe in the period  an increase of on a per unit of production basis 
the gross margin increase is the result of a increase in revenue per mcfe produced  offset by a increase in lease operating expense per mcfe produced 
depreciation  depletion  amortization and accretion of oil and gas properties was million in the period versus million in the period 
the period included accretion expense related to asset retirement obligations due to the adoption in january of sfas no 
of million versus none in on a unit of production basis  depreciation and depletion expense excluding accretion expense was per mcfe produced in the period versus per mcfe produced in the period 
this increase in the equivalent unit cost was due primarily to an increase in development costs and shorter reserve life properties associated with our activities in the gulf of mexico as well as the transfer of million of costs from unproved properties to the full cost pool 
the costs which were transferred related to unproved property costs associated with properties which were sold or proved during  as well as costs associated with leases which expired during the year 
accretion expense was per mcfe in versus none in total depreciation  depletion  amortization and accretion for this segment was per mcfe in versus per mcfe in segment profit for exploration and production operations was million for the period versus million for the period  an increase of  principally due to properties acquired in the prize merger  the success of our drilling program  and higher realized crude oil and natural gas prices 
gathering  marketing and processing operations for the year ended december   our gathering system throughput was mmcf per day versus mmcf per day for the same period in  an increase of due to successful drilling behind the system 
gas processing throughput was mmcf per day in versus mmcf per day in  an increase of  due primarily to the effect of the prize merger 
revenues from gathering  marketing and processing increased to million in versus million in  primarily due to higher realized prices for natural gas and natural gas liquids 
the gross margin realized from gathering  marketing and processing for was million versus million in  an increase of 
the gathering margin was per mcf gathered in versus per mcf in due to an increase in gathering fees 
the processing margin was per mcf in compared to per mcf in due to more favorable processing economics 
depreciation expense for gas gathering  marketing and processing operations was million for the period versus million for the period  due to the prize merger 
segment profit for gas gathering  marketing and processing operations was million in the period versus million for the period  an increase of  principally due to higher throughput and improved processing economics at our natural gas processing plants 
oil field management services operations revenues from oil field management services were million in the period versus million in the period due to higher management and operations services fees charged to third parties 
operating costs increased to million in from million in due to higher costs for labor and overhead 
the gross margin for this segment in compared to was unchanged at million 
depreciation expense was thousand in the period versus thousand in the period  an increase of  due to capital additions 
segment profit was million in versus million in  a decrease of  due to the increase in depreciation expense 
depreciation  depletion  amortization and accretion total depreciation  depletion  amortization and accretion expense was million in the period versus million in the period  an increase of  primarily as a result of increased production and increased depletion and accretion rates in our exploration and production segment 
other income and expenses we recorded a gain on sale of assets other than oil and gas properties of thousand in versus thousand in general and administrative expense for increased to million from million in the principal reason for this increase was the million cost of expensing employee stock options recorded in the period as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
in june  with an effective date of january  the number of full time employees at fiscal year end and was and respectively 
we recorded equity in loss of affiliate of thousand in versus equity in earnings of affiliate of thousand in  principally due to the reduction of the carrying value of our investment in ngts by thousand to state it at its estimated fair value prior to sale  as well as our equity in losses generated by metrix networks  inc metrix prior to our acquisition of control of metrix in december other income was thousand for versus thousand in  a increase  due to an increase in interest income 
in  we recorded an impairment of thousand on an investment in a company that declared bankruptcy 
we recognized a million gain in other non cash hedging adjustments in versus a loss of million in in the period  million of the hedging gain relates to the amortization of commodity hedge liabilities acquired in the prize merger  while thousand of the gain was due to recording hedge ineffectiveness 
in the period  a loss of million relates to the amortization of commodity hedge assets acquired in the prize merger  and a loss of thousand was due to recording hedge ineffectiveness 
we incurred costs associated with early retirement of debt of million in versus million in the period costs were associated with the million  million  and million redemptions in principal value of our senior notes at of par  of par  and of par in january  june and december  respectively  as well as a subsidiary s august purchase of thousand in principal value of our senior notes at of par 
of the million in principal value of senior notes redeemed in  a subsidiary received million in principal value 
the period debt retirement costs of million were associated with the amendment of our facility in connection with the prize merger 
interest expense was million for versus million for  a decrease of  primarily as a result of lower interest rates on our senior credit facility facility  lower interest rate hedging costs  and interest saved on the early redemption of our senior notes 
during the period  the average interest rate on our facility was versus in  a decline of 
the weighted average daily balance of our facility increased to million in from million in by december   the level of our facility had been reduced to million through sales of non strategic oil and gas properties and the issuance in december of million of floating rate convertible senior notes convertible notes  which have a floating interest rate based on three month libor initially set at 
in addition  we incurred interest rate hedge expense of thousand in the period versus million in the period 
the interest rate hedge expired in august we recorded income tax expense of million in million of which was deferred  versus a deferred income tax benefit of million in the period benefited from the release of the million valuation allowance on previously reserved deferred tax assets as a result of the increased likelihood due to the prize merger that the tax assets generated from prior net operating losses will be realized in the future 
the period was also impacted by a million deferred tax provision from the adjustment of goodwill due to sales of non strategic oil and gas properties 
the effective tax rate for and was and  respectively 
the variance in the effective tax rate from the statutory rate of was due to state income taxes in the period and the release of the valuation allowance on our previously reserved deferred tax assets in the period 
for the years ended december  and we reported net income of million for the year ended december  as compared to net income of million for the same period in  an increase of 
the period results include a provision for impairment of investments of thousand and a loss from early retirement of debt of million 
the period results include a loss on enron related assets of million  a provision for impairment of investments of million  and a loss from early retirement of debt of thousand from the repurchase of million in principal value of our senior notes 
total operating revenues increased to million in from million in and operating profit increased to million in from million in a decrease in the price received for oil and gas sold on a thousand cubic feet equivalent  or mcfe  basis  combined with a increase in oil and gas production on a million cubic feet equivalent  or mmcfe  basis in our oil and gas exploration and production segment  was primarily responsible for the improvement in revenues 
the production increase was primarily due to the merger with prize 
total operating costs and expenses increased to million in from million in  principally due to higher depreciation  depletion and amortization expense  lease operating expenses  and general administrative expenses due to the merger with prize 
income before income tax decreased to million in from million in  primarily due to higher interest expense and non cash hedging losses due to the prize merger 
income per common share diluted was per share in the period compared to per share in the period  a decrease of  due to a increase in diluted shares  principally as a result of the prize merger 
the effect of the extraordinary loss in the and periods was per share  basic and diluted 
no dividends were recorded in the or periods due to the conversion of million liquidation value of our series a convertible preferred stock on january  into approximately million shares of our common stock 
exploration and production operations for the year ended december   we reported oil production of mmbbls million barrels and gas production of mmcf million cubic feet  which represents an increase of in oil and an increase of in gas produced from the comparable period in our reported equivalent daily rate of production on a million cubic feet per day basis mmcfe day increased to mmcfe day in the period from mmcfe day in the period 
these increases were primarily the result of the prize merger and the success of our drilling program offsetting normal production declines 
prices realized in the period averaged per barrel of oil and per mcf of gas 
this represents a decrease on a thousand cubic feet of gas equivalent mcfe basis over the period average realized prices of per barrel of oil and per mcf of gas 
the unit prices realized include the effects of hedging 
during the period  hedging decreased the average price we received for oil by per barrel and increased the average price we received for gas by per mcf 
excluding the effects of hedging  oil prices increased and natural gas prices decreased in from those received in as a result of higher production levels  partially offset by lower realized prices  oil and gas revenues increased to million in the period compared to million in the period 
for the period  oil and gas production lifting costs  on a unit of production basis  were per mcfe as compared to per mcfe in the period  an increase of due to the relatively higher cost per unit of the prize properties 
production tax and other costs were per mcfe in the period compared to per mcfe in the period  an increase of principally due to higher ad valorem taxes 
gross margin for exploration and production operations for the period was million  or per mcfe  compared to million  or per mcfe in the period  a decrease of on a per unit of production basis  primarily as a result of the decrease in oil and gas prices realized and the increase in lifting costs per unit 
depreciation  depletion  and amortization of oil and gas properties was million in the period versus million in the period  an increase of due primarily to the prize merger 
on a unit of production basis  depreciation and depletion expense was per mcfe produced in the period versus per mcfe produced in the period 
this decrease in the equivalent unit cost was due primarily to the merger with prize which added proved reserves at a cost of approximately per mcfe 
segment profit for exploration and production operations was million for the period versus million for the period  an increase of  principally due to the prize merger 
gas gathering  marketing and processing operations for the year ended december   our gathering system throughput was mmcf per day versus mmcf per day for the same period in  a decline of due to normal production declines behind the system 
gas processing throughput was mmcf per day in versus mmcf per day in  an increase of 
our reported processing throughput in the period was reduced due to i the sale in september of a substantial ownership interest in oil and gas properties supplying one of our plants  ii the voluntary shutdown of two gas processing plants for approximately two months of the period due to adverse processing economics as a result of high natural gas prices and iii normal production declines on properties supplying the plants 
our processing throughput in the period was increased due to the acquisition of a processing plant in the merger with prize 
revenues from gathering  marketing and processing increased to million in versus million in  primarily due to the acquisition of a processing plant in the merger with prize 
the gross margin realized from gathering  marketing and processing for was million versus million in  an increase of 
gathering margin was per mcf gathered in versus per mcf in due to an increase in marketing spreads 
in the period  losses were incurred on pipeline imbalance positions 
processing margin was per mcf in compared to per mcf in due to more favorable processing economics because of the decline in natural gas prices and the temporary shutdown of two plants for a portion of the period 
depreciation expense for gas gathering  marketing and processing operations was million in the period versus thousand in the period  an increase of  due to the prize merger 
segment profit for gas gathering  marketing and processing operations was million in the period versus thousand in the period  an increase of  principally due to the prize merger 
oil field management services operations revenues from oil field management services were million in the period versus million in the period due to higher management and operations services fees charged to third parties as a result of the prize merger 
operating costs increased to million in from million in due to higher costs for labor and overhead 
the gross margin for this segment in was million versus thousand in  an increase of 
depreciation expense was thousand in the period versus thousand in the period  an increase of due to capital additions 
segment profit was million in versus thousand in other income and expenses depreciation and depletion expense was million in the period versus million in the period  an increase of due to higher production levels as a result of the prize merger 
general and administrative expense for increased to million from million in the principal cause of this increase was an increase in salary  benefits and retirement plan expenses and an increase in our overall headcount associated with the prize merger 
the numbers of employees at fiscal year end and were and  respectively 
we recorded equity in earnings of affiliate of thousand in versus income of million in  a decrease  due to an operating loss recorded by one of the affiliates 
other income was thousand for versus thousand in  a increase  due to an increase in interest income 
we recognized a million loss in other non cash hedging adjustments in versus a gain of thousand in in the period  million relates to the amortization of commodity hedge assets acquired in the prize merger  while thousand was due to recording hedge ineffectiveness 
in the period  the thousand gain was due to interest rate swaps 
we made provision for a million loss on assets associated with the enron corp 
bankruptcy in the period 
of the total loss provision recorded  approximately million was related to accounts receivable from enron for physical gas sales and approximately thousand was related to a receivable from a natural gas commodity hedge in which enron was the counterparty 
we had equity and debt investments in a privately held entity which declared bankruptcy subsequent to december   and we provided an impairment charge against earnings of million at december  additionally  we had an investment in available for sale securities of another entity of million at december  because of the deteriorating financial condition of this entity  we reported an other than temporary impairment of million as a charge against earnings at december   based on the entity s reported market value on that date 
in  this entity declared bankruptcy and we recorded a further impairment of thousand on this investment 
interest expense was million for versus million for  an increase of  primarily as a result of higher debt levels due to the prize merger 
on march  we issued million in senior notes due in during the period  the interest rate on our facility was versus in  a decline of 
the weighted average daily balance of bank debt increased to million in from million in by december   the level of debt under our facility had been reduced to million through sales of non strategic oil and gas properties 
in addition  interest expense was reduced in the period by thousand as a result of interest rate derivatives versus an increase in interest expense of million from interest rate derivatives in the period 
we recorded an income tax benefit of million in versus income tax expense of million in the period benefited from a million reduction in the valuation allowance charged against deferred tax assets as a result of the increased likelihood due to the prize merger that the tax assets generated from prior net operating losses will be realized in the future 
the period was also impacted by a million deferred tax provision from the adjustment of goodwill due to sales of non strategic oil and gas properties 
the effective tax rate for and was and  respectively 
the variance in the effective tax rate from the statutory rate of was due to the release of the valuation allowance on our previously reserved deferred tax assets in liquidity and capital resources our liquidity is primarily dependent upon our ability to generate cash flow from operations and from external sources such as our commercial banks or the bond market 
one of the most significant items that can impact our internally generated funds and availability under our line of credit is commodity prices 
should oil and gas prices decline significantly  our cash flow would be negatively impacted 
if commodity prices declined and were perceived by our lenders to be more than temporary  the amount available under our bank line of credit would be reduced 
reductions in our borrowing capacity could cause us to have to pay down our bank debt  reduce our drilling activities and possibly sell oil and gas properties 
increases in interest rates could also negatively impact our liquidity  as more cash flow would have to be directed toward the payment of interest 
because magnum hunter is leveraged  interest expense is a significant financial obligation 
we attempt to mitigate the impact of decreases in commodity prices and increases in interest rates by the use of hedging contracts  however  we do not hedge all of our commodity price or interest rate risks 
instead  management judges the likelihood of changes in commodity prices and interest rates and considers other factors such as the amount of debt and estimated cash flow under various scenarios 
hedges are then considered and entered into as deemed appropriate 
cash flow and working capital 
net cash provided by operating activities was million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
our operating cash flow for increased over that for  primarily due to higher operating profits realized by our business segments when adjusted for non cash items 
please see the period to period comparisons for further explanations on the causes and amounts of the increases in our earnings 
we also benefited in the period from million in income tax refunds net of current year payments as well as the return of million in margins we had posted on commodity hedge positions 
our operating cash flow was lower than our operating cash flow due to higher receivables balances carried at year end  large margins posted on our hedge positions  and cash used to reduce current liabilities acquired in the prize merger 
these decreases in cash flows were partially offset by increases in cash flows due to tax refunds received and cash received on hedge positions acquired in the prize merger which were closed during our net working capital position at december  was a deficit of million 
at this date  we had million available under our facility 
a large factor in our negative working capital was million in current derivative liabilities we had recorded on our hedging program due to continued increases in commodities prices over our hedged prices 
this liability is partially offset by million in deferred tax assets which will be released as our hedges are settled 
if actual commodities prices realized on our production remain higher than our hedged prices  our resulting higher proceeds from oil and gas sales will offset any actual amounts paid out on this liability 
our net working capital position at december  was a deficit of million 
at this date we had million available under our facility 
again  a large factor in our negative working capital was million in current derivative liabilities we had recorded on our hedging program due to continued increases in commodities prices over our hedged prices for production 
the amounts paid out on these liabilities were offset by higher cash received for the related production in this liability was also offset by million of current deferred tax assets which were released as the positions were settled 
investing activities net cash used in investing activities was million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
in  the main source of our investing was million spent for capital expenditures which are discussed in the section immediately following our liquidity and capital resources discussions 
during we also received million from the sales of non strategic oil and gas properties as well as million from the sale of our interest in ngts 
we spent million to purchase land which we currently have available for sale 
we expect to sell these properties during during we spent million on capital expenditures as well as million to complete the prize merger 
both of these items are discussed in detail in separate sections following our liquidity and capital resources discussions

became the controlling shareholder of metrix  resulting in its full consolidation with a minority interest 
these three entities will collectively be referred to as canvasback 
like bluebird  these entities are not guarantors of any of our issued debt  and they cannot be included in debt compliance calculations

magnum hunter s capital resources the following discussion of magnum hunter s capital resources refers to the company and its affiliates other than canvasback and bluebird  whose capital resources are discussed separately above 
internally generated cash flow from operations and borrowings under our facility are our major sources of liquidity 
from time to time  we may also sell investments and oil and gas properties to increase our liquidity 
we also may use other sources of capital  such as issuances of additional debt or equity securities to fund acquisitions or other specific needs 
in the past  we have accessed both public and private capital markets to obtain capital for specific activities as well as general corporate purposes 
on may   our board of directors announced an expansion of our existing stock repurchase program originally established in june under the program  the company or our affiliates are authorized to repurchase up to two million shares of our common stock 
on october   our board of directors approved a new three million share repurchase program 
approximately million shares have been repurchased through these programs  and approximately thousand remain available for repurchase 
on december   we announced a distribution of one warrant for every five shares of our common stock owned on january  these warrants were distributed on march  each new warrant entitles the holder to purchase one share of common stock at the warrants will expire three years from the date of distribution unless extended by the board of directors 
on january   we entered into a sale leaseback transaction on three newly constructed offshore production platforms and associated pipelines 
we received a total of million in new funding which was used for general corporate purposes  including a voluntary reduction under our facility 
the production platforms are being leased from a syndicate group of lenders over a term of three to five years and at a cost of funds of approximately per annum  based on current interest rates 
this transaction is accounted for as a capital lease 
on march   we amended and restated our facility in conjunction with the merger with prize 
the amended facility provided for total borrowings of million  up from million  and raised the borrowing base limit from million to million 
additionally  we amended and extended the expiration date of the facility to march after march   the facility was used i to fund the cash component of the prize merger  ii to pay certain costs associated with the merger  and iii for general corporate purposes 
in connection with certain oil and gas property divestitures  the borrowing base was reduced to million on september  during  we amended our facility in may and october to increase the borrowing base to million  up million from our previous million borrowing base 
we also extended the expiration date of the facility to may  the increased borrowing base was used to fund the redemptions of our senior notes which were completed prior to the issuance of our convertible notes in december we also used the increased borrowing base to fund the costs of issuing our convertible notes 
upon the issuance of our convertible notes  we repaid approximately million of our borrowings on this facility  and the borrowing base was reduced million to million 
at december   we had available credit under this facility of million 
our facility includes covenants  the most restrictive of which requires maintenance of a minimum funded debt to ebitda ratio and an interest coverage ratio  as defined in the loan agreement 
we were not in compliance with the funded debt to ebitda ratio required under the covenants at march  the lender provided us with a waiver as of that date  and we negotiated a less restrictive funded debt to ebitda ratio for the next four successive quarters until march  we were in compliance with the covenants for the remainder of and have been in compliance with the revised covenants for all of we expect to be able to comply with these covenants in the future 
on a semi annual basis  our borrowing base under our facility is redetermined by the financial institutions who have committed to the company based on their review of our proved oil and gas reserves and other assets 
if the outstanding balance on the facility exceeds the redetermined borrowing base  we must repay the excess immediately 
the last redetermination date had an effective date of june  and was completed on october  this redetermination increased our borrowing base by million 
our next redetermination date will have an effective date of december  and will have an estimated completion date of may on march   we also completed a private placement of million of senior notes the private placement due that are unsecured 
the senior notes bear an annual interest rate of due semi annually  commencing september  with the funds provided by the new facility in and the private placement of the senior notes  we repaid indebtedness on our old facility of million  retired the long term debt acquired in the prize merger for million  funded the cash component of the merger for million million net of cash acquired  and paid approximately million for fees and expenses related to the merger 
in connection with the prize merger  we issued  shares of our common stock to prize shareholders  increasing our total shares outstanding by 
during  we paid million to redeem the million in principal of our senior notes 
this redemption was funded by borrowings under our facility as well as the issuance of million in convertible notes during december we paid approximately million in premiums to redeem the senior notes 
of the notes redeemed  canvasback received approximately million in principal and received premiums of approximately thousand 
during december of  we issued million in face value of convertible notes 
these convertible notes bear interest equal to the three month libor  to be adjusted quarterly 
the initial rate set on issuance of the convertible notes was 
the convertible notes are convertible into a combination of cash and magnum hunter common stock upon certain events 
the initial conversion price is  subject to adjustment under certain conditions 
the convertible notes are due december  but can be put by the holders on december    and we have the right to call these convertible notes at any time after december  the proceeds from these convertible notes were used to repay borrowings under the facility 
holders may surrender convertible notes for conversion into cash and shares of our common stock prior to the convertible notes maturity date in the following circumstances i during any calendar quarter commencing after the issuance of the convertible notes  if our common stock price for at least trading days in the period of consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the calendar quarter preceding the quarter in which the conversion occurs is more than of the conversion price per share of our common stock in effect on that th trading day  ii if we have called the particular convertible notes for redemption and the redemption has not yet occurred  iii during the five trading day period after any five consecutive trading day period in which the trading price of  principal amount of the convertible notes for each day of such five day period was less than of the product of the closing sale price of our common stock on that day multiplied by the conversion rate  or iv upon the occurrence of specified corporate transactions 
upon the occurrence of the circumstances described above  holders may convert any outstanding notes into cash and shares of our common stock at an initial conversion price per share of 
subject to certain exceptions  at the time notes are tendered for conversion  the value the conversion value of the cash and shares of our common stock  if any  to be received by a holder converting  principal amount of the notes will be determined by multiplying the conversion rate by the ten day average closing stock price of our common stock 
we will deliver the conversion value to holders as follows i an amount in cash the principal return equal to the lesser of a the conversion value and b the principal amount of the notes to be converted and  if the conversion value is greater than the principal return  ii an amount in shares equal to the conversion value less the principal return the net share amount 
the number of net shares to be paid will be determined by dividing the net share amount by the ten day average closing stock price of our common stock 
our internally generated cash flows  results of operations  and financing of our operations are substantially dependent on oil and gas prices 
to the extent that oil and gas prices decline  our earnings and cash flows may be adversely affected regardless of our commodity hedging programs 
we believe that our cash flows from operations  existing working capital  and availability under our facility will be sufficient to meet interest payments and fund capital expenditures during capital expenditures 
for the year ended december   our total capital expenditures for property  plant and equipment  were million 
the following summarizes our capital expenditures by cost component in thousands oil and gas properties other property total acquisition costs unproved acquisition   proved acquisition   other property acquisition development costs   exploratory costs   total   for the year  we have budgeted approximately million for exploration and development activities 
we anticipate that the capital expenditure budget will be funded by cash flow from operations and facility utilization 
we are not contractually obligated to proceed with any of our material budgeted capital expenditures 
the amount and allocation of future capital expenditures will depend on a number of factors that are not entirely within our control or ability to forecast  including drilling results  oilfield costs  and changes in oil and gas prices 
as a result  actual capital expenditures may vary significantly from current expectations 
in the normal course of business  we review opportunities for the possible acquisition of oil and gas reserves and activities related thereto 
when potential acquisition opportunities are deemed consistent with our growth strategy  bids or offers in amounts and with terms acceptable to the company may be submitted 
it is uncertain whether any such bids or offers which we may submit from time to time  will be acceptable to the sellers 
in the event of a future significant acquisition  we may require additional financing in connection therewith 
we do not budget for acquisition expenditures 
the following summarizes the oil and gas properties acquired in the prize merger in millions oil gas properties unproved proved other property total acquisition costs     contractual obligations and commercial commitments 
we have the following contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period in thousands contractual obligations total less than year years years after years long term debt    capital leases     operating leases     total contractual obligations    we have no off balance sheet arrangements  special purpose entities or financing partnerships 
in the past we have provided trade guarantees on behalf of our formerly owned affiliate  ngts 
the last of these guarantees expired in july further  we have sold our ownership interest in ngts  and  therefore  no longer maintain any equity interest in this affiliate 
we have no other guarantees on behalf of any entities and do not intend to issue any at this time 
our capital expenditure budget is million 
based on our reserve report  future development costs are estimated to be million for our proved reserves and million for our probable reserves 
in relation to our hedging programs  we could have significant cash payments related to current derivative positions 
based on current pricing  we will make payments of million during and million during related to our hedging program 
these payment estimates are based on december  commodity prices  and will vary in the future 
please see item a and note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to our derivatives and market risk 
we make significant interest payments each year on our debt 
during  we paid million in interest and recorded a liability for million for interest which would be paid during at december   we had million fixed rate debt and million in variable rate debt  interest payments are made at least semi annually under all of our debt agreements 
we expect debt levels in the future to decrease over time  unless we complete a significant acquisition 
with respect to the variable rate debt  we are exposed to interest rate risk 
please see item a and note to our consolidated financial statements for additional information about our debt 
we currently have million in federal and state income tax net operating loss carryforwards  which  for the most part  prevent us from paying income taxes 
these losses will expire  if unused  in years through approximately million of these losses are limited to million per year 
we expect we will be able to continue to offset any current period taxes due with these losses for the foreseeable future 
in relation to our oil and gas properties  we have substantial retirement obligations 
we estimate that we will have obligations of million in plugging and abandonment costs related to our current properties 
while we do not anticipate material payments in relation to our plugging obligations until and beyond  the timing of these costs is not subject to our control 
please see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on our asset retirement obligations 
critical accounting policies and other our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the reported financial results and disclosures were determined using significant accounting policies  practices and estimates as described below 
we believe the reported financial results are reliable and that the ultimate actual results will not differ significantly from those reported 
the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of magnum hunter and our existing wholly owned subsidiaries 
we also consolidate on a pro rata basis our approximately ownership  as of december   of tel offshore trust  our ownership of mallard hunter  lp and our ownership of teal hunter  lp 
prior to december  we accounted for our approximate interest in metrix under the equity method 
in december  we acquired an controlling interest in that company  thus  we now consolidate metrix with a minority interest for the outside owners 
we accounted for our investment in ngts under the equity method prior to its sale during september all significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation 
certain items in prior periods have been reclassified to conform with the current presentation 
magnum hunter is a holding company with no significant assets or operations other than our investments in our subsidiaries 
our wholly owned subsidiaries  except for canvasback energy  inc  redhead energy  inc 
and metrix  collectively referred to as canvasback  are direct guarantors of our facility  senior notes and our convertible notes  and have fully and unconditionally guaranteed the notes on a joint and several basis 
the guarantors comprise all of the direct and indirect subsidiaries of the company other than canvasback  and we have presented separate condensed consolidating financial statements and other disclosures concerning each guarantor and canvasback see note to the consolidated financial statements 
there is no restriction on the ability of consolidated or unconsolidated subsidiaries  except for canvasback  to transfer funds to magnum hunter in the form of cash dividends and loans or advances 
oil and gas properties we use the full cost method of accounting for our investment in oil and gas properties 
under the full cost method of accounting  all costs of acquisition  exploration and development of oil and gas proved reserves are capitalized into a full cost pool on a country by country basis as incurred  and properties in the pool  less their associated salvage values  are depleted and charged to operations using the unit of production method based on the ratio of current production to total proved oil and gas reserves  as determined by independent petroleum engineers 
to the extent that such capitalized costs net of accumulated depreciation  depletion and amortization less deferred taxes exceed the pv of estimated future net cash flow from proved reserves of oil and gas  and the lower of unamortized cost or fair value of unproved properties after income tax effects  such excess costs are charged to operations 
once incurred  a write down of oil and gas properties is not reversible at a later date even if oil or gas prices subsequently increase 
our capitalized costs did not exceed the pv limitation using prices in effect at december  significant downward revisions of quantity estimates  declines in oil and gas prices  higher operating costs or additional capital costs which are not offset by incremental increases in oil and gas reserves or other factors could possibly result in write down for impairment of oil and gas properties in the future 
in accordance with sfas  accounting for asset retirement obligations  we carry a liability for any legal retirement obligations on our oil and gas properties 
the associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the full cost pool and depleted on the unit of production basis 
reserve engineering is a subjective process that is dependent on the quality of available data and on engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
reserve estimates are subject to change over time as additional information becomes available 
revenue recognition revenues are recognized when title to the product transfers to purchasers 
we follow the sales method of accounting for revenue for oil and natural gas production  so that we recognize sales revenue on all production sold to purchasers  regardless of whether the sales are proportionate to our ownership in the property 
in these instances when our sales are not proportionate to our interests  a receivable or liability is recognized only to the extent that we have an imbalance on a specific property greater than the expected remaining proved reserves 
ultimate revenues from the sales of oil and gas production is not known with certainty until up to three months after production and title transfer occur 
current revenues are accrued based on our expectation of actual deliveries and actual prices received 
inflation and changes in prices our results of operations and cash flow have been  and will continue to be  affected by the volatility in oil and gas prices 
should we experience a significant increase in oil and gas prices that is sustained over a prolonged period  we would expect that there would also be a corresponding increase in oil and gas finding costs  lease acquisition costs  and operating expenses 
we market oil and gas for our own account  which exposes us to the attendant commodities risk 
a significant portion of our gas production is currently sold to end users either i on the spot market on a month to month basis at prevailing spot market prices or ii under long term contracts based on current spot market prices 
we normally sell our oil under month to month contracts to a variety of purchasers 
derivative instruments our product price and interest hedging activities are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
periodically we enter into derivative instruments such as futures  swaps and options contracts to reduce the adverse effects of fluctuations in natural gas and crude oil prices 
under our risk management policy  at inception  commodity hedge positions may not exceed of natural gas and of crude oil current forecasted months commodity production 
for non current greater than months commodity production  at inception  commodity hedge positions for natural gas and crude oil may not exceed of forecasted production for each product 
we also utilize  from time to time  financial derivative instruments to hedge the risk associated with interest on our outstanding debt 
generally  the cash settlement of all derivative instruments is recognized as income or expense in the period in which the hedged transaction is recognized 
we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas no 
 as extended by sfas no 
june and amended by sfas no 
june  beginning january  sfas no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
it requires the recognition of derivatives in the balance sheet and the measurement of those instruments at fair value 
we determine our fair value based on market values obtained from our counterparties 
derivative instruments that are not hedges must be adjusted to the fair value through net income loss 
under the provisions of sfas  changes in the fair value of derivative instruments that are fair value hedges are offset against changes in the fair value of the hedged assets  liabilities  or firm commitments  through net income loss 
changes in the fair value of derivative instruments that are cash flow hedges are recognized in other comprehensive income loss until such time as the hedged items are recognized in net income loss 
ineffective portions of a derivative instrument s change in fair value are immediately recognized in net income loss 
goodwill as a result of our merger with prize  we currently have million of goodwill recorded on our books 
under sfas no 
 we will not amortize any of the goodwill acquired in the merger 
all goodwill has been allocated to the exploration and production reporting unit 
we test our goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or whenever indicators of impairment exist 
we performed our annual impairment test at december   and determined that no impairment existed 
the annual impairment test requires management to make significant estimates and judgments 
if impairment is determined to exist  we will measure our impairment based on a comparison of the carrying value of goodwill to the implied fair value of that goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the exploration and production reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit 
the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  impairment will be recognized in the income statement

 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  was issued in november this interpretation addresses the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under guarantees 
it also clarifies the requirements related to the recognition of a liability by a guarantor at the inception of a guarantee for the obligations the guarantor has undertaken in issuing that guarantee 
we adopted this interpretation in january in the past  we have provided trade guarantees on behalf of ngts 
the last of these guarantees expired in july further  we have sold our ownership interest in ngts  and  therefore  no longer maintain any equity interest in this former affiliate see note to our consolidated financial statements

 consolidation of variable interest entities  addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities with certain defined characteristics 
this interpretation applies to the first fiscal year or interim period ending after december   to variable interest entities created or obtained before february  for variable interest entities created after january   the consolidated provisions apply immediately 
we do not have any variable interest entities that would be subject to these provisions and  accordingly  fin will not have an impact on our financial statements

l  consolidated financial statements arb 
as per arb  a general rule for preparation of consolidated financial statements of a parent and its subsidiary is ownership by the parent  either directly or indirectly  of over fifty percent of the outstanding voting shares of a subsidiary 
however  application of the majority voting interest requirement of arb to certain types of entities may not identify the party with a controlling financial interest because the controlling financial interest may be achieved through arrangements that do not involve voting interest 
fin clarifies applicability of arb to entities in which the equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support 
fin requires an entity to consolidate a variable interest entity even though the entity does not  either directly or indirectly  own over fifty percent of the outstanding voting shares 
we do not have any variable interest entities that would be subject to these provisions  and  accordingly  fin r also will not have an impact on our financial statements 
sfas in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity sfas 
sfas establishes standards for how an issuer of financial instruments classifies and measures in its statement of financial position certain instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas modifies the accounting and financial statement disclosures of certain financial instruments that  under previous guidance  issuers could account for as equity 
sfas affects the issuer s accounting for three types of financial instruments that are required to be accounted for as liabilities 
we did not have any financial instruments outstanding to which the provisions of sfas apply  therefore  the initial adoption of sfas did not have any impact on the results of operations or equity of the company 
in june  fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations  which requires the purchase method of accounting for business combinations initiated after june  and eliminates the pooling of interests method 
in july  the fasb also issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which discontinues the practice of amortizing goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets and initiates an annual review of impairment 
intangible assets with a determinable useful life will continue to be amortized over that period 
the amortization provisions apply to goodwill and intangible assets acquired after june  sfas no 
and clarify that more assets should be distinguished and classified between tangible and intangible 
we did not change or reclassify contractual mineral rights included in proved and unproved oil and gas properties on our balance sheet upon adoption of sfas no 
we believe the treatment of such mineral rights as tangible assets under the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas properties is appropriate 
an issue has been raised regarding whether these mineral rights should be classified as tangible or intangible assets 
if it is determined that reclassification is necessary  we will reduce our proven properties by million  decrease unproved properties by million and report intangible mineral rights related to proved properties of million and intangible mineral rights related to unproved properties of million at december  at december   we will reduce our proven properties by million  reduce our unproved properties by million  and report intangible mineral rights related to proved properties of million and intangible mineral rights related to unproved properties of million 
these reclassifications represent the cost of acquiring proved and unproved mineral use rights from the effective date of june  the provisions of sfas no 
and sfas no 
impact only the balance sheet and any associated footnote disclosures 
any reclassifications potentially required would not impact our cash flows or statements of income 
off balance sheet arrangements we have provided trade guarantees on behalf of ngts in the past

we had equity and debt investments in a privately held entity which declared bankruptcy on march   and for which we recorded an impairment charge against earnings of million at december  we are not responsible for any debts of this entity 
we had an investment in available for sale securities of another entity of million at december  because of the deteriorating financial condition of this entity  we recorded an other than temporary impairment of million as a charge against earnings at december   and we recorded an additional impairment for the remaining carrying value of this asset at june  we are not responsible for any debts of this entity 
other at february   magnum hunter had approximately of its natural gas production and approximately of its crude oil production hedged through december  in addition  magnum hunter had approximately of its natural gas production and none of its crude oil production hedged for the calendar year unless we enter into additional hedging transactions  the remainder of our hydrocarbon volumes will be sold at market prices 
future commodity price declines will negatively impact future income and cash flow to the extent of any production sold at market prices 
these declines could ultimately affect the quantity of proved oil and gas reserves and cost center ceiling values 
these results  individually or collectively  could result in bank debt default and or debt acceleration  restrict our ability to attract qualified personnel or cause further industry consolidation 
there is no requirement from any of our lenders to hedge our products 
our domestic operations are concentrated in the southwestern and mid continent regions of the united states and shallow water region of the gulf of mexico offshore texas and louisiana 
we currently have no operations outside of the united states of america 
we currently have eighteen wells that individually produce mmcfe per day or greater  but these are not concentrated in any one field

energy swap agreements 
we produce  purchase  and sell crude oil  natural gas  condensate  and natural gas liquids 
as a result  our financial results can be significantly impacted as these commodity prices fluctuate widely in response to changing market forces 
we have previously engaged in oil and gas hedging activities and intend to continue to consider various hedging arrangements to realize commodity prices which we consider favorable and to reduce volatility 
we engage in futures contracts with certain of our oil and gas production through various contracts swap agreements 
the primary objective of these activities is to protect against significant decreases in price during the term of the hedge 
the swap agreements provide for separate contracts tied to the new york mercantile exchange nymex light sweet crude oil futures and henry hub natural gas futures  and to the inside ferc natural gas index price postings index 
we have combined contracts which have agreed upon price floors and ceilings costless collars 
when the index price exceeds the contract ceiling  we pay the spread between the ceiling and the index price applied to the related contract volumes 
when the contract floor exceeds the index  we receive the spread between the contract floor and the index price applied to the related contract volumes 
to the extent we receive the spread between the contract floor and the index price applied to related contract volumes  we have a credit risk in the event of nonperformance of the counterparty to the agreement 
we do not anticipate any material impact to our results of operations as a result of nonperformance by these counterparties 
due to hedge contracts acquired in the prize merger  we were contractually obligated to a counter party to provide a margin deposit in the form of cash or bank letter of credit should the aggregate fair value of hedge contracts held with the counter party exceed a predetermined value
