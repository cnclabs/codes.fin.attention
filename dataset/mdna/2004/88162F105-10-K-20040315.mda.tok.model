item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
business overview recent increased activity levels within the oil and gas exploration and production industry have contributed to the company s increased revenues and cash flows during  compared to the prior year 
such increased cash flows from operations were primarily applied to the repayment of the company s long term debt  thus providing the company with significant flexibility and financial strength to capitalize on future opportunities for continued growth 
as of december   the company had total assets of million and working capital of million  including million of cash and temporary investments 
the company s growth strategy includes expanding its existing businesses both through internal growth as well as the pursuit of suitable acquisition transactions and identifying opportunities to establish operations in additional niche oil service markets 
given the company s financial position  such acquisitions could be consummated using cash  debt  equity  or any combination thereof 
demand for the company s products and services depends primarily on activity in the oil and gas exploration and production industry in the gulf of mexico  texas  louisiana and in selected international markets 
this activity can be significantly affected by the level of capital expenditures for the exploration and production of oil and gas reserves and for the plugging and decommissioning of abandoned oil and gas properties 
these expenditures are influenced strongly by industry expectations about oil and gas prices and the supply and demand for crude oil and natural gas 
strong oil and gas prices during late and throughout  along with general economic improvement and signs of market recovery have led to increased oil and gas industry spending during  which is expected to continue into such increased activity was reflected in the company s revenues and operating cash flows during the gulf of mexico and selected international oil and gas rig counts are leading indicators for the fluids division 
the maturity of gulf of mexico producing fields  oil and gas prices and government regulation are the drivers for the well abandonment decommissioning division 
natural gas prices and gas drilling rig counts in north and south america are key indicators for the testing services division 
gulf of mexico oil and gas rig counts were down slightly during  averaging rigs compared to an average of during international rig counts averaged during compared to during  with a majority of the increase generated in mexico  where the company has its most significant international production testing operations 
us natural gas drilling increased during compared to the prior year  with an average gas rig count of average during the fourth quarter of compared to a average during such activity was spurred by higher natural gas prices  with a average price of approximately mmbtu  compared to a average price of approximately mmbtu 
the company anticipates that industry activity and spending will again increase in  with gulf of mexico activity increasing more modestly compared to other sectors of the industry 
over the longer term  the company believes that there will continue to be growth opportunities for the company s products and services in both the us and international markets 
such increased activity will be supported by deeper gas drilling operations with more complex completions in the us  faster reservoir depletion in the us  more rigorous enforcement of environmental and abandonment regulations  advancing age of offshore platforms in the us  increasing development of oil and gas reserves abroad  and increasing future demand for natural gas and oil in the us and abroad 
the fluids division generates revenues and cash flows by manufacturing and selling completion fluids and providing filtration and associated products and engineering services to exploration and production companies worldwide 
the fluids division sells products and services primarily to domestic energy market customers  and these products and services are particularly affected by drilling activity in the gulf of mexico 
given the lack of growth in the gulf of mexico drilling activity during compared to  the fluids division revenues increased only slightly during the year and earnings decreased 
the company s management anticipates that worldwide spending on exploration and production activities will increase in over the prior year  although management believes that gulf of mexico activity will increase more modestly than growth rates worldwide 
this increase in activity  combined with the company s current market position as a major supplier of completion fluids  should provide a modest increase in revenues and cash flows for this division in the well abandonment decommissioning division generates revenues and cash flows by performing well plug and abandonment  pipeline and platform decommissioning and removal and site clearance services for oil and gas companies 
in addition  the division provides electric wireline  workover  engineering and drilling services and is a producer of oil and gas 
services are marketed in the gulf coast region of the us including onshore  offshore and in the inland waters 
platform decommissioning and well abandonment operations are driven primarily by mms regulations and oil and gas company activity levels 
led by the division s offshore abandonment and decommissioning operations  divisional revenues and cash flows increased significantly in  compared to the prior year  reflecting an increased market share as well as overall increased well abandonment and decommissioning activity levels in the gulf of mexico 
given the advancing age of offshore platforms in the gulf of mexico  management expects the division s well abandonment and decommissioning activities to again expand in the division includes maritech resources  inc maritech  a wholly owned subsidiary formed in to acquire  produce and exploit oil and gas properties in conjunction with the company s well abandonment business 
maritech s business is strongly affected by oil and gas prices and the availability of producing properties which could be acquired on acceptable terms 
maritech also generated increased revenues and cash flows during  resulting from higher commodity prices and the acquisition of additional producing properties in late and early the testing services division generates revenues and cash flows by performing flowback pressure and volume testing and other services for oil and gas producers 
the primary markets served are texas  louisiana  mississippi  alabama  offshore gulf of mexico  mexico and venezuela 
the testing services division also provides technology and services required for separation and recycling of oily residuals generated from petroleum refining  primarily to oil refineries in the united states 
testing services division revenues increased slightly during compared to the prior year  due to increased oil and gas drilling activity 
management expects additional growth in this division in  based on anticipated increases in industry drilling and completion activities both domestically and internationally 
critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing its consolidated financial statements  the company makes assumptions  estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported 
the company periodically evaluates its estimates and judgments related to potential impairments of long lived assets including goodwill  the collectibility of accounts receivable  and the current cost of future abandonment and decommissioning obligations 
note b summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements contains the accounting policies governing each of these matters 
the company s estimates are based on historical experience and on future expectations that are believed to be reasonable 
the combination of these factors forms the basis for judgments made about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results are likely to differ from the company s current estimates  and those differences may be material 
impairment of long lived assets the determination of impairment of long lived assets  including goodwill  is conducted periodically whenever indicators of impairment are present 
if such indicators are present  the determination of the amount of impairment is based on the company s judgments as to the future operating cash flows to be generated from these assets throughout their estimated useful lives 
the oil and gas industry is cyclical  and the company s estimates of the period over which future cash flows will be generated  as well as the predictability of these cash flows  can have significant impact on the carrying value of these assets and  in periods of prolonged down cycles  may result in impairment charges 
oil and gas properties maritech accounts for its interests in oil and gas properties using the successful efforts method  whereby costs incurred to drill and equip development wells  including unsuccessful development wells  are capitalized and costs related to unsuccessful exploratory wells are expensed as incurred 
all capitalized costs are accumulated and recorded separately for each field  and are depleted on a unit of production basis  based on the estimated remaining proved oil and gas reserves of each field 
the process of estimating oil and gas reserves is complex  requiring significant decisions and assumptions in the evaluation of available geological  geophysical  engineering and economic data for each reservoir 
as a result  these estimates are inherently imprecise 
actual future production  cash flows  development expenditures  operating and abandonment expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves may vary substantially from those initially estimated by maritech 
any significant variance in these assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of proved reserves 
maritech s oil and gas properties are assessed for impairment in value whenever indicators become evident  with any impairment charged to expense 
maritech purchases oil and gas properties and assumes the related well abandonment and decommissioning liabilities 
many of the transactions have been structured so that the estimated fair market value of the oil and gas reserves acquired and recorded approximately equals the amount of the working interest ownership of the well abandonment and decommissioning liabilities recorded  net of any cash received or paid 
therefore  any difference in the actual amounts of oil and gas reserves produced or decommissioning costs incurred will affect the company s anticipated profitability 
decommissioning liabilities the company estimates the third party market values including an estimated profit to plug and abandon the wells  decommission the pipelines and platforms and clear the sites  and uses these estimates to record maritech s well abandonment and decommissioning liabilities  net of amounts allocable to joint interest owners and any contractual amount to be paid by the previous owners of the property referred to as decommissioning liabilities 
in estimating the decommissioning liabilities  the company performs detailed estimating procedures  analysis and engineering studies 
whenever practical  maritech utilizes the services of its affiliated companies to perform well abandonment and decommissioning work 
when these services are performed by an affiliated company  all recorded intercompany revenues are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements 
the recorded decommissioning liability associated with a specific property is fully extinguished when the property is completely abandoned 
the liability is first reduced by all cash expenses incurred to abandon and decommission the property 
if the liability exceeds or is less than the company s out of pocket costs  the difference is reported as income or loss in the period in which the work is performed 
the company reviews the adequacy of its decommissioning liability whenever indicators suggest that either the amount or timing of the estimated cash flows underlying the liability have changed materially 
the timing and amounts of these cash flows are subject to changes in the energy industry environment and may result in additional liabilities recorded  which in turn would increase the carrying values of the related properties 
revenue recognition the company generates revenue on certain well abandonment and decommissioning projects from billings under contracts  which are typically of short duration  that provide for either lump sum turnkey charges or specific time  material and equipment charges which are billed in accordance with the terms of such contracts 
with regard to turnkey contracts  revenue is recognized using the percentage of completion method based on the ratio of costs incurred to total estimated costs at completion 
total project revenue and cost estimates for turnkey contracts are reviewed periodically as work progresses  and adjustments are reflected in the period in which such estimates are revised 
provisions for estimated losses on such contracts are made in the period such losses are determined 
bad debt reserves reserves for bad debts are calculated on a specific identification basis  whereby the company estimates whether or not specific accounts receivable will be collected 
a significant portion of the company s revenues come from oil and gas exploration and production companies 
if  due to adverse circumstances  certain customers are unable to repay some or all of the amounts owed the company  an additional bad debt allowance may be required 
income taxes the company provides for income taxes by taking into account the differences between the financial statement treatment and tax treatment of certain transactions 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect of a change in tax rates is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment date 
this calculation requires the company to make certain estimates about its future operations 
changes in state  federal and foreign tax laws  as well as changes in the company s financial condition  could affect these estimates 
results of operations the following data should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the associated notes contained elsewhere in this document

consolidated gross profit for was million compared to million during  an increase of 
overall  gross profit was of revenues during compared to of revenues during general and administrative expenses consolidated general and administrative expenses increased million to million during compared to million during the prior year  an increase of 
this increase was primarily caused by a million increase in payroll and incentive compensation and a million increase in professional fees consistent with the company s growth and with industry trends 
the increase in professional fees was also due to unusually low professional fees during due to the recovery of million of legal fees associated with a long standing lawsuit 
also  beginning in the company reflected million of accretion expenses related to asset retirement obligations in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas rules 
despite these increases in general and administrative costs  as a percentage of revenues  general and administrative expenses decreased to of revenues during compared to of revenues during other income expense other income and expense was million of income for the current year compared to million of income in the prior year 
this change is primarily due to million of gains on sales of property  plant and equipment during  compared to a million loss on such disposals in the prior year 
interest expense and income taxes net interest expense decreased from million during to million during the current year  a decrease of  due to the company s reduction and eventual payment of the balance outstanding under its bank credit facility during also  prior to paying the remaining balance of the facility  interest expense was reflected at lower interest rates during compared to the prior year s expense  due partly to the company s interest rate swap contract  which expired after the end of the company s average interest rate during was approximately 
the provision for income taxes was million in  an increase of million  as a result of increased earnings compared to the prior year 
the effective tax rate for the year decreased to during compared to in  due primarily to a reduction in the impact of international income taxes 
net income net income before discontinued operations and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle was million during compared to million during net income per diluted share before discontinued operations and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle was with  shares outstanding compared to with  shares outstanding 
in september  the company sold its subsidiary  damp rid  inc  and made the decision to discontinue its norwegian process services operation 
the company recorded a gain of million from the sale of damp rid  net of taxes of million  and a loss of million for the asset impairment related to the future disposal of the norwegian process services facility  net of million tax benefit 
net income from discontinued operations per diluted share during was compared to a net loss of in the prior year  primarily due to the net gain on disposal of damp rid 
in july  the financial accounting standards board released sfas  accounting for asset retirement obligations  which requires that costs associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets be recorded as part of the carrying value of the asset when the obligation is incurred 
the company adopted the provisions of sfas on january  prior to  the company expensed the costs of retiring its non oil and gas properties at the time of retirement 
in addition  prior to the company recorded the retirement obligations associated with its oil and gas properties at an undiscounted fair market value 
the effect of adopting sfas was to record a charge of million per diluted share  net of taxes of million  to expense the costs of retirement obligations associated with the company s existing long lived assets and to accrete the liability to its present value as of january  net income for the year ended december  was million compared to million in the prior year  an increase of million or 
net income per diluted share was with  shares outstanding compared to with  shares outstanding 
divisional comparisons fluids division fluids division revenues increased million to million during compared to million during the prior year  an increase of  primarily due to an approximate million increase from higher product sales volumes and approximately million from pricing improvements 
the division also reflected increased revenues of approximately million  resulting from improved utilization of filtration service equipment and an estimated million from fluids product market share gains 
these increases domestically were largely offset  however  by decreases in international fluids revenues  particularly in the united kingdom and norway  where decreased north sea activity contributed to a revenue decrease of million compared to the prior year 
despite the overall revenue increase  gross profit for the fluids division decreased by million to million  a decrease 
gross profit percentage for the fluids division decreased from of revenues during to of revenues during  as approximately million of increases in product and related costs  including feedstocks  transportation  utilities  repair and maintenance  payroll and insurance more than offset million of pricing increases 
gross profits were also lower by approximately million  due to lower margin product sales in certain operating areas 
fluids division profitability was particularly affected by a decline in activity related to the decrease in the average gulf of mexico rig count during compared to future revenue and profit levels will continue to be affected by overall energy market activity levels 
the above mentioned decrease in north sea activity also resulted in an additional gross profit decrease of approximately million related to the division s international operations 
fluids division income before taxes decreased by million to million during  a decrease compared to the prior year  due to the above mentioned million decrease in gross profit  offset partially by approximately million in decreased overall administrative costs for the division 
well abandonment decommissioning division the well abandonment decommissioning wa d division reflected revenues of million during compared to million during the prior year  an increase of million  or 
the largest revenue increase was generated by the division s offshore abandonment and decommissioning business  with an increase of million  which captured an increased share of the overall increased activity levels in the gulf of mexico and  in particular  benefited from the timing during of several large projects for specific customers 
these operations are driven primarily by the maturity of the gulf of mexico fields  and the age of the platforms and structures in the gulf 
increased overall gulf of mexico activity levels should continue as existing gulf of mexico fields continue to deplete  and the number of aging offshore platforms requiring decommissioning increases 
the division s inland water well abandonment operations also reflected increased activity early in the year  with a million increase despite lower rates for its services due to competition and its land operations contributed a million increase  which includes approximately million of added revenues from an acquisition during also contributing to the increased wa d division revenues was its maritech oil and gas production subsidiary  which contributed approximately million of additional production revenues related to producing properties acquired in late and early  and an approximate million increase in revenues from higher oil and gas commodity prices during wa d division gross profit also rose significantly  increasing from million in to million in  an increase of million  or 
gross profit percentage for the wa d division increased to of revenues from of revenues in the prior year 
these gross profit increases were also led by the division s offshore abandonment and decommissioning operations  which reflected a gross profit increase of million  primarily from the successful completion of several large projects and a million gain from the settlement of an insurance claim for the prior year s damages to the company s heavy lift barge 
the division s inland water plug and abandonment and rig operations reflected approximately a million decrease in gross profit compared to the prior year  and have been negatively affected during the second half of by lower rates and reduced activity related to the recent and pending ownership changes of many inland water properties 
the company has taken certain steps to reduce the cost structure of its inland water operations 
maritech s gross profit increased approximately million due to the above mentioned producing property acquisitions as well as approximately million from increased commodity prices 
such increases more than offset the million charge for maritech s relinquishment of an oil and gas property during the year 
income before taxes for the wa d division increased significantly to million  a million or increase from the prior year 
the above mentioned increase in gross profit of million was offset partially by approximately million of division personnel infrastructure cost increases  consistent with the increased levels of activity 
the division also reflected million of expense related to fas accretion for maritech s abandonment and decommissioning liabilities beginning in testing services division testing services division revenues increased million during the current year  increasing from million during to million  an increase of  largely due to a million revenue increase from the domestic production testing operations  which have recently reflected increased drilling and completion activity in the texas and louisiana areas 
this increase in domestic production testing activity more than offset a million decline in production testing revenues in mexico and venezuela 
revenues for process services increased million during compared to the prior year  due to higher demand and increased processed volumes 
gross profit for the testing services division was million during and increased domestic production testing activity was more than offset by increased costs and the lower overall utilization of the operation s resource base  resulting in a million decrease in gross profit for this business 
the increased process services demand resulted in throughput efficiencies which resulted in increased gross profit of approximately million 
division gross profit as a percentage of revenues decreased from to 
testing services division income before taxes decreased million  from million to million  a decrease compared to the prior year 
administrative costs for professional services increased during  compared to the prior year  due to the recovery during of approximately million of legal fees associated with a long standing lawsuit 
other administrative cost increases related to increased personnel infrastructure costs of approximately million  primarily related to the domestic production testing operations 
such increases were partially offset by million of gains on sales of production testing equipment during the year 
corporate overhead the company includes in corporate overhead general and administrative expense  interest income and expense and other income and expense 
such expenses and income are not allocated to the company s business segments  as they relate to the company s general corporate activities 
corporate overhead increased from million in to million during  a million increase compared to the prior year 
this increase was primarily caused by approximately million of increased corporate salary and incentive compensation expenses  million of increased professional services and public company expenses  and million of increased corporate insurance expense 
such increases were partially mitigated by a million decrease in interest expense  as a result of the decrease in long term debt outstanding  and an approximate million decrease in corporate insurance claims and other fringe benefit costs during the year 
compared to consolidated comparisons revenues and gross profit consolidated revenues for the year ended december  were million  down million or from the prior year total of million 
all operating divisions of the company experienced a drop in their revenues  as represented a peak activity year for the oil and gas industry  and in the industry experienced a significant downturn in rig count activity resulting from decreased oil and gas prices 
gross profit for the year was million compared to million in the prior year  a decrease of million or 
the decrease is principally the result of the drop in revenues of million during the year combined with a decrease in gross margin percentage from to 
general and administrative expenses consolidated general and administrative expenses were million in compared to million in the prior year  a decrease of million or 
however  general and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue increased to in from in the prior year  due to decreased revenues 
reductions of million in incentive compensation  lower legal expenses as a result of the recovery of legal costs of million associated with a long standing suit settled in  and million of reduced sales and marketing expenses accounted for most of the decrease 
these reductions were partially offset by million of costs for additional infrastructure in information technology and other corporate departments necessary to support the future growth of the company 
other income expense other income and expense was million of income for the year compared to million of expense in the prior year 
this change is a result of state tax refunds offset by losses on the disposal of fixed assets  loan fees and various foreign non income taxes in excess of the prior year amounts 
interest expense and income taxes net interest expense for the year was million compared to million in the prior year 
the increase was primarily a result of the interest expense allocation to discontinued operations in the first three quarters of actual interest paid decreased million from the prior year due to a significant reduction in average long term debt 
the provision for income taxes was million in  a decrease of million as a result of reduced earnings from the prior year 
the effective tax rate for the year was versus in  due primarily to a reduction in state income tax expense and the utilization of general business credits 
net income net income before discontinued operations was million during compared to million during net income per diluted share before discontinued operations was with  shares outstanding compared to with  shares outstanding 
discontinued operations include the operations of damp rid  inc and the company s norwegian process services operations 
income loss per diluted share from discontinued operations was a loss of during compared to an income of during net income for the year was million compared to million in the prior year 
for  net income per diluted share was on  average diluted shares outstanding compared to per diluted share on  average diluted shares outstanding in  or excluding goodwill amortization 
divisional comparisons fluids division the fluids division reported revenues of million  a decrease of million or from the prior year 
the division s domestic revenues decreased million  reflecting the drop of in the average offshore gulf of mexico rig count from  while the division s international revenues decreased million  reflecting the drop of in the average rig count activity for certain international regions in which the division operates 
weather conditions in the gulf of mexico in the fourth quarter contributed approximately million to the revenue decrease  as did political events in venezuela  which were the main cause of a million decline in revenues from that country 
fluids division gross profit decreased  or million  from million to million  as a result of the lower revenues caused by the factors described above  which consequently reduced gross profit by million 
helping to offset this decline was an improvement in this division s gross profit percentage from to  as improved pricing in select areas contributed an approximate million increase in gross profit  and a favorable mix of product and service revenues generated an approximate million increase in gross profit compared to the prior year 
fluids division income before taxes decreased million  or  to million compared to the prior year 
this decrease primarily reflects an approximate million decrease in income from lower demand  offset by the approximate million increase in income from pricing and more favorable mix of higher margin product and service revenues 
well abandonment decommissioning division the wa d division reported revenues of million  a decrease of million or from the prior year 
the division s heavy lift barge  the southern hercules  was out of service for approximately ten months of the year for renovation and repair  contributing approximately million to the decrease in revenues 
the most significant decrease  however  was due to the september and october gulf of mexico hurricanes and earlier tropical storms  which contributed to lower utilization of the inland water and offshore well abandonment rigs and equipment for much of the second half of the year 
the reduced utilization resulted in an estimated revenue decrease of million as compared to the same period for the prior year 
in addition  revenues for the division s exploitation and production company  maritech  were million lower than the previous year  a reduction 
this decrease was due primarily to an estimated million revenue decrease resulting from shut in production due to hurricane damage as well as an approximate million decrease in revenues from lower commodity prices received during the year 
the division s electric wireline business saw its equipment utilization drop significantly from the prior year  which was the primary cause of a million revenue decrease  as the lower rig count activity contributed to fewer projects in addition to putting downward pressure on pricing for services 
wa d division gross profit declined million during to million  a decrease from the prior year  and divisional gross profit as a percentage of revenues decreased from to 
the lower utilization of the division s rig fleet and heavy lift barge in addition to the costs and downtime related to the gulf of mexico storms in the second half of the year contributed approximately million to the decline 
in the first quarter  the division s heavy lift barge the southern hercules was involved in a storm related accident that resulted in significant downtime and repair expense  contributing approximately million to the decline in gross profit 
during this downtime period  the company elected to perform substantial upgrades and capital improvements to the southern hercules before returning it to service  which was anticipated in the second quarter of during  the company received proceeds from an insurance claim for a significant portion of its repair costs  however  the repair costs related to the southern hercules were expensed as incurred in decreased electric wireline equipment utilization further reduced division gross profit by approximately million 
the division also increased its infrastructure in the decommissioning and well abandonment businesses to accommodate the higher activity associated with the acquisition opportunities and the management of maritech oil and gas properties  resulting in an approximate million reduction in gross profit 
maritech s gross profit was lower than the previous year due  in part  to lower average realized commodity prices in resulting in a decrease in revenues of approximately million  and a further decrease of approximately million from higher downtime  repair expenses and logistics costs related to the gulf of mexico storms 
wa d division income before taxes decreased million to million  an decrease from the prior year  due primarily to an million decrease from lower equipment utilization  million from heavy lift barge downtime and repair expenses  million from lower commodity prices and million from lost production and costs related to storms 
the previously mentioned increased personnel infrastructure for the decommissioning and well abandonment businesses included administrative costs associated with the acquisition opportunities and the management of maritech oil and gas properties as well  resulting in a total decrease in earnings of approximately million 
testing services division revenues for the testing services division were million  a decrease of million or from the prior year 
revenues for the domestic production testing group decreased by million  a decrease from the prior year  primarily due to the drop in the us average gas rig count of 
the division acquired the assets of precision well testing company in july   bolstering the offshore gulf of mexico equipment fleet and increasing revenue by approximately million 
testing services division gross profit decreased to million  a million decrease from the prior year  with a decrease in gross profit percentage from to 
lower gas drilling activity contributed to much of the decline in the production testing business  where underutilized equipment and personnel reduced margins by approximately million domestically and million internationally 
testing services division income before taxes decreased million to million  a decrease compared to the prior year  primarily due to the above mentioned decreases in overall production testing business activity  which resulted in an approximate million decrease in earnings 
the division s earnings for the year also reflected a decrease in the division s general and administrative expenses compared to  primarily due to lower legal expenses as a result of recovery of legal costs of million associated with a long standing suit settled in corporate overhead the company includes in corporate overhead general and administrative expense  interest income and expense and other income and expense 
such expenses and income are not allocated to the company s business segments  as they relate to the company s general corporate activities 
corporate overhead decreased from million in the prior year to million during  a decrease of million or 
this decrease in general corporate overhead was primarily due to a million reduction in corporate incentive compensation expenses and a million decrease in corporate legal expenses  which was offset somewhat by an increase of million of expenses for additional infrastructure in information technology and a higher net interest expense of million 
liquidity and capital resources the company has historically funded its growth and working capital needs primarily from the cash flows from its three operating divisions and its revolving line of credit 
during the year ended december   the company generated a total of approximately million of cash flow from operating activities 
this cash flow was supplemented by an additional million of net proceeds from the sale of the company s damp rid  inc subsidiary during september this cash flow was used to repay the remaining outstanding balance of its existing bank line of credit 
at december   the company had working capital of approximately million and unrestricted cash and temporary investments of approximately million 
during the three year period ended december   the company generated approximately million of net cash flow from operating activities  which it used to fund the purchase of approximately million of capital expenditures and million of acquisitions 
an additional million  net of borrowings  was used to retire long term debt during this three year period 
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was million during compared to million in  an increase of million 
this increase was primarily due to the growth in revenues and profitability from the company s wa d division which resulted from higher utilization and activity levels as well as from increased oil and gas production cash flows 
increased overall operating activities during the fourth quarter of compared to the prior year resulted in an increase in accounts receivable at december  compared to the prior year balance 
the company has historically generated net operating cash flow from each of its three operating divisions 
future operating cash flows are largely dependent upon the level of oil and gas industry activity  particularly in the gulf of mexico region of the us while the company expects that such industry activity will increase in  the resulting net cash flow will also be affected by the impact of competition  the prices for its products and services  and the operating and administrative costs required to deliver its products and services 
in addition to the above factors  future operating cash flow will also continue to be affected by the timing of expenditures required for the plugging  abandonment and decommissioning of maritech s oil and gas properties 
the third party market value  including an estimated profit  of maritech s decommissioning liability was million as of december   and the cash outflow necessary to extinguish this liability is expected to occur over several years  shortly after the end of each property s productive life 
such timing is estimated based on the future oil and gas production cash flows as indicated by the company s oil and gas reserve estimates and  as such  are imprecise and subject to change due to changing commodity prices  reserve revisions and other factors 
the company s decommissioning liability is net of amounts allocable to joint interest owners and any contractual amount to be paid by the previous owners of the properties 
investing activities cash capital expenditures for the year ended december  were million 
approximately million was invested in the wa d division primarily related to development expenditures on maritech s offshore oil and gas properties 
also  the division invested in additional equipment assets  particularly for its plug and abandonment and wireline businesses 
the fluids division incurred approximately million of capital expenditures for the procurement of plant additions  particularly related to its chlorides manufacturing business 
approximately million was invested in the testing services division  a significant portion of which went to replace and enhance the production testing equipment fleet 
the company also invested additional capital in its process services operations to enhance its oily residual separation business 
the remaining capital expenditures were used to support general corporate activities 
during  the company disposed of certain production testing assets  oil and gas properties and other various assets for proceeds of million  in addition to the sale of its damp rid subsidiary 
during the first quarter of  maritech purchased oil and gas producing properties in four separate transactions 
maritech purchased oil and gas producing assets in offshore gulf of mexico and onshore louisiana locations in exchange for the assumption of approximately million in decommissioning liabilities 
these oil and gas producing assets were purchased for approximately the value of the decommissioning liabilities assumed  less cash received of million 
the company continues to pursue the purchase of additional producing oil and gas properties as part of its strategy to support its wa d division 
while the purchases of such properties are primarily funded through the assumption of the associated decommissioning liabilities  the transactions may also involve the payment or receipt of cash at closing 
the company expects to continue its ongoing capital expenditure program in order to grow and expand its existing operations in each of its operating divisions 
the company expects to fund such capital expenditures in through cash flows from operations 
the vast majority of the company s future cash capital expenditure plans is discretionary  however  and may be postponed or cancelled as conditions change 
in addition  the company s strategy includes the pursuit of suitable acquisition transactions and the identification of opportunities to establish operations in additional niche oil service markets 
given the company s financial position  such acquisitions could be consummated using cash  debt  equity  or any combination thereof 
to the extent the company consummates a significant transaction  all or a portion of the purchase consideration may be funded with cash  which could significantly alter the company s liquidity position 
other commercial commitments of the company as of december  include letters of credit of million  all of which will expire within one year 
financing activities to fund its capital and working capital requirements  the company supplements its cash flow from operating activities as needed from its general purpose  secured  prime rate libor based revolving line of credit with a bank syndicate led by bank of america 
in september  the company amended its credit facility  expanding its available line of credit to million 
this agreement matures in december  carries no amortization  and is secured by accounts receivable and inventories 
the agreement permits the company to execute up to million of capital leases and million of unsecured senior notes  and there are no limitations or restrictions on operating leases or unsecured nonrecourse financing 
the company s credit facility is subject to common financial ratio covenants and dollar limits on the total amount of capital expenditures and acquisitions the company may undertake in any given year without receiving a waiver from the lenders 
the company pays a commitment fee on unused portions of the line and a libor based interest rate on any outstanding balance  plus an additional to above the libor based interest rate based upon changes in a designated debt ratio

the sec has recently questioned the application of certain provisions of sfas no 
and sfas no 
to companies in the extractive industries 
specifically  the accounting for and disclosure of mineral rights held under lease and other contractual arrangements has been questioned in various comment letters issued to companies in the oil and gas industry 
the issue is whether sfas no 
requires companies to classify the costs of mineral rights held under lease or other contractual arrangements associated with extracting oil and gas as intangible assets in the balance sheet  apart from other capitalized oil and gas property costs  and provide specific footnote disclosures 
historically  the company has included the costs of such mineral rights associated with its oil and gas exploitation and production as a component of oil and gas properties 
if it is ultimately determined that sfas no 
requires oil and gas companies to classify costs of mineral rights held under lease or other contractual arrangements associated with extracting oil and gas as a separate intangible assets line item on the balance sheet  a significant amount of capitalized costs would be reclassified out of oil and gas properties  net of accumulated depletion  depreciation and amortization  pursuant to this requirement
