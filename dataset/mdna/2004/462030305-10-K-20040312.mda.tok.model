item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview iomega designs and markets products that help customers protect  secure  capture and share their valuable digital information 
the company has organized its products into three broad business categories to align with its customers for marketing purposes a mobile and desktop storage products  b network storage systems and c new technologies 
mobile and desktop storage products include zip drives and disks  optical drives including cd rw and dvd rewritable drives as well as portable and desktop hard disk drives hdd  iomega mini and micro mini usb drives  external floppy disk drives and various software titles 
at december   network storage systems consisted of a selection of network attached storage nas servers with capacities of gigabytes gb  where gigabyte equals billion bytes  to terabytes tb  where terabyte equals trillion bytes 
the company s new technologies include the development expenses associated with two new magnetic storage technologies  a removable hard disk storage system  referred to as removable rigid disk rrd technology or by the rev trademark  that is expected to have a native capacity of approximately gb and a compressed capacity of up to gb and a small form factor removable flexible magnetic storage device referred to as digital capture technology or dct that is expected to have a capacity of about to gb 
there have been no sales associated with new technologies 
no sales are expected from rev products until april and no sales are expected from dct until sometime during the summer of during  the company reported a net loss of million  or per share  on sales of million which compares to net income in of million  or per diluted share  on sales of million 
sales decreased primarily from the continuing decline of the zip product business 
the net loss for included pre tax restructuring charges of million  but was favorably impacted by million of net pre tax legal settlements and various tax adjustments which net to a million benefit see the tax discussion for more details 
net income for included costs relating to the sale of the company s penang manufacturing subsidiary  consisting of million pre tax impairment charges and an additional million tax provision related to the company s earnings previously considered to be permanently invested in non us operations and a benefit of million resulting from a decrease in the valuation allowance for net deferred tax assets 
net income for also included an million pre tax release of marketing accruals  million of net unfavorable pre tax legal settlements  a million pre tax release of rebate and price protection accruals recorded in prior periods that were not claimed as originally estimated and a pre tax million reversal of restructuring charges 
for  the company had an operating loss of million  compared to an operating profit of million for the operating loss for included million of restructuring charges and million of net favorable legal settlements 
operating income for included million of impairment charges related to the sale of the company s penang manufacturing subsidiary  an million release of marketing accruals  million of net unfavorable legal settlements  a million release of rebate and price protection accruals recorded in prior periods that were not claimed as originally estimated and a million reversal of restructuring charges 
iomega corporation and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued overview continued during  the company implemented plans to restructure its operations and recorded restructuring charges of million and anticipates recording another million of restructuring charges in the first quarter of  primarily for the severance and benefits of employees who are on transition 
substantially all of the restructuring charges are expected to be cash charges 
during  million of cash was paid for the and previously recorded restructuring actions 
some of the cash charges will be paid beyond since the company will most likely continue to pay the lease payments associated with vacated facilities on a monthly basis through the remaining life of the leases 
the company anticipates paying approximately million in in cash for both the and restructuring actions 
the company anticipates that the restructuring actions will result in annual cost and expense reductions of approximately million to million as compared to first half run rates  when fully implemented in despite the company s efforts to slow the decline in zip product sales  the company expects the sales from zip products to continue to decline as the product segment completes its lifecycle 
other mobile and desktop sales increased as the company introduced new mobile and desktop storage products such as mini and floppy usb drives to leverage the iomega brand 
although increased sales of these products partially offset the decline in zip sales during  the company s margins on such products are substantially smaller than on zip products 
during  the company plans to continue introducing new mobile and desktop storage products 
with respect to the company s optical products  the company plans to continue the transition from cd rw drives to dvd rewritable drives 
during the fourth quarter of  the company decided to focus its nas strategy on the low end and certain models of the mid range of the target market and is in the process of exiting the high end products costing  to  per unit of the target market 
during  the company plans to focus on the sales of servers with capacities ranging from gb to tb 
by focusing on the lower end of the target market  the company expects to better leverage its small to medium sized business customer base and channel customers  including existing vars already focused on these customers 
despite significant efforts and spending on marketing and product introductions during and  the company was not successful in penetrating the high end of the target market and first tier corporate reseller channels and thus made the decision to exit this market 
the company is also continuing to focus the majority of its research and development resources on its two new magnetic storage technologies  rev products and dct 
the company s number one goal is to successfully launch its rev products in april the company plans to target rev products as a tape replacement product for both the entry and mid range segments of the tape drive market 
with respect to dct  the company plans on introducing a dct based credit card sized pc card drive and external usb hi speed usb drive under the iomega brand in the summer of it is the company s goal to gain the commitment of leading consumer electronics brands to either build the drive into future products or adopt some of the available dct based original design manufacturer s designs 
the company believes that in order to achieve this goal  it is critical to successfully demonstrate that consumers value low cost  high capacity removability in mobile consumer electronic applications 
the company further believes that the overall commercial success of dct is dependent upon significant consumer electronics oem adoption of the product 
the company does not believe that it will be able to generate a quarterly operating profit unless and until its new rev products and dct technology are successfully launched and become profitable 
in the meantime  it is imperative that the company continues to control its costs and improve operating efficiencies to minimize losses 
management anticipates that rev products should be profitable by the fourth quarter of  but it is unlikely that dct will be profitable during  unless some major oems adopt dct technology into their products 
additionally  the company s overall gross margins are expected to continue to decline as higher margin zip product sales are displaced with lower margin sales from sourced branded products such as optical products  external hard drives  mini and micro mini usb drives and external floppy disk drives 
iomega corporation and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued overview continued during the third quarter of  the board of directors declared a one time cash dividend of per share to stockholders of record as of the close of business on september   which was paid on october  the amount of the dividend paid was million 
at december   the company s total cash  cash equivalents and temporary investment balance was million see the liquidity and capital resources discussion for more detail on the tax impacts of repatriating the foreign cash 
the company believes this total cash is sufficient to operate the business and fund the investments required for rev and dct products for the next two or more years 
critical accounting estimates and assumptions the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of sales and expenses during the reporting periods 
areas where significant judgments are made that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made and are susceptible to material changes from period to period include revenue recognition  price protection and rebate reserves  marketing program accruals  allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory valuation reserves and tax valuation allowances 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
management has discussed the development and selection of the following critical accounting estimates and assumptions with the audit committee of the company s board of directors audit committee and the audit committee has reviewed these disclosures 
revenue recognition the company defers recognition of sales on estimated excess inventory in the distribution  retail and catalog channels 
for this purpose  excess inventory is the amount of inventory that exceeds the channels four week requirements as estimated by management 
oem and var customers are not considered to have excess inventory as they tend to not carry more than four weeks of inventory 
the distribution  retail and catalog channels four week requirements are estimated based on inventory and sell through amounts reported weekly to the company by the company s key customers  who make up the majority of the company s sales in these channels 
no adjustment is made for those customers that do not report inventory and sell through information 
this inventory and sell through information is reported to the company at the stock keeping unit sku level 
however  for purposes of the excess inventory calculation  this information is accumulated at the major product level ie zip megabyte mb drive  zip mb drive  etc 
the company uses the last weeks of reported sell through information to calculate a weekly average  which is then used to estimate the channels four week requirements 
this estimate may not be indicative of four weeks of future sell through 
the company defers sales and cost of sales associated with estimated excess channel inventory in the consolidated statements of operations  with the resulting offset being reflected in the consolidated balance sheets in margin on deferred revenue 
at december   the company had million in margin on deferred revenue associated with excess channel inventory  which reflected a deferral of million of sales and million of cost of sales 
at december   the company had million in margin on deferred revenue associated with excess channel inventory  which reflected a deferral of million of sales and million of cost of sales 
the decrease in the reserve for resulted primarily from lower levels of zip product channel inventory 
iomega corporation and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued critical accounting estimates and assumptions continued the company believes that the accounting estimates related to excess channel inventory are critical accounting estimates because the reserve is highly susceptible to change from period to period due to the variability of the different inputs to the calculation of the reserve such as changes in the level of channel inventory and channel sell through rates the material impact that changes in these inputs can have on sales  cost of sales and margin on deferred revenue and a change in methodology in calculating the company s four week requirement could have a material impact on sales  cost of sales and margin on deferred revenue 
excess channel inventory is a critical estimate for all segments of the company s business 
since the company has no material debt and adequate cash balances  the company believes that changes in excess channel inventory accruals would not impact the company s liquidity 
price protection and rebate reserves the company has agreements with some of its customers which  in the event of a price decrease  allow those customers subject to limitations a credit equal to the difference between the price originally paid and the new decreased price on units in the customer s inventory on the date of the price decrease not to exceed the number of units shipped to the customer for a specified time period prior to the price decrease 
when a price decrease is anticipated  the company establishes reserves against gross trade receivables with the corresponding reduction in sales for estimated amounts to be reimbursed to qualifying customers 
in addition  the company records reserves at the time of shipment for estimated volume rebates and other estimated rebates given to consumers at the time of purchase from channel partners for which sales have been recognized 
estimates for rebates are based on a number of variable factors that depend on the specific program or product 
these variables include the anticipated redemption rate of rebates  anticipated sales volumes in the channel  the perceived consumer value of the rebate and historical experience 
changes in any of these variables would have a direct impact on the amount of the recorded reserves 
the company uses price protection and rebate programs in all of its segments and the statement of operations charges are recorded against their respective segment 
the company believes that the accounting estimates related to price protection and rebate programs are critical accounting estimates because the reserve is highly susceptible to change from period to period due to the assumptions made concerning redemption rates and other variables and changes in this reserve can have a material impact on sales and trade receivables 
price protection and rebate reserves have been variable in the past 
for example  during  million of price protection and rebate reserves that were recorded in prior periods were released as they were not claimed as originally estimated 
reserves for volume and other rebates and price protection totaled million and million at december  and  respectively  and are netted against trade receivables in the consolidated balance sheets 
the decrease in this reserve for was primarily a reflection of lower rebate and price protection programs during relative to the lower sales in the company believes that the use of rebates will continue to be a significant part of the company s business strategy 
since the company has no material debt and adequate cash balances  the company believes that changes in price protection and rebate accruals would not impact the company s liquidity 
iomega corporation and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued critical accounting estimates and assumptions continued marketing program accruals the company  as part of its normal operations  has entered into contracts with many of the company s distribution and retail customers whereby the customer is allowed to use a set percentage of its purchases of the company s products for various marketing purposes 
the purpose of these contracts is to encourage advertising and promotional events to promote the sale of the company s products 
the company also contracts with various third parties to support these customer programs 
the company accrues for the estimated costs of these marketing programs with the customers and third parties in accordance with the contractual percentage of product sold to the respective customer and the estimated support costs during the period that the product is sold or the period that the support costs are incurred 
during the period  the customer and company develop and approve specific marketing programs to utilize the above funds in a manner intended to best promote the company s products 
on a quarterly basis  the company evaluates the adequacy of these marketing program accruals to cover known marketing programs that the company has agreed to pay and or share costs with the customer 
in addition  the company evaluates the specific programs for proper classification of these costs in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
 vendor income statement characterization of consideration paid to a reseller of the vendor s products eitf 
the company believes that the accounting estimates related to marketing program accruals are critical accounting estimates because changes in these accruals can have a material impact on selling  general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations and on accrued marketing in the consolidated balance sheets 
the company makes estimates regarding marketing program accruals in all of the company s segments and the statement of operations impact is either specifically identified by segment or allocated across all segments depending upon the nature of the program 
at december   these accrued marketing costs totaled million  compared to million at december  the decrease in accrued marketing costs during was attributable to lower accruals resulting from fewer marketing programs relative to lower sales during during  the company released million of marketing accruals that related primarily to changes in estimates associated with various programs the company implemented during and as the company attempted to reverse the declining trends of revenue 
the company s previous accrual process combined with the lag times associated with customer claims and the high volume of programs during and made it difficult to determine when the individual marketing claims were actually completed 
in conjunction with this  the company also anticipated that there would be full participation by all customers but it was difficult to determine the actual liability until a full review of all customer deductions had been completed 
in several instances  some customers subsequently chose not to participate in the marketing programs 
each customer routinely deducts from its payment those items that it believes the company owes the customer for market development funds and other programs 
with some programs  customers were entitled to incentive sales payments and the reserves remained until the deductions came through 
in some cases  the customer combined the deduction with other claims 
since the company has no material debt and adequate cash balances  the company believes that changes in marketing program accruals would not impact the company s liquidity 
iomega corporation and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued critical accounting estimates and assumptions continued allowance for doubtful accounts the company records its trade receivables at sales value and establishes a non specific allowance for estimated doubtful accounts by applying specified percentages to the different receivable aging categories 
the percentage applied against the aging categories increases as the accounts become further past due 
accounts in excess of days past due are fully reserved 
in addition  specific reserves are established for specific customer accounts as collection problems become known or occur due to insolvency  disputes or other collection issues 
the amounts of these specific reserves are estimated by management based on the following assumptions variables customer s financial position  age of the customer s receivables and changes in payment schedules 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is charged with the write off of uncollectible customer accounts whether due to insolvency  settlement or disputes 
the company believes that the accounting estimates related to allowance for doubtful accounts are critical accounting estimates because the reserve is highly susceptible to change from period to period due to the addition or removal of reserves for specific customer accounts  which require judgment and subjectivity when assessing the financial strength and ability of specific customers to pay their account balances and changes in specific customer reserves can have a material impact on bad debt expense in the consolidated statement of operations and on trade receivables in the consolidated balance sheets 
the statement of operations impact of adjustments to the allowance for doubtful accounts is allocated to the company s segments based on a percentage of sales 
the company s customer base is quite concentrated and changes in either a customer s financial position or the economy as a whole could cause actual write offs to be materially different from the estimated reserve 
for example  at december   the customers with the ten highest outstanding trade receivable balances totaled million  or of the gross trade receivables  compared to million  or of gross trade receivables  at december  at december   the largest outstanding trade receivables balance from the largest customer was million  or of gross trade receivables  compared to the trade receivables balance from the largest customer of million  or of gross trade receivables  at december  if any one or a group of these customers receivable balances should be deemed uncollectible  it would have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
during  the allowance for bad debt expense decreased million primarily from lower sales and the related lower receivables balances 
during  the allowance for bad debt expense decreased million  of which million was the result of decreases in specific reserves 
during  the company reached a settlement with a us customer for which the company had previously established a million reserve and released million of this reserve 
during  the company also released the majority of million in specific reserves previously established for european customers as the customers unexpectedly paid on a majority of their balances  with only a minimal portion of the reserves being utilized 
the remaining million decrease was a result of lower receivables and improved agings 
since the company has no material debt and adequate cash balances  the company believes that changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts would not impact the company s liquidity 
iomega corporation and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued critical accounting estimates and assumptions continued inventory valuation reserves the company evaluates the carrying value of inventory on a quarterly basis to determine if the carrying value is recoverable at estimated selling prices including known future price decreases 
the company includes product costs and direct selling expenses in its analysis of inventory realization 
to the extent that estimated selling prices do not exceed such costs and expenses  valuation reserves are established against inventories 
in addition  the company generally considers inventory which is not expected to be sold within the next nine months  as forecasted by the company s material requirements planning systems  as excess and thus appropriate reserves are established through a charge to cost of sales 
the company believes that the accounting estimates related to inventory valuation reserves are critical accounting estimates because the reserve is highly susceptible to change from period to period due primarily to estimating future sales volumes of products and future sales prices  the competitive nature of the technology industry which can quickly change the price of the company s products in the market place or the overall demand for the company s products and changes in the value of inventory can have a material impact on cost of sales and inventory valuation reserves 
inventory valuation reserve adjustments are necessitated primarily from changes in estimating future sales volumes and from changes in the estimates made of future sales prices 
estimating future sales volumes and future sales prices is particularly difficult for new products  end of life products  nas products and for sourced branded products such as optical  hdd and iomega mini and micro mini usb drives 
the price competition and short product life cycles of source branded products make it especially difficult to estimate both future sales and future sales price levels 
zip products have shown a long market life compared to the company s other products and combined with the high margins associated with zip products  they have historically not been as susceptible to inventory valuation reserve adjustments as some of the company s other products 
although purchase order commitments for the majority of zip components are extended for no greater than three months  declining volumes make mitigation of risk more difficult 
as zip volumes continue to decline  the risk associated with inventory valuation reserves will increase 
during  the company recorded a net increase in inventory valuation reserves of million which was recorded in cost of sales in the consolidated statement of operations 
this million net increase was comprised of an addition of million to the inventory valuation reserves which was partially offset by million in inventory reserve utilizations into cost of goods sold as product that had been previously reserved was sold or scrapped 
the million addition to the inventory valuation reserves was comprised of million for zip products  million for optical products and million for other products primarily nas  jaz and hdd 
the million zip write off was primarily for the reserve of inventory components previously purchased which exceed current estimated needs 
the million write off for optical products primarily resulted from the continued price decline necessary to sell optical products 
the million write off for other products primarily related to the discontinuance of the high end of the target market nas servers  excess jaz inventory and lower prices for hdd 
the million of inventory reserve utilizations was primarily for peerless  zip and optical products 
during  the company recorded a net release of inventory reserves of million which was recorded in cost of sales in the consolidated statement of operations 
this million net release was comprised of million of inventory write offs related to peerless and nas products and was considered normal recurring operations and was more than offset by million in inventory reserve utilizations into cost of goods sold as product that had been previously reserved iomega corporation and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued critical accounting estimates and assumptions continued was sold or scrapped 
as product is sold below cost  inventory reserves previously established are utilized to bring the product to a break even point as the loss on the product has already been recognized in prior periods 
as the company continues to offer new products or exits product lines  there is no assurance that further inventory valuation reserves will not be required 
at december   the company had inventory valuation reserves of million  which compares to inventory valuation reserves of million at december  the increase in inventory valuation reserves during was primarily attributable to increases in reserves as described above 
adjustments to the inventory reserves are a non cash adjustment and would not affect the company s liquidity 
tax valuation allowances statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas requires that a valuation allowance be established when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the company evaluates the realizability of its net deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis and valuation allowances are provided or released  as necessary 
during this evaluation  the company reviews its actual operating results and its forecasts of income in conjunction with other positive and negative evidence surrounding the realizability of its deferred tax assets to determine if a valuation allowance is needed 
adjustments to the valuation allowance will increase or decrease the company s tax provisions 
the company believes that the accounting estimates related to deferred tax valuation allowances are critical accounting estimates because the need for valuation allowance is highly susceptible to change from period to period due to changes in deferred tax asset and deferred tax liability balances  the need for valuation allowance is susceptible to actual operating results and to changes in the company s future income forecasts and changes in the tax valuation allowance can have a material impact on the tax provision in the consolidated statement of operations and on deferred income taxes in the consolidated balance sheets 
for example  during  the company increased its valuation allowance by million  primarily as a result of its evaluation of the realizability of its increased state net operating loss carryforward nol deferred tax assets  which were adjusted in conjunction with the completion of an irs audit 
during  the company recorded a million decrease in the valuation allowance for net deferred tax assets which was comprised of a million decrease in valuation allowance  related to the sale of the penang manufacturing subsidiary see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more detail and a million decrease resulting primarily from a reduction in net deferred tax assets associated with us nols 
the reduction in nols was primarily the result of the passage of the job creation and worker assistance act of  which allowed for a year carryback and utilization of a portion of the company s tax net operating loss 
adjustments to deferred tax valuation allowances are non cash adjustments and do not affect the company s liquidity 
iomega corporation and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued business segment information the company has seven reportable segments based primarily on the nature of the company s customers and products zip  optical formerly referred to as cd rw  other mobile and desktop storage products  jaz  pocketzip  network storage systems and new technologies 
jaz  pocketzip and some of the other mobile and desktop storage products have been discontinued  as further discussed below 
the zip segment involves the development  distribution and sale of zip drives and disks to retailers  distributors  resellers and oems throughout the world 
until the sale of the penang manufacturing subsidiary in november  the company also manufactured its zip drives and some of its zip disks 
the company s optical segment involves the distribution and sale of cd rw drives and dvd rewritable drives dvd rewritable drives which began shipping in limited quantities in the first quarter of to retailers  distributors and resellers throughout the world 
the optical segment also includes hotburn software which is bundled with cd rw and dvd rewritable drives and sold on a stand alone basis on the company s website 
the other mobile and desktop storage products segment formerly included in other includes peerless drive and disk systems  sourced branded products such as portable and desktop hdds  which began shipping during the second quarter of  iomega mini usb drives  which began shipping during the fourth quarter of and external floppy disk drives  which began shipping in the first quarter of  iomega software products such as iomega automatic backup software and other miscellaneous items 
the other mobile and desktop storage products segment also includes products that have been discontinued such as fotoshow  iomega microdrive miniature hard drives  iomega compactflash and iomega smartmedia memory cards

the pocketzip segment involved the development  manufacture  distribution and sale of pocketzip drives and disks for use with portable digital products to retailers  distributors and resellers throughout the world 
the network storage systems segment formerly included in other consists of the development  distribution and sale of nas servers targeted toward small and medium sized businesses and enterprise workgroups 
the new technologies segment includes the research and development of two new high capacity removable storage devices  including a removable hard disk storage system referred to as removable rigid disk technology or by the rev trademark that is expected to have a native capacity of approximately gb and up to gb compressed and a small form factor removable flexible magnetic storage device referred to as digital capture technology or dct that is expected to have a capacity of about to gb 
there have been no sales associated with new technologies and no sales are expected from rev products until april no sales are expected from dct until sometime during the summer of in early  the company discontinued the jaz drive and pocketzip product line  including hipzip digital audio players hipzip  which were being reported in the pocketzip segment 
under the other mobile and desktop storage products category  the company also discontinued in early its fotoshow  microdrive  compactflash and smartmedia products 
the company has continued to sell disks for jaz and pocketzip products to support the installed drive base of these products

iomega corporation and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued business segment information continued during  the company recorded impairment charges of million as cost of sales  of which was charged to the zip segment and million was charged to the jaz segment 
these impairment charges resulted from the company selling its penang manufacturing subsidiary see the section below entitled  penang manufacturing subsidiary impairment charges for more detail 
during  the company recorded non restructuring charges of million  of which million was charged to the respective product lines mainly as cost of sales 
these charges primarily reflected write downs of hipzip  fotoshow  cd rw and other inventory  equipment and other assets  loss accruals for related supplier purchase commitments and other various contractual arrangements 
during  the company recorded restructuring charges of million associated with the optical segment see the sections below entitled  non restructuring charges and restructuring charges reversals for more detail 
the company evaluates performance based on product profit margin ppm for each segment 
ppm is defined as sales and other income related to a segment s operations  less both fixed and variable product costs  research and development expenses  selling expenses and amortization related to a segment s operations 
when such costs and expenses exceed sales and other income  ppm is referred to as product loss 
the accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in note operations and significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
intersegment sales  eliminated in consolidation  are not material 
the expenses attributable to general corporate activity are not allocated to the product segments 
iomega corporation and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued business segment information continued the information in the following table was derived directly from the segments internal financial information used for corporate management purposes 
the information for has been reclassified to show the effects of eitf which requires  retroactively  certain consumer and trade sales promotion expenses to be shown as a reduction of sales 
the amount of this reclassification resulted in a reduction to sales and a corresponding decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses of million for  comprised of million for zip  million for optical  million for jaz and million for other mobile and desktop storage products 
the eitf reclassification did not impact ppm

there can be no assurance that this historic pattern will continue 
given the continued expected decline of the zip business  the company is unable to estimate or forecast any zip product seasonality in future quarters

other mobile and desktop storage product sales were million in  representing a million  or  increase compared to sales of million 
other mobile and desktop storage product sales represented of total sales in  compared to in the increase in other mobile and desktop storage products sales resulted primarily from higher mini usb drive sales of million which began shipping late in the fourth quarter of  higher hdd sales of million and sales from external floppy disk drives of million which began shipping in the first quarter of  partially offset by lower peerless sales of million and lower sales of million from other products such as compactflash  microdrive  smartmedia and fotoshow  all of which were discontinued in early network storage systems product sales were million in  representing a million  or  increase compared to network storage systems product sales of million for the increase was due primarily to the expansion and refreshing of the company s network storage systems product offerings during the second and third quarters of  though the increased sales did not meet internal expectations as the company was unsuccessful in generating significant sales in the high end of the targeted nas server market 
as a result of this difficulty  the company is exiting the high end of the targeted nas server market and plans to focus on the low end and certain models of the mid range of the targeted market where the company has had more business success 
geographically  sales in the americas totaled million  or of total sales  in  compared to million  or of total sales  in the decrease in sales dollars was primarily due to lower zip sales and to a lesser extent  lower optical sales

the decrease in the gross margin percentage was primarily due to a lower proportion of sales from the higher margin zip products 
the zip gross margin percentage was in  compared to in this percentage decrease resulted primarily from higher per unit costs due to declining volumes and million of restructuring charges in  partially offset by million of impairment charges in resulting from the sale of the penang manufacturing subsidiary 
management expects that gross margin percentages reported for will continue to decline in as the product mix continues to shift from higher margin zip product sales to lower margin sales from sourced branded products such as optical products  external hard drives  mini and micro mini usb drives and external floppy disk drives as well as from start up costs associated with rev products and dct 
future gross margin percentages will depend on a number of factors including the future volume of zip products sold  the mix between zip products compared to sourced branded products  sales mix between aftermarket and oem or private label channels  as oem and private label sales generally provide lower gross margins than sales through other channels  sales mix of zip mb  zip mb and zip mb drives and disks  as sales of the various zip products have differing gross margins  sales volumes of zip disks  which generate significantly higher gross margin percentages than the corresponding drives  pricing actions or promotions  the strength or weakness of foreign currencies  especially the euro  the impact of any future material cost changes  supply or other disruptions  the ability to avoid future inventory and fixed asset charges  the ability to accurately forecast future product demand  the ability to cover fixed costs associated with newly introduced products  such as rev products and dct when launched  the company s ability to successfully resolve all remaining technical and manufacturing issues to complete the rev products and dct and then successfully launch those products  start up costs associated with the introduction of new products such as rev products and dct  the revenue ramp of rev products and dct  price competition from other substitute third party storage products including cd rw and dvd products  significant price competition given that cd r  cd rw and dvd discs are significantly cheaper than zip disks  possible payment of license royalties to resolve alleged patent infringement disputes and general economic conditions

this resulted in an additional deferred us tax liability of million 
this provision was partially offset by the release of million of valuation allowance for a net provision of million in the third quarter of the release of the valuation allowance on the us deferred tax assets resulted from the company no longer being in a net deferred tax asset position 
the resulting net deferred tax liability position was primarily due to the million provision on the company s foreign earnings that were previously considered permanently invested in non us operations 
during  the company recorded a million decrease in the valuation allowance for net deferred tax assets which was comprised of the million decrease in valuation allowance described above related to the sale of the penang manufacturing subsidiary and a million decrease resulting primarily from a reduction in net deferred tax assets associated with us nols 
the reduction in nols was primarily the result of the passage of the job creation and worker assistance act of  which allowed for a year carryback and utilization of a portion of the company s tax net operating loss

the decline in selling  general and administrative expenses was due to specific restructuring actions and other cost reduction efforts  million of non restructuring charges recorded during and from the marketing program releases discussed above 
bad debt the million improvement in bad debt resulted primarily from improved collections  improved agings and lower receivables during and from the release of reserves that had been previously established in for specific customers with whom the company was having collection issues 
during  the company recorded a specific million bad debt reserve for a us customer because the company believed that this customer s financial position was seriously deteriorating  the age of the customer s account and several failed collection attempts 
during  the company reached a settlement with this us customer and released million of the reserve 
also during  the company recorded specific bad debt reserves of million associated with european customers for which the company had cancelled distribution contracts early in the fourth quarter 
these customers were refusing to pay on their accounts 
during the majority of the million specific reserve for european customers was released as the customers paid on a majority of their balances  with only a minimal portion being utilized 
at december   the company had million in trade receivables in excess of days past due compared to million at december  research and development expenses research and development expenses of million for decreased by million  or  when compared to million for the lower research and development expenses during resulted primarily from headcount reductions and lower project expenses associated with zip  peerless and cd rw  partially offset by project expenses associated with the development of higher capacity removable storage products and nas products 
the development of higher capacity removable storage products included work on a small form factor removable flexible magnetic storage device that is expected to have a capacity of about to gb and a small form factor  removable hard disk storage system that is expected to have a native capacity of approximately gb and up to gb compressed 
the company is also continuing its efforts to expand software applications to be used with the company s current product offerings to provide additional value to the customer 
research and development expenses were flat as a percentage of sales at in both and interest and other income and expense interest income of million during decreased million from million during significantly lower interest rates were partially offset by higher average cash  cash equivalents and temporary investment balances 
iomega corporation and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued as compared to continued interest expense of million during increased million from million during primarily as a result of interest expense associated with the amortization of bond holdings in the company s temporary investment portfolio 
other expense of million during increased million from million during primarily from the write off of the million carrying value of a research and development venture investment which was included in other assets  from higher bank and management fees associated with the higher average cash  cash equivalent and temporary investment balances and from higher foreign currency losses 
income taxes for  the company recorded a net income tax provision of million on pre tax income of million  which reflected an income tax provision of million  an additional tax provision of million related to the company s earnings previously considered to be permanently invested in non us operations and a benefit of million resulting from a decrease in the valuation allowance for net deferred tax assets 
the million additional provision resulted from the sale of the company s penang manufacturing subsidiary

for  the company recorded an income tax benefit of million on a pre tax loss of million reflecting an income tax benefit of million  partially offset by a million increase in the valuation allowance for net deferred tax assets 
excluding the million increase in the valuation allowance  the effective tax benefit rate for was 
the effective tax rate was higher than the statutory rate of primarily resulting from non deductible permanent items 
the company s decision to sell its penang manufacturing subsidiary necessitated the recording of a tax provision during the third quarter of for the company s foreign earnings that were previously considered permanently invested in non us operations 
this resulted in an additional deferred us tax liability of million 
this provision was partially offset by the release of million of valuation allowance for a net provision of million in the third quarter of the release of the valuation allowance on the us deferred tax assets resulted from the company no longer being in a net deferred tax asset position 
the resulting net deferred tax liability position was primarily due to the million provision on the company s foreign earnings that were previously considered permanently invested in non us operations 
during  the company recorded a million decrease in the valuation allowance for net deferred tax assets which was comprised of the million decrease in valuation allowance described above related to the sale of the penang manufacturing subsidiary and a million decrease resulting primarily from a reduction in net deferred tax assets associated with net us nols 
the reduction in nols was primarily the result of the passage of the job creation and worker assistance act of  which allowed for a year carryback and utilization of a portion of the company s tax net operating loss 
during the third quarter of  the company established a us valuation allowance totaling million for a portion of its us deferred tax assets 
after considering its forecasts of taxable income in conjunction with the positive and negative evidence surrounding the realizability of its deferred tax assets  the company concluded that a partial valuation allowance should be recorded against the net deferred tax assets in the third quarter of the remaining million increase in the valuation allowance related to an increase in the foreign net deferred tax assets associated with foreign nols 
iomega corporation and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued as compared to continued deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
they are measured by applying the enacted tax rates and laws in effect for the years in which such differences are expected to reverse 
at december   the company had million of deferred tax assets related to us nols  which reflected a tax benefit of approximately million in future us tax deductions 
the us federal nols expire at various dates beginning in and the us state nols expire at various dates beginning in the company continues to maintain a full valuation allowance of million for net deferred tax assets related to foreign nols  which reflect a tax benefit of approximately million in future foreign tax deductions 
these carryforwards expire at various dates beginning in these deferred tax assets remain fully reserved because their realization is dependent on earning future foreign taxable income in the tax jurisdictions to which the nols related 
the largest of these foreign nols relates to the company s french subsidiary  nomai sa this subsidiary s operations are inactive and therefore  the foreign nols related to nomai sa are not likely to be realized in the future 
net deferred tax liabilities for the company at december  were million 
as of december   deferred tax liabilities for estimated us federal and state taxes of million have been accrued on unremitted foreign earnings of million 
during the third quarter of  taxes were provided on all earnings previously considered to be permanently invested in non us operations 
liquidity and capital resources at december   the company had total cash  cash equivalents and temporary investments of million compared to million at december   a decrease of million  or 
on july   the company s board of directors declared a one time cash dividend of per share to stockholders of record as of the close of business on september   that was paid on october  the total amount of the dividend was million 
at december   million of total cash  cash equivalents and temporary investments were on deposit in the us  for the us entity  compared to million at december  at december   the remaining million of total non us entities cash  cash equivalents and temporary investments were on deposit in the us and foreign countries primarily western europe  compared to million at december  the repatriation of any of the million of foreign cash to the us will be taxable income in the us for federal and state tax purposes at a rate of approximately 
however  the amount of cash required for us federal and state taxes will be less than the company s rate due to the availability of the company s existing federal and state nols and tax credit carryforwards 
any taxes paid on the repatriation of cash to the us would not impact the consolidated statement of operations as taxes have already been provided on these foreign earnings 
iomega corporation and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued liquidity and capital resources continued working capital of million at december  decreased by million  compared to million at december  the decrease in working capital resulted primarily from lower cash  cash equivalents and temporary investments due to the million one time cash dividend payment in the fourth quarter of and lower accounts payable  margin on deferred revenue  accrued marketing and higher income taxes receivables  partially offset by lower trade receivables  inventories  current deferred income taxes and other current assets 
for the year ended december   cash used by operating activities amounted to million  a decrease of million  compared to cash provided by operating activities of million for the year ended december  the primary drivers for the usage of cash in were million for the development and capital expenditures for rev products and dct  the network storage systems product loss of million and million for restructuring disbursements and changes in current assets and current liabilities as described below 
trade receivables decreased for the year ended december  primarily from lower sales and improved collections 
days sales outstanding dso in receivables increased to days at december   compared to days at december  dso is calculated by multiplying the december trade receivables balance by and dividing that amount by the sales for the quarter ended december of the applicable year 
as mentioned in last year s annual report on form k  the company believed that it would be difficult to maintain dso in trade receivables at the december  level 
accounts payable decreased primarily from approximately million in initial purchases of inventory from the company s former penang manufacturing subsidiary which was sold on november  that were not due as of december  and from lower inventory purchases during margin on deferred sales decreased primarily due to lower levels of zip channel inventory 
accrued marketing was lower due to lower marketing expenditures in relation to the lower sales levels 
inventory decreased primarily due to lower levels of zip inventories and a concentrated program to lower inventory in light of declining sales 
restructuring accruals increased as a result of the restructuring actions see the section above entitled  restructuring charges reversals 
at december   the company replaced an expiring letter of credit and classified million of cash as restricted cash to secure this new letter of credit 
per the agreement associated with this letter of credit  this cash was set aside in a certificate of deposit until the letter of credit expired in march the company also has million of restricted cash to cover foreign bank guarantees for vat 
this cash is reported separately as restricted cash in the consolidated balance sheets 
during  the company did not repurchase any shares of the company s common stock  however the company s treasury share balance increased by  shares for restricted common stock that was issued and later forfeited in conjunction with the company s management incentive plan 
during  the company repurchased  shares of the company s common stock for million 
as of december   approximately million remained available for future repurchases under the stock repurchase plan authorized by the company s board of directors on september  with respect to both rev products and dct  the company s two key development projects  the company anticipates spending approximately million to million developing rev products and dct during the first quarter of the company also anticipates spending an additional million to million in capital expenditures for supplier tooling and manufacturing equipment for rev products and dct during the first quarter of iomega corporation and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued liquidity and capital resources continued during  the company implemented plans to restructure its operations and recorded restructuring charges of million and anticipates recording another million of restructuring charges in  primarily for the severance and benefits of employees who are on transition 
substantially all of the restructuring charges are expected to be cash charges 
during  million of cash was paid for the and restructuring actions 
some of the cash charges will be paid beyond since the company will most likely continue to pay the lease payments associated with vacated facilities on a monthly basis through the remaining life of the leases 
the company anticipates paying approximately million in in cash for both the and restructuring actions 
the company believes that its balance of unrestricted cash  cash equivalents and temporary investments  together with cash flows from future operations  will be sufficient to fund anticipated working capital requirements including the investments in rev products and dct  funding of restructuring actions  capital expenditures and cash required for other activities for the next two or more years 
however  cash flow from future operations  investing activities and the precise amount and timing of the company s future financing needs  cannot be determined at this time and will depend on a number of factors  including the market demand for the company s products  the future volume of zip products sold  the company s ability to slow its sales decline  the progress of the company s product development efforts  the success of the company s new technologies rev products and dct and ability to successfully launch rev products and dct products in  competitive price pressures  worldwide economic conditions  the availability of critical components  the adequate supply of products from the company s sourcing partners  the financial stability of the company s customers  the necessity for future restructuring or other charges which might consume cash and the success of the company in managing its inventory  forecasting accuracy  litigation exposures or other unforeseen liabilities  trade receivables and accounts payable 
should the company be unable to meet its cash needs from its current balance of unrestricted cash  cash equivalents and temporary investments and future cash flows from operations  the company would most likely seek financing from other sources and or incur additional restructuring charges to adjust the company s expenditures to a level that its cash flows could support 
the company s current balance of unrestricted cash  cash equivalents and temporary investments is its sole source of liquidity 
given the company s recent history of sales declines  there is no assurance that  if needed  the company would be able to obtain financing from external sources or obtain a competitive interest rate 
contractual obligations the company s contractual obligations as of december  were as follows payments due by period obligation total less than year to years to years after years in thousands purchase obligations operating leases restructuring commitments excess purchase commitments licensing agreement total iomega corporation and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued liquidity and capital resources continued purchase obligations are comprised of open purchase orders for inventory and other supplier commitments as of december  that are not recorded on the company s balance sheets as of december   as they are not considered commitments under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
these purchase obligations include those contracts that the company can terminate for its convenience on advance written notice to the supplier 
the company conducts a substantial portion of its operations from leased facilities 
aggregate lease commitments under non cancellable operating leases are shown in the table above 
the remaining commitments under the company s and restructuring actions relate primarily to severance payments which will be paid in for the restructuring actions and to lease obligations  which the company is trying to sublease and for which the obligations are being paid monthly 
the longest lease will expire in the purchase orders under which the company buys many of its components and sourced products generally extend one to three quarters in the future based on the lead times associated with the specific component or sourced product 
the quantities on the purchase orders are based on estimated future sales requirements 
in the case of new products or products with declining sales  it can be difficult to estimate future product demand  which could result in excess purchase commitments  where the company has made commitments for purchases that the company does not anticipate utilizing and therefore are considered excess 
the company s accrual for these excess purchase commitments are shown above 
the company has entered into a licensing agreement whereby the company will make annual payments of million each january with the final payment occurring in january for the license of another company s patents for the company s products and for research and development projects 
off balance sheet arrangements guarantees during the third quarter of  the company entered into a limited guarantee with a component supplier whereby the company will provide a guarantee of payments for purchases by a contract manufacturer of the component supplier s product 
the contract manufacturer is incorporating the component supplier s product into iomega branded dvd products 
the company has guaranteed purchases of the component supplier s product by the contract manufacturer for up to million 
all purchase orders placed by the contract manufacturer must be countersigned or approved by a company representative in advance of the transaction 
this guarantee will remain in effect until the company is no longer selling the component supplier s product under the iomega brand or until the component supplier extends a credit facility to the contract manufacturer that does not require a guarantee by the company 
the company entered into this guarantee to facilitate the purchase of product by the contract manufacturer directly from the component supplier 
the company will only make payments under this guarantee in the event that the contract manufacturer is in material payment default 
however  if the contract manufacturer defaulted on payment to the component supplier  the company would be entitled to withhold any related amounts due from the company to the contract manufacturer 
the component supplier has presently granted a million line of credit to the contract manufacturer 
accordingly  the current potential exposure to the company under the guarantee is million 
the company recorded a thousand liability to reflect the fair value of this guarantee 
the fair value was based on the estimated market value of a similar stand alone letter of credit 
iomega corporation and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued off balance sheet arrangements continued the company has no other off balance sheet arrangements as defined by the securities and exchange commission s sec final rules regarding off balance sheet arrangements 
other matters sec review as previously disclosed in the company s annual report on form k for the years ended december   and and quarterly reports on form q s throughout  in connection with a review of the company s periodic sec reports  the company has previously received comments from the staff of the sec requesting various supplemental information and certain additional disclosures 
the sec staff questioned aspects of the company s accounting for its acquisition of nomai  the subsequent evaluation of impairment of goodwill relating to the nomai acquisition and the restructuring charges recorded by the company in in particular  the sec staff questioned whether a in connection with the nomai acquisition  approximately million of the acquisition cost should have been recorded as post acquisition expenses  rather than as goodwill  b any remaining unamortized goodwill relating to the nomai acquisition should have been written off in the third quarter of when the company decided to cease manufacturing at the nomai facilities in avranches  france the amount of unamortized goodwill reported by the company at the end of the third quarter of was million and c the company had in place a sufficiently detailed plan to support the restructuring charges which amounted to million and million in the second quarter and second half of  respectively 
the company s management believes that the company s accounting for each of these matters  which is described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  is in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will prevail in its position 
if the company does not prevail  the company may be required to restate its consolidated financial statements in order to adjust the manner in which it has accounted for the nomai acquisition in  the subsequent evaluation in of the impairment of the goodwill relating to the nomai acquisition and the restructuring actions 
the company does not believe that any such restatement would have a material adverse effect on the company s current financial condition or future results of operations 
iomega corporation and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued other matters continued recent accounting pronouncement in january of  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  and interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
fin and in december of issued a revised version fin r 
fin r provides guidance for determining whether and how to consolidate variable interest entities vies 
variable interests are contractual  ownership or other interests in an entity that expose their holders to the risks and rewards of the vie 
variable interests include equity investments  loans  leases  derivatives  guarantees and other instruments whose values change with changes in the vie s assets 
any of these instruments may require its holder to consolidate the vie 
the party with the majority of the variability in gains or losses of the vie is required to consolidate the vie 
fin r modified the effective dates of fin and the effective date for fin r in its entirety is march   with some specific sections being effective earlier 
the company adopted fin during the fourth quarter of the company does not have an interest in a vie that meets the fin requirements 
factors affecting future operating results demand for the company s products and operating efficiencies the company s future operating results will depend  in large part  upon the company s ability to achieve and maintain a significant market demand and presence for its products and to operate profitably and efficiently 
the company s ability to accomplish these objectives will depend on a number of factors  including the following market demand for digital storage products in general  completion of development  launch and market success and acceptance of rev products and dct  success of the company in establishing oem arrangements on rev products and dct and meeting oem quality  supply and other requirements  price  performance  quality and other characteristics of the company s products and of competing and substitute products rumored  announced or introduced by other vendors  emergence of any competing solutions as industry standards  success of the company in meeting targeted availability dates for new and enhanced products  success of the company in maintaining zip product oem arrangements and meeting oem quality  supply and other requirements  willingness of oems to promote products containing the company s drives  success of the company s efforts to provide and maintain customer service and satisfaction  public perception of the company and its products  including statements made by industry analysts or consumers and adverse publicity resulting from such statements or from litigation filed against the company  worldwide economic conditions  including overall market demand for personal computers and other products with which the company s products can be used  ability of the company to profitably and efficiently manage its supply of products and key components  and to avoid disruptions in the supply thereof  iomega corporation and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued factors affecting future operating results continued ability of the company to maintain profitable relationships with distributors  retailers and other resellers of the company s products  the company s ability to attract and retain competent  motivated employees  ability of the company to comply with applicable laws  regulations  ordinances and other legal requirements in the numerous countries in which it does business  ability of the company to successfully manage litigation  including enforcing its rights  protecting its interests and defending itself from claims made against it and ability of the company to successfully implement its announced restructuring of operations  to achieve and maintain an appropriate cost structure and to minimize unforeseen and extraordinary expenses 
the company cannot provide any assurance that it will be able to successfully manage  satisfy or influence any of these factors 
zip drives and disks since  sales of zip products have accounted for a significant majority of the company s revenues and profits 
however  for the past several years zip product sales have declined consistently and significantly on a year over year basis  both in terms of unit volumes and sales dollars 
for example  in  zip sales were million  a decrease of approximately million  or  from shipments of the company s zip drive units during decreased from shipments in and shipments of zip disk units in decreased compared to the company expects continuing declines in zip unit sales and revenues of at least comparable  if not greater rates  due to factors such as the following abandonment of zip drive and disk usage by existing zip drive customers as the zip technology reaches the end of its lifecycle  the continued loss of shelf space for zip products at key retailers  the prevalence of optical drives cd rw and dvd being built into new computers  their availability in the aftermarket and the low cost of optical media  the continued widespread proliferation of other low cost storage devices and media such as external hard drives and usb flash drives  the continued proliferation of alternative means for sharing  transporting and backing up large data files  increasing difficulty in generating demand for zip products through promotions and potential disruptions in the supply of zip drives and disks from the company s suppliers as zip volumes continue to decline 
the company is developing two new products  the rev drive and disk and dct  has launched a line of network storage systems products and has broadened its line of sourced branded products for example  optical  hdd  mini and micro mini usb and external floppy disk drives in an attempt to create additional revenue streams 
however  until and unless the company demonstrates an ability to launch and sell such products profitably particularly rev products and dct  its profitability remains largely dependent on maximizing  to the extent possible  sales of zip drives and disks  which generate significantly higher gross and product profit margins than the company s other products 
in the meantime  the company s profitability iomega corporation and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued factors affecting future operating results continued and or results of operations will continue to be adversely affected by zip sales declines unless and until the company s other product lines become consistently profitable 
there can be no assurance that they will ever do so 
as the company s zip drive and disk sales have declined  it has consistently been losing shelf space for zip products with its key resellers and retailers because of reduced volumes 
the company anticipates increasing challenges in this area for the remainder of the zip product life cycle 
although the company attempts to offer competitive sales and marketing programs to induce channel customers to continue to purchase zip products and other offerings  there is no assurance that the company will be successful in this regard 
the company sells a significant percentage of its total volume of zip drives to a relatively small number of computer oems 
the company s oem customers are not obligated to purchase any minimum volume of zip drives 
moreover  the fact that the number of oem customers is relatively small presents a risk that the loss of one or more key oem accounts would have an immediate  material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or operating results 
computer oem customers have adopted cd rw and dvd rewritable drives as standard product features 
the company believes that this adoption  which has had a material adverse impact on the company s zip business  is irreversible 
at some point  one or more oems will cease offering the zip drive as a built in option or will stop purchasing the company s zip products altogether 
when that occurs  the adverse impact on the company may be significant 
the company cannot predict when that might occur 
as the company s zip volumes continue to decline  suppliers of certain critical components of both zip drives and disks have been indicating that they will stop producing  or end of life  such components 
in such cases  the company attempts to make an end of life purchase on the required component s based on its estimates of all future requirements 
the end of life of such components raises a number of business risks  including risks such as the following risks that an end of life purchase option will not be available from a supplier who has chosen to discontinue a component  risks that the company will order insufficient or excess quantities of key components  risks of irreparable quality problems manifesting in certain components  spoilage  loss or destruction only after iomega has completed last time buys of such components and risks that certain suppliers may produce excess inventory of key components in the absence of firm orders from iomega  leading to potential disputes regarding payment obligations 
the company will need to properly manage the end of life processes for such components to ensure ongoing zip profitability 
the company can give no assurance that it will be able to do so 
as zip product segment sales and profits continue to decline  the risk increases that the million of goodwill associated with the zip product segment will become impaired and that impairment charges will become necessary 
in addition  as the company s zip volumes continue to decline  it becomes increasingly difficult for the company to forecast zip revenue streams  to manage the company s supply of zip products and to manage inventory of zip products at distributors and retailers 
the company can give no assurance that it will be able to successfully manage these factors 
moreover  the company has been unable to accurately forecast and predict the actual rate of zip decline over time 
any significant negative change in the rate of the decline  iomega corporation and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued factors affecting future operating results continued from the company s internal forecasts  from quarter to quarter or year to year  will have a negative impact on financial results because the company is generally unable to quickly make a corresponding reduction in operating expenses or other costs 
consequently  there is no assurance that the company will be able to maintain its zip business and profitability 
optical products the company ships a variety of rewritable optical cd rw and dvd drives 
the company s optical business strategy differs fundamentally from its zip product strategy 
material differences between the optical and zip businesses include the following a the company does not own any significant intellectual property relating to its optical drives  b unlike zip drives  optical drives use very low cost  non proprietary discs available from many sources  c there is intense competition between different providers of optical drives and d the company obtains significantly lower overall gross margins on sales of optical drives than on zip drives 
the overall optical business is characterized by low gross margins  continuing end user price reductions  the frequent introduction of performance upgrades and intense competition from both brand name and generic  low cost competitors 
one or more of these factors could compel the company to initiate an inventory write down with respect to its optical drives 
in light of these factors  the company must accurately forecast demand and closely monitor its inventory levels  product transitions  sales channel inventory  purchase commitments  advertising and other marketing expenses in order to compete effectively and profitably 
there is no assurance that the company can consistently achieve these objectives  and historically it has failed to do so 
since it entered the optical market in  the company has reported product losses on its optical business every year through in spite of these challenges  the company believes it must maintain a presence in the optical market in order to achieve its overall objective to be viewed as a full line supplier of digital mobile and desktop storage products for the company s retail  catalog and online customers 
the company s optical business activities are focused on reducing product costs and operating expenses  improving inventory management processes  receiving more favorable contract terms  improving product life cycle management and revising channel marketing programs with the ultimate goal to minimize product losses 
however  there is no assurance that the company s activities in this regard will be successful 
the suppliers  as the original manufacturers  have certain competitive advantages over the company in the marketplace  including the ability at any time to sell substantially identical drives at lower prices than the company 
in addition  the company believes that the overall market for aftermarket external cd rw drives is shrinking  due to factors such as the following a oems continue to offer  and customers continue to choose  internal cd rw drives as a standard product feature  thereby minimizing market demand for aftermarket external cd rw drives  b customers continue to transition from cd rw drives to dvd rewritable drives and c aftermarket internal drives are now significantly less expensive than external drives 
the company is trying to mitigate the impact of the shrinking aftermarket external cd rw drive market by offering external dvd drive products  however  there is no guarantee that this strategy will be successful 
iomega hdd  iomega mini and micro mini usb drives and other sourced branded products in  the company began shipping a series of portable and desktop hdd drives and usb flash drives 
the company may ship additional sourced branded products finished products which contain little or no iomega intellectual property and are procured from third party suppliers 
the company will face many of the same challenges with these sourced branded products that it faces in the optical market 
for example  a the company does not own any significant intellectual property relating to its hdd and usb flash drives and is iomega corporation and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued factors affecting future operating results continued unlikely to own significant intellectual property rights in other sourced branded products  b there is intense competition between different providers of hdd and usb flash drives and such competition is likely to exist between suppliers of other sourced branded products and c there is a need to continually requalify new drives and products as existing drives and products come into short supply or become obsolete 
there are other risks associated with shipping sourced branded products 
such products may infringe another party s protected intellectual property  may lack adequate quality or may otherwise expose the company to liabilities which could exceed the profits or even the revenues that the company would recognize from selling such products 
the overall sourced product market is characterized by low gross margins  continuing end user price reductions  the frequent introduction of upgraded products and intense competition from both brand name and generic  low cost competitors 
in order to successfully compete in this market  the company must accurately forecast demand  secure quality products  meet aggressive product price and performance targets  create market demand for its particular brand of products and avoid holding excessive inventory 
in addition  the company must ensure access to an adequate supply of products in the face of potential shortages of particular products or of key components thereof 
for example  there is a current worldwide shortage of flash memory products  which the company expects to last at least through the first half of calendar year this shortage has had  and will continue to have  a negative impact upon the company s sales of mini and micro mini usb drives or other products which incorporate flash memory 
there is no assurance that the company can or will be able to successfully manage any of these risks set forth above or achieve sustainable profitability on these products 
network storage systems in  the company introduced a line of nas servers 
the nas market is dominated by large computer providers including dell and hp  is highly price competitive  primarily relies upon vars and requires core competencies in server  software  systems integration and networking technologies 
the company has not yet demonstrated an ability to operate profitably in this market 
in  the company incurred start up expenses relating to nas product qualification  launch and customer support in excess of its expectations 
during  the company recorded product losses in excess of million on its nas operations due to under absorbed operational overhead due to lower than planned volumes and from higher sales and marketing and research and development spending designed to broaden the company s nas product offerings 
the company has recorded nas product losses in each quarter it has shipped the product 
during the fourth quarter of  the company decided to focus on the low end of the target market and is in the process of exiting the high end products costing  to  per unit of the target market 
during  the company plans to focus on the sales of nas servers with capacities ranging from gb to tb 
by focusing on the low end of the target market  the company expects to better leverage its small to medium sized business customer base and channel customers  including existing vars already focused on these customers 
despite efforts and spending on marketing and product introductions during and  the company was not successful in penetrating the high end of the target market and first tier corporate reseller channels and thus made the decision to exit this market 
in conjunction with this re alignment  at the end of december  the company incurred million of inventory and other charges to exit the high end nas market 
the company can provide no assurance that these actions will help it to build a profitable sustained nas business 
iomega corporation and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued factors affecting future operating results continued the company has not yet successfully developed  nor can there be any assurance that the company will  successfully develop the necessary core competencies to compete in this market segment  that the company s nas products will be successful  that the company will be successful in implementing its network storage systems strategy  that the company will be able to resolve any of the other challenges set forth above or that the company will ever achieve profitability on this product line 
development and introduction of new products and new revenue streams in light of continuing declines in the zip business  the company believes that it must develop or acquire new products that are profitable in order to remain viable 
however  the company s efforts in this regard have been unsuccessful in recent years 
during  and  the company invested significant resources in developing and launching new products  including peerless  pocketzip  hipzip  fotoshow and microdrive products 
the company was unable to sell any of these products profitably and no longer markets any of these products 
in  the company introduced desktop and portable hdd drives  nas servers and iomega mini usb drives 
with the exception of the iomega mini usb drive  the company has not been able to maintain profitable operations on any of these products  or with optical products  for any sustained period of time 
the company has spent  and plans to continue to spend  significant resources on efforts to develop two new high capacity removable storage devices  referred to as rev products and dct 
in addition  the company expects to review new business opportunities in multiple areas including digital storage  software  disks  networking  services and other related areas 
the company may spend significant resources attempting to develop new technology products or attempting to market new products incorporating such products or applications 
there is no assurance that the company will be successful in any of these endeavors 
planned introduction of rev products the company now expects to launch rev products in april the company s planned rev products will consist of a drive in both oem and desktop versions and removable cartridges with a native capacity of approximately gb and up to gb compressed 
the company s planned introduction of rev products entails numerous risks  including risks relating to factors such as the following lack of market acceptance  unforeseen manufacturing and technical challenges or delays  failure to achieve any significant oem adoption of the products  inability to maintain acceptable agreements with key suppliers or manufacturers  performance  quality or other issues that are only discovered in the context of usage by large numbers of end users  lack of defensible intellectual property  lack of relevant core competencies or market expertise  intense competition from substitute and strongly entrenched technologies  significant product launch and sales and marketing expenses which could cause on going product losses  significant expenditures for tooling and inventory before any market demand is validated  risk that third parties may assert intellectual property claims against new products and iomega corporation and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued factors affecting future operating results continued risk that any delay of the rev product launch  will generate negative publicity and perception of the company 
additional risks exist with respect to the company s planned introduction of rev products 
although development of the rev products is being finalized for the anticipated launch  significant actions and therefore risks remain in completing the products including the implementation of various engineering changes  resolution of various component supply issues  final software development and integration with the products  quality testing and the production ramp up 
for example  the company has already had to delay the launch of its rev products by approximately one month  from the end of the first quarter of to april  due to software related technical challenges 
other technical  supplier and manufacturing challenges either hardware or software related could manifest themselves at any time 
the products may be delayed or never achieve the functionality that the company has anticipated and announced 
the rev product manufacturing lines and production processes are still being finalized and unforeseen problems with the supply chain may arise 
the company believes that the commercial success of rev products  once launched  is dependent upon significant oem acceptance 
as of the date of this filing  no agreements with any such oems have been executed 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully resolve any of these challenges  problems or risks 
any such challenges  problems or risks  if unresolved  could cause rev products to be cancelled before or after launch  and in such event  the company would incur material restructuring and other charges 
development of dct products the company has spent significant resources developing dct products 
the company has publicly stated that it intends to launch dct products in the summer of the company plans to introduce dct drives in embedded for oem  usb and pcmcia formats 
as currently planned  dct disks will be removable and fully rewritable  will be about the size of a half dollar coin  will weigh about grams  will employ a rugged stainless steel cartridge designed to protect important digital content from data loss and are expected to have a capacity of about to gb per disk 
the company s planned  announced introduction of dct products has numerous risks  including risks relating to factors such as the following unforeseen manufacturing and technical challenges or delays  failure to achieve any significant oem adoption of the products  failure to achieve the desired product capacity or other features  lack of market acceptance  inability to reach acceptable agreements with key suppliers  manufacturers or oems  performance  quality or other issues that are only discovered in the context of usage by large numbers of end users  lack of defensible intellectual property  lack of relevant core competencies or market expertise  intense competition from substitute technologies  significant product launch and sales and marketing expenses which could cause on going product losses  significant expenditures for tooling and inventory before any market demand is validated  risk that third parties may assert intellectual property claims against new products and iomega corporation and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued factors affecting future operating results continued risk that any cancellation of the dct program or delay of the dct launch  which the company has publicly announced as planned for the summer of  will generate negative publicity and perception of the company 
additional risks exist with respect to the company s planned introduction of dct products 
the dct products development currently faces significant challenges including the resolution of various technical issues necessary to achieve the targeted capacity of to gb  the launch schedule in the summer of  which is at significant risk given the technical issues and the fact that the dct prototype products currently cost more to manufacture than potential oem customers appear willing to bear 
the products may never achieve the functionality or cost parameters that the company has anticipated and announced and in light of technical challenges  the company has recently reduced its capacity specification for dct from gb per disk to to gb per disk 
the reduction in the expected capacity was driven by  among other technical issues  the design of the heads which read the media and the media 
the dct heads and media are sourced from  and designed by  third parties which creates greater uncertainty 
given the uncertainty surrounding the capacity parameter  the company believes that it is most likely that the capacity achieved at dct launch will be at the low end of the to gb target range 
further  the dct manufacturing lines and production processes are still being developed and unforeseen problems with the supply chain may arise 
the company has not yet completed supply agreements with any dct manufacturers 
in addition  the company believes that dct products will not be commercially successful in the absence of agreements with key consumer electronics oems to incorporate or distribute such products 
as of the date of this filing  no agreements with any such oems have been executed and the company may decide not to proceed with the launch of dct products without such oem commitments 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully resolve any of these challenges  problems or risks 
any such challenges  problems or risks  if unresolved  could cause the dct products to be cancelled before or after launch  and in such event  the company could incur material restructuring and other charges 
general economic conditions the company s future operating results are subject to risks associated with general economic conditions and consumer confidence 
any disruption in consumer confidence or general economic conditions including those caused by acts of war  terrorism or other factors could have an adverse impact on the company s operating results 
collection risks although the company uses commercially reasonable steps to manage the credit granted to its customers  certain trade receivable balances from one or more of its customers may become uncollectible 
this event could adversely affect the company s financial results 
the company may be required to increase its allowance for doubtful accounts in the future 
in addition  there is a risk that key resellers  distributors and resellers who sell the company s products may require the company to offer them increasingly favorable credit and purchase terms and conditions in exchange for continuing to carry the company s products 
such terms could have an adverse effect upon the company 
information technology system upgrade during the third quarter of  the company began a project to upgrade the company s information technology system  re engineer its business processes and upgrade its enterprise resource planning erp systems 
work on these upgrades continued throughout the fourth quarter of and will continue into the third quarter of the ultimate goal of these combined projects is to reduce costs by simplifying business iomega corporation and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued factors affecting future operating results continued processes and reducing the number of systems needed to be maintained 
there is no assurance that the company will reduce costs or simplify processes a result of the system upgrade and business process changes 
during the system upgrade process and thereafter  there is a risk that such upgrades may result in significant operational and informational interruptions within the company 
company operations the company has experienced and may in the future experience significant fluctuations in its quarterly operating results 
moreover  because the company s expense levels including budgeted selling  general and administrative and research and development expenses are based  in part  on expectations of future sales levels  a shortfall in expected sales could result in a disproportionate adverse effect on the company s net income and cash flow 
inventory management management of the company s inventory levels is complex 
the company s customers frequently adjust their ordering patterns in response to factors such as the following company s and competitors inventory supplies in the retail and distribution channel  new product introductions  seasonal fluctuations  company and customer promotions  consolidation of customer distribution centers and customer and market demand for the company s products and perceptions of the company s ability to meet demand 
customers may increase orders during times of shortages  cancel orders if the channel is filled with currently available products or delay orders in anticipation of new products 
excess inventories could force the company to reduce prices  write down such inventory or take other actions which in turn could adversely affect the company s results of operations 
product procurement on november   the company sold its penang manufacturing subsidiary to a third party 
the company entered into a five year manufacturing services agreement with the third party for the manufacture and supply of zip drives and certain other products 
as a result of this transaction  the company faces new risks  including the following the company no longer has direct control over the manufacturing processes of zip drives and other products  the company s ability to quickly increase or decrease production rates may be impaired  the company s lack of control over its manufacturing processes may increase the risk that quality or reliability problems may arise with respect to its products and the company has incurred increased product and operational costs  and may incur additional product and operational costs in the future 
specifically  the product prices agreed to with the vendor are contingent upon the company purchasing certain volumes 
the company has incurred significant incremental costs as a result of not meeting the targeted volumes on zip drives and the company may incur such additional costs in the future 
iomega corporation and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued factors affecting future operating results continued product procurement costs the company believes that it must continually reduce the procurement costs of its products in order to remain competitive 
however  with the sale of the company s penang manufacturing subsidiary  the company has limited involvement in the manufacturing of any of the products it sells 
thus  in order to reduce product costs  the company believes that it must successfully negotiate lower product procurement costs from suppliers 
in the case of zip products  in particular  the supplier may not be able to meet contractual obligations to reduce operational overhead or introduce business from other non iomega sources rapidly enough to offset the decline in zip unit production  causing further price adjustments 
the company has also consolidated all zip disk manufacturing with one supplier with the goal to reduce costs 
this consolidation entails a number of risks  including risks of disruption in the supply of zip disks in the event of labor  quality or other problems at the zip disk manufacturer and risks that the consolidation will not lead to reduced costs or efficiencies 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully manage these risks 
distribution and logistics the company in recent years has outsourced its distribution and logistics centers 
during first quarter  the company entered into an agreement with a global provider of logistics services with the goal to consolidate its worldwide distribution and logistics requirements with one prime contractor 
consequently  the company has become more reliant upon the computer systems of its outsourcing partners and logistics services providers 
the company faces risks that these systems may have communication  control or reliability problems 
in addition  the company faces risks of operational interruptions  missed or delayed shipments and inventory management risks in conjunction with its transition to a new logistics provider 
the company hopes to realize cost savings and operational efficiencies with its transition to a new logistics provider 
however  the company can give no assurance that any cost savings or operational efficiencies will result from this consolidation 
moreover  a number of problems may occur in any distribution outsourcing relationship  including problems relating to product availability  supply  distribution  handling  shipping  quality or reliability 
such problems  if they were to arise with respect to the company s outsourced operations  could have an adverse effect in the form of a lower company sales  income and or gross margin  b damage to the company s reputation in the marketplace  resulting in decreased demand for or acceptance of the company s products or c damage claims filed against the company by customers  contract partners or investors as a result of such problems 
reporting of channel inventory and product sales by channel partners the company defers recognition of sales on estimated excess inventory in the distribution  retail and catalog channels 
for this purpose  excess inventory is the amount of inventory that exceeds the channels four week requirements as estimated by management 
in order to make this estimation  the company relies on its global channel partners weekly reporting of channel inventory and product sales by sku 
errors in reports received from channel partners could lead to inaccurate estimates of the excess channel inventory 
the company has comprehensive processes and systems checks in place to help reasonably ensure the accuracy of the reports and believes these reports to be correct in all material respects 
however  there can be no assurance that the third party data  as reported  will always be correct and reliable 
iomega corporation and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued factors affecting future operating results continued obsolescence risks the company s ability to effectively manage obsolescence risks will affect its operating results 
the company may terminate its marketing of certain products from time to time in response to market demand  supply  cost  competition or other factors 
this requires the company to carefully manage a number of issues  such as a maintaining market demand for the terminated product while successfully selling existing inventories through the channel  b reserving sufficient  but not excessive  quantities of product to comply with warranty  customer satisfaction and legal obligations and c preventing  to the extent possible  the return of such products from inventories held by distributors  retailers and other resellers 
there is no assurance that the company can successfully manage these factors 
component supplies although the company has sold its penang manufacturing subsidiary  the company has retained responsibility for the supply of certain key components 
the company has experienced difficulty in the past and may experience difficulty in the future  in obtaining a sufficient supply of many key components on a timely and cost effective basis 
many components incorporated or used in the manufacture of the company s products are currently available only from single source suppliers or from a limited number of suppliers and are purchased by the company without guaranteed supply arrangements 
in addition  the company has only one supplier of certain key products 
as zip product volumes have declined  multiple suppliers have imposed component price increases  which increases the overall cost of the zip products 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain a sufficient supply of components on a timely and cost effective basis 
the company s inability to obtain sufficient components and equipment or to obtain or develop alternative sources of supply could have a number of adverse consequences  such as the following the company might be unable to produce sufficient quantities of its products to satisfy market demand  in the case of a component purchased exclusively from one supplier  the company could be prevented from producing any quantity of the affected product s until such component becomes available from an alternative source  the company might be forced to delay product shipments  the company s material costs might increase thereby reducing product gross margins and the company could experience an imbalance in the inventory levels of certain components  which could increase costs  slow or stop production or cause the company to modify the design of its products to use a more readily available component  with uncertain consequences 
any or all of these problems could in turn result in the loss of customers  provide an opportunity for competing products to achieve market acceptance and otherwise adversely affect the company s business and financial results 
the purchase orders under which the company buys many of its components and sourced products generally extend one to three quarters in the future based on the lead times associated with the specific component or sourced product 
the quantities on the purchase orders are based on estimated future sales requirements 
in the case of new products or products with declining sales  it can be difficult to estimate future product demand  which could result in excess purchase commitments  where the company has made commitments for iomega corporation and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued factors affecting future operating results continued purchases that the company does not anticipate utilizing and therefore are considered excess 
the company has recorded significant charges in the past relating to excess purchase commitments and inventory reserves 
the company may be required to take similar charges attributable to forecasting inaccuracies in the future 
intellectual property risks patent  copyright  trademark or other intellectual property infringement claims may be asserted against the company at any time 
such claims could have a number of adverse consequences  including an injunction against current or future product shipments  a requirement that the company pay royalties to a third party in order to continue to market and distribute one or more of the company s current or future products  a requirement that the company pay royalties to third parties for past product shipments  a requirement that the company devote unplanned resources to developing modifications to its products or marketing programs  a requirement that the company indemnify third parties who have distributed the infringing product with the company s permission or significant legal fees incurred by the company 
the company must routinely review and respond to claims from third parties for patent royalties  both on products designed or sold by the company and products designed and supplied to the company by third parties 
resolution of patent infringement demand letters and lawsuits can be very costly  with legal fees and costs running into the millions of dollars 
the company attempts to protect its intellectual property rights through a variety of means  including seeking and obtaining patents  trademarks and copyrights  and through license  nondisclosure and other agreements 
the company s failure to properly protect its intellectual property rights could have devastating consequences 
although the company has  in general  been successful in its efforts to protect its intellectual property rights  there is no assurance that it will be able to do so in the future 
legal risks the company has entered into multiple agreements  including service  supply  resale  distribution  development and other agreements in multiple jurisdictions throughout the world 
in addition  as of december   the company employed people throughout the world 
although the company attempts to fulfill all of its obligations and enforce all of its rights under these agreements and relationships  there is no assurance that it will be able to do so 
the company has been sued and may be sued  under numerous legal theories  including breach of contract  tort  products liability  intellectual property infringement and other theories 
complaints have been filed and may be filed  against the company by contract partners  third parties  employees and other individuals or entities 
such litigation  regardless of outcome  may have an adverse effect upon the company s profitability or public perception  even if the litigation is unsuccessful 
restructuring and other cost reduction activities the company restructured its operations during and notified employees that their positions were being eliminated 
of these  all but have been released and of these remaining individuals will leave the company in the first quarter of with the remaining leaving the company in the third quarter of iomega corporation and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued factors affecting future operating results continued in conjunction with these restructurings  iomega incurred pre tax restructuring charges of million  which reflects expenses associated with reductions in the company s worldwide workforce described above  reimbursement of restructuring expenses incurred by a strategic supplier  termination of contractual obligations and lease expenses associated with unutilized facilities 
there is no assurance that these restructuring actions will lead to sustainable cost reductions or will otherwise benefit the company 
in addition  in carrying out these actions  the company is at risk that key personnel and experience may have been lost 
the company may experience short term disruptions of information technology systems and other business operations  or the strategic supplier may experience similar disruptions as a result of its restructuring 
the company may incur legal liabilities and claims associated with the restructuring actions and layoff 
retention of key personnel the company s continued success will depend  in part  upon its ability to attract and retain highly skilled and experienced personnel and to maintain continuity and stability within the company s senior management team 
there is no assurance that the company will be able to do so 
some skilled and experienced employees voluntarily resigned from the company during and there is a risk of additional resignations by such employees  particularly in light of recent restructuring activities  the company s recent financial performance and recent improvements in the us economy 
one time cash dividend on july   the company s board of directors declared a one time cash dividend of per share to stockholders of record as of the close of business on september   which was paid on october  the total amount of the dividend was million 
as a result of paying the dividend  the company s cash balances have been significantly reduced and the company may be subject to greater liquidity risks in the future 
other risk factors during the third quarter of  the company announced plans to cease its nomai manufacturing operations in avranches  france and ceased such operations shortly thereafter 
the company may be forced to incur additional legal or other costs relating to this matter 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in part iv for more information concerning nomai litigation 
significant portions of the company s sales are generated in europe and asia 
the company invoices the majority of its european customers in euros and invoices its remaining customers in us dollars 
fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar that are not sufficiently hedged by international customers invoiced in us dollars could result in lower sales and have an adverse effect on future operating results see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk below 
doing business outside the united states can be difficult to manage or to properly execute 
american executives may overlook local trends outside the us  market ineffectively in countries outside of the us  institute efforts from an american perspective that are unsuccessful outside the us or be unaware of customs or laws in other countries  with resulting legal exposure  complaints  cost inefficiencies or weak sales 
effective january   the company began expensing the cost of stock options that the company grants to employees 
as a result of the payment of the one time cash dividend on october   after the payment  iomega corporation and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued factors affecting future operating results continued all of the company s outstanding stock options are being accounted for under the fair value method of sfas accounting for stock based compensation 
it is difficult to estimate the impact that expensing stock options will have on the company s statement of operations as this expense is dependent upon variables that are difficult to predict  such as the number of options to be granted during a period  the price of the company s common stock at the time of grant  the stock price volatility  the risk free interest rate during the period and the expected average life of the option 
a slight change in any one of these variables can materially affect the amount of compensation expense to be recorded 
in summary  a number of factors could adversely affect the company or could cause actual events or results to differ materially from those indicated by any forward looking statements 
such factors include the ability of management to manage an increasingly complex business in a highly competitive environment  transportation issues  product and component pricing  changes in analysts earnings estimates  competition  technological changes and advances  adoption of technology or communications standards affecting the company s products  intellectual property rights  litigation  general economic conditions  seasonality and changes or slowdowns in overall market demand for personal computer products and other consumer products which utilize the company s products 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to various interest rate risks including foreign currency  interest rate and securities price risks 
the company is exposed to various foreign currency exchange rate risks that arise in the normal course of business 
the company s functional currency is the us dollar 
the company has international operations resulting in receipts and payments in currencies that differ from the functional currency of the company 
the company attempts to reduce foreign currency exchange rate risks by utilizing financial instruments  including derivative transactions pursuant to company policies 
the company uses forward contracts to hedge those net assets and liabilities that  when remeasured according to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  impact the consolidated statement of operations 
all forward contracts entered into by the company are components of hedging programs and are entered into for the sole purpose of hedging an existing or anticipated currency exposure  not for speculation or trading purposes 
currently  the company is using forward contracts only to hedge net balance sheet exposures 
the contracts are primarily in european currencies and the singapore dollar 
the company enters into contracts throughout the month as necessary 
these contracts normally have maturities that do not exceed days 
when hedging balance sheet exposures  all gains and losses on forward contracts are recognized in other income and expense in the same period that the gains and losses on remeasurement of the foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities occur 
all gains and losses related to foreign exchange contracts are included in cash flows from operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows 
iomega corporation and subsidiaries item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk continued the fair value of the company s forward contracts is subject to change as a result of potential changes in market rates and prices 
if the us dollar were to strengthen or weaken against these foreign currencies by  the hypothetical value of the contracts would have increased or decreased by approximately million and million at december  and december   respectively 
however  these forward exchange contracts are hedges and consequently any market value gains or losses arising from these foreign exchange contracts should be offset by foreign exchange losses or gains on the underlying net assets and liabilities 
calculations of the above effects assume that each rate changed in the same direction at the same time relative to the us dollar 
the calculations reflect only those differences resulting from mechanically replacing one exchange rate with another 
they do not factor in any potential effects that changes in currency exchange rates may have on statement of operations translation  sales volume and prices and on local currency costs of production 
as of december  and december   the company s analysis indicated that such market movements  given the offsetting foreign currency gains or losses on the underlying net assets and liabilities  would not have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
factors that could impact the effectiveness of the company s hedging programs include volatility of the currency and interest rate markets  availability of hedging instruments and the company s ability to accurately project net asset or liability positions 
actual gains and losses in the future may differ materially from the company s analysis depending on changes in the timing and amount of interest rate and foreign exchange rate movements and the company s actual exposures and hedges 
the company did not have any significant debt outstanding at december  and december  should the company need to borrow funds in the future  it would be subject to credit based interest rate risks 
the company is also subject to interest rate risks on its current cash  cash equivalents and temporary investment balances 
for example  if the interest rate on the company s interest bearing investments were to change basis points  interest income would have hypothetically increased or decreased by million during and million during this hypothetical analysis does not take into consideration the effects of the economic conditions that would give rise to such an interest rate change or the company s response to such hypothetical conditions 
the company minimizes its credit risk associated with temporary investments by using investment grade  highly liquid securities 
the company has classified all of its temporary investments as available for sale securities 
the company s temporary investments are purchased with maturities in excess of three months 
temporary investments at december  and primarily consisted of corporate notes and bonds and paper  us treasuries  certificates of deposit  us agencies  taxable and non taxable municipal obligations  asset backed securities and mortgage backed securities 
none of the company s temporary investments have an effective maturity greater than months and at december   the average duration of the company s temporary investments was less than months  as compared to months at december  at december   the company had million and million of debt security investments that will mature within one year and will mature between one to two years  respectively 
cash and cash equivalents include all marketable securities purchased with maturities of three or fewer months 
cash equivalents at december  and  consisted primarily of investments in repurchase agreements  corporate obligations  certificates of deposit  money market funds  us agencies  and taxable and non taxable municipal obligations
