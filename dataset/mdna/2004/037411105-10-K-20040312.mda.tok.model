we have paid cash dividends on our common stock for consecutive years through december  when  and if  declared by our board of directors  future dividend payments will depend upon our level of earnings  financial requirements and other relevant factors 
in  our board of directors adopted a stockholder rights plan to replace the former plan adopted in under our stockholder rights plan  each of our common stockholders received a dividend of one preferred stock purchase right for each outstanding shares of common stock adjusted for the percent and five percent stock dividends and two for one stock split that the stockholder owned 
we refer to these preferred stock purchase rights as the rights 
unless the rights have been previously redeemed  all shares of apache common stock are issued with rights 
the rights trade automatically with our shares of common stock 
certain triggering events will give the holders of the rights the ability to purchase shares of our common stock  or the equivalent stock of a person that acquires us  at a discount 
the triggering events relate to persons or groups acquiring an amount of our common stock in excess of a set percentage  or attempting to or actually acquiring us

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview apache corporation is an independent energy company whose principle business includes exploration  development and production of crude oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids 
during the company added an additional international core area with the acquisition of the uk north sea forties field from bp plc bp 
the company s other core geographic areas include operations in the united states  canada  australia and egypt 
smaller  non core operations are conducted in china and argentina 
apache adheres to a portfolio approach to provide diversity in terms of hydrocarbon mix crude oil and natural gas  geologic risk and geographic location 
our growth strategy focuses on economic growth through drilling  through acquisitions  or through a combination of both  depending on what the environment gives us 
as we pursue growth  we continually monitor the capital resources available to us to meet our future financial obligations and liquidity needs 
these obligations and needs must be met with cash on hand  cash generated from our operations  unused committed borrowing capacity under our global credit facility and the capital markets 
the interest cost of debt and access to the equity markets are greatly influenced by a company s ability to maintain a strong balance sheet and generate ongoing operating cash flow 
for these reasons  we strive to maintain a manageable debt load that is properly balanced with equity  and our single a credit ratings 
we are also cognizant of the costs to add reserves through drilling and acquisitions as well as the costs necessary to produce such reserves 
consequently  we must stay abreast of industry drilling costs and the price at which properties are available for purchase  when choosing where to allocate our available funds 
we monitor operating costs  on both an absolute dollar and per unit of production basis  relative to our historical norms and relative to our industry sector  factoring in the impact from property acquisitions and changes in industry conditions 
given the inherent volatility and unpredictability of commodity prices  and changing industry conditions  we frequently revise our forecasts and adjust our budgets accordingly 
commodity prices throughout were relatively high and remained consistently strong throughout the year 
this price consistency allowed us to maintain a fairly constant level of capital expenditures for exploration and development drilling throughout the year 
our drilling and acquisition capital expenditures discussed below were balanced  as we grew both production and reserves to record levels  while maintaining a balance in terms of hydrocarbon mix 
we had exceptional profitability growth in  achieving several operational and financial milestones noted below our oil and gas production revenues reached a record billion  percent higher than in we generated record earnings of billion  more than twice our prior year level 
more importantly  on a diluted share basis earnings rose percent to a record per share 
cash from operating activities increased percent from the prior year to a record billion 
production averaged a record  barrels of oil equivalent per day boe d  the th increase in the last years 
in mid july  production was initiated on the zhao dong block in bohai bay  offshore china 
we began actively marketing our us natural gas effective with july production 
with our nd quarter north american daily natural gas production exceeding one billion cubic feet bcf  we felt it was prudent to bring this responsibility back in house 
on december  we announced the signing of a memorandum of understanding mou with the egyptian general petroleum corporation egpc for a gas sales agreement  field development plan and deepwater development lease for a minimum of trillion cubic feet tcf of natural gas over years from the deepwater portion of our egyptian west mediterranean concession 
production is scheduled to commence in  contingent upon completion of significant development infrastructure and resolution of delays in certain payments for production by egpc 
we ended the year with record proved reserves of billion barrels of oil equivalent boe  marking the th consecutive year of reserve growth 
nearly half of our proved reserve additions were added through exploration and development activities 
we began our th year in a strong financial position and on january   we announced the bp acquisition  our single largest acquisition to date  establishing a new international core area and augmenting our gulf of mexico portfolio 
the bp acquisition fit our balanced portfolio business model and provides the potential for internal growth similar to what we have experienced in other areas 
it also extends our relationship with one of the world s largest integrated major companies 
in july  we consummated a deal with shell exploration and production company shell adding additional oil and gas fields on the outer continental shelf of the gulf of mexico 
our total acquisition costs for were approximately billion  compared to million in the prior year 
these acquisitions are discussed in more detail below 
our worldwide capital expenditures for exploration and development were approximately billion  percent higher than and approximately percent higher than our initial plan 
our strong cash flow enabled us to allocate additional funds to exploration and development during we spent approximately percent of our exploration and development capital in north america  which is consistent with reserve and production contributions 
we had numerous drilling successes throughout the year  particularly in egypt and australia our most significant exploration success in egypt  announced in july  was the qasr x well located on the khalda concession 
in november  we announced completion of the qasr x confirming the qasr x discovery 
we believe the qasr discovery has the potential to be the most significant discovery in apache s years 
production was initiated on a restricted basis in the fourth quarter of  with full production expected in  pending completion of additional development wells  appraisal wells and construction of pipeline facilities 
in july  we announced that our ravensworth well discovered oil in the exmouth sub basin offshore western australia  creating a new oil play area for apache in an oil prone area and adding a new dimension to our exploration program offshore western australia 
early in october  we announced our second discovery in the exmouth sub basin  the crosby  providing additional confidence that we have established a new oil play area 
appraisal wells along with additional exploration drilling will occur in following a very active year of drilling and acquisitions  our year end reserves remained balanced at percent oil and percent natural gas  compared with percent oil and percent natural gas at year end the increase in oil reserves is primarily attributable to the properties acquired in the north sea 
during  the us contributed percent of equivalent production  up from percent in  reflecting the impact of the gulf of mexico assets acquired from bp and shell 
apache ended the year in a strong financial position  maintaining single a credit ratings on unsecured long term debt issued by moody s  standard and poor s and fitch rating agencies 
also  we reduced debt to percent of capitalization despite over billion in capital expenditures 
to manage our financial flexibility  we consummated several debt and equity transactions during on january   in conjunction with the pending bp transaction  we completed a public offering of million shares of common stock  adjusted for the two for one stock split  raising million 
during the second quarter  the company issued million of year  senior unsecured notes at a percent coupon rate 
proceeds were used to reduce bank debt and outstanding commercial paper  and for general corporate purposes 
to take advantage of historically low interest rates on commercial paper and better position ourselves to pay down short term debt  if we so elect  on september   apache repurchased and retired preferred interests issued by three of its subsidiaries for approximately million  plus an additional million for accrued dividends and distributions 
the company also filed a shelf registration with the securities and exchange commission that allows apache to sell up to billion in stock and debt securities 
on september  the company announced that its board of directors  in recognition of the company s outstanding growth and progress  voted to increase the quarterly cash dividend on its common stock percent to cents per share from cents per share  effective with the november payment  and to split the stock two for one 
while was an outstanding year  the current outlook for is also encouraging 
recent drilling successes and acquisitions should generate substantial production 
also  the current nymex futures markets indicate oil and natural gas prices above historical averages in lastly  we are well positioned to access capital should appropriate acquisition opportunities present themselves 
a more detailed discussion of operations follows our critical accounting policies 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
certain accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts could have been reported under different conditions  or if different assumptions had been used 
we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on a regular basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions used in preparation of our financial statements 
below  we have provided expanded discussion of our more significant accounting policies  estimates and judgments 
we discussed the development  selection and disclosure of each of these with our audit committee 
we believe these accounting policies reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in preparation of our financial statements 
see results of operations and note of item of this form k for a discussion of additional accounting policies and estimates made by management 
full cost method of accounting for oil and gas operations the accounting for our business is subject to special accounting rules that are unique to the oil and gas industry 
there are two allowable methods of accounting for oil and gas business activities the successful efforts method and the full cost method 
there are several significant differences between these methods 
under the successful efforts method  costs such as geological and geophysical g g  exploratory dry holes and delay rentals  are expensed as incurred where under the full cost method these types of charges would be capitalized to their respective full cost pool 
in the measurement of impairment of oil and gas properties  the successful efforts method of accounting follows the guidance provided in statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  where the first measurement for impairment is to compare the net book value of the related asset to its undiscounted future cash flows using commodity prices consistent with management expectations 
under the full cost method the net book value full cost pool is compared to the future net cash flows discounted at percent using commodity prices in effect on the last day of the reporting period 
we have elected to use the full cost method to account for our investment in oil and gas properties 
under this method  the company capitalizes all acquisition  exploration and development costs for the purpose of finding oil and gas reserves  including salaries  benefits and other internal costs directly attributable to these activities 
although some of these costs will ultimately result in no additional reserves  we expect the benefits of successful wells to more than offset the costs of any unsuccessful ones 
in addition  gains or losses on the sale or other disposition of oil and gas properties are not recognized unless the gain or loss would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves of oil and natural gas attributable to a country 
as a result  we believe that the full cost method of accounting better reflects the true economics of exploring for and developing oil and gas reserves 
our financial position and results of operations would have been significantly different had we used the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas investments 
typically  the application of the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas property generally results in higher capitalized costs and higher depletion  depreciation and amortization dd a rates compared to similar companies applying the successful efforts methods of accounting 
the company has taken note of a july inquiry to the financial accounting standards board fasb regarding whether or not contract based oil and gas mineral rights held by lease or contract mineral rights should be recorded or disclosed as intangible assets 
the inquiry presents a view that these mineral rights are intangible assets as defined in sfas no 
 business combinations  and  therefore  should be classified separately on the balance sheet as intangible assets 
sfas no 
 and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  became effective for transactions subsequent to june  with the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
required as of january  sfas no 
requires that all business combinations initiated after june  be accounted for using the purchase method and that intangible assets be disaggregated and reported separately from goodwill 
sfas no 
established new accounting guidelines for both finite lived intangible assets and indefinite lived intangible assets 
under the statement  intangible assets should be separately reported on the face of the balance sheet and accompanied by disclosure in the notes to financial statements 
sfas no 
scopes out accounting utilized by the oil and gas industry as prescribed by sfas no 
 and is silent about whether or not its disclosure provisions apply to oil and gas companies 
apache does not believe that sfas no 
or change the classification of oil and gas mineral rights and the company continues to classify these assets as part of oil and gas properties 
the emerging issues task force eitf has added the treatment of oil and gas mineral rights to an upcoming agenda  which may result in a change in how apache classifies these assets 
should such a change be required  the amounts related to business combinations and major asset purchases after june  that would be classified as intangible undeveloped mineral interest was million and million as of december  and december   respectively 
the amounts related to business combinations and major asset purchases after june  that would be classified as intangible developed mineral interest was million and billion as of december  and december   respectively 
intangible developed mineral interest amounts are presented net of accumulated dd a 
accumulated dd a was estimated using historical depletion rates applied proportionately to the costs of the acquisitions to be classified as intangible developed mineral interest 
the amounts noted above only include mineral rights acquired in business combinations or major asset purchases  and exclude those acquired individually or in groups as we have not historically tracked these in this manner 
the company has also not historically tracked the amount of mineral rights in the proved property balances related to producing leases or relinquished leases 
we are currently identifying a methodology to do so for transactions subsequent to june  the numbers above are based on our understanding of the issue before the eitf  if all mineral rights associated with unevaluated property and producing reserves were deemed to be intangible assets mineral rights with proved reserves that were acquired after june  and mineral rights with no proved reserves would be classified as intangible assets and would not be included in oil and gas properties on our consolidated balance sheet  results of operations and cash flows would not be materially affected because mineral rights would continue to be amortized in accordance with full cost accounting rules  and disclosures required by sfas nos 
and relative to intangibles would be included in the notes to our financial statements 
if the accounting for mineral rights is ultimately changed  transitional guidance for intangible assets permits the reclassification of only amounts acquired after the effective date of sfas nos 
and if records were not previously maintained to track acquisition costs based on their intangible or tangible nature 
lack of these records prior to the effective date could result in the loss of comparability between historical balances of tangible and intangible asset balances and among companies in the industry 
reserve estimates our estimate of proved reserves is based on the quantities of oil and gas which geological and engineering data demonstrate  with reasonable certainty  to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data  engineering and geological interpretation  and judgment 
for example  we must estimate the amount and timing of future operating costs  severance taxes  development costs  and workover costs  all of which may in fact vary considerably from actual results 
in addition  as prices and cost levels change from year to year  the estimate of proved reserves also changes 
any significant variance in these assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of our reserves 
despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates  our reserves are used throughout our financial statements 
for example  since we use the units of production method to amortize our oil and gas properties  the quantity of reserves could significantly impact our dd a expense 
our oil and gas properties are also subject to a ceiling limitation based in part on the quantity of our proved reserves 
finally  these reserves are the basis for our supplemental oil and gas disclosures 
we engage an independent petroleum engineering firm to review our estimates of proved hydrocarbon liquid and gas reserves 
during  and  their review covered  and percent of the reserve value  respectively 
bad debt expense we routinely assess the recoverability of all material trade and other receivables to determine their collectibility 
many of our receivables are from joint interest owners on properties of which we are the operator 
thus  we may have the ability to withhold future revenue disbursements to recover any non payment of joint interest billings 
generally  our crude oil and natural gas receivables are typically collected within two months 
however  during and  we experienced a gradual decline in the timeliness of receipts from egpc for our oil and gas sales 
deteriorating economic conditions during and in egypt lessened the availability of us dollars  resulting in an additional one to two month delay in receipts from egpc 
while hard currency shortages in egypt could lead to further delays  we did not experience any further delays in please refer to the future trends section in this item for additional discussion concerning our egyptian receivables 
we accrue a reserve on a receivable when  based on the judgment of management  it is probable that a receivable will not be collected and the amount of any reserve may be reasonably estimated 
asset retirement obligation the company has significant obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore land or seabed at the end of oil and gas production operations 
apache s removal and restoration obligations are primarily associated with plugging and abandoning wells and removing and disposing of offshore oil and gas platforms 
estimating the future restoration and removal costs is difficult and requires management to make estimates and judgments because most of the removal obligations are many years in the future and contracts and regulations often have vague descriptions of what constitutes removal 
asset removal technologies and costs are constantly changing  as are regulatory  political  environmental  safety and public relations considerations 
prior to  under the full cost method of accounting  as described in the preceding critical accounting policy sections  the estimated undiscounted costs of the abandonment obligations  net of the value of salvage  were included as a component of our depletion base and expensed over the production life of the oil and gas properties 
in  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
apache adopted this statement effective january   as discussed in note of item of this form k 
sfas no 
significantly changed the method of accruing for costs an entity is legally obligated to incur related to the retirement of fixed assets asset retirement obligations or aro 
primarily  the new statement requires the company to record a separate liability for the discounted present value of the company s asset retirement obligations  with an offsetting increase to the related oil and gas properties on the balance sheet 
inherent in the present value calculation are numerous assumptions and judgments including the ultimate settlement amounts  inflation factors  credit adjusted discount rates  timing of settlement  and changes in the legal  regulatory  environmental and political environments 
to the extent future revisions to these assumptions impact the present value of the existing aro liability  a corresponding adjustment is made to the oil and gas property balance 
in addition  increases in the discounted aro liability resulting from the passage of time will be reflected as accretion expense in the consolidated statement of operations 
sfas no 
requires a cumulative adjustment to reflect the impact of implementing the statement had the rule been in effect since inception 
the company  therefore  calculated the cumulative accretion expense on the aro liability and the cumulative depletion expense on the corresponding property balance 
the sum of these cumulative expenses was compared to the depletion expense originally recorded 
because the historically recorded depletion expense was higher than the cumulative expense calculated under sfas no 
 the difference resulted in a gain which the company recorded as cumulative effect of change in accounting principle on january  upon implementation  the company also had to determine if the statement required us to recalculate our historical full cost ceiling tests see note of item of this form k 
the company chose not to re calculate its historical full cost ceiling tests even though its historical oil and gas property balances would have been higher had we applied the statement from inception 
we believe this approach is appropriate because sfas no 
is silent on this issue and was not effective during the prior impairment test periods 
had a recalculation of the historical full cost ceiling test resulted in impairment  the charge would have reduced the gain recorded upon adoption 
going forward  our depletion expense will be reduced since we will deplete a discounted aro rather than the undiscounted value previously depleted 
the lower depletion expense under sfas no 
is offset  however  by accretion expense  which reflects increases in the discounted asset retirement obligation over time 
also  the company had to determine how to incorporate the asset retirement obligations into the quarterly calculation of its full cost ceiling tests see note of item of this form k 
sfas no 
is silent with respect to this issue and  although there are various views  the company elected to continue including the undiscounted aro as part of future development costs  essentially reducing the present value of its future net revenues and full cost ceiling limit 
to compare the property balance  which included the aro component  to the full cost ceiling limit  which has been reduced by a similar abandonment cost  we netted the aro liability against the property balance 
the company believes its view is appropriate since there must be a comparable basis between the net book value of the properties and the full cost ceiling limitation 
another widely contemplated view is to exclude the aro from future development costs when calculating the full cost ceiling limitation and not reduce the carrying amount of capitalized costs by the related liability 
this approach would result in a higher full cost ceiling limitation and a comparatively higher net oil and gas property balance 
income taxes oil and gas exploration and production is a global business 
as a result  we are subject to taxation on our income in numerous jurisdictions 
we record deferred tax assets and liabilities to account for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements and our tax returns 
we routinely assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
if we conclude that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized under accounting standards  the tax asset would be reduced by a valuation allowance 
we consider future taxable income in making such assessments 
numerous judgments and assumptions are inherent in the determination of future taxable income  including factors such as future operating conditions particularly as related to prevailing oil and gas prices 
we intend to permanently reinvest earnings from our international operations  therefore  we do not recognize deferred taxes on the unremitted earnings of our international subsidiaries 
if it becomes apparent that some or all of the unremitted earnings will be remitted  we would then reflect taxes on those earnings 
derivatives apache uses commodity derivative contracts on a limited basis to manage its exposure to oil and gas price volatility and accounts for the contracts in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
the estimated fair values of apache s derivative contracts within the scope of this statement are carried on the company s consolidated balance sheet 
for contracts designated and qualifying as cash flow hedges  realized gains and losses are generally recognized in oil and gas production revenues when the forecasted transaction occurs 
sfas requires that gains and losses from the change in fair value of derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting be marked to market and reported in current period income  rather than in the period in which the hedged transaction is settled 
the company does not currently enter into derivative or other financial instruments for trading purposes 
the estimate of fair value of apache s derivative contracts requires substantial judgment  however  the company s derivative contracts are generally exchange traded or valued by reference to commodities that are traded in highly liquid markets 
as such  the ultimate fair value is determined by references to readily available public data 
option valuations are verified against independent third party quotations 
see commodity risk under item a of this form k for commodity price sensitivity information 
results of operations this section includes a discussion of our and results of operations 
apache has six reportable segments  which are the united states  canada  australia  egypt  the north sea and other international 
these segments are primarily in the business of crude oil and natural gas exploration and production 
please refer to note of item of this form k for segment information 
acquisitions and divestitures in  we spent billion on oil and gas acquisitions  adding mmboe to our reserve base 
the preponderance of our acquisition activity was focused in the north sea and gulf of mexico 
the north sea assets further diversified our reserves and production  while the gulf of mexico properties provide opportunities in an area that historically enjoys the highest netback natural gas pricing in north america 
seventy two percent of our acquisition capital was spent to acquire north sea and gulf of mexico properties from bp 
another percent was spent to acquire additional gulf of mexico properties from shell 
the balance of our activity involved smaller acquisitions in australia and north america 
the north sea acquisition establishes a new international operating region for apache  providing the potential for future internal growth 
the gulf of mexico properties acquired from bp and shell lay down well with our existing gulf of mexico properties and provide promising prospects for future exploration  exploitation and development activities 
as we have in the past  we expect to identify and take advantage of efficiencies in field operations and economics of scale  while concurrently accelerating production and adding reserves 
in association with the bp acquisition  apache agreed to sell all of the production from the north sea properties to bp for a two year period at a combination of fixed and market sensitive prices pursuant to a contract entered into in connection with the north sea purchase agreement 
to protect the acquisition economics on the gulf of mexico properties acquired from bp we hedged prices on a substantial portion of the oil production for a month period ending january   and a substantial portion of the gas production for the first two years see note under item of this form k 
prior to the shell transaction  morgan stanley capital group  inc morgan stanley paid shell million to acquire an overriding royalty interest in a portion of the reserves to be produced over the next four years 
shell s sale of an overriding royalty interest to morgan stanley is commonly known in the industry as a volumetric production payment vpp 
under the terms of the vpp  morgan stanley is to receive a fixed volume of oil and gas production over the four year term 
the vpp reserves and production will not be recorded by apache 
in addition  a million liability for the future cost to produce and deliver volumes subject to the vpp has been recorded by the company because the overriding royalties are not burdened by production costs 
this liability will be amortized as the volumes are produced and delivered to morgan stanley 
in  we elected to exercise patience on the acquisition front  in anticipation of lower acquisition prices 
we focused our attention on managing our financial structure by building equity and paying down debt so we would be in a position to act quickly when attractive assets became available at reasonable prices 
our oil and gas acquisitions in totaled approximately million  adding mmboe to our reserve base  far short of the million we expended during  which added mmboe of proved reserves 
in addition  the acquisitions added million and million of production  processing and transportation facilities in and  respectively  and million of goodwill in seventy five percent of our acquisition activity occurred in the us and was related to the acquisition of properties primarily located in two southern louisiana parishes 
the balance of our acquisitions primarily related to two acquisitions in canada 
in connection with our south louisiana acquisition  we entered into costless collar hedges to protect apache from the potential for falling gas prices and to protect the economics of the transaction 
these hedges are consistent with some of our and acquisitions  whereby we entered into and assumed fixed price commodity swaps and costless collars that protected apache from falling commodity prices 
this enabled us to better predict the financial performance of our acquisitions 
see note of item for the terms of the company s hedging activity 
our acquisitions over the last three years helped us maintain diversity in terms of hydrocarbon product oil or gas  geologic risk and geographic location 
as shown in note of this form k  our year end international reserves as a percentage of total reserves climbed to percent from percent at year end  while our international average daily production remained constant at percent of our total production in both and our hydrocarbon product mix on a boe basis in remained relatively constant at percent natural gas and percent oil  compared to percent natural gas and percent oil in while the us  a highly stable environment  remains our largest producing core area  apache will continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities in existing core areas and in new areas should they arise 
note that  in light of the uncertainty of how the collapse of enron corp 
would impact the derivatives markets  we closed all of our derivatives positions in october and november  most of which were associated with prior acquisitions  recognizing a net gain in of million with additional gains and losses to be recognized over the original life of the hedge 
a net gain of million was recognized in and a million net loss was recognized in these  as well as the unwinding of our gas price swaps associated with advances from gas purchasers  increased the company s average natural gas price by 
per mcf during  
per mcf during and

revenues our revenues are sensitive to changes in prices received for our products 
a substantial portion of our production is sold at prevailing market prices  which fluctuate in response to many factors that are outside of our control 
imbalances in the supply and demand for oil and natural gas can have dramatic effects on the prices we receive for our production 
political instability and availability of alternative fuels could impact worldwide supply  while other economic factors could impact demand 
oil and natural gas prices while the market price received for crude oil and natural gas varies among geographic areas  crude oil trades in a world wide market  whereas natural gas  which has a limited global transportation system  is subject to local supply and demand conditions 
consequently  price movements for all types and grades of crude oil generally move in the same direction  while natural gas price movements generally follow local market conditions 
apache sells its natural gas into three markets  north america  which has a common market and where production is currently in short supply relative to demand 
australia  which has a local market with limited demand and infrastructure 
egypt  which has a local market and where the price received for the majority of our production is currently indexed to a weighted average dated brent crude oil price

contributions to oil and natural gas revenues as with production and reserves  a consequence of geographic diversification is a shifting geographic mix of our oil revenues and natural gas revenues 
for the reasons discussed in the oil and natural gas price section above  contributions to oil revenues and gas revenues should be viewed separately 
the following table presents each segment s oil revenues and gas revenues as a percentage of total oil revenues and gas revenues  respectively 
oil revenues gas revenues for the year ended for the year ended december  december  united states canada north america egypt australia north sea other international total crude oil contribution in oil revenues from areas outside the us rose to approximately percent of consolidated oil revenues  up from percent in the increase is directly related to the acquisition of the north sea properties and  to a much lesser extent  initial production from china 
the percentage contribution from all other areas fell  reflecting the impact from the north sea revenues and china revenues 
in  oil revenues outside the us reached approximately percent of consolidated oil revenues  up from percent in this increase primarily occurred in egypt and australia where crude oil revenues rose to percent and percent of total oil revenues  respectively 
canada contributed percent of oil revenue  down from percent in natural gas contribution the preponderance of consolidated natural gas revenues comes from our north american operations 
in  percent of apache s natural gas revenues came from north america  percent from the us and percent from canada 
the us contribution rose percent from  primarily because of the properties acquired from bp and shell in  and properties acquired in south louisiana in december our us gulf coast region  which contributed percent of apache s us production  is characterized by reservoirs which demonstrate high initial production rates followed by steep declines when compared to most other us producing areas 
higher us natural gas prices also contributed  but to a much lesser extent 
canada s contribution was down two percent from primarily because of the production growth in the us egypt s contribution to total gas revenues declined to eight percent from percent in egypt s total natural gas revenues were relatively flat year over year  as additional revenues generated from higher natural gas prices were offset by lower production generated revenues 
australia s contribution to natural gas revenues declined to three percent from five percent in in  percent of apache s natural gas revenues came from the north american market  percent from the us and percent from canada 
the remaining percent was split between egypt  percent  and australia  percent

higher production added the remaining million 
virtually all of the additional revenues attributable to price came from the us and canada 
the additional revenues attributable to production were concentrated in the us  where natural gas production increased percent  reflecting the impact from the bp and shell acquisitions and the december acquisition of the south louisiana properties 
partially offsetting the additional us production revenues were lower production in egypt  australia and canada  down seven percent  six percent and three percent  respectively 
egypt s lower production related to gas production curtailment imposed by egpc and scheduled plant shutdowns  while australia saw lower customer demand 
consolidated natural gas revenues declined million in  consistent with an 
per mcf decline in the weighted average realized price for natural gas and a four percent decline in production 
the price decline reduced revenues by million  while lower gas production reduced revenues by another million 
a gas production decline of percent was experienced in the us  with declines of percent and percent in the gulf coast and central regions  respectively 
the gulf coast region  which contributed percent of apache s us production  is characterized by reservoirs which demonstrate high initial rates followed by steep declines when compared to other us producing regions 
natural decline coupled with capital curtailments  property sales in late and back to back hurricanes in september and october contributed to the production decline in the us collectively  canada  egypt  australia and argentina saw a percent increase in natural gas production 
canada s increase was the result of previous acquisitions and subsequent drilling activity  coupled with successful results at ladyfern  which offset natural decline at zama 
egypt s increase also came from previous acquisitions and subsequent drilling activity 
see note of item of this k for further discussion of acquisition and divestiture activity 
we have used long term  fixed price physical contracts to lock in a small portion of our domestic future natural gas production 
the contracts provide a measure of protection to the company in the event of decreasing natural gas prices and represented approximately nine and percent of our and domestic natural gas production  respectively 
in  these contracts reduced our average realized price 
per mcf 
in  these contracts added 
per mcf 
additionally  substantially all of our natural gas production sold in australia is subject to long term fixed price contracts that are periodically adjusted for changes in australia s consumer price index 
our realized prices are also impacted by a change in the value of the australian dollar relative to the us dollar 
in  we saw an increase in our realized prices primarily because of the stronger australian dollar 
crude oil revenues our consolidated oil revenues increased million with a percent increase in oil production generating an additional million of revenues 
crude oil prices improved in all areas  pushing our worldwide weighted average crude oil price up per barrel  adding the remaining million 
revenues from properties acquired in the north sea accounted for over half of the increase in oil revenues attributable to production 
a portion of the revenue from the north sea is tied to a separate crude oil physical sales contract entered into in conjunction with the acquisition 
see note of item of this form k for a discussion of the terms of this contract 
production in the us increased percent  primarily from the gulf of mexico bp properties and to a lesser extent from properties acquired from shell and in south louisiana in december initial production from china and a nine percent increase in production from egypt also contributed to the revenue gains 
oil revenues improved million in with both a higher realized price and higher production 
the weighted average realized price for oil improved per barrel  adding million to oil revenues  while oil production gains added another million 
the price improvement was across the board  while production gains of percent and percent occurred in australia and egypt  respectively 
the legendre  simpson and gibson south plato developments drove australia s gain  while egypt s increase was related to the repsol acquisition in and subsequent drilling 
us production declined nine percent related to natural decline  back to back hurricanes in late september and early october and property sales 
see note of item of this form k for further discussion of acquisition and divestiture activity 
operating expenses the tables below present a comparison of our expenses on an absolute dollar basis and an equivalent unit of production boe basis 
our discussion may reference either expenses on a boe basis or expenses on an absolute dollar basis  or both  depending on their relevance

total    depreciation  depletion and amortization apache s full cost dd a expense is driven by many factors including certain costs incurred in the exploration  development  and acquisition of producing reserves  production levels  and estimates of proved reserve quantities and future developmental costs 
full cost dd a expense of billion is comprised of the us  million  canada  million  egypt  million  australia  million  the north sea  million  and china  million 
full cost dd a expense increased million compared to the majority of the increase in absolute costs was in the us  up million  and the north sea  million  related to increases in production driven by our recent acquisitions

the remaining increase is concentrated in egypt and australia 
on a boe basis  our average full cost dd a rate in increased 
to from in the bulk of the increase occurred in australia  egypt and the us contributing

the increases in australia and egypt reflect the impact of higher finding and development costs  while the increase in the us reflects the impact of higher finding and development costs and higher acquisition costs 
china and the north sea each added  while canada s rate lowered the consolidated rate 
in  our full cost dd a expense increased million 
areas outside the us saw an increase in their expense  while dd a expense decreased in the us the areas experiencing the largest increase in absolute costs were egypt  up million and australia  up million consistent with their overall increase in production  while the us experienced a million decline in full cost dd a expense on lower production levels 
canada also had higher dd a expense of million relating to higher production levels 
on a boe basis our full cost dd a rate rose 
to 
the us contributed 
to the increase in rate  driven by higher finding costs and higher future development costs 
the remaining increase in the consolidated rate is split between egypt and australia 
the impact from egypt is related to higher finding and development costs 
the impact from australia is primarily related to higher future development costs 
depreciation of other assets increased million  in in line with our overall growth 
impairments we assess all of our unproved properties for possible impairment on a quarterly basis based on geological trend analysis  dry holes or relinquishment of acreage 
when an impairment occurs  costs associated with these properties are generally transferred to our proved property base where they become subject to amortization 
in some of our international exploration plays  however  we have not yet established proved reserves 
as such  any impairments in these areas are immediately charged to earnings 
during  we impaired a portion of our unproved property costs in poland and china by million million after tax 
in  we impaired an additional million in poland million after tax 
in  we impaired the remaining million million after tax of unproved property costs in poland 
goodwill is subject to a periodic fair value based impairment assessment beginning in goodwill totals million at december  and no impairment was recorded in or for further discussion  see note of item of this form k 
lease operating costs lease operating costs loe is generally comprised of several components  direct operating costs  repair and maintenance costs  workover costs and ad valorem costs 
loe is driven in part by the type of commodity produced  the level of workover activity and the geographical location of the properties 
oil is inherently more expensive to produce than natural gas 
workovers continue to be an important part of our strategy 
they enable us to exploit our existing reserves by accelerating production and taking advantage of high priced environments 
repair and maintenance costs are higher on offshore properties and in areas with plants and facilities 
during  the company saw a substantial increase in its loe costs on both an absolute dollar basis and boe basis 
the majority of the increase on an absolute dollar basis was expected  given the bp and shell acquisitions and the acquisition of the south louisiana properties 
on a boe basis  loe increased 
to  with all of the increase occurring outside the us the north sea properties  which are located offshore and produce oil  added approximately million of costs  increasing our consolidated rate 
per boe 
canada s loe costs increased million  adding 
to our consolidated boe rate 
the impact from a weaker us dollar  a full year of loe on properties acquired in the second half of  costs associated with new fields  and higher power and fuel rates drove the increase in canadian costs 
egypt s operating costs increased million  adding 
to the overall rate 
the majority of the increase in egypt was attributable to higher workover activity 
australia s loe increased million because of an increase in repair and maintenance and higher oil production 
australia added 
to the overall boe rate 
the loe rate in the us declined as the impact from the additional costs associated with the acquisitions discussed above were more than offset by the incremental production 
the us reduced the overall rate by 
per boe 
during  loe was per boe  a 
increase from higher absolute costs accounted for percent  
per boe  of this rate increase  with lower production accounting for the remaining 
per boe 
we experienced higher absolute costs in the gulf coast region  egypt and canada 
in the gulf coast region increased repairs and maintenance  related to both routine operations and hurricane repairs  generally higher costs on properties operated by others on offshore gulf of mexico properties and increased workover activity in the region  contributed to higher loe 
in egypt  higher workover activity on the khalda  south umbarka and east bahariya concessions drove up loe 
in canada  the increased costs reflect the impact of the fletcher  conoco and burlington acquisitions  which carry higher production costs than our other operations  and increased workover activity  with the heaviest activity at house mountain  hatton  zama and simonette fields 
gathering and transportation costs during  the company adopted emerging issues task force issue  accounting for shipping and handling fees and costs 
prior to adoption  amounts paid to third parties for transportation had been reported as a reduction of revenue instead of an increase in operating expenses 
recent property acquisitions and their associated transportation arrangements have increased the significance of transportation costs paid to third parties 
for comparative purposes  previously reported transportation costs paid to third parties were reclassified as corresponding increases to oil and gas production revenues and operating expenses with no impact on income attributable to common stock 
apache generally sells oil and natural gas under two types of transactions  both of which include a transportation charge 
one is a netback arrangement  under which apache sells oil or natural gas at the wellhead and collects a price  net of transportation incurred by the purchaser 
under the other arrangement  apache sells oil or natural gas at a specific delivery point  pays transportation to a carrier and receives from the purchaser a price with no transportation deduction 
in both the us and canada  apache sells oil and natural gas under both types of arrangements 
in the north sea  apache pays transportation to a carrier and receives a purchase price with no transportation deduction 
in egypt and australia  oil and natural gas are sold under the netback arrangement 
gathering and transportation costs disclosed here only include transportation paid by apache to a carrier 
these costs are primarily related to the transportation of natural gas in our north american operations 
in  these costs totaled million in canada and million in the us  up from million and million in  respectively 
the increase in canada primarily involved higher third party transportation charges for gas transported from several fields and increased production volumes from acquisitions 
canada also incurred transportation charges for crude oil as we began taking our oil in kind and marketing it ourselves instead of selling it at the lease 
the increase in the us is related to the higher production from the gulf of mexico acquisitions 
in the north sea  these costs are related to the transportation of crude oil and totaled million in overall  transportation costs in were relatively flat to severance and other taxes severance and other taxes are comprised primarily of severance taxes on properties onshore and in state or provincial waters in the us and australia 
in both and  these severance taxes  which are generally based on a percentage of oil and gas production revenues  represented over percent of the total severance and other taxes expense incurred 
the other tax component is primarily made up of the australian petroleum resources rent tax prrt  to which apache first became subject in  the petroleum revenue tax prt on the north sea properties and the canadian large corporation tax  saskatchewan capital tax  saskatchewan resource surtax and freehold mineral tax 
oil and gas production revenues generated from egypt  canada and the north sea are not subject to severance taxes 
in  severance and other taxes totaled million million in the us  million in australia  million in the north sea  million in canada and million in argentina 
severance and other taxes increased percent or million 
twenty million dollars of the increase is associated with north sea s prt expense 
canadian taxes increased million as a result of exchange rate increases and higher prices in  and a million refund in us and australia severance taxes increased million and million  respectively  in line with higher production revenues 
in  severance and other taxes totaled million  comprised of us  million  australia  million and canada  million 
overall  severance and other taxes decreased million 
a million decline in us severance taxes  and a million decline in canada saskatchewan resource surtax were partially offset by initial prrt of million and a million increase in australian severance taxes 
the decrease in us severance taxes reflects the impact of lower gas price realizations 
the increase in australia s severance taxes was attributable to higher oil price realizations and a change in production mix as a higher portion of production was from properties in provincial waters  such as legendre and harriet  relative to production from federal waters 
canada s decline was primarily related to a refund of the saskatchewan resource surtax 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses g a of 
per boe for increased 
per boe over absolute costs increased million  or percent 
over million  or percent  is associated with expensing compensation  including stock appreciation rights sars  stock options  restricted stock and incremental incentive compensation  in light of our record year 
the increased stock compensation expense stems from apache s decision to expense stock related compensation plans see note in item of this form k 
approximately million  or percent  of the increase is related to our new north sea operations 
the balance of the increase was related to the company s decision to increase its charitable contributions  expansion of the company s new gas marketing group and transition costs incurred on acquisitions 
overall  general and administrative expenses trended higher in  rising 
to 
per boe 
on an absolute cost basis  thirty eight percent of the increase is tied to rising medical costs  a sharp increase in premiums on business insurance policies renewed subsequent to the september  terrorist attacks and the addition of a sizeable political risk insurance package added in mid the remaining increase is related to non recurring employee separation costs  a consequence of our region realignment in the us  higher outside legal support costs related to arbitration proceedings with our gas marketer  cinergy and litigation with predator see note of this form k  costs associated with the implementation of and compliance with various sections of sarbanes oxley  and a full year of expense related to additional staff and office costs incurred with the acquisition of canadian subsidiaries of fletcher during realignment of our three us regions into two involved both reassignment and reduction of personnel 
all corresponding costs were expensed as incurred 
financing costs  net the major components of net financing costs are interest expense and capitalized interest 
net financing costs increased million compared to with a million increase in expense largely offset by an increase in capitalized interest 
five million dollars of the increase is interest expense related to the write off of unamortized fees triggered by the retirement of preferred interests of subsidiaries discussed below 
the remaining million of higher interest expense was attributable to a higher average debt balance in compared to capitalized interest increased million driven by a higher unproved property balance associated with acquisitions and an active drilling program 
if net financing costs included distributions from preferred interests of subsidiaries  net financing costs would have decreased by approximately million 
net financing costs decreased by five percent in lower average debt outstanding during resulted in a decrease in interest expense of million compared to a reduction in capitalized interest of million  associated with lower unproved property balances  partially offset this decrease 
our weighted average cost of borrowing on december  was percent compared to percent on december  the rate is higher at year end as a lower percentage of our debt is at floating rates  which carry a lower rate than fixed rate debt 
provision for income taxes income tax expense of million was million or percent higher than the the higher taxes were primarily associated with higher income in and  to a lesser extent  a higher effective tax rate 
our effective tax rate increased primarily because of million of additional deferred tax expenses resulting from currency fluctuations 
for a discussion of apache s sensitivity to foreign currency fluctuations  please refer to foreign currency risk under item a of this form k 
the impact caused by currency fluctuations was partially offset by a million reduction in deferred tax expense related to a reduction in canadian federal statutory income tax rates 
our effective tax rate for was percent compared to percent for the prior year

preliminary north american capital expenditures include million in the gulf coast region  million in the central region and million in canada 
the company has estimated its international capital expenditures in at million 
capital expenditures will be reviewed periodically  and possibly adjusted throughout the year in light of changing industry conditions 
cash dividend payments apache paid a total of million in dividends during on its series b preferred stock issued in august dividends on the series c preferred stock were paid through may   when the shares automatically converted to common stock see note  under item of this form k 
common dividends paid during rose percent to million  reflecting the increase in common shares outstanding and the higher common stock dividend rate 
the company has paid cash dividends on its common stock for consecutive years through future dividend payments will depend on the company s level of earnings  financial requirements and other relevant factors 
the company has increased its quarterly cash dividend percent  to six cents per share from five cents per share  effective with the november dividend payment 
capital resources apache s primary needs for cash are for exploration  development and acquisition of oil and gas properties  repayment of principal and interest on outstanding debt and payment of dividends 
the company funds its exploration and development activities primarily through internally generated cash flows and budgets capital expenditures based on projected cash flows 
apache routinely adjusts capital expenditures in response to changes in oil and natural gas prices  drilling and acquisition costs  and cash flow 
the company has historically utilized net cash provided by operating activities  debt  preferred interests of subsidiaries and equity as capital resources to obtain necessary funding for all other cash needs 
net cash provided by operating activities apache s net cash provided by operating activities during totaled billion  an increase of percent from driven by higher oil and gas production revenues partially offset by higher operating expenses 
oil production revenues increased with a percent increase in production and a percent increase in prices 
gas production revenues increased with a percent production increase and a percent price increase 
net cash provided by operating activities during decreased percent to billion from billion in the decrease was driven by lower oil and gas production revenues and slightly higher operating expenses 
oil and gas production revenues fell with a percent decline in gas prices  which was partially offset by a seven percent improvement in oil prices 
the impact of lower gas production was partially offset by rising oil production 
debt at december   apache had outstanding debt of million under its commercial paper program and uncommitted lines of credit and a total of billion of other debt 
this other debt included notes and debentures maturing in the years through based on our current plan for capital spending and projections of debt and interest rates  interest payments on the company s debt for are projected to be million using weighted average balances for floating rate obligations 
on june   apache entered into a new billion global credit facility to replace its existing global and day credit facilities 
the new global credit facility consists of four separate bank facilities a million day facility in the united states  a million five year facility in the united states  a million five year facility in australia  and a million five year facility in canada 
loans under the global credit facility do not require the company to maintain a minimum credit rating 
the five year facilities are scheduled to mature on june  and the day facility is currently scheduled to mature on may  the day facility allows the company the option to convert outstanding revolving loans at maturity into one year term loans 
the company may request extensions of the maturity dates subject to approval of the lenders 
please see note debt of item for a summary of the financial covenants of the global credit facility 
the negative covenants include restrictions on the company s ability to create liens and security interests on our assets with exceptions for liens typically arising in the oil and gas industry  purchase money liens and liens arising as a matter of law  such as tax and mechanics liens  restrictions on apache s ability to merge with another entity  unless the company is the surviving entity  and a restriction on our ability to guarantee the debt of entities not within our consolidated group 
the company has a billion commercial paper program which enables apache to borrow funds for up to days at competitive interest rates 
the commercial paper balances at december  and were classified as long term debt in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as the company has the ability and intent to refinance such amounts on a long term basis through either the rollover of commercial paper or available borrowing capacity under the us five year facility and the day facility 
if the company is unable to issue commercial paper following a significant credit downgrade or dislocation in the market  the company s us five year credit facility and day credit facility are available as a percent backstop 
the weighted average interest rate for commercial paper was percent in and percent in preferred interests of subsidiaries during  several of our subsidiaries issued a total of million million  net of issuance costs of preferred stock and limited partner interests to unrelated institutional investors  adding to the company s financial liquidity 
we paid a weighted average return to the investors of basis points above the prevailing libor interest rate 
these subsidiaries were consolidated in the accompanying financial statements with the million at december  reflected as preferred interests of subsidiaries on the balance sheet 
on september   apache repurchased and retired the preferred interests issued by three of its subsidiaries for approximately million  plus an additional million for accrued dividends and distributions 
the transactions involved the purchase of preferred stock issued by two of the company s subsidiaries for approximately million and the retirement of a limited partnership interest in a partnership controlled by a subsidiary of the company for approximately million 
apache funded the transactions with available cash on hand and by issuing commercial paper under its existing commercial paper facility 
stock transactions on september   our board of directors declared a percent stock dividend payable on january  to shareholders of record on december  as a result  we reclassified approximately million from retained earnings to common stock and paid in capital  which represents the fair market value at the date of declaration of the shares distributed 
no fractional shares were issued and cash payments totaling  were made in lieu of fractional shares 
on may   we completed the mandatory conversion of our series c preferred stock into approximately million common shares 
on december   our board of directors declared a five percent stock dividend payable on april  to shareholders of record on march  as a result  in december  we reclassified approximately million from retained earnings to common stock and paid in capital  which represents the fair market value at the date of declaration of the shares distributed 
in  at the date of the distribution  an additional million was reclassified from retained earnings to common stock and paid in capital 
no fractional shares were issued and cash payments were made in lieu of fractional shares 
on january   we completed a public offering of approximately million shares of common stock  including million shares for the underwriters over allotment option  for net proceeds of million 
on december   we announced that holders of our common stock approved an increase in the number of authorized common shares to million from million in order to complete a previously announced two for one stock split 
the record date for the stock split was december  and the additional shares were distributed on january  liquidity during  we strengthened our financial flexibility and continued to build upon the solid financial performances of previous years 
cash will be required to fund expenditures necessary to offset the inherent declines in production and proven reserves typical in an extractive industry like ours 
future success in growing reserves and production will be highly dependent on capital resources available and our success in acquiring or finding additional reserves 
we believe that cash on hand  net cash generated from operating activities  and unused committed borrowing capacity under our global credit facility will be adequate to satisfy future financial obligations and liquidity needs 
net cash generated from operating activities is a function of commodity prices  which are inherently volatile and unpredictable  production and capital spending 
our business  as with other extractive industries  is a depleting one in which each barrel produced must be replaced or the company  and a critical source of our future liquidity  will shrink  as stated in item  risk factors related to our business and operations 
based on the year end reserve life index  the company s overall decline is approximately nine percent per year 
this projection assumes the capital investment  prices  costs and taxes reflected in our standardized measure in item note  of this form k 
less predictable than production declines from our proved reserves is the impact of constantly changing oil and natural gas prices on cash flows and  therefore  capital budgets 
for these reasons  we only forecast  for internal use by management  an annual cash flow 
these annual forecasts are revised monthly and capital budgets are reviewed by management and adjusted as warranted by market conditions 
longer term cash flow and capital spending projections are neither developed nor used by management to operate our business 
as of december   available borrowing capacity under our global credit facility was billion 
we had million in cash and cash equivalents on hand at december   a decrease from million at the prior year end 
in addition  the ratio of current assets to current liabilities decreased from at the end of last year to at december  we have assumed various financial obligations and commitments in the normal course of operations 
these contractual obligations represent known future cash payments that we are required to make and relate primarily to long term debt  operating leases  pipeline transportation commitments and international commitments 
the company expects to fund these contractual obligations with cash generated from operating activities

b this table does not include the company s pension or postretirement benefit obligations 
see note under item of this form k for further discussion 
apache is also subject to various contingent obligations that become payable only if certain events or rulings were to occur 
the inherent uncertainty surrounding the timing of and monetary impact associated with these events or rulings prevents any meaningful accurate measurement  which is necessary to assess any impact on future liquidity 
such obligations include environmental contingencies and potential settlements resulting from litigation 
apache s management feels that it has adequately reserved for its contingent obligations 
the company has reserved approximately million for environmental remediation 
the company s exposure to other legal contingent liabilities is estimated at less than million and is fully reserved 
the company does not believe it has any material exposure for any contingencies see note under item of this form k 
upon closing of our acquisition of the north sea properties  apache will assume bp s abandonment obligation for those properties and such costs were considered in determining the purchase price 
the purchase of the properties  however  does not relieve bp of its liabilities if apache does not satisfy the abandonment obligation 
although not currently required  to ensure apache s payment of these costs  apache agreed to deliver a letter of credit to bp if the rating of our senior unsecured debt is lowered by both moody s and standard and poor s from the company s current ratings of a and a  respectively 
any such letter of credit would be in an amount equal to the net present value of future abandonment costs of the north sea properties as of the date of any such ratings change 
if apache is obligated to provide a letter of credit  it will expire if either rating agency restores its rating to the present level 
the initial letter of credit amount would be million british pounds million us at december  
this amount represents the letter of credit requirement through march  and will be negotiated annually based on apache s future abandonment obligation estimates 
in addition  under apache s long term oil physical sales contract with bp  related to the bp acquisition  apache may be required to post margin if the mark to market exposure  as defined  exceeds the credit threshold limits 
the outstanding position of the term oil physical sales contract with bp is described in greater detail in note under item of this form k 
the company s future liquidity could be impacted by a significant downgrade of its credit ratings by standard and poor s and moody s  however  we do not believe that such a sharp downgrade is reasonably likely 
the company s global credit facility does not require the company to maintain a minimum credit rating 
the negative covenants associated with our debt are outlined in greater detail within the debt section of our discussion on capital resources above 
in addition  generally under our commodity hedge agreements  apache may be required to post margin or terminate outstanding positions if the company s credit ratings decline significantly 
off balance sheet arrangements apache does not currently utilize any off balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities to enhance liquidity and capital resource positions  or for any other purpose 
any future transactions involving off balance sheet arrangements would be scrutinized and disclosed by the company s management 
future trends apache s strategy is to increase its oil and gas reserves  production  cash flow and earnings through a balanced growth program that involves exploiting our existing asset base  acquiring properties to which we can add incremental value  and investing in high potential exploration prospects 
apache s present plans are to increase worldwide capital expenditures for exploratory and development drilling to approximately billion from billion in we will continue to monitor commodity prices and adjust our capital expenditures accordingly 
we will also continue to evaluate and pursue acquisition opportunities 
exploiting existing asset base apache seeks to maximize the value of our existing asset base by increasing production and reserves while containing operating costs per unit 
in order to achieve these objectives  we rigorously pursue production enhancement opportunities such as workovers  recompletions and moderate risk drilling  while divesting marginal and non strategic properties and identifying other activities to reduce costs 
our acquisitions from bp and shell added to our inventory at a time of high commodity prices 
acquiring properties to which we can add incremental value apache seeks to purchase reserves at appropriate prices by generally avoiding auction processes where we are competing against other buyers 
our aim is to follow each acquisition with a cycle of reserve enhancement  property consolidation and cash flow acceleration  facilitating asset growth and debt reduction 
we evaluate potential purchases on an ongoing basis  but we are very selective 
practically all of our acquisition activity was completed by early july 
we remained in the market during the second half of  but we did not identify any assets that fit our balanced portfolio business model 
we believe attractive assets will be available  as larger energy companies look to shed non core assets 
investing in high potential exploration prospects apache seeks to concentrate its exploratory investments in a select number of international areas and to become the dominant operator in those regions 
we believe that these investments  although generally higher risk  offer potential for attractive investment returns and significant reserve additions 
our international investments and exploration activities are a significant component of our long term growth strategy 
they complement our north american operations  which are more development oriented 
a critical component in implementing our three pronged growth strategy is maintenance of significant financial flexibility 
all three rating agencies have a credit ratings on apache s senior unsecured long term debt  a testament to our conservative financial structure and commitment to preserving a strong balance sheet while building a solid foundation and competitive advantage with which to pursue our growth initiatives 
egyptian receivables deteriorating economic conditions during and in egypt lessened the availability of us dollars  resulting in an additional one to two month delay in receipts from egpc 
while hard currency shortages in egypt could lead to further delays  we did not experience any further delays in it is currently our intention to resolve the delays in egpc s payments prior to incurring the substantial capital expenditures required to develop our deepwater interests in the west mediterranean concession or signing the gas sales agreement provided for by the mou for a minimum of tcf of natural gas over years from such concession 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity risk the major market risk exposure is in the pricing applicable to our oil and gas production 
realized pricing is primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and spot prices applicable to our united states and canadian natural gas production 
prices received for oil and gas production have been and remain volatile and unpredictable 
monthly oil price realizations ranged from a low of per barrel to a high of per barrel during average gas price realizations ranged from a monthly low of per mcf to a monthly high of per mcf during the same period 
based on the company s worldwide oil production levels  a per barrel change in the weighted average realized price of oil would increase or decrease revenues by million 
based on the company s worldwide gas production levels  a 
per mcf change in the weighted average realized price of gas would increase or decrease revenues by million 
if oil and gas prices decline significantly  even if only for a short period of time  it is possible that non cash write downs of our oil and gas properties could occur under the full cost accounting method allowed by the securities exchange commission sec 
under these rules  we review the carrying value of our proved oil and gas properties each quarter on a country by country basis to ensure that capitalized costs of proved oil and gas properties  net of accumulated depreciation  depletion and amortization  and deferred income taxes  do not exceed the ceiling 
this ceiling is the present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves  discounted at percent  plus the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties included in the costs being amortized  net of related tax effects 
if capitalized costs exceed this limit  the excess is charged to additional dd a expense 
the calculation of estimated future net cash flows is based on the prices for crude oil and natural gas in effect on the last day of each fiscal quarter except for volumes sold under long term contracts 
write downs required by these rules do not impact cash flow from operating activities  however  as discussed above  sustained low prices would have a material adverse effect on future cash flows 
we periodically enter into hedging activities on a portion of our projected oil and natural gas production through a variety of financial and physical arrangements intended to support oil and natural gas prices at targeted levels and to manage our overall exposure to oil and gas price fluctuations 
apache may use futures contracts  swaps  options and fixed price physical contracts to hedge its commodity prices 
realized gains or losses from the company s price risk management activities are recognized in oil and gas production revenues when the associated production occurs 
apache does not generally hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes 
as indicated in notes and  under item of this form k  the company entered into several derivative positions in conjunction with the south louisiana acquisition in december and with the acquisition from bp in these positions were entered into to preserve our strong financial position in a period of cyclically high gas and oil prices and were designated as cash flow hedges of anticipated production 
on december   the company had open natural gas derivative positions with a fair value of million 
a percent increase in natural gas prices would change the fair value by million 
a percent decrease in prices would change the fair value by million 
the company also had open oil price swap positions with a fair value of million 
a percent change in oil prices would change the fair value by plus or minus million 
these fair value changes assume volatility based on prevailing market parameters at december  see note under item of this form k for notional volumes associated with the company s derivative contracts 
interest rate risk approximately percent of the company s yearend debt is term debt with fixed interest rates  minimizing the company s exposure to fluctuations in short term interest rates 
at december   the company had million of floating rate debt which is subject to fluctuations in short term interest rates 
a percent change in the floating interest rate approximately basis points on these year end balances  would change annual interest expense  the company did not have any open derivative contracts relating to interest rates at december  or foreign currency risk the company s cash flow stream relating to certain international operations is based on the us dollar equivalent of cash flows measured in foreign currencies 
in australia  gas production is sold under fixed price australian dollar contracts and over half the costs incurred are paid in australian dollars 
the north sea production is sold under us dollar contracts  however  the majority of costs incurred are paid in british pounds 
revenue and disbursement transactions denominated in australian dollars and british pounds are converted to us dollar equivalents based on the exchange rate as of the transaction date 
prior to october   reported cash flow from canadian operations was measured in canadian dollars and converted to the us dollar equivalent based on the average of the canadian and us dollar exchange rates for the period reported 
the majority of apache s debt in canada is denominated in us dollars and  as such  was adjusted for differences in exchange rates at each period end and recorded as revenues and other 
in light of the continuing transformation of the us and canadian energy markets into a single energy market  we adopted the us dollar as our functional currency in canada  effective october  a percent strengthening of the australian and canadian dollars and the british pound as of december  will result in a foreign currency net loss of approximately million 
this is primarily driven from foreign currency effects on the companies deferred tax liability positions in its international operations 
the company did not have any open derivative contracts relating to foreign currencies at december  or forward looking statements and risk certain statements in this report  including statements of the future plans  objectives  and expected performance of the company  are forward looking statements that are dependent upon certain events  risks and uncertainties that may be outside the company s control  and which could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated 
some of these include  but are not limited to  the market prices of oil and gas  economic and competitive conditions  inflation rates  legislative and regulatory changes  financial market conditions  political and economic uncertainties of foreign governments  future business decisions and other uncertainties  all of which are difficult to predict 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves and in projecting future rates of production and the timing of development expenditures 
the total amount or timing of actual future production may vary significantly from reserve and production estimates 
the drilling of exploratory wells can involve significant risks  including those related to timing  success rates and cost overruns 
lease and rig availability  complex geology and other factors can affect these risks 
although apache makes use of futures contracts  swaps  options and fixed price physical contracts to mitigate risk  fluctuations in oil and gas prices  or a prolonged continuation of low prices  may substantially adversely affect the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows
