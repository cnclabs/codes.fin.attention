part i item business general first financial bankshares  inc  a texas corporation  is a financial holding company registered under the bank holding company act of  or bhca 
as such  we are supervised by the board of governors of the federal reserve system  or federal reserve board  as well as several other state and federal regulators 
we were formed as a bank holding company in under the original name f m operating company  but our banking operations date back to  when farmers and merchants national bank opened for business in abilene  texas 
by virtue of a series of reorganizations  mergers  and acquisitions since  we now own  through our wholly owned delaware subsidiary  first financial bankshares of delaware  inc  ten banks  a trust company and a technology operating company  all organized and located in texas 
these subsidiaries are o first national bank of abilene  abilene  texas  o first technology services  inc  abilene  texas  o first financial trust asset management company  national association  abilene  texas  o hereford state bank  hereford  texas  o first national bank  sweetwater  texas  o eastland national bank  eastland  texas  o first financial bank  national association  cleburne  texas  o stephenville bank and trust co  stephenville  texas  o san angelo national bank  san angelo  texas  o weatherford national bank  weatherford  texas  o first financial bank  national association  southlake  texas  and o city national bank  mineral wells  texas 
as described in more detail below  we elected to be treated as a financial holding company in september our service centers are located primarily in north central and west texas 
considering the branches and locations of all our subsidiaries  as of december   we had financial centers across texas  with seven locations in abilene  two locations in cleburne  two locations in stephenville  two locations in san angelo  three locations in weatherford  and one location each in mineral wells  hereford  sweetwater  eastland  southlake  aledo  alvarado  burleson  keller  trophy club  roby  and trent 
information on our revenues  profits and losses and total assets appears in the discussion of our results of operations contained in item hereof 
first financial bankshares  inc we provide management and technical resources and policy direction to our subsidiaries  which enables them to improve or expand their banking services while continuing their local activity and identity 
each of our subsidiaries operates under the day to day management of its own board of directors and officers  with substantial authority in making decisions concerning their own investments  loan policies  interest rates  and service charges 
we provide resources and policy direction in  among other things  the following areas o asset and liability management  o accounting  budgeting  planning and insurance  o capitalization  and o regulatory compliance 
in particular  we assist our subsidiaries with  among other things  decisions concerning major capital expenditures  employee fringe benefits  including pension plans and group medical  dividend policies  and appointment of officers and directors and their compensation 
we also perform  through corporate staff groups or by outsourcing to third parties  internal audits and loan reviews of our subsidiaries 
we provide advice and specialized services for our banks related to lending  investing  purchasing  advertising  public relations  and computer services 
we evaluate various potential financial institution acquisition opportunities and evaluate potential locations for new branch offices 
we anticipate that funding for any acquisitions or expansions would be provided from our existing cash balances  available dividends from subsidiary banks  utilization of available lines of credit and future debt or equity offerings 
services offered by our subsidiary banks each of our subsidiary banks is a separate legal entity that operates under the day to day management of its own board of directors and officers 
each of our subsidiary banks provides general commercial banking services  which include accepting and holding checking  savings and time deposits  making loans  automated teller machines  drive in and night deposit services  safe deposit facilities  transmitting funds  and performing other customary commercial banking services 
effective january   the activities of trust departments of first national bank of abilene  first national bank  sweetwater  stephenville bank and trust co  and san angelo national bank were transferred to our new trust company  first financial trust asset management company  national association 
through this new company  we administer pension plans  profit sharing plans and other employee benefit plans as well as administering estates  testamentary trusts  various types of living trusts  and agency accounts 
we believe that the structure of our new trust company will result in a more effectively managed trust department and provide trust services to customers of our banks that do not currently have trust departments 
in addition  first national bank of abilene  first financial bank  national association  cleburne  san angelo national bank and first financial bank  national association  southlake  texas provide securities brokerage services through arrangements with various third parties 
competition commercial banking in texas is highly competitive  and because we hold less than of the state s deposits  we represent only a minor segment of the industry 
to succeed in this industry  our management believes that our banks must have the capability to compete in the areas of interest rates paid or charged  scope of services offered  and prices charged for such services 
our subsidiary banks compete in their respective service areas against highly competitive banks  thrifts  savings and loan associations  small loan companies  credit unions  mortgage companies  and brokerage firms  all of which are engaged in providing financial products and services and some of which are larger than our subsidiary banks in terms of capital  resources and personnel 
our business does not depend on any single customer or any few customers  the loss of any one of which would have a materially adverse effect upon our business 
although we have a broad base of customers that are not related to us  our customers also occasionally include our officers and directors  as well as other entities with which we are affiliated 
with our subsidiary banks we may make loans to officers and directors  and entities with which we are affiliated  in the ordinary course of business 
we make these loans on substantially the same terms  including interest rates and collateral  as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with other persons 
loans to directors  officers and their affiliates are also subject to numerous restrictions under federal and state banking laws which we describe in greater detail below 
employees with our subsidiary banks we employed approximately full time equivalent employees at march  our management believes that our employee relations have been and will continue to be good 
supervision and regulation both federal and state laws extensively regulate bank holding companies  financial holding companies and banks 
these laws and the regulations promulgated thereunder are primarily intended to protect depositors and the deposit insurance fund of the federal deposit insurance corporation  or fdic  although shareholders may also benefit 
the following information describes particular laws and regulatory provisions relating to financial holding companies and banks 
this discussion is qualified in its entirety by reference to the particular laws and regulatory provisions 
a change in any of these laws or regulations may have a material effect on our business and the business of our subsidiary banks 
bank holding companies and financial holding companies traditionally  the activities of bank holding companies were limited to the business of banking and activities closely related or incidental to banking 
bank holding companies were generally prohibited from acquiring control of any company which was not a bank and from engaging in any business other than the business of banking or managing and controlling banks 
the gramm leach bliley act  which took effect on march   dismantled many depression era restrictions against affiliation between banking  securities and insurance firms by permitting bank holding companies to engage in a broader range of financial activities  so long as certain safeguards are observed 
specifically  bank holding companies may elect to become financial holding companies that may affiliate with securities firms and insurance companies and engage in other activities that are financial in nature or incidental to a financial activity 
thus  with the enactment of the gramm leach bliley act  banks  securities firms and insurance companies find it easier to acquire or affiliate with each other and cross sell financial products 
the act permits a single financial services organization to offer a more complete array of financial products and services than historically was permitted 
a financial holding company is essentially a bank holding company with significantly expanded powers 
under the gramm leach bliley act  among the activities that will be deemed financial in nature for financial holding companies are  in addition to traditional lending activities  securities underwriting  dealing in or making a market in securities  sponsoring mutual funds and investment companies  insurance underwriting and agency activities  activities which the federal reserve board determines to be closely related to banking  and certain merchant banking activities 
the federal reserve board has proposed permitting a number of additional financial activities  but we cannot predict whether any of these additional proposals will be adopted or the form any final rule will take 
we elected to become a financial holding company in september as a financial holding company  we have very broad discretion to affiliate with securities firms and insurance companies  make merchant banking investments  and engage in other activities that the federal reserve board has deemed financial in nature 
in order to continue as a financial holding company  we must continue to be well capitalized  well managed and maintain compliance with the community reinvestment act 
depending on the types of financial activities that we may engage in in the future  under gramm leach bliley s fractional regulation principles  we may become subject to supervision by additional government agencies 
the election to be treated as a financial holding company increases our ability to offer financial products and services that historically we were either unable to provide or were only able to provide on a limited basis 
as a result  we will face increased competition in the markets for any new financial products and services that we may offer 
likewise  an increased amount of consolidation among banks and securities firms or banks and insurance firms could result in a growing number of large financial institutions that could compete aggressively with us 
mergers and acquisitions we generally must obtain approval from the banking regulators before we can acquire other financial institutions 
we must not engage in certain acquisitions if we are undercapitalized 
furthermore  the bhca provides that the federal reserve board cannot approve any acquisition  merger or consolidation that may substantially lessen competition in the banking industry  create a monopoly in any section of the country  or be a restraint of trade 
however  the federal reserve board may approve such a transaction if the convenience and needs of the community clearly outweigh any anti competitive effects 
specifically  the federal reserve board would consider  among other factors  the expected benefits to the public greater convenience  increased competition  greater efficiency  etc 
against the risks of possible adverse effects undue concentration of resources  decreased or unfair competition  conflicts of interest  unsound banking practices  etc banks federal and state laws and regulations that govern banks have the effect of  among other things  regulating the scope of business  investments  cash reserves  the purpose and nature of loans  the maximum interest rate chargeable on loans  the amount of dividends declared  and required capitalization ratios 
national banking associations 
banks that are organized as national banking associations under the national bank act are subject to regulation and examination by the office of the comptroller of the currency  or occ 
the occ supervises  regulates and regularly examines the first national bank of abilene  first national bank  sweetwater  first financial bank  national association  cleburne  eastland national bank  san angelo national bank  weatherford national bank  first financial bank  national association  southlake and city national bank  mineral wells  as well as our new trust company  first financial trust asset management company  national association 
the occ s supervision and regulation of banks is primarily intended to protect the interests of depositors 
the national bank act o requires each national banking association to maintain reserves against deposits  o restricts the nature and amount of loans that may be made and the interest that may be charged  and o restricts investments and other activities 
state banks 
banks that are organized as state banks under texas law are subject to regulation and examination by the banking commissioner of the state of texas 
the commissioner regulates and supervises  and the texas banking department regularly examines  hereford state bank and stephenville bank and trust co 
the commissioner s supervision and regulation of banks is primarily designed to protect the interests of depositors 
texas law o requires each state bank to maintain reserves against deposits  o restricts the nature and amount of loans that may be made and the interest that may be charged  and o restricts investments and other activities 
because our texas chartered banks are members of the fdic  they are also subject to regulation at the federal level by the fdic  and are subject to most of the federal laws described below 
deposit insurance each of our subsidiary banks is a member of the fdic 
the fdic provides deposit insurance protection that covers all deposit accounts in fdic insured depository institutions and generally does not exceed  per depositor 
our subsidiary banks must pay assessments to the fdic under a risk based assessment system for federal deposit insurance protection 
fdic insured depository institutions that are members of the bank insurance fund pay insurance premiums at rates based on their risk classification 
institutions assigned to higher risk classifications ie  institutions that pose a greater risk of loss to their respective deposit insurance funds pay assessments at higher rates than institutions that pose a lower risk 
an institution s risk classification is assigned based on its capital levels and the level of supervisory concern the institution poses to bank regulators 
in addition  the fdic can impose special assessments to cover the costs of borrowings from the us treasury  the federal financing bank and the bank insurance fund member banks 
as of december   the assessment rate for each of our subsidiary banks is at the lowest level risk based premium available 
under the financial institutions reform  recovery  and enforcement act of  or firrea  an fdic insured depository institution can be held liable for any losses incurred by the fdic in connection with the default of one of its fdic insured subsidiaries or any assistance provided by the fdic to one of its fdic insured subsidiaries in danger of default 
default is defined generally as the appointment of a conservator or receiver  and in danger of default is defined generally as the existence of certain conditions indicating that a default is likely to occur in the absence of regulatory assistance 
the federal deposit insurance act  or fdia requires that the fdic review any merger or consolidation by or with an insured bank  or any establishment of branches by an insured bank 
the fdic is also empowered to regulate interest rates paid by insured banks 
approval of the fdic is also required before an insured bank retires any part of its common or preferred stock  or any capital notes or debentures 
insured banks that are also members of the federal reserve system  however  are regulated with respect to the foregoing matters by the federal reserve system 
payment of dividends we are a legal entity separate and distinct from our banking and other subsidiaries 
we receive most of our revenue from dividends paid to us by our delaware holding company subsidiary 
similarly  the delaware holding company subsidiary receives dividends from our bank subsidiaries 
described below are some of the laws and regulations that apply when either we or our subsidiary banks pay dividends 
each state bank that is a member of the federal reserve system and each national banking association is required by federal law to obtain the prior approval of the federal reserve board and the occ  respectively  to declare and pay dividends if the total of all dividends declared in any calendar year would exceed the total of such bank s net profits as defined and interpreted by regulation for that year plus its retained net profits as defined and interpreted by regulation for the preceding two calendar years  less any required transfers to surplus 
in addition  these banks may only pay dividends to the extent that retained net profits including the portion transferred to surplus exceed bad debts as defined by regulation 
our subsidiary banks paid aggregate dividends of approximately million in and approximately million in under the dividend restrictions discussed above  as of december   our subsidiary banks  without obtaining governmental approvals  could have declared in the aggregate additional dividends of approximately million from retained net profits 
to pay dividends  we and our subsidiary banks must maintain adequate capital above regulatory guidelines 
in addition  if the applicable regulatory authority believes that a bank under its jurisdiction is engaged in or is about to engage in an unsafe or unsound practice which  depending on the financial condition of the bank  could include the payment of dividends  the authority may require  after notice and hearing  that such bank cease and desist from the unsafe practice 
the federal reserve board and the occ have each indicated that paying dividends that deplete a bank s capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice 
the federal reserve board  the occ and the fdic have issued policy statements that recommend that bank holding companies and insured banks should generally only pay dividends to the extent that net income is sufficient to cover both cash dividends and rate of earnings retention consistent with capital needs  asset quality and overall financial condition 
no undercapitalized institution may pay a dividend 
affiliate transactions the federal reserve act  the fdia and the rules adopted under these statutes restrict the extent to which we can borrow or otherwise obtain credit from  or engage in certain other transactions with  our depository subsidiaries 
these laws regulate covered transactions between insured depository institutions and their subsidiaries  on the one hand  and their nondepository affiliates  on the other hand 
covered transactions include a loan or extension of credit to a nondepository affiliate  a purchase of securities issued by such an affiliate  a purchase of assets from such an affiliate unless otherwise exempted by the federal reserve board  an acceptance of securities issued by such an affiliate as collateral for a loan  and an issuance of a guarantee  acceptance  or letter of credit for the benefit of such an affiliate 
the covered transactions that an insured depository institution and its subsidiaries are permitted to engage in with their nondepository affiliates are limited to the following amounts in the case of any one such affiliate  the aggregate amount of covered transactions cannot exceed ten percent of the capital stock and the surplus of the insured depository institution  and in the case of all affiliates  the aggregate amount of covered transactions cannot exceed twenty percent of the capital stock and surplus of the insured depository institution 
in addition  extensions of credit that constitute covered transactions must be collateralized in prescribed amounts 
further  a bank holding company and its subsidiaries are prohibited from engaging in certain tie in arrangements in connection with any extension of credit  lease or sale of property or furnishing of services 
finally  when we and our subsidiary banks conduct transactions internally among us  we are required to do so at arm s length 
loans to directors  executive officers and principal shareholders the authority of our subsidiary banks to extend credit to our directors  executive officers and principal shareholders  including their immediate family members and corporations and other entities that they control  is subject to substantial restrictions and requirements under sections g and h of the federal reserve act and regulation o promulgated thereunder  as well as the sarbanes oxley act of these statutes and regulations impose specific limits on the amount of loans our subsidiary banks may make to directors and other insiders  and specified approval procedures must be followed in making loans that exceed certain amounts 
in addition  all loans our subsidiary banks make to directors and other insiders must satisfy the following requirements o the loans must be made on substantially the same terms  including interest rates and collateral  as prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with persons not affiliated with us or the subsidiary banks  o the subsidiary banks must follow credit underwriting procedures at least as stringent as those applicable to comparable transactions with persons who are not affiliated with us or the subsidiary banks  and o the loans must not involve a greater than normal risk of repayment or other unfavorable features 
furthermore  each subsidiary bank must periodically report all loans made to directors and other insiders to the bank regulators  and these loans are closely scrutinized by the regulators for compliance with sections g and h of the federal reserve act and regulation o 
capital bank holding companies and financial holding companies 
the federal reserve board has adopted risk based capital guidelines for bank holding companies and financial holding companies 
the ratio of total capital to risk weighted assets including certain off balance sheet activities  such as standby letters of credit must be a minimum of eight percent 
at least half of the total capital is to be composed of common shareholders equity  minority interests in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries and a limited amount of perpetual preferred stock  less goodwill  which is collectively referred to as tier capital 
the remainder of total capital may consist of subordinated debt  other preferred stock and a limited amount of loan loss reserves 
in addition  the federal reserve board has established minimum leverage ratio guidelines for bank holding companies and financial holding companies 
bank holding companies and financial holding companies that meet certain specified criteria  including having the highest regulatory rating  must maintain a minimum tier capital leverage ratio tier capital to average assets for the current quarter  less goodwill of three percent 
bank holding companies and financial holding companies that do not have the highest regulatory rating will generally be required to maintain a higher tier capital leverage ratio of three percent plus an additional cushion of to basis points 
the federal reserve board has not advised us of any specific minimum leverage ratio applicable to us 
the guidelines also provide that bank holding companies and financial holding companies experiencing internal growth or making acquisitions will be expected to maintain strong capital positions 
such strong capital positions must be kept substantially above the minimum supervisory levels without significant reliance on intangible assets eg  goodwill  core deposit intangibles and purchased mortgage servicing rights 
as of december   our capital ratios were as follows tier capital to risk weighted assets ratio   total capital to risk weighted assets ratio   and tier capital leverage ratio  
banks 
the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of  or fdicia established five capital tiers with respect to depository institutions well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized  and critically undercapitalized 
a depository institution s capital tier will depend upon where its capital levels are in relation to various relevant capital measures  including risk based capital measures  a leverage ratio capital measure and certain other factors 
regulations establishing the specific capital tiers provide that a well capitalized institution will have a total risk based capital ratio of ten percent or greater  a tier risk based capital ratio of six percent or greater  and a tier leverage ratio of five percent or greater  and not be subject to any written regulatory enforcement agreement  order  capital directive or prompt corrective action derivative 
for an institution to be adequately capitalized  it will have a total risk based capital ratio of eight percent or greater  a tier risk based capital ratio of four percent or greater  and a tier leverage ratio of four percent or greater in some cases three percent 
for an institution to be undercapitalized  it will have a total risk based capital ratio that is less than eight percent  a tier risk based capital ratio less than four percent or a tier leverage ratio less than four percent or a leverage ratio less than three percent if the institution is rated composite in its most recent report of examination  subject to appropriate federal banking agency guidelines 
for an institution to be significantly undercapitalized  it will have a total risk based capital ratio less than six percent  a tier risk based capital ratio less than three percent  or a tier leverage ratio less than three percent 
for an institution to be critically undercapitalized  it will have a ratio of tangible equity to total assets equal to or less than two percent 
fdicia requires federal banking agencies to take prompt corrective action against depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements 
under current regulations  we were well capitalized as of december  fdicia generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distribution including payment of a dividend or paying any management fee to its holding company if the depository institution would thereafter be undercapitalized 
an undercapitalized institution must develop a capital restoration plan and its parent holding company must guarantee that institution s compliance with such plan 
the liability of the parent holding company under any such guarantee is limited to the lesser of five percent of the institution s assets at the time it became undercapitalized or the amount needed to bring the institution into compliance with all capital standards 
furthermore  in the event of the bankruptcy of the parent holding company  such guarantee would take priority over the parent s general unsecured creditors 
if a depository institution fails to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan  it shall be treated as if it is significantly undercapitalized 
significantly undercapitalized depository institutions may be subject to a number of requirements and restrictions  including orders to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized  requirements to reduce total assets  and cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent banks 
critically undercapitalized institutions are subject to the appointment of a receiver or conservator 
finally  fdicia requires the various regulatory agencies to set forth certain standards that do not relate to capital 
such standards relate to the safety and soundness of operations and management and to asset quality and executive compensation  and permit regulatory action against a financial institution that does not meet such standards 
if an insured bank fails to meet its capital guidelines  it may be subject to a variety of other enforcement remedies  including a prohibition on the taking of brokered deposits and the termination of deposit insurance by the fdic 
bank regulators continue to indicate their desire to raise capital requirements beyond their current levels 
in addition to fdicia capital standards  texas chartered banks must also comply with the capital requirements imposed by the texas banking department 
neither the texas finance code nor its regulations specify any minimum capital to assets ratio that must be maintained by a texas chartered bank 
instead  the texas banking department determines the appropriate ratio on a bank by bank basis  considering factors such as the nature of a bank s business  its total revenue  and the bank s total assets 
as of december   all of our texas chartered banks exceeded the minimum ratios applied to them 
our support of our subsidiary banks under federal reserve board policy  we are expected to commit resources to act as a source of strength to support each of our subsidiary banks 
this support may be required at times when  absent such federal reserve board policy  we would not otherwise be required to provide it 
in addition  any loans we make to our subsidiary banks would be subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to other indebtedness of our banks 
in the event of a bank holding company s bankruptcy  any commitment by the bank holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and be subject to a priority of payment 
under the national bank act  if the capital stock of a national bank is impaired by losses or otherwise  the occ is authorized to require the bank s shareholders to pay the deficiency on a pro rata basis 
if any shareholder refuses to pay the pro rata assessment after three months notice  then the bank s board of directors must sell an appropriate amount of the shareholder s stock at a public auction to make up the deficiency 
to the extent necessary  if a deficiency in capital still exists and the bank refuses to go into liquidation  then a receiver may be appointed to wind up the bank s affairs 
additionally  under the federal deposit insurance act  in the event of a loss suffered or anticipated by the fdic either as a result of the default of a banking subsidiary or related to fdic assistance provided to a subsidiary in danger of default our other banking subsidiaries may be assessed for the fdic s loss 
interstate banking and branching act pursuant to the riegle neal interstate banking and branching efficiency act of  or riegle neal act  a bank holding company or financial holding company is able to acquire banks in states other than its home state 
the riegle neal act also authorized banks to merge across state lines  thereby creating interstate branches  beginning june  furthermore  under this act  a bank is now able to open new branches in a state in which it does not already have banking operations  if the laws of such state permit it to do so 
accordingly  both the occ and the texas banking department accept applications for interstate merger and branching transactions  subject to certain limitations on ages of the banks to be acquired and the total amount of deposits within the state a bank or financial holding company may control 
since our primary service area is texas  we do not expect that the ability to operate in other states will have any material impact on our growth strategy 
we may  however  face increased competition from out of state banks that branch or make acquisitions in our primary markets in texas 
community reinvestment act of the community reinvestment act of  or cra subjects a bank to regulatory assessment to determine if the institution meets the credit needs of its entire community  including low and moderate income neighborhoods served by the bank  and to take that determination into account in its evaluation of any application made by such bank for  among other things  approval of the acquisition or establishment of a branch or other deposit facility  an office relocation  a merger  or the acquisition of shares of capital stock of another financial institution 
the regulatory authority prepares a written evaluation of an institution s record of meeting the credit needs of its entire community and assigns a rating 
we believe our subsidiary banks have taken significant actions to comply with the cra  and each has received at least a satisfactory commendation in its most recent review by federal regulators with respect to its compliance with the cra 
monitoring and reporting suspicious activity under the bank secrecy act  irs rules and other regulations  we are required to monitor and report unusual or suspicious account activity as well as transactions involving the transfer or withdrawal of amounts in excess of prescribed limits 
in the wake of the tragic events of september th  on october   the president signed the uniting and strengthening america by providing appropriate tools required to intercept and obstruct terrorism  or usa patriot act  of under the usa patriot act  financial institutions are subject to prohibitions against specified financial transactions and account relationships as well as enhanced due diligence and know your customer standards in their dealings with foreign financial institutions and foreign customers 
for example  the enhanced due diligence policies  procedures  and controls generally require financial institutions to take reasonable steps o to conduct enhanced scrutiny of account relationships to guard against money laundering and report any suspicious transaction  o to ascertain the identity of the nominal and beneficial owners of  and the source of funds deposited into  each account as needed to guard against money laundering and report any suspicious transactions  o to ascertain for any foreign bank  the shares of which are not publicly traded  the identity of the owners of the foreign bank  and the nature and extent of the ownership interest of each such owner  and o to ascertain whether any foreign bank provides correspondent accounts to other foreign banks and  if so  the identity of those foreign banks and related due diligence information 
under the usa patriot act  financial institutions are also required to establish anti money laundering programs 
the usa patriot act sets forth minimum standards for these programs  including o the development of internal policies  procedures  and controls  o the designation of a compliance officer  o an ongoing employee training program  and o an independent audit function to test the programs 
in addition  the usa patriot act also requires the secretary of the treasury to adopt rules addressing a number of related issues  including increasing the cooperation and information sharing between financial institutions  regulators  and law enforcement authorities regarding individuals  entities and organizations engaged in  or reasonably suspected based on credible evidence of engaging in  terrorist acts or money laundering activities 
any financial institution complying with these rules will not be deemed to violate the privacy provisions of the gramm leach bliley act that are discussed below 
finally  under the regulations of the office of foreign asset control  we are required to monitor and block transactions with certain specially designated nationals who ofac has determined pose a risk to us national security 
consumer laws and regulations we are also subject to certain consumer laws and regulations that are designed to protect consumers in transactions with banks 
while the following list is not exhaustive  these laws and regulations include the truth in lending act  the truth in savings act  the electronic funds transfer act  the expedited funds availability act  the equal credit opportunity act  and the fair housing act  among others 
these laws and regulations among other things prohibit discrimination on the basis of race  gender or other designated characteristics and mandate various disclosure requirements and regulate the manner in which financial institutions must deal with customers when taking deposits or making loans to such customers 
these and other laws also limit finance charges or other fees or charges earned in our activities 
we must comply with the applicable provisions of these consumer protection laws and regulations as part of our ongoing customer relations 
technology risk management and consumer privacy state and federal banking regulators have issued various policy statements emphasizing the importance of technology risk management and supervision in evaluating the safety and soundness of depository institutions with respect to banks that contract with outside vendors to provide data processing and core banking functions 
the use of technology related products  services  delivery channels and processes expose a bank to various risks  particularly operational  privacy  security  strategic  reputation and compliance risk 
banks are generally expected to prudently manage technology related risks as part of their comprehensive risk management policies by identifying  measuring  monitoring and controlling risks associated with the use of technology 
under section of the gramm leach bliley act  the federal banking agencies have established appropriate standards for financial institutions regarding the implementation of safeguards to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer records and information  protection against any anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of such records and protection against unauthorized access to or use of such records or information in a way that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to a customer 
among other matters  the rules require each bank to implement a comprehensive written information security program that includes administrative  technical and physical safeguards relating to customer information 
under the gramm leach bliley act  a financial institution must also provide its customers with a notice of privacy policies and practices 
section prohibits a financial institution from disclosing nonpublic personal information about a consumer to nonaffiliated third parties unless the institution satisfies various notice and opt out requirements and the customer has not elected to opt out of the disclosure 
under section  the agencies are authorized to issue regulations as necessary to implement notice requirements and restrictions on a financial institution s ability to disclose nonpublic personal information about consumers to nonaffiliated third parties 
under the final rule the regulators adopted  all banks must develop initial and annual privacy notices which describe in general terms the bank s information sharing practices 
banks that share nonpublic personal information about customers with nonaffiliated third parties must also provide customers with an opt out notice and a reasonable period of time for the customer to opt out of any such disclosure with certain exceptions 
limitations are placed on the extent to which a bank can disclose an account number or access code for credit card  deposit  or transaction accounts to any nonaffiliated third party for use in marketing 
monetary policy banks are affected by the credit policies of other monetary authorities  including the federal reserve board  that affect the national supply of credit 
the federal reserve board regulates the supply of credit in order to influence general economic conditions  primarily through open market operations in united states government obligations  varying the discount rate on financial institution borrowings  varying reserve requirements against financial institution deposits  and restricting certain borrowings by financial institutions and their subsidiaries 
the monetary policies of the federal reserve board have had a significant effect on the operating results of banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future 
pending and proposed legislation new regulations and statutes are regularly proposed containing wide ranging proposals for altering the structures  regulations and competitive relationships of financial institutions operating in the united states 
we cannot predict whether or in what form any proposed regulation or statute will be adopted or the extent to which our business may be affected by any new regulation or statute 
enforcement powers of federal banking agencies the federal reserve and other state and federal banking agencies and regulators have broad enforcement powers  including the power to terminate deposit insurance  issue cease and desist orders  impose substantial fees and other civil and criminal penalties and appoint a conservator or receiver 
our failure to comply with applicable laws  regulations and other regulatory pronouncements could subject us  as well as our officers and directors  to administrative sanctions and potentially substantial civil penalties

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction as a multi bank financial holding company  we generate most of our revenue from interest on loans and investments  trust fees  and service charges 
our primary source of funding for our loans are deposits we hold in our subsidiary banks 
our largest expenses are interest on these deposits and salaries and related employee benefits 
we usually measure our performance by calculating our return on average assets  return on average equity  our regulatory leverage and risk based capital ratios  and our efficiency ratio  which is calculated by dividing non interest expense by the sum of net interest income on a tax equivalent basis and non interest income 
you should read the following discussion and analysis of the major elements of our consolidated balance sheets as of december  and  and consolidated statements of earnings for the years through in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements  accompanying notes  and selected financial data presented elsewhere in this form k 
all prices and per share data related to our common stock have been adjusted to give effect to all stock splits and stock dividends  including the five for four stock split in the form of a stock dividend effective june  for shareholders of record on may  critical accounting policies we prepare consolidated financial statements based on the selection of certain accounting policies  generally accepted accounting principles and customary practices in the banking industry 
these policies  in certain areas  require us to make significant estimates and assumptions 
we deem a policy critical if the accounting estimate required us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time we make the accounting estimate  and different estimates that reasonably could have been used in the current period  or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  would have a material impact on the financial statements 
the following discussion addresses our allowance for loan loss and its provision for loan losses  which we deem to be our most critical accounting policy 
we have other significant accounting policies and continue to evaluate the materiality of their impact on our consolidated financial statements  but we believe that these other policies either do not generally require us to make estimates and judgments that are difficult or subjective  or it is less likely that they would have a material impact on our reported results for a given period 
the allowance for loan losses is an amount that we believe will be adequate to absorb inherent estimated losses on existing loans in which full collectibility is unlikely based upon our review and evaluation of the loan portfolio  including letters of credit  lines of credit and unused commitments to provide financing 
the allowance for loan losses is increased by charges to income and decreased by charge offs net of recoveries 
our periodic evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance is based on general economic conditions  the financial condition of the borrower  the value and liquidity of collateral  delinquency  prior loan loss experience  and the results of periodic reviews of the portfolio by our independent loan review department and regulatory examiners 
we have developed a consistent  well documented loan review methodology that includes allowances assigned to specific loans and nonspecific allowances  which are based on the factors noted in the prior sentence 
while each subsidiary bank is responsible for the adequacy of its allowance  our independent loan review department is responsible for reviewing this evaluation for all of our subsidiary banks to ensure consistent methodology and overall adequacy for us 
although we believe that we use the best information available to make loan loss allowance determinations  future adjustments could be necessary if circumstances or economic conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in making our initial determinations 
a downturn in the economy and employment could result in increased levels of nonperforming assets and charge offs  increased loan loss provisions and reductions in income 
additionally  as an integral part of their examination process  bank regulatory agencies periodically review our allowance for loan losses 
the bank regulatory agencies could require the recognition of additions to the loan loss allowance based on their judgment of information available to them at the time of their examination 
accrual of interest is discontinued on a loan when management believes  after considering economic and business conditions and collection efforts  that the borrower s financial condition is such that collection of interest is doubtful 
our policy requires measurement of the allowance for an impaired collateral dependent loan based on the fair value of the collateral 
other loan impairments are measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows or the loan s observable market price

net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between interest income on earning assets and interest expense on liabilities incurred to fund those assets 
our earning assets consist primarily of loans and investment securities 
our liabilities to fund those assets consist primarily of noninterest bearing and interest bearing deposits 
tax equivalent net interest income was million in as compared to million in and million in the decrease in compared to was the result of declining net interest spreads offset by increases in volume of earning assets 
in  the increase over was primarily due to the growth in the volume of earning assets and an improved net interest spread 
average earning assets were billion in  as compared to billion in and billion in the increase in average earning assets is attributable to a larger volume of investment securities we held  which increased million  and a larger volume of loans we made  which increased million 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in the average of short term investments  which consist primarily of federal funds sold 
the increase in average earning assets was attributable to higher average investment securities we held  which increased million  and higher average loans we made  which increased million

effective january   we froze our pension plan whereby no additional service costs will accrue in the future unless the pension plan is reinstated 
under current generally accepted accounting principles and utilizing current assumptions  we do not expect any significant pension costs in and beyond as a result of this action

the allowance for loan losses is the amount we determine as of a specific date to be adequate to provide for losses on loans that we deem are uncollectible

the risk based capital rules provide for the weighting of assets and off balance sheet commitments and contingencies according to prescribed risk categories ranging from to 
regulatory capital is then divided by risk weighted assets to determine the risk adjusted capital ratios 
the leverage ratio is computed by dividing shareholders equity less intangible assets by quarter to date average assets less intangible assets

as of december   our total risk based and leverage ratios were and  respectively  as compared to total risk based and leverage ratios of and as of december  we believe by all measurements our capital ratios remain well above regulatory minimums 
interest rate risk 
interest rate risk results when the maturity or repricing intervals of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities are different 
our exposure to interest rate risk is managed primarily through our strategy of selecting the types and terms of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities that generate favorable earnings while limiting the potential negative effects of changes in market interest rates 
we use no off balance sheet financial instruments to manage interest rate risk 
each of our subsidiary banks has an asset liability committee that monitors interest rate risk and compliance with investment policies as well as a holding company wide committee that monitors the aggregate companies interest rate risk and compliance with investment policies 
each subsidiary bank tracks interest rate risk by  among other things  interest sensitivity gap and simulation analysis 
table sets forth the interest rate sensitivity of our consolidated assets and liabilities as of december   and sets forth the repricing dates of our consolidated interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities as of that date  as well as our projected consolidated interest rate sensitivity gap percentages for the periods presented 
the table is based upon our estimates and assumptions as to when assets and liabilities will reprice in a changing interest rate environment 
assets and liabilities indicated as maturing or otherwise repricing within a stated period may  in fact  mature or reprice at different times and at different volumes than those estimated 
also  the renewal or repricing of certain assets and liabilities can be discretionary and subject to competitive and other pressures 
therefore  the following table does not and cannot necessarily indicate the actual future impact of general interest rate movements on our consolidated net interest income 
should we be unable to maintain a reasonable balance of maturities and repricing of our interest earning assets and our interest bearing liabilities  we could be required to dispose of our assets in an unfavorable manner or pay a higher than market rate to fund our activities 
our asset liability committees oversee and monitor this risk

we estimate that  as of december   an upward shift of interest rates by basis points would result in a increase in projected net interest income over the next twelve months  and a downward shift of interest rates by basis points would result in a reduction in projected net interest income over the next twelve months 
these are good faith estimates and assume that the composition of our interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at each year end will remain constant over the relevant twelve month measurement period and that changes in market interest rates are instantaneous and sustained across the yield curve regardless of duration of pricing characteristics of specific assets or liabilities 
also  this analysis does not contemplate any actions that we might undertake in response to changes in market interest rates 
we believe  these estimates are not necessarily indicative of what actually could occur in the event of immediate interest rate increases or decreases of this magnitude 
we also believe that it is unlikely that such changes would occur in a short time period 
as interest bearing assets and liabilities reprice at different time frames and proportions to market interest rate movements  various assumptions must be made based on historical relationships of these variables in reaching any conclusion 
since these correlations are based on competitive and market conditions we anticipate that our future results will likely be different from the foregoing estimates  and such differences could be material 
liquidity liquidity is our ability to meet cash demands as they arise 
such needs can develop from loan demand  deposit withdrawals or acquisition opportunities 
potential obligations resulting from the issuance of standby letters of credit and commitments to fund future borrowings to our loan customers are other factors affecting our liquidity needs 
many of these obligations and commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon  therefore the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements affecting our liquidity position 
the potential need for liquidity arising from these types of financial instruments is represented by the contractual notional amount of the instrument  as detailed in tables and asset liquidity is provided by cash and assets  which are readily marketable or which will mature in the near future 
liquid assets include cash  federal funds sold  and short term investments in time deposits in banks 
liquidity is also provided by access to funding sources  which include core depositors and correspondent banks that maintain accounts with and sell federal funds to our subsidiary banks 
other sources of funds include our ability to sell securities under agreement to repurchase  which amounted to million at december   and an unfunded million line of credit established with a nonaffiliated bank which matures on june  we believe the line of credit will be renewed upon maturity 
given the strong core deposit base and relatively low loan to deposit ratios maintained at our subsidiary banks  we consider our current liquidity position to be adequate to meet our short and long term liquidity needs 
in addition  we anticipate that any future acquisition of financial institutions and expansion of branch locations could also place a demand on our cash resources 
available cash at our parent company which totaled million at december   available dividends from subsidiary banks which totaled million at december   utilization of available lines of credit  and future debt or equity offerings are expected to be the source of funding for these potential acquisitions or expansions

we are a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of our customers 
these financial instruments include unfunded lines of credit commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit 
those instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in our consolidated balance sheets 
our exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparty to the financial instrument for unfunded lines of credit  commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual notional amount of these instruments 
we generally use the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as we do for on balance sheet instruments 
unfunded lines of credit and commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
these commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
we evaluate each customer s creditworthiness on a case by case basis 
the amount of collateral obtained  as we deem necessary upon extension of credit  is based on our credit evaluation of the counterparty 
collateral held varies but may include accounts receivable  inventory  property  plan  and equipment and income producing commercial properties 
standby letters of credit are conditional commitments we issue to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
the credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers 
the average collateral value held on letters of credit usually exceeds the contract amount 
table commitments as of december  in thousands total notional amounts less than over committed year years years years unfunded lines of credit    unfunded commitments to extend credit 
     standby letters of credit   total commercial commitments      we believe we have no other off balance sheet arrangements or transactions with unconsolidated  special purpose entities that would expose us to liability that is not reflected on the face of the financial statements 
parent company funding 
our ability to fund various operating expenses  dividends  and cash acquisitions is generally dependent solely on our own earnings without giving effect to our subsidiaries  cash reserves and funds derived from our subsidiary banks 
these funds historically have been produced by intercompany dividends and management fees that are limited to reimbursement of actual expenses 
we anticipate that our recurring cash sources will continue to include dividends and management fees from our subsidiary banks 
at december   approximately million was available for the payment of intercompany dividends by the subsidiary banks without the prior approval of regulatory agencies 
our subsidiary banks paid aggregate dividends of million in and million in also at december   we had million available under a line of credit with an unaffiliated financial institution 
dividends 
our long term dividend policy is to pay cash dividends to our shareholders of between and of net earnings while maintaining adequate capital to support growth 
the cash dividend payout ratios have amounted to  and of net earnings  respectively  in  and given our current strong capital position and projected earnings and asset growth rates  we do not anticipate any significant change in our current dividend policy 
each state bank that is a member of the federal reserve system and each national banking association is required by federal law to obtain the prior approval of the federal reserve board and the occ  respectively  to declare and pay dividends if the total of all dividends declared in any calendar year would exceed the total of such bank s net profits as defined and interpreted by regulation for that year plus its retained net profits as defined and interpreted by regulation for the preceding two calendar years  less any required transfers to surplus 
in addition  these banks may only pay dividends to the extent that retained net profits including the portion transferred to surplus exceed bad debts as defined by regulation 
to pay dividends  we and our subsidiary banks must maintain adequate capital above regulatory guidelines 
in addition  if the applicable regulatory authority believes that a bank under its jurisdiction is engaged in or is about to engage in an unsafe or unsound practice which  depending on the financial condition of the bank  could include the payment of dividends  the authority may require  after notice and hearing  that such bank cease and desist from the unsafe practice 
the federal reserve board and the occ have each indicated that paying dividends that deplete a bank s capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice 
the federal reserve board  the occ and the fdic have issued policy statements that recommend that bank holding companies and insured banks should generally only pay dividends out of current operating earnings
