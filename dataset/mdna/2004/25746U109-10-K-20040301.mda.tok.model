state regulatory matters electric dominion s electric retail service is subject to regulation by the virginia state corporation commission virginia commission and the north carolina utilities commission north carolina commission 
dominion s electric utility subsidiary holds certificates of public convenience and necessity authorizing it to maintain and operate its electric facilities now in operation and to sell electricity to customers 
however  it may not construct or incur financial commitments for construction of any substantial generating facilities or large capacity transmission lines without the prior approval of various state and federal government agencies 
status of electric deregulation in virginia the virginia electric utility restructuring act virginia restructuring act was enacted in and established a plan to restructure the electric utility industry in virginia 
the virginia restructuring act addressed among other things capped base rates  regional transmission organization rto participation  retail choice  the recovery of stranded costs and the functional separation of a utility s electric generation from its electric transmission and distribution operations 
retail choice has been available to all of dominion s virginia regulated electric customers since january  dominion has also separated its generation  distribution and transmission functions through the creation of divisions within virginia power 
virginia codes of conduct ensure that virginia power s generation and other divisions operate independently and prevent cross subsidies between the generation and other divisions 
since the passage of the virginia restructuring act  the competitive environment has not developed in virginia as anticipated 
in january  legislation supported by the offices of the governor and the attorney general of virginia was submitted to the virginia general assembly that would extend the capped base rates by three and one half years  through december  the bill was supported by dominion and was approved by the virginia senate in late january in addition to extending capped rates  the bill would n lock in dominion s fuel factor until the earlier of july  or the termination of capped rates through virginia commission order  n provide for a one time adjustment of dominion s fuel factor  effective july  through december   with no adjustment for previously incurred over recovery or under recovery of fuel costs and thus would eliminate deferred fuel accounting  and n end wires charges on the earlier of july   or the termination of capped rates  consistent with the virginia restructuring act s original timetable 
other bills were introduced in the virginia house of delegates that would repeal the virginia restructuring act  suspend most of the virginia restructuring act  suspend customer choice  and re impose cost of service rate making 
legislation calling for suspension of the virginia restructuring act s key provisions and a return to the cost of service regulatory methodology was defeated in a house committee in early february 
other measures have been deferred to by a house committee 
until the legislative process is concluded  no assessment can be made concerning future developments

retail access pilot programs in september  the virginia commission approved dominion s application for three proposed electric retail access pilot programs 
the programs were proposed by dominion to stimulate the development of retail electric competition in virginia 
the pilot programs are to run through the remainder of the capped rate period and will make available to competitive service providers up to megawatts of load  with expected participation of more than  customers from a variety of customer classes 
the programs were scheduled to begin in february however in january  dominion asked the virginia commission for an extension in the start of the programs by days so that it may address deregulation legislation under consideration by the virginia general assembly  increased market prices for electricity due to colder weather and reevaluate the size and design of the programs due to the large numbers of volunteers 
in february  the virginia commission granted the day extension 
rate matters virginia in december  the virginia commission approved dominion s proposed settlement of its fuel factor increase of million 
the settlement includes a recovery period for the under recovery balance over three and a half years 
approximately million of the million would be recovered in  million in  million in and million in the first six months of under current virginia law  dominion is permitted to request adjustments to its fuel rates  subject to the virginia restructuring act 
dominion is generally permitted to pass the cost of recoverable fuel and certain purchased power costs to its customers through a fuel factor  to the extent the virginia commission determines after hearing that such costs are prudently incurred 
certain proposed modifications to the timing and scope of fuel adjustments are the subject of proposed legislation in the virginia general assembly which is discussed above in status of electric deregulation in virginia 
north carolina in connection with the north carolina commission s approval of the cng acquisition  dominion agreed not to request an increase in north carolina retail electric base rates until  except for certain events that would have a significant financial impact on dominion s electric utility operations 
fuel rates are still subject to change under the annual fuel cost adjustment proceedings 
in january  the north carolina public staff requested that the north carolina commission initiate an investigation into dominion s north carolina base rates and sought a decrease in base rates 
dominion believes that its base rates are reasonable and intends to respond to the filing  however  dominion cannot predict the outcome of this matter at this time 
gas dominion s gas distribution service is regulated by the public utilities commission of ohio ohio commission  the pennsylvania public utility commission pennsylvania commission and the west virginia public service commission west virginia commission 
status of gas deregulation each of the three states in which dominion has gas distribution operations has enacted or considered legislation regarding deregulation of natural gas sales at the retail level 
ohio ohio has not enacted legislation requiring supplier choice for residential and commercial natural gas consumers 
however  in cooperation with the ohio commission  dominion on its own initiative offers retail choice to customers 
at december   approximately  of dominion s million ohio customers were participating in this open access program 
large industrial customers in ohio also source their own natural gas supplies 
pennsylvania in pennsylvania  supplier choice is available for all residential and small commercial customers 
at december   approximately  residential and small commercial customers had opted for energy choice in dominion s pennsylvania service area 
nearly all pennsylvania industrial and large commercial customers buy natural gas from nonregulated suppliers 
west virginia at this time  west virginia has not enacted legislation to require customer choice in its retail natural gas markets 
however  the west virginia commission has issued regulations to govern pooling services  one of the tools that natural gas suppliers may utilize to provide retail customer choice in the future and has issued rules requiring competitive gas service providers to be licensed in west virginia 
rate matters gas distribution dominion s gas distribution business subsidiaries are subject to regulation of rates and other aspects of their businesses by the states in which they operate pennsylvania  ohio and west virginia 
when necessary  dominion s gas distribution subsidiaries seek general rate increases on a timely basis to recover increased operating costs 
in addition to general rate increases  certain of dominion s gas distribution subsidiaries make routine separate filings with their respective state regulatory commissions to reflect changes in the costs of purchased gas 
these purchased gas costs are generally subject to rate recovery through a mechanism that ensures dollar for dollar recovery of prudently incurred costs 
costs that are expected to be recovered in future rates are deferred as regulatory assets 
the purchased gas cost recovery filings generally cover prospective three month or twelve month periods 
approved increases or decreases in gas cost recovery rates result in increases or decreases in revenues with corresponding increases or decreases in net purchased gas cost expenses 

table of contents ohio in december  the ohio commission approved a joint application filed by dominion and several other ohio natural gas companies for recovery of bad debt expense via a rider known as a bad debt tracker 
the tracker insulates dominion from the effect of changes in bad debt expense  which is affected by the volatility of natural gas prices  weather  and prices charged by competitive retail natural gas suppliers 
the tracker is an adjustable rate that recovers the cost of bad debt in a manner similar to a gas cost recovery rate 
instead of recovering bad debt costs through its base rates  dominion now will recover all bad debt expenses through the bad debt tracker and will remove bad debt from base rates 
annually  dominion will assess the need to adjust the tracker based on the preceding year s actual bad debt expense 
west virginia in august  dominion filed an application with the west virginia commission to increase its purchased gas cost rate by approximately million on an annualized basis  effective for the period january  through october  the increase is in anticipation of higher purchased gas costs expected for that period 
dominion s rate moratorium expired at the end of the application reflects the traditional purchased gas adjustment treatment for dominion s purchased gas costs 
the west virginia commission issued an order setting an interim rate in the fourth quarter of  with a final rate order to be issued in the second quarter of rate matters gas transmission dominion implemented various rate filings  tariff changes and negotiated rate service agreements for its ferc regulated businesses during in all material respects  these filings were approved by ferc in the form requested by dominion and were subject to only minor modifications 
dominion has no significant rate matters pending before ferc at this time 
public utility holding company act of act dominion is a registered holding company under the act 
the act and related regulations issued by the sec govern activities of dominion and its subsidiaries with respect to the issuance and acquisition of securities  acquisition and sale of utility assets  certain transactions among affiliates  engaging in business activities not directly related to the utility or energy business and other matters 
dominion became a registered public utility holding company when it completed the cng acquisition in january the act prohibits registered companies from owning businesses not directly related to utility or other energy operations 
dominion has substantially completed its strategy to exit the core operating business of dominion capital  inc dci  its financial services subsidiary  and continues to seek opportunities to divest the remaining assets 
currently  dominion is required to divest of all remaining dci holdings by january federal energy regulatory commission in november  ferc issued new standards of conduct governing conduct between interstate transmission gas and electricity providers and their marketing function or their energy related affiliates 
the new rule redefines the scope of the affiliates covered by the standards and is designed to prevent transmission providers from giving their marketing functions or affiliates undue preferences 
all transmission providers must be in compliance by june dominion has adopted an implementation plan and will train the appropriate personnel to ensure compliance with the new rules 
other ferc regulations that affect the electric and gas industries are discussed below 
electric under the federal power act  ferc regulates wholesale sales of electricity and transmission of electricity in interstate commerce by public utilities 
dominion s electric utility subsidiary sells electricity in the wholesale market under its market based sales tariff authorized by ferc but does not make wholesale power sales under this tariff to loads located within its service territory 
in february  dominion s electric utility subsidiary received ferc approval of a tariff to sell wholesale power at capped rates based on its embedded cost of generation 
this cost based sales tariff could be used to sell to loads within or outside its service territory 
any such sales would be voluntary 
dominion s sales of natural gas  liquid hydrocarbon by products and oil in wholesale markets are not regulated by ferc 
the virginia restructuring act requires that dominion join an rto  and ferc encourages rto formation as a means to foster wholesale market formation 
dominion and pjm interconnection  llc pjm entered into an agreement in september that provides that  subject to regulatory approval and certain provisions  dominion will become a member of pjm and transfer functional control of its electric transmission facilities to pjm for inclusion in a new pjm south region 
however  in april  virginia enacted legislation that required dominion to file an application with the virginia commission by july  to join an rto and delayed entry into an rto until on or after july  subject to virginia commission approval  dominion would be required to transfer management and control of its electric transmission assets to an rto by january  for additional discussion on this matter  see rto in future issues and other matters in md a 
gas ferc regulates the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce under the natural gas act of and the natural gas policy act of  as amended 
ferc also has jurisdiction over the construction of pipeline and related facilities used in transportation and storage of natural gas in interstate commerce 
competition in the natural gas industry was increased by ferc order  which was issued in ferc order 
table of contents requires transmission pipelines to operate as open access transporters and provide transportation and storage services on an equal basis for all gas suppliers  whether purchased from dominion or from another gas supplier 
dominion s interstate gas transportation and storage activities are conducted in accordance with certificates  tariffs and service agreements on file with ferc 
dominion is also subject to the natural gas pipeline safety act of  which authorizes the establishment and enforcement of federal pipeline safety standards and places jurisdiction of these standards with the department of transportation 
in december  congress enacted the pipeline safety act of  which included new mandates regarding the inspection frequency for interstate and intrastate natural gas transmission and storage pipelines located in areas of high density population where the consequences of potential pipeline accidents pose the greatest risk to people and their property 
the company is currently evaluating its natural gas transmission and storage properties under the final regulations issued in december and is currently assessing the nature and costs of inspection and potential remediation activities at this time 
environmental regulations each operating segment faces substantial regulation and compliance costs with respect to environmental matters 
for discussion of significant aspects of these matters  including current and planned capital expenditures relating to environmental compliance  see environmental matters in future issues and other matters in md a 
additional information can also be found in item legal proceedings and note to the consolidated financial statements 
from time to time dominion may be identified as a potentially responsible party to a superfund site 
the epa or a state can either a allow such a party to conduct and pay for a remedial investigation  feasibility study and remedial action or b conduct the remedial investigation and action and then seek reimbursement from the parties 
each party can be held jointly  severally and strictly liable for all costs 
these parties can also bring contribution actions against each other and seek reimbursement from their insurance companies 
as a result  dominion may be responsible for the costs of remedial investigation and actions under the superfund act or other laws or regulations regarding the remediation of waste 
dominion does not believe that any currently identified sites will result in significant liabilities 
in december  the epa announced plans to propose additional regulations addressing pollution transport from electric generating plants as well as the regulation of mercury and nickel emissions 
these regulatory actions  in addition to revised regulations expected to be issued in to address regional haze  could require additional reductions in emissions from the company s fossil fuel fired generating facilities 
if these new emission reduction requirements are imposed  additional significant expenditures may be required 
the united states congress is considering various legislative proposals that would require generating facilities to comply with more stringent air emissions standards 
emission reduction requirements under consideration would be phased in under a variety of periods of up to years 
if these new proposals are adopted  additional significant expenditures may be required 
the epa has announced the publication of new regulations that govern existing utilities that employ a cooling water intake structure  and whose flow levels exceed a minimum threshold 
as announced  the epa s proposed rule presents several control options 
dominion is evaluating facility information from certain of its power stations 
dominion cannot predict the future impact on its operations at this time 
dominion has applied for or obtained the necessary environmental permits for the operation of its regulated facilities 
many of these permits are subject to re issuance and continuing review 
nuclear regulatory commission all aspects of the operation and maintenance of dominion s nuclear power stations  which are part of the dominion generation segment  are regulated by the nrc 
operating licenses issued by the nrc are subject to revocation  suspension or modification  and the operation of a nuclear unit may be suspended if the nrc determines that the public interest  health or safety so requires 
from time to time  the nrc adopts new requirements for the operation and maintenance of nuclear facilities 
in many cases  these new regulations require changes in the design  operation and maintenance of existing nuclear facilities 
if the nrc adopts such requirements in the future  it could result in substantial increases in the cost of operating and maintaining dominion s nuclear generating units 
the nrc also requires dominion to decontaminate nuclear facilities once operations cease 
this process is referred to as decommissioning  and dominion is required by the nrc to be financially prepared 
for information on dominion s decommissioning trusts  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
interconnections dominion maintains major interconnections with progress energy  american electric power company  inc  pjm west and pjm 
through this major transmission network  dominion has arrangements with these entities for coordinated planning  operation  emergency assistance and exchanges of capacity and energy

table of contents competition deregulation and restructuring in the electric and gas industries continue to create issues that affect or will likely affect the markets where dominion generation and dominion delivery do business  and govern the way these business units and their competitors operate 
the electric power and natural gas industries continue to evolve into a competitive marketplace where energy companies will compete to provide energy and energy services to a broad range of customers 
dominion delivery retail electric distribution as noted earlier  dominion has made retail choice available for all of its virginia regulated electric customers since january  for additional information on electric deregulation in virginia  see status of electric deregulation in virginia 
in north carolina  regulators and legislators have explored the issues related to electric industry restructuring  the development of a competitive  wholesale market and retail competition 
however  to date  there has been no significant activity 
dominion plans to continue to participate actively in both the legislative and regulatory processes to ensure an orderly transition from a regulated environment 
retail gas distribution deregulation is at varying stages in the three states in which dominion s gas distribution subsidiaries operate 
in pennsylvania  supplier choice is available for all residential and small commercial customers 
in ohio  legislation has not been enacted to require supplier choice for residential and commercial natural gas consumers 
however  dominion offers an energy choice program to customers on its own initiative  in cooperation with the ohio commission 
west virginia does not require customer choice in its retail natural gas markets at this time 
see status of gas deregulation for additional information 
dominion energy dominion s large underground natural gas storage network and the location of its pipeline system are a significant link between the country s major gas pipelines and large markets in the northeast and mid atlantic regions and on the east coast 
dominion s pipelines are part of an interconnected gas transmission system which continues to provide local distribution companies  marketers  power generators and industrial and commercial customers the accessibility of supplies nationwide 
dominion competes with domestic and canadian pipeline companies and gas marketers seeking to provide or arrange transportation  storage and other services for customers 
alternative energy sources  such as oil or coal  provide another level of competition 
although competition is based primarily on price  the array of services that can be provided to customers is also an important factor 
the combination of capacity rights held on certain longline pipelines  a large storage capability and the availability of numerous receipt and delivery points along its own pipeline system enables dominion to tailor its services to meet the needs of individual customers 
dominion exploration production dominion conducts exploration and production operations in several major producing basins in the lower states  including the outer continental shelf and deepwater areas of the gulf of mexico and western canada 
competitors range from major  international oil companies to smaller  independent producers 
dominion faces significant competition in the bidding for federal offshore leases and in obtaining leases and drilling rights for onshore properties 
since dominion is the operator of a number of properties  it also faces competition in securing drilling equipment and supplies for exploration and development 
in terms of its production activities  dominion sells most of its deliverable natural gas and oil into short and intermediate term markets 
dominion faces challenges related to the marketing of its natural gas and oil production due to the contraction of participants in the energy marketing industry 
however  dominion owns a large and diverse natural gas and oil portfolio and maintains an active gas and oil marketing presence in its primary production regions  which strengthens its knowledge of the marketplace and delivery options 
dominion generation dominion has a diversified generation portfolio located in the midwest  northeast and mid atlantic regions of the united states 
in virginia and north carolina  dominion s electric utility generation  along with power purchases  is used to serve its utility service area obligations 
revenues for serving this load are based on capped rates  with the majority of fuel costs for both its utility generating fleet and power purchases being recovered through the fuel factor 
subject to market conditions  any generation remaining after meeting system needs is sold outside of dominion s service area 
with respect to its merchant generation fleet  dominion owns and operates three large facilities in the midwest 
these generation plants are all under long term contracts and are therefore largely unaffected by competition 
the majority of dominion generation s remaining merchant assets operates within functioning independent system operators iso 
competitors include other generating assets bidding to operate within the iso 
these isos have clearly identified market rules that ensure the competitive wholesale market is functioning properly 
dominion generation s merchant units have a variety of short and medium term contracts  and also compete in the spot market with other generators to produce any number of products including energy  capacity and operating reserves 
it is difficult to compare various types of generation given the wide range of fuels  fuel procurement strategies  efficiencies  and operating characteristics of the fleet 
table of contents within any given iso 
however  management believes that dominion has the expertise in operations  dispatch and risk management to ensure its merchant fleet remains competitive compared to like assets within the region 
availability of fuel for electric generation dominion uses a variety of fuels to power its electric generation 
these include a mix of both nuclear fuel and fossil fuel as described further below 
nuclear fuel dominion utilizes both long term contracts and short term purchases to support its nuclear fuel requirements 
worldwide market conditions are continuously evaluated to ensure a range of supply options at reasonable prices 
current agreements  inventories and spot market availability are expected to support current and planned fuel supply needs 
additional fuel is purchased as required to ensure optimum cost and inventory levels 
fossil fuel dominion utilizes coal  oil and natural gas in its fossil fuel operations 
dominion generation s coal supply is obtained through long term contracts and spot purchases 
oil and oil fired generation are used primarily to support heavier system generation loads during very cold or very hot weather periods 
system requirements are purchased mainly under short term spot agreements 
dominion uses natural gas as needed throughout the year for dominion s jurisdictional and non jurisdictional generation facilities 
dominion s gas supply is obtained from various sources including purchases from major and independent producers in the southwest and midwest regions  purchases from local producers in the appalachian area  purchases from gas marketers  and withdrawals from dominion s and third party underground storage fields 
firm natural gas transportation contracts capacity exist that allow delivery of gas to our facilities 
dominion s capacity portfolio allows flexible natural gas deliveries to its gas turbine fleet  while minimizing costs 
availability of natural gas for retail distribution dominion is engaged in the sale and storage of natural gas through its operating subsidiaries 
sources of gas supplies for sale to customers are the same as those described in fossil fuel supply above 
dominion continues to purchase volumes from the array of accessible producing basins using its firm capacity resources 
these purchased supplies include appalachian resources in ohio  pennsylvania and west virginia and production from the gulf coast  mid continent and offshore areas 
upon ferc s restructuring of the interstate pipeline business in and  pipelines no longer sell the delivered natural gas commodity  rather  customers provide their own gas supply for wholesale storage and or delivery by the pipelines 
much of the supply is purchased by local distributors  energy marketing companies or end users under seasonal or spot purchase agreements 
dominion s underground storage facilities play an important part in balancing gas supply with sales demand and are essential to servicing the mid atlantic and northeast s large volume of space heating business 
in addition  storage capacity is an important element in the effective management of both gas supply and pipeline transport capacity

table of contents nuclear decommissioning dominion has a total of six licensed  operating nuclear reactors at its surry and north anna plants in virginia and its millstone plant in connecticut 
surry and north anna serve customers of dominion s regulated electric utility operations 
millstone is a non regulated merchant plant with two operating units 
a third millstone unit ceased operations before dominion acquired the plant 
decommissioning represents the decontamination and removal of radioactive contaminants from a nuclear power plant  once operations have ceased  in accordance with standards established by the nrc 
through july  amounts are being collected from ratepayers and placed in trusts and invested to fund the expected costs of decommissioning the surry and north anna units 
as part of its acquisition of millstone  dominion acquired the decommissioning trusts for the three units that were fully funded to the regulatory minimum as of the acquisition date 
currently  dominion believes that the amounts available in the trusts and their expected earnings will be sufficient to cover expected decommissioning costs for the millstone units  without any additional contributions to the trusts 
the total estimated cost to decommission dominion s seven nuclear units is billion based upon site specific studies completed in dominion expects to perform new cost studies in for all units except millstone unit and unit  the current cost estimates assume decommissioning activities will begin shortly after cessation of operations  which will occur when operating licenses expire

introduction dominion is a diversified  fully integrated electric and gas holding company headquartered in richmond  virginia 
dominion concentrates its efforts largely in what dominion refers to as the main to maine region 
in the power industry  main means the mid america interconnected network  which comprises all of illinois and portions of the states of missouri  iowa  wisconsin  michigan and minnesota 
under this strategy  dominion focuses its efforts on the region stretching from main  through its primary mid atlantic service areas in ohio  pennsylvania  west virginia  virginia and north carolina  and up through new york and new england 
the main to maine region is home to approximately of the nation s demand for energy 
operating in all aspects of the energy supply chain positions dominion to optimize the value of its energy portfolio and enhance its return on invested capital 
dominion has the capability to discover and produce gas  store it  sell it or use it to generate power  it can generate electricity to sell to customers in its retail markets or in wholesale transactions 
these capabilities give dominion the ability to produce and sell energy in whatever form it finds most useful and economic 
dominion also operates north america s largest natural gas storage system  which gives it the flexibility to provide supply when it is most economically advantageous to do so 
maintaining and improving dominion s financial condition and flexibility is of paramount importance to its management 
important measures of an entity s financial strength and credit worthiness are the credit ratings assigned by moody s and standard poor s 
dominion resources  inc  and its subsidiaries  virginia electric and power company virginia power and consolidated natural gas company cng  are each rated by those agencies and have ratings that are considered investment grade 
dominion has responded to recommendations by those agencies to reduce the percentage of debt in dominion s overall capital structure by focusing on minimizing incremental debt issuance  delaying certain capital projects and raising capital by issuing equity securities in proportion to debt so as to reduce overall debt to capital 
dominion s businesses are managed along four primary operating segments dominion generation  dominion energy  dominion delivery and dominion exploration production 
these segments  and their composition  reflect changes made to dominion s management structure during the fourth quarter of the contributions to net income by dominion s primary operating segments are determined based on a measure of profit that executive management believes represents the segments core earnings 
as a result  certain specific items attributable to those segments are not included in profit measures evaluated by executive management in assessing segment performance or allocating resources among the segments 
those specific items are reported in the corporate and other segment 
dominion generation includes the generation operations of dominion s electric utility and merchant fleet 
the fuel mix used by these operations is diversified and includes coal  nuclear  gas  oil  hydro and purchased power 
dominion s strategy for its electric generation operations focuses on serving customers in the main to maine region 
its generation facilities are located in virginia  west virginia  north carolina  connecticut  illinois  indiana  pennsylvania and ohio 
in addition  dominion expects to complete the acquisition of the kewaunee power plant located in northeastern wisconsin in the second half of utility generation operations represent dominion generation s primary source of revenue and cash flow 
these operations are sensitive to external factors  primarily weather 
currently  revenue from utility operations largely reflects the capped rates charged to customers in virginia  the majority of its utility customer base 
under virginia s current deregulation legislation  electric rates are capped through mid as rates are capped  changes in dominion generation s operating costs  relative to costs recovered in the capped rates  will impact dominion s earnings 
dominion generation has reduced costs by terminating certain long term power purchase agreements and  based on engineering studies  extended the estimated useful lives of generation assets  reducing the annual depreciation expense for those assets 
currently  legislators in virginia are evaluating the future of electric deregulation in virginia as well as the possibility of extending the capped rates period 

table of contents prices received for electricity generated by its merchant fleet are market based  subjecting dominion generation to risks associated with recovering capital expenditures and absorbing variability in fuel costs 
generally  dominion generation manages these risks by entering into fixed price sales and purchase contracts 
variability in expenses for dominion generation relates primarily to the cost of labor and benefits  fuel consumed and the timing  duration and costs of scheduled outages 
dominion is currently permitted to seek rate recovery for fuel costs associated with utility operations 
dominion energy includes the following operations n a regulated interstate gas transmission pipeline and storage system  serving dominion s gas distribution businesses and other customers in the midwest  the mid atlantic states and the northeast  n a regulated electric transmission system principally located in virginia and northeastern north carolina  n field services operations  representing aggregation of gas supply and related wholesale activities related to appalachian and canadian areas  n a liquefied natural gas unloading and storage facility in maryland  n certain gas production operations located in the appalachian basin and n dominion energy clearinghouse clearinghouse  which is responsible for energy trading  marketing  hedging and arbitrage activities 
dominion energy s revenue and cash flows are derived from both regulated and non regulated operations 
revenue and cash flow provided by regulated electric and gas transmission operations and the liquefied natural gas facility are based primarily on rates established by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc 
variability in revenue and cash flow provided by these businesses results primarily from changes in rates 
variability in expenses relates largely to operating and maintenance expenditures  including decisions regarding use of resources for operations and maintenance or capital related activities 
revenue and cash flow for dominion energy s nonregulated businesses are subject to variability associated with changes in commodity prices 
dominion energy s nonregulated businesses use physical and financial arrangements to hedge this price risk 
certain hedging and trading activities may require cash deposits to satisfy margin requirements 
in addition  reported earnings for this segment reflect changes in the fair value of certain derivatives  these values may change significantly from period to period 
variability in expenses for these nonregulated businesses relates largely to labor and benefits and the costs of purchased commodities for resale and payments under financially settled contracts 
dominion delivery includes dominion s electric and gas distribution systems and customer service operations as well as retail energy marketing activities 
electric distribution operations serve customers in virginia and northeastern north carolina 
gas distribution operations serve residential  commercial and industrial gas sales and transportation customers in ohio  pennsylvania and west virginia 
retail energy marketing activities include the marketing of gas  electricity and related products and services to residential and small commercial customers in the northeast and midwest 
revenue and cash flow provided by electric and gas distribution operations are based primarily on rates established by state regulatory authorities 
variability in dominion delivery s revenue and cash flow relates largely to changes in volumes  which are primarily weather sensitive 
for local gas distribution operations  revenue may vary based upon changes in levels of rate recovery for the costs of gas sold to customers 
such costs and recoveries generally offset and do not materially impact net income 
revenue from retail energy marketing operations may vary in connection with changes in weather and commodity prices as well as the acquisition and potential loss of customers 
variability in expenses results from changes in the cost of purchased gas  routine maintenance and repairs including labor and benefits as well as decisions regarding the use of resources for operations and maintenance or capital related activities  and unplanned damage to property  such as the recent storm related damage caused by hurricane isabel 
for gas distribution operations  dominion is permitted to seek recovery of the cost of gas sold to customers 
dominion exploration production includes dominion s gas and oil exploration  development and production operations 
these operations are located in several major producing basins in the lower states  including the outer continental shelf and deepwater areas of the gulf of mexico  and western canada 
dominion exploration production operates a drilling program focused on low risk development drilling in several proven onshore regions of the united states and western canada  while also maintaining some exposure to higher risk exploration opportunities 
significant development drilling programs are currently underway in west texas  the appalachians and the rocky mountains where dominion exploration production holds sizable acreage positions and operational experience 
while each region provides dominion exploration production with exploration opportunities  most exploratory drilling takes place in the gulf coast region  including the deepwater gulf of mexico 
dominion exploration production maintains an active and ongoing drilling program  participating in net wells during  and replacing approximately percent of its production 
revenue and cash flow provided by exploration and production operations are based primarily on the production and sale of company owned natural gas and oil reserves 
variability in dominion exploration production s revenue and cash flow relates primarily to changes in commodity prices  which are market based  and volumes  which are impacted by numerous 
table of contents factors including drilling success  timing of development projects  as well as external factors such as severe weather 
dominion manages commodity price volatility by hedging a substantial portion of its near term expected production 
variability in dominion exploration production s expenses relates primarily to changes in operating costs and production taxes  which tend to increase and decrease with changes in gas and oil prices and the prevailing cost environment 
commodity price changes place upward or downward pressure on related e p service industry costs  while severance and property taxes move with changes in revenue 
a changing price environment impacts both operating costs and the cost of acquiring  finding and developing natural gas and oil reserves 
corporate and other includes n the operations of dominion capital  inc  a financial services subsidiary dci  which are being divested in accordance with an sec order  n dominion fiber ventures  llc dfv and its subsidiary  dominion telecom  inc dti  a telecommunications business that is being discontinued  n dominion s corporate and other operations  including its services company and n specific items attributable to dominion s operating segments that are reported in corporate and other 
accounting matters critical accounting policies and estimates dominion has identified the following accounting policies  including certain inherent estimates  that as a result of the judgments  uncertainties  uniqueness and complexities of the underlying accounting standards and operations involved  could result in material changes to its financial condition or results of operations under different conditions or using different assumptions 
accounting for derivative contracts at fair value dominion uses derivative instruments to manage its commodity and financial market risks 
in addition  dominion purchases and sells commodity based contracts in the natural gas  electricity and oil markets for trading purposes 
accounting requirements for derivatives and hedging activities are complex  interpretation of these requirements by standard setting bodies is ongoing 
generally  derivatives are reported on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value 
in addition  in and prior years  all energy trading contracts were reported at fair value 
as a result of new accounting requirements beginning in  non derivative trading contracts are no longer reported at fair value 
prior period financial statements were not restated for this change 
changes in the fair value of derivatives that are not designated as accounting hedges are recorded in earnings 
the measurement of fair value is based on actively quoted market prices  if available 
otherwise  dominion seeks indicative price information from external sources  including broker quotes and industry publications 
if pricing information from external sources is not available  measurement involves judgment and estimates 
these estimates are based on valuation methodologies considered appropriate by dominion management 
for individual contracts  the use of different assumptions could have a material effect on the contract s estimated fair value 
in addition  for hedges of forecasted transactions  dominion must estimate the expected future cash flows of the forecasted transactions  as well as evaluate the probability of the occurrence and timing of such transactions 
changes in conditions or the occurrence of unforeseen events could affect the timing of recognition in earnings for changes in fair value of certain hedging derivatives 
use of estimates in goodwill impairment testing dominion is required to test its goodwill for potential impairment on an annual basis  or more frequently if impairment indicators are present 
in performing the test  dominion estimates the fair value of its reporting units by using discounted cash flow analyses and other valuation techniques based on multiples of earnings for peer group companies  as well as analyses of recent business combinations involving peer group companies 
these calculations are dependent on many subjective factors  including management s estimate of future cash flows  the selection of appropriate discount and growth rates  and the selection of peer group companies and recent transactions 
the cash flow estimates used by dominion are based on relevant information available at the time the estimates are made 
however  estimates of future cash flows are highly uncertain by nature and may vary significantly from actual results 
the underlying assumptions and estimates involved in preparing these fair value calculations could change significantly from period to period 
modifications to any of these assumptions  particularly changes in discount rates and changes in growth rates inherent in management s estimate of future cash flows  could result in a future impairment of goodwill 
substantially all of dominion s goodwill is allocated to its generation  energy  delivery and exploration production reporting units 
if the estimates of future cash flows used in the annual test had been lower  the resulting discounted cash flows would have been greater than the carrying values of each of those reporting units  still indicating no impairment was present 
use of estimates in long lived asset impairment testing impairment testing for long lived assets and intangible assets with definite lives is required when circumstances indicate those assets may be impaired 
in performing the impairment test  dominion would estimate the future cash flows associated with individual assets or groups of assets 
impairment must be recognized when the undiscounted estimated future cash flows 
table of contents are less than the related asset s carrying amount 
in those circumstances  the asset must be written down to its fair value  which  in the absence of market price information  may be estimated as the present value of its expected future net cash flows  using an appropriate discount rate 
although cash flow estimates used by dominion are based on relevant information available at the time the estimates are made  estimates of future cash flows are  by nature  highly uncertain and may vary significantly from actual results 
in  reflecting a significant revision in long term expectations for potential growth in telecommunications service revenue  dominion approved a strategy to sell its interest in the telecommunications business 
in connection with this change in strategy  dominion tested the network assets to be sold for impairment  using the revised long term expectations for potential growth 
dominion s assets were determined to be substantially impaired and were written down to fair value 
asset retirement obligations dominion recognizes liabilities for the expected cost of retiring tangible long lived assets for which a legal obligation exists 
these asset retirement obligations aros are recognized at fair value as incurred  and are capitalized as part of the cost of the related tangible long lived assets 
in the absence of quoted market prices  dominion estimates the fair value of its aros using present value techniques  in which estimates of future cash flows associated with retirement activities are discounted using its credit adjusted risk free rate 
aros currently reported on dominion s consolidated balance sheet were measured during a period of historically low interest rates 
the impact on measurements of new aros  using different rates in the future  may be significant 
a significant portion of dominion s aros relates to the future decommissioning of its nuclear facilities 
at december   nuclear decommissioning aros totaled billion  which represented approximately of dominion s total aros 
based on their significance  the following discussion of critical assumptions inherent in determining the fair value of aros relates to those associated with dominion s nuclear decommissioning obligations 
dominion obtains from third party experts periodic site specific base year cost studies in order to estimate the nature  cost and timing of planned decommissioning activities for its utility nuclear plants 
dominion uses internal cost studies for its merchant nuclear facility based on similar methods 
these cost studies are based on relevant information available at the time they are performed  however  estimates of future cash flows for extended periods are by nature highly uncertain and may vary significantly from actual results 
in addition  these cost estimates are dependent on subjective factors  including the selection of cost escalation rates  which dominion considers to be a critical assumption 
dominion determines cost escalation rates  which represent projected cost increases over time  due to both general inflation and increases in the cost of specific decommissioning activities  for each of its nuclear facilities 
the weighted average cost escalation used by dominion was 
the use of alternative rates would have been material to the liabilities recognized 
for example  had dominion increased the cost escalation rate by to  the amount recognized as of december  for its aros related to nuclear decommissioning would have been million higher 
employee benefit plans dominion sponsors noncontributory defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans for eligible active employees  retirees and qualifying dependents 
the costs of providing benefits under these plans are dependent  in part  on historical information such as employee demographics  the level of contributions made to the plans and earnings on plan assets 
assumptions about the future  including the expected rate of return on plan assets  discount rates applied to benefit obligations  rate of compensation increase and the anticipated rate of increase in health care costs  also have a significant impact on employee benefit costs 
the impact on pension and other postretirement benefit plan obligations associated with changes in these factors is generally recognized in the consolidated statements of income over the remaining average service period of plan participants rather than immediately 
the selection of discount rates and expected long term rates of return on plan assets are critical assumptions 
dominion determines the expected long term rates of return on plan assets for pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans by using a combination of n historical return analysis to determine expected future risk premiums  n forward looking return expectations derived from the yield on long term bonds and the price earnings ratios of major stock market indices  n expected inflation and risk free interest rate assumptions and n the types of investments expected to be held by the plans 
assisted by an independent actuary  management develops assumptions  which are then compared to the forecasts of other independent investment advisors to ensure reasonableness 
an internal committee selects the final assumptions 
discount rates are determined from analyses performed by a third party actuarial firm of aa aa rated bonds with cash flows matching the expected payments to be made under dominion s plans 

table of contents the following table illustrates the effect of changing the critical actuarial assumptions discussed above increase in net periodic cost actuarial assumption change in assumption pension benefits other postretirement benefits millions discount rate rate of return on plan assets healthcare cost trend rate n a accounting for regulated operations methods of allocating costs to accounting periods for operations subject to federal or state cost of service rate regulation may differ from accounting methods generally applied by nonregulated companies 
when the timing of cost recovery prescribed by regulatory authorities differs from the timing of expense recognition used for accounting purposes  dominion s consolidated financial statements may recognize a regulatory asset for expenditures that otherwise would be expensed 
regulatory assets represent probable future revenue associated with certain costs that will be recovered from customers through rates 
regulatory liabilities represent probable future reductions in revenue associated with expected customer credits through rates or amounts collected from customers for expenditures not yet incurred 
management makes assumptions regarding the probability of regulatory asset recovery through future rates approved by applicable regulatory authorities 
the expectations of future recovery are generally based on orders issued by regulatory commissions or historical experience  as well as discussions with applicable regulatory authorities 
if recovery of regulatory assets is determined to be less than probable  they would be expensed in the period such assessment is made 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
accounting for gas and oil operations dominion follows the full cost method of accounting for gas and oil exploration and production activities prescribed by the sec 
under the full cost method  all direct costs of property acquisition  exploration and development activities are capitalized and subsequently depreciated using a unit of production method 
the depreciable base of costs includes estimated future costs to be incurred in developing proved gas and oil reserves  as well as capitalized asset retirement costs  net of projected salvage values 
the calculations under this accounting method are dependent on engineering estimates of proved reserve quantities and estimates of the amount and timing of future expenditures to develop the proved reserves 
proved reserves  and the cash flows related to these reserves  are estimated based on a combination of historical data and expected future activity 
actual reserve quantities and development expenditures may differ from the forecasted amounts 
in addition  dominion has significant investments in unproved properties  which are initially excluded from the depreciable base 
until the properties are evaluated  a ratable portion of the capitalized costs is periodically reclassified to the depreciable base  determined on a property by property basis  over terms of underlying leases 
once a property has been evaluated  any remaining capitalized costs are then transferred to the depreciable base 
capitalized costs in the depreciable base are subject to a ceiling test prescribed by the sec 
the test limits capitalized amounts to a ceiling the present value of estimated future net revenues to be derived from the production of proved gas and oil reserves assuming period end hedge adjusted prices 
dominion performs the ceiling test quarterly  on a country by country basis  and would recognize asset impairments to the extent that total capitalized costs exceed the ceiling 
any impairment of excess gas and oil property costs over the ceiling is charged to operations 
given the volatility of natural gas and oil prices  it is possible that dominion s estimate of discounted future net cash flows from proved natural gas and oil reserves could change in the near term 
if natural gas or oil prices have declined as of the date of the ceiling test  or if dominion revises its estimates of the quantities or timing of future production from its proved reserves  recognition of natural gas and oil property impairments could occur 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
accounting for retained interests from securitizations securitizations involve selling loans to qualifying unconsolidated trusts in exchange for cash and retained interests 
retained interests may include unsecured debt of the trust or retained interests in the transferred loans 
dominion holds retained interests from mortgage and commercial loans securitized in prior years and classifies them as available for sale investments  carried on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value 
quarterly  dominion evaluates the key assumptions relating to valuing the retained interests 
those key assumptions include loan prepayment speeds  credit losses  forward yield curves and discount rates 
using a published forward yield curve  cash flows  net of adjustments for expected credit losses and loan prepayments  are discounted to determine the estimated fair value of the retained interests 
loan prepayment speeds and credit loss assumptions are based on actual historical results and future estimates 
the discount rate is risk adjusted and is periodically compared to industry averages and recent or similar transactions for reasonableness 
changes in interest rates will result in a change in the forward yield curve and can result in a change in the assumed amount of loan prepayments 
changes in general economic conditions may impact actual credit losses  thus impacting the credit loss assumption used in dominion s quarterly evaluation 
income from the residual interests is reported as other revenue 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of impairment charges recorded in  and 
table of contents newly adopted accounting standards in during  dominion was required to adopt several new accounting standards which affect the comparability of its consolidated financial statements 
the requirements of those standards are discussed in notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
the following discussion is presented to provide an understanding of the financial statement impacts of those standards when comparing the consolidated financial statements to prior years 
sfas no 
adopting statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  on january   affected the comparability of dominion s consolidated financial statements to those of prior years as follows n recognition of asset retirement obligations of billion compared to a liability of billion that had been previously recorded for nuclear decommissioning  n recognition of million of capitalized asset retirement costs in property  plant and equipment and a million increase in accumulated depreciation  depletion and amortization  representing the depreciation of such costs through december   n beginning in  accretion of the aros  including nuclear decommissioning  is reported in other operations and maintenance expense 
previously  expenses associated with the provision for nuclear decommissioning were reported in depreciation expense and in other expense  as described below and n beginning in  realized and unrealized earnings of trusts available for funding decommissioning activities at dominion s utility nuclear plants are recorded in other income and other comprehensive income  as appropriate 
previously  as permitted by regulatory authorities  these earnings were recorded in other income with an offsetting charge to expense  also recorded in other income  for the accretion of the decommissioning liability 
eitf and eitf the adoption of emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 issues involved in accounting for derivative contracts held for trading purposes and contracts involved in energy trading and risk management activities and the related eitf  reporting realized gains and losses on derivative instruments that are subject to fasb statement no 
and not held for trading purposes as defined in issue no 
 changed the timing of recognition in earnings for certain clearinghouse energy related contracts  as well as the financial statement presentation of gains and losses associated with energy related contracts 
the consolidated statements of income for and were not restated 
prior to  all energy trading contracts  including non derivative contracts  were recorded at fair value with changes in fair value and settlements reported in revenue on a net basis 
specifically  adopting eitf and eitf affected the comparability of dominion s consolidated financial statements to those of prior years as follows n for derivative contracts not held for trading purposes that involve physical delivery of commodities  unrealized gains and losses and settlements on sales contracts are presented in revenue  while unrealized gains and losses and settlements on purchase contracts are reported in expenses and n non derivative energy related contracts  previously subject to fair value accounting under prior accounting guidance  are no longer subject to fair value accounting 
dominion recognizes revenue or expense on a gross basis at the time of contract performance  settlement or termination 
fin r upon adoption of fasb interpretation no 
revised december  consolidation of variable interest entities  fin r on december  with respect to special purpose entities  dominion was required to consolidate certain variable interest lessor entities through which dominion had financed and leased several new power generation projects  as well as its corporate headquarters and aircraft 
as a result  the consolidated balance sheet as of december  reflects an additional million in net property  plant and equipment and deferred charges and million of related debt 
in addition  under fin r  dominion reports its junior subordinated notes held by five capital trusts as long term debt  rather than the trust preferred securities issued by those trusts 
at december   dominion consolidated the trusts and reported the trust preferred securities on its consolidated balance sheet

dominion earned per diluted share on net income of million  a decrease of per diluted share and  million 
the per share decrease includes approximately of share dilution  reflecting an increase in the average number of common shares outstanding during the combined net income contribution of dominion s primary operating segments increased million in this increase largely reflects the benefits of higher natural gas prices during on sales of dominion s gas and oil production as well as margins associated with gas trading activities 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for information about dominion s operating segments 
this increased contribution by the operating segments was more than offset by significant specific charges recognized in and reported in the corporate and other segment  including n million of after tax losses associated with dominion s telecommunications business  which is being discontinued  n million of after tax incremental expenses associated with hurricane isabel  n million of after tax charges for dci asset impairments  n million of after tax charges for asset impairments related to certain investments held for sale  n million of after tax charges associated with the termination of long term power purchase agreements and the restructuring of power sales agreements and n million of after tax severance costs for workforce reductions

selected information energy trading activities as previously described  dominion energy manages dominion s energy trading  hedging and arbitrage activities through the clearinghouse 
dominion believes these operations complement its integrated energy businesses and facilitate its risk management activities 
as part of these operations  the clearinghouse enters into contracts for purchases and sales of energy related commodities  including natural gas  electricity  and oil 
settlements of contracts may require physical delivery of the underlying commodity or cash settlement 
the clearinghouse enters into contracts with the objective of benefiting from changes in prices 
for example  after entering into a contract to purchase a commodity  the clearinghouse typically enters into a sales contract  or a combination of sales contracts  with quantities and delivery or settlement terms that are identical or very similar to those of the purchase contract 
when the purchase and sales contracts are settled either by physical delivery of the underlying commodity or by net cash settlement  the clearinghouse may receive a net cash margin a realized gain  or may pay a net cash margin a realized loss 
clearinghouse management continually monitors its contract positions  considering location and timing of delivery or settlement for each energy commodity in relation to market price activity  seeking arbitrage opportunities 
in addition  the clearinghouse held a portfolio of financial derivative instruments to manage dominion s price risk associated with a portion of its anticipated sales of natural gas production that had not been considered in the hedging activities of the dominion exploration production segment economic hedges 
for the year ended december   dominion energy recognized a net loss of million on the economic hedges 
as anticipated  dominion exploration production sold sufficient volumes of natural gas in at market prices  which  when combined with the settlement of the economic hedges  resulted in a range of prices for those sales contemplated by the risk management strategy

short term cash requirements not met by cash provided by operating activities are generally satisfied with proceeds from short term borrowings 
long term cash needs are met through sales of securities and additional long term financing 
at december   dominion had cash and cash equivalents of million with million of unused capacity under its credit facilities 
for long term financing needs  amounts available for debt or equity offerings under currently effective shelf registrations totaled billion at march cash provided by operations as presented on dominion s consolidated statements of cash flows  net cash flows from operating activities were billion for each of the years  and dominion s management believes that its operations provide a stable source of cash flow sufficient to contribute to planned levels of capital expenditures and maintain or grow current shareholder dividend levels 
dominion s operations are subject to risks and uncertainties that may negatively impact the timing or amounts of operating cash flow  including n unusual weather and its effect on energy sales to customers and energy commodity prices  n extreme weather events that could disrupt gas and oil production or cause catastrophic damage to dominion s electric distribution and transmission systems  n exposure to unanticipated changes in prices for energy commodities purchased or sold  including the effect on derivative instruments that may require the use of funds to post margin deposits with counterparties  n effectiveness of dominion s risk management activities and underlying assessment of market conditions and related factors  including energy commodity prices  basis  liquidity  volatility  counterparty credit risk  availability of generation and transmission capacity  currency exchange rates and interest rates  n the cost of replacement electric energy in the event of longer than expected or unscheduled generation outages  n contractual or regulatory restrictions on transfers of funds among dominion and its subsidiaries  and n timeliness of recovery for costs subject to cost of service utility rate regulation

cash provided by financing activities dominion resources  inc  virginia electric and power company virginia power and cng collectively the dominion companies rely on bank and capital markets as a significant source of funding for capital requirements not satisfied by cash provided by the companies operations 
as discussed further in the credit ratings section below  the dominion companies ability to borrow funds or issue securities and the return demanded by investors are affected by the issuing company s credit ratings 
in addition  the raising of external capital is subject to certain regulatory approvals  including authorization by the sec and  in the case of virginia power  the virginia state corporation commission virginia commission 
during  and  net cash flows from financing activities were million  billion and billion  respectively 
during  the dominion companies issued long term debt net of exchanged debt and common stock totaling approximately billion 
the proceeds were used primarily to repay other debt and to finance capital expenditures 
credit facilities and short term debt the dominion companies use short term debt  primarily commercial paper  to fund working capital requirements and as bridge financing for acquisitions  if applicable 
the levels of borrowing may vary significantly during the course of the year  depending upon the timing and amount of cash requirements not satisfied by cash from operations 
at december   the dominion companies had committed lines of credit totaling billion

at december   the total amount of commercial paper outstanding was  million and the total amount of letter of credit issuances was million  leaving approximately million available for issuance 
the dominion companies are required to pay minimal annual commitment fees to maintain the credit facilities 
in addition  these credit agreements contain various terms and conditions that could affect the dominion companies ability to borrow under these facilities 
they include maximum debt to total capital ratios  material adverse change clauses and cross default provisions 
all of the credit facilities include a defined maximum total debt to total capital ratio 
as of december   the calculated ratio for the dominion companies  pursuant to the terms of the agreements  was as follows company maximum ratio actual ratio dominion resources  inc virginia power cng indebtedness as defined by the bank agreements excludes certain junior subordinated notes payable to affiliated trusts and mandatorily convertible securities that are reflected on the consolidated balance sheets 
these provisions apply separately to dominion resources  inc  virginia power and cng 
if any one of the dominion companies or any of that specific company s material subsidiaries fail to make payment on various debt obligations in excess of million  the lenders could require that respective company to accelerate its repayment of any outstanding borrowings under the credit facility and the lenders could terminate their commit 
table of contents ment to lend funds to that company 
accordingly  any defaults on indebtedness by cng or any of its material subsidiaries would not affect the lenders commitment to virginia power 
similarly  any defaults on indebtedness by virginia power or any of its material subsidiaries would not affect the lenders commitment to cng 
however  any default by either cng or virginia power would also affect in like manner the lenders commitment to dominion resources  inc under the joint credit agreements 
although the joint credit agreements contain material adverse change clauses  the participating lenders  under those specific provisions  cannot refuse to advance funds to any of the dominion companies for the repurchase of its outstanding commercial paper

credit ratings credit ratings are intended to provide banks and capital market participants with a framework for comparing the credit quality of securities and are not a recommendation to buy  sell or hold securities 
management believes that the current credit ratings of the dominion companies provide sufficient access to the capital markets 
however  disruptions in the banking and capital markets not specifically related to dominion may affect the dominion companies ability to access these funding sources or cause an increase in the return required by investors 
both quantitative financial strength and qualitative business or operating characteristics factors are considered by the credit rating agencies in establishing an individual company s credit rating 
credit ratings should be evaluated independently and are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization 
the credit ratings for the dominion companies are most affected by each company s financial profile  mix of regulated and non regulated businesses and respective cash flows  changes in methodologies used by the rating agencies and event risk  if applicable  such as major acquisitions 
credit ratings for the dominion companies as of february  follow standard poor s moody s dominion resources  inc senior unsecured debt securities bbb baa preferred securities of affiliated trusts bbb baa commercial paper a p virginia power mortgage bonds a a senior unsecured including tax exempt debt securities bbb a preferred securities of affiliated trust bbb baa preferred stock bbb baa commercial paper a p cng senior unsecured debt securities bbb a preferred securities of affiliated trust bbb baa commercial paper a p 
table of contents as of february   moody s maintains a negative outlook for its ratings of cng and standard poor s maintains a negative outlook for its ratings of dominion resources  inc and cng 
generally  a downgrade in an individual company s credit rating would not restrict its ability to raise short term and long term financing so long as its credit rating remains investment grade  but it would increase the cost of borrowing 
dominion has been working closely with both standard poor s and moody s with the objective of maintaining its current credit ratings 
recent steps to improve the agencies view of dominion s financial position include the reduction of planned capital spending and related borrowings  as discussed below  and the issuance of billion of common stock during and million during as discussed in risk factors and cautionary statements that may affect future results  in order to maintain its current ratings  dominion may find it necessary to modify its business plans and such changes may adversely affect its growth and earnings per share 
debt covenants as part of borrowing funds and issuing debt both short term and long term or preferred securities  the dominion companies must enter into enabling agreements 
these agreements contain covenants that  in the event of default  could result in the acceleration of principal and interest payments  restrictions on distributions related to its capital stock  including dividends  redemptions  repurchases  liquidation payments or guarantee payments  and in some cases  the termination of credit commitments unless a waiver of such requirements is agreed to by the lenders security holders 
these provisions are customary  with each agreement specifying which covenants apply 
these provisions are not necessarily unique to the dominion companies 
some of the typical covenants include n the timely payment of principal and interest  n information requirements  including submitting financial reports filed with the sec to lenders  n performance obligations  audits inspections  continuation of the basic nature of business  restrictions on certain matters related to merger or consolidation  restrictions on disposition of substantial assets  n compliance with collateral minimums or requirements related to mortgage bonds  and n limitations on liens 
dominion monitors the covenants on a regular basis in order to ensure that events of default will not occur 
as of december   there were no events of default under the dominion companies covenants 
cash used in investing activities during  and  investing activities resulted in net cash outflows of billion  billion  and billion respectively 
significant investing activities for included n billion for the construction and expansion of generation facilities  including environmental upgrades  purchases of nuclear fuel  and construction and improvements of gas and electric transmission and distribution assets  n billion for the purchase and development of gas and oil producing properties  drilling and equipment costs and undeveloped lease acquisitions  n million for the purchase of securities and million for the sale of securities  primarily related to investments held in nuclear decommissioning trusts  n million for purchase of dfv senior notes  n million in advances related to a generation project under construction in pennsylvania 
the asset  when completed  will be leased to dominion  n million of proceeds from sales of gas and oil properties and n release of million from escrow for the repayment of debt 
future cash payments for contractual obligations and planned capital expenditures dominion is party to numerous contracts and arrangements obligating dominion to make cash payments in future years 
these contracts include financing arrangements such as debt agreements and leases  as well as contracts for the purchase of goods and services and financial derivatives 
presented below is a table summarizing expected cash payments that may result from contracts to which dominion is a party as of december  for purchase obligations and other liabilities  amounts are largely estimated based upon contract terms  including fixed  minimum or expected quantities to be purchased at fixed or market based prices 
actual cash payments will be based upon actual quantities purchased and prices paid and will likely differ from amounts presented below 
less than year years years more than years total millions long term debt interest charges leases purchase obligations purchased electric capacity for utility operations fuel used for utility operations other production handling pipeline capacity energy commodity purchases for resale other fuel nonregulated other other long term liabilities financial derivatives asset retirement obligations other contractual obligations total cash payments based on stated maturity dates rather than the earlier redemption dates that could be elected by instrument holders 

table of contents fuel used in utility operations is recoverable through rate recovery mechanisms 
represents the summation of settlement amounts  by contracts  due from dominion if all physical or financial transactions among dominion and its counterparties were liquidated and terminated 
represents expected cash payments adjusted for inflation for estimated costs to perform asset retirement activities 
dominion s planned capital expenditures during are expected to total approximately billion 
for  planned capital expenditures are expected to range from billion to billion 
these expenditures include construction and expansion of generation facilities  environmental upgrades  construction improvements and expansion of gas and electric transmission and distribution assets  purchases of nuclear fuel and expenditures to explore for and develop natural gas and oil properties 
dominion expects to fund its capital expenditures with cash from operations  and a combination of sales of securities and short term borrowings 
dominion may choose to postpone or cancel certain planned capital expenditures  to the extent they are not fully covered by operating cash flows 
dominion would do this in order to mitigate the need for future debt financings  beyond those needed to cover normal maturities and redemptions 
use of off balance sheet arrangements leasing arrangements as of december   dominion was party to an agreement with a voting interest entity lessor in order to construct and lease a new power generation project in pennsylvania 
project costs totaled million at december  of which million was advanced to the lessor by dominion 
dominion expects to be repaid during this project is expected to be completed in and will result in estimated annual lease commitments of approximately million 
a lease agreement has not yet been executed for this project  however  dominion expects that  once executed  it will qualify as an operating lease 
dominion has been appointed to act as the construction agent for the lessor and controls the design and construction of the facility 
dominion  in this role  is responsible for completing construction by a specified date 
in the event a project is terminated before completion  dominion has the option to either purchase the project for of project costs plus fees or terminate the project and turn it over to the lessor 
benefits of this arrangement include n certain tax benefits as dominion would be considered the owner of the leased property for tax purposes 
as a result  it would be entitled to tax deductions for depreciation not recognized for financial accounting purposes and n as an operating lease for financial accounting purposes  the asset and related borrowings used to finance the construction of the asset would not be included on dominion s consolidated balance sheets 
although this improves measures of leverage calculated using amounts reported in dominion s consolidated financial statements  credit rating agencies view lease obligations as debt equivalents in evaluating dominion s credit profile 
securitizations of mortgages and loans as of december   dominion held million of retained interests from securitizations of mortgage and commercial loans completed in prior years 
dominion did not securitize or originate any loans in investors in the securitization trusts have no recourse to dominion s other assets for failure of debtors to repay principal and interest on the underlying loans when due 
therefore  dominion s exposure to any future losses from this activity is limited to its investment in retained interests 
future issues and other matters status of deregulation in virginia the virginia electric utility restructuring act the virginia restructuring act  enacted in  established a plan to restructure the electric utility industry in virginia 
the virginia restructuring act addressed among other things capped base rates  participation in a regional transmission organization rto  retail choice and the recovery of stranded costs 
dominion made retail choice available to all of its virginia regulated electric customers as of january  base rates under the virginia restructuring act  the generation portion of dominion s virginia jurisdictional operations is no longer subject to cost based rate regulation 
dominion s base rates excluding fuel costs and certain other allowable adjustments will remain capped until july  unless modified or terminated sooner under the virginia restructuring act 
recovery of generation related costs will continue through capped rates  and  where applicable  a wires charge assessed on those customers opting for alternative suppliers 
additionally  the virginia restructuring act provides that after the end of the capped rate period  any default service provided by dominion will be based upon competitive market prices for electric generation services 
in january  legislation supported by the offices of the governor and the attorney general of virginia was submitted to the virginia general assembly that would extend the capped base rates by three and one half years  through december  the bill was supported by dominion and was approved by the virginia senate in late january in addition to extending capped rates  the bill would n lock in dominion s fuel factor until the earlier of july  or the termination of capped rates through virginia commission order  n provide for a one time adjustment of dominion s fuel factor  effective july  through december   with no adjustment for previously incurred over recovery or under recovery of fuel costs and thus would eliminate deferred fuel accounting and 
table of contents n end wires charges on the earlier of july   or the termination of capped rates  consistent with the virginia restructuring act s original timetable 
other bills were introduced in the virginia house of delegates that would repeal the virginia restructuring act  suspend most of the virginia restructuring act  suspend customer choice  and re impose cost of service rate making 
legislation calling for suspension of the virginia restructuring act s key provisions and a return to the cost of service regulatory methodology was defeated in a house committee in early february 
other measures have been deferred to by a house committee 
until the legislative process is concluded  no assessment can be made concerning future developments 
rto the virginia restructuring act requires that dominion join an rto subject to virginia commission approval 
ferc requires each public utility that owns or operates transmission facilities to make certain filings with respect to rto formation  but relies on voluntary formation of rtos to advance its energy policies 
by joining an rto  dominion s regulated electric utility subsidiary  virginia power  would transfer functional control of its transmission assets to a third party rto 
in september  dominion and pjm interconnection  llc pjm entered into the pjm south implementation agreement 
the agreement provides that  subject to regulatory approval and certain provisions  dominion will become a member of pjm  transfer functional control of its electric transmission facilities to pjm for inclusion in a new pjm south region and integrate its control area into the pjm energy markets 
the agreement also allocates costs of implementation of the agreement among the parties 
in june  dominion made a filing as required by the virginia restructuring act requesting authorization from the virginia commission to become a member of pjm on november  in september  the virginia commission issued an order directing dominion to provide additional information concerning the application 
hearings on dominion s application are scheduled to begin in october dominion intends to file for ferc and north carolina commission approval to join pjm in the future 
dominion has incurred and will continue to incur integration and operating costs associated with joining an rto 
dominion has deferred certain of these costs for future recovery and is giving further consideration to seeking regulatory approval to defer the balance of such costs 
recovery of stranded costs stranded costs are those generation related costs incurred or commitments made by utilities under cost based regulation that may not be reasonably expected to be recovered in a competitive market 
at december   dominion s exposure to potentially stranded costs consisted of long term purchased power contracts that could ultimately be determined to be above market  generating plants that could possibly become uneconomical in a deregulated environment  and unfunded obligations for nuclear plant decommissioning and postretirement benefits not yet recognized in the financial statements 
dominion believes capped electric retail rates and  where applicable  wires charges will provide an opportunity to recover a portion of its potentially stranded costs  depending on market prices of electricity and other factors 
recovery of dominion s potentially stranded costs remains subject to numerous risks even in the capped rate environment 
these include  among others  exposure to long term power purchase commitment losses  future environmental compliance requirements  changes in tax laws  nuclear decommissioning costs  inflation  increased capital costs  and recovery of certain other items 
the enactment of deregulation legislation in not only caused the discontinuance of sfas no 
for dominion s virginia jurisdictional utility generation related operations but also caused dominion to review its utility generation assets for impairment and long term power purchase contracts for potential losses at that time 
significant assumptions considered in that review included possible future market prices for fuel and electricity  load growth  generating unit availability and future capacity additions in dominion s market  capital expenditures  including those related to environmental improvements  and decommissioning activities 
based on those analyses  no recognition of plant impairments or contract losses was appropriate at that time 
in response to future events resulting from the development of a competitive market structure in virginia and the expiration or termination of capped rates and wires charges  dominion may have to reevaluate its utility generation assets for impairment and long term power purchase contracts for potential losses 
assumptions about future market prices for electricity represent a critical factor that affects the results of such evaluations 
since  market prices for electricity have fluctuated significantly and will continue to be subject to volatility 
any such review in the future  which would be highly dependent on assumptions considered appropriate at the time  could possibly result in the recognition of plant impairment or contract losses that would be material to dominion s results of operations or its financial position 
in january  the commission on electric utility restructuring adopted a resolution related to the monitoring of stranded costs 
changes to cost structure while the virginia restructuring act did not define specific generation related costs to be recovered  it did provide for generation related cash flows through the combination of capped rates and wires charges billed to customers through july   unless terminated earlier pursuant to the virginia restructuring act the transition period 
the generation related cash flows provided by the virginia restructuring act are intended to compensate dominion for continuing to provide generation services and to allow dominion management to incur costs to restructure such operations during the transition period 
as a result  during the tran 
table of contents sition period  dominion may increase earnings to the extent that management can reduce operating costs for its utility generation related operations 
conversely  the same risks affecting the recovery of dominion s stranded costs  discussed above  may also adversely impact its cost structure during the transition period 
accordingly  dominion could realize the negative economic impact of any such adverse event 
in addition to managing the cost of its generation related operations  dominion may also seek opportunities to sell available electric energy and capacity to customers beyond its electric utility service territory 
using cash flows from operations during the transition period  dominion may further alter its cost structure or choose to make additional investment in its business 
the capped rates were derived from rates established as part of the virginia rate settlement and do not provide for specific recovery of particular generation related expenditures  except for certain regulatory assets 
to the extent that dominion manages its operations to reduce its overall operating costs below those levels included in the capped rates  dominion s earnings may increase 
since the enactment of the virginia restructuring act  dominion has been reviewing its cost structure to identify opportunities to reduce the annual operating expenses of its generation related operations 
for example  the reduction in future fixed capacity payments  resulting from the termination of certain long term power purchase agreements during and  is expected to increase annual after tax earnings by approximately million during the transition period 
also in and  dominion revised the estimated useful lives of its electric generation assets 
the changes in estimates were based upon expected life extensions of nuclear plants and new engineering studies of the other assets 
as a result of these changes  annual after tax earnings will increase by approximately million during the transition period  as a result of lower depreciation expense for these assets 
ferc standard market design proposal in  ferc issued proposed rules that would establish a standardized transmission service and wholesale electric market design for entities participating in wholesale electric markets 
ferc proposed to exercise jurisdiction over the transmission component of bundled retail transactions  modify the existing electric transmission tariff to include a single tariff service applicable to all transmission customers and provide a standard market design for wholesale electric markets 
ferc also proposed that transmission owners that have not yet joined an rto must contract with a separate entity  an independent transmission provider  to operate their transmission facilities 
ferc scheduled a number of technical conferences and meetings with interested parties and has indicated that the market design and timing of the rule is subject to change 
in april  ferc issued a discussion document addressing several issues raised by state regulatory commissions and market participants in ferc s proposed standard market design 
the document proposes certain changes to standard market design and to work with the states and market participants to develop reasonable timetables for moving forward on the formation of rtos 
ferc also stated that it would not use the standard market design rulemaking to overturn prior rto orders where there is an overlap 
it is uncertain what impact  if any  these matters may have on dominion s efforts to join pjm or on the design of wholesale electric markets 
environmental matters dominion is subject to costs resulting from a number of federal  state and local laws and regulations designed to protect human health and the environment 
these laws and regulations affect future planning and existing operations 
they can result in increased capital  operating and other costs as a result of compliance  remediation  containment and monitoring obligations 
historically  dominion recovered such costs arising from regulated electric operations through utility rates 
however  to the extent that environmental costs are incurred in connection with operations regulated by the virginia commission  during the period ending june   in excess of the level currently included in the virginia jurisdictional electric retail rates  dominion s results of operations will decrease 
after that date  recovery through regulated rates may be sought for only those environmental costs related to regulated electric transmission and distribution operations 
dominion also may seek recovery through regulated rates for environmental expenditures related to regulated gas transmission and distribution operations 
environmental protection and monitoring expenditures dominion incurred approximately million  million and million of expenses including depreciation during  and  respectively  in connection with environmental protection and monitoring activities  and expects these expenses to be approximately million in in addition  capital expenditures related to environmental controls were million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the estimated amount for these expenditures is million for clean air act compliance the clean air act requires dominion to reduce its emissions of sulfur dioxide so 

and nitrogen oxide no 
x  which are gaseous by products of fossil fuel combustion 
the clean air act s so 

and nox reduction programs include n the issuance of a limited number of so 

emission allowances 
each allowance permits the emission of one ton of so 

into the atmosphere 
the allowances may be transacted with a third party  and n the issuance of a limited number of nox emission allowances to comply with nox emission requirements applicable during ozone season months of may through september 
each allowance permits the emission of one ton of nox into the atmosphere 

table of contents implementation of projects to comply with so 

and no 
x 
limitations are ongoing and will be influenced by changes in the regulatory environment  availability of allowances  various state and federal control programs  and emission control technology 
in response to these requirements  dominion expects to make the following capital expenditures at its affected generating facilities n million during the period through on so emission control equipment  and n million during through on nox reduction equipment 
total costs are expected to be million  of which approximately million has been incurred through december  the majority of these cost estimates are also included in the capital cost expenditure estimate contemplated by the consent decree  described below 
in relation to a notice of violation received by virginia power in from the environmental protection agency epa and related proceedings  virginia power  the us department of justice  the epa  and the states of virginia  west virginia  connecticut  new jersey and new york agreed to a settlement in april in the form of a proposed consent decree 
the virginia federal district court entered the final consent decree in october  resolving the underlying actions 
under the settlement  virginia power paid a million civil penalty  agreed to fund million for environmental projects and committed to improve air quality under the consent decree estimated to involve expenditures of billion 
dominion has already incurred certain capital expenditures for environmental improvements at its coal fired stations in virginia and west virginia and has committed to additional measures in its current financial plans and capital budget to satisfy the requirements of the consent decree 
as of december   dominion had recognized a provision for the funding of the environmental projects  substantially all of which was recorded in other as part of its reissuance of a pollution discharge permit for the millstone power station  the connecticut department of environmental protection is evaluating the ecological impacts of the cooling water intake system 
until the permit is reissued  it is not possible to predict the financial impact  if any  that may result 
future environmental regulations in december  the epa announced plans to propose additional regulations addressing pollution transport from electric generating units as well as the regulation of mercury and nickel emissions 
these regulatory actions  in addition to revised regulations expected to be issued in to address regional haze  could require additional reductions in emissions from the company s fossil fuel fired generating facilities 
if these new emission reduction requirements are imposed additional significant expenditures may be required 
under authority of the clean water act  the epa has announced the publication of new regulations governing utilities that employ a cooling water intake structure  with flow levels that exceed a minimum threshold 
as announced  the epa s rule presents several control options 
dominion is evaluating facility information from affected power stations 
dominion cannot predict the future impact on its operations at this time 
the us congress is considering various legislative proposals that would require generating facilities to comply with more stringent air emissions standards 
emission reduction requirements under consideration would be phased in under a variety of periods of up to years 
if these new proposals are adopted  additional significant expenditures may be required 
in  the united states signed an international protocol to limit man made greenhouse emissions under the united nations framework convention on climate change 
however  the protocol will not become binding unless approved by the us senate 
currently  the bush administration has indicated that it will not pursue ratification of the protocol and has set a voluntary goal of reducing the nation s greenhouse gas emission intensity by over the next years 
several legislative proposals that include provisions seeking to impose mandatory reductions of greenhouse gas emissions are under consideration in the united states congress 
the cost of compliance with the protocol or other mandatory greenhouse gas reduction obligations could be significant 
given the highly uncertain outcome and timing of future action  if any  by the us federal government on this issue  dominion cannot predict the financial impact of future climate change actions on its operations at this time 
other matters telecommunications operations in december  dominion classified the assets and related liabilities of dti as held for sale  and its results of operations as discontinued operations 
the current plan of sale anticipates a closing by the end of june in addition dti has long term obligations  including leases  maintenance agreements and other contracts  that must be considered in the sale and may result in additional losses in future periods depending upon the final terms of the sale 
millstone operating licenses in january  dominion filed with the nuclear regulatory commission to renew the operating licenses of its two nuclear units at millstone power station 
if renewed  unit would continue to operate until and unit until 
table of contents kewaunee power plant during the fourth quarter of  dominion announced an agreement with wisconsin public service corporation  a subsidiary of wps resources corporation wps  and wisconsin power light company wp l  a subsidiary of alliant energy corporation  to purchase the kewaunee power plant  a nuclear power station in northeastern wisconsin 
under terms of the agreement  the aggregate purchase price is million in cash  including million for nuclear fuel 
dominion will sell of the facility s output to wps and wp l under a power purchase agreement that expires in the transaction is expected to close in the second half of  pending applicable federal and state regulatory approvals 
kewaunee will be included in the dominion generation operating segment 
future acquisitions because dominion s industry is rapidly changing  there are many opportunities for acquisitions of assets  as well as for business combinations 
dominion investigates any opportunity that may increase shareholder value and build on existing businesses  with an objective to enter into transactions that would be immediately accretive to earnings per share 
dominion has participated in the past and its security holders may assume that at any time dominion may be participating in bidding or other negotiations for such transactions 
such participation may or may not result in a transaction for dominion 
however  any such transaction that does take place may involve consideration in the form of cash  debt or equity securities 
it may also involve payment of a premium over book or market values 
such transactions or payments could affect the market prices and rates for dominion s securities 
market rate sensitive instruments and risk management dominion s financial instruments  commodity contracts and related derivative financial instruments are exposed to potential losses due to adverse changes in interest rates  equity security prices  foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
interest rate risk generally is related to dominion s outstanding debt 
commodity price risk is present in dominion s electric operations  gas production and procurement operations  and energy marketing and trading operations due to the exposure to market shifts in prices received and paid for natural gas  electricity and other commodities 
dominion uses derivative commodity contracts to manage price risk exposures for these operations 
in addition  dominion is exposed to equity price risk through various portfolios of equity securities 
the following sensitivity analysis estimates the potential loss of future earnings or fair value from market risk sensitive instruments over a selected time period due to a unfavorable change in commodity prices  interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
commodity price risk trading activities as part of its strategy to market energy and to manage related risks  dominion manages a portfolio of commodity based derivative instruments held for trading purposes 
these contracts are sensitive to changes in the prices of natural gas  electricity and certain other commodities 
dominion uses established policies and procedures to manage the risks associated with these price fluctuations and uses derivative instruments  such as futures  forwards  swaps and options  to mitigate risk by creating offsetting market positions 
in addition  dominion may use its generation capacity to satisfy commitments to sell energy when not needed to serve customers in its service territory 
a hypothetical unfavorable change in commodity prices would have resulted in a decrease of approximately million and million in the fair value of dominion s commodity based financial derivative instruments held for trading purposes as of december  and december   respectively 
commodity price risk non trading activities dominion manages the price risk associated with purchases and sales of natural gas  oil and electricity by using derivative commodity instruments including futures  forwards  options and swaps 
for sensitivity analysis purposes  the fair value of dominion s non trading derivative commodity instruments is determined based on models that consider the market prices of commodities in future periods  the volatility of the market prices in each period  as well as the time value factors of the derivative instruments 
market prices and volatility are principally determined based on quoted prices on the futures exchange 
a hypothetical unfavorable change in market prices of dominion s non trading commodity based derivative financial instruments would have resulted in a decrease in fair value of approximately million and million as of december  and december   respectively 
the impact of a change in energy commodity prices on dominion s non trading derivative commodity instruments at a point in time is not necessarily representative of the results that will be realized when such contracts are ultimately settled 
net losses from derivative commodity instruments used for hedging purposes  to the extent realized  are substantially offset by recognition of the hedged transaction  such as revenue from sales 
interest rate risk dominion manages its interest rate risk exposure predominantly by maintaining a balance of fixed and variable rate debt 
dominion also enters into interest rate sensitive derivatives  including interest rate swaps and interest rate lock agreements 
for financial instruments outstanding at december   a hypothetical increase in market interest rates would decrease annual earnings by approximately million 
a hypothetical increase in market interest rates  as determined at december   would have resulted in a decrease in annual earnings of approximately million 

table of contents in addition  dominion  through subsidiaries  retains ownership of mortgage investments  including subordinated bonds and interest only residual assets retained from securitizations of mortgage loans originated and purchased in prior years 
note to the consolidated financial statements discusses the impact of changes in value of these investments 
foreign exchange risk dominion s canadian natural gas and oil exploration and production activities are relatively self contained within canada 
as a result  dominion s exposure to foreign currency exchange risk for these activities is limited primarily to the effects of translation adjustments that arise from including that operation in its consolidated financial statements 
dominion s management monitors this exposure and believes it is not material 
in addition  dominion manages its foreign exchange risk exposure associated with anticipated future purchases of nuclear fuel processing services denominated in foreign currencies by utilizing currency forward contracts 
as a result of holding these contracts as hedges  dominion s exposure to foreign currency risk is minimal 
a hypothetical unfavorable change in relevant foreign exchange rates would have resulted in a decrease of approximately million and million in the fair value of currency forward contracts held by dominion at december  and  respectively 
investment price risk dominion is subject to investment price risk due to marketable securities held as investments in decommissioning trust funds 
in accordance with current accounting standards  these marketable securities are reported on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value 
dominion recognized a net realized loss net of investment income of million and a net unrealized gain of million on decommissioning trust investments for the year ended for the year ended december   dominion recognized a net realized gain including investment income of million and a net unrealized loss of million 
dominion also sponsors employee pension and other postretirement benefit plans that hold investments in trusts to fund benefit payments 
to the extent that the values of investments held in these trusts decline  the effect will be reflected in dominion s recognition of the periodic cost of such employee benefit plans and the determination of the amount of cash to be contributed to the employee benefit plans 
during  dominion s pension plans experienced net realized and unrealized gains of million and in net realized and unrealized losses of million 
risk management policies dominion has operating procedures in place that are administered by experienced management to help ensure that proper internal controls are maintained 
in addition  dominion has established an independent function at the corporate level to monitor compliance with the risk management policies of all subsidiaries 
dominion maintains credit policies that include the evaluation of a prospective counterparty s financial condition  collateral requirements where deemed necessary  and the use of standardized agreements that facilitate the netting of cash flows associated with a single counterparty 
in addition  dominion also monitors the financial condition of existing counterparties on an ongoing basis 
based on credit policies and the december  provision for credit losses  management believes that it is unlikely that a material adverse effect on its financial position  results of operations or cash flows would occur as a result of counterparty nonperformance 
risk factors and cautionary statements that may affect future results factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in any forward looking statement include weather conditions  governmental regulations  cost of environmental compliance  inherent risk in the operation of nuclear facilities  fluctuations in energy related commodities prices and the effect these could have on dominion s earnings  liquidity position and the underlying value of its assets  trading counterparty credit risk  capital market conditions  including price risk due to marketable securities held as investments in trusts and benefit plans  fluctuations in interest rates  changes in rating agency requirements and ratings  changes in accounting standards  collective bargaining agreements and labor negotiations  the risks of operating businesses in regulated industries that are becoming deregulated  the transfer of control over electric transmission facilities to a regional transmission organization  political and economic conditions including inflation and deflation  and completing the divestiture of investments held by dci  cng international corporation and dfv 
other more specific risk factors are as follows dominion s operations are weather sensitive 
dominion s results of operations can be affected by changes in the weather 
weather conditions directly influence the demand for electricity and natural gas and affect the price of energy commodities 
in addition  severe weather  including hurricanes  winter storms and droughts  can be destructive  causing outages  production delays and property damage that require dominion to incur additional expenses 
dominion is subject to complex governmental regulation that could adversely affect its operations 
dominion s operations are subject to extensive regulation and require numerous permits  approvals and certificates from federal  state and local governmental agencies 
dominion must also comply with environmental legislation and associated regulations 
management believes the necessary approvals have been obtained for dominion s existing operations and that its business is conducted in accordance with applicable laws 
however  new laws or regulations  or the revision or reinterpretation of 
table of contents existing laws or regulations  may require dominion to incur additional expenses 
costs of environmental compliance  liabilities and litigation could exceed dominion s estimates 
compliance with federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations may result in increased capital  operating and other costs  including remediation and containment expenses and monitoring obligations 
in addition  dominion may be a responsible party for environmental clean up at a site identified by a regulatory body 
management cannot predict with certainty the amount and timing of all future expenditures related to environmental matters because of the difficulty of estimating clean up and compliance costs  and the possibility that changes will be made to the current environmental laws and regulations 
there is also uncertainty in quantifying liabilities under environmental laws that impose joint and several liability on all potentially responsible parties 
dominion is exposed to cost recovery shortfalls because of capped base rates in effect in virginia through mid for its regulated electric utility 
under the virginia restructuring act  the generation portion of dominion s electric utility operations is open to competition and resulting uncertainty 
under the virginia restructuring act  dominion s base rates excluding  generally  fuel costs and certain other allowable adjustments remain unchanged until july unless modified or terminated consistent with the virginia restructuring act 
although the virginia restructuring act allows for the recovery of certain generation related costs during the capped rates period  dominion remains exposed to numerous risks of cost recovery shortfalls 
these include exposure to potentially stranded costs  future environmental compliance requirements  tax law changes  costs related to hurricanes or other weather events  inflation and increased capital costs 
in addition  under the virginia restructuring act  the generation portion of dominion s electric utility operations is open to competition and is no longer subject to cost based regulation 
to date  the competitive market has been slow to develop and it is difficult to predict the pace at which the competitive environment will evolve and the extent to which dominion will face increased competition and be able to operate profitably within this competitive environment 
additional uncertainty arises from several legislative proposals currently under consideration by the virginia general assembly 
these proposals range from extending for three and a half years the period during which capped rates are in effect but with certain limitations on changes in the fuel factor  to suspending customer choice and returning to cost based regulation 
see future issues and other matters status of deregulation in virginia in md a and note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
dominion s merchant power business is operating in a challenging market 
the success of dominion s merchant power business depends upon its ability to find buyers willing to enter into power purchase agreements at prices sufficient to cover its operating costs 
depressed spot and forward wholesale power prices and excess capacity in the industry could result in lower than expected revenues in dominion s merchant power business 
there are inherent risks in the operation of nuclear facilities 
these risks include the cost of and dominion s ability to maintain adequate reserves for decommissioning  plant maintenance costs  threat of terrorism  spent nuclear fuel disposal costs and exposure to potential liabilities arising out of the operation of these facilities 
dominion maintains decommissioning trusts and external insurance coverage to minimize the financial exposure to these risks 
however  it is possible that costs arising from claims could exceed the amount of any insurance coverage 
the use of derivative instruments could result in financial losses 
dominion uses derivative instruments  including futures  forwards  options and swaps  to manage its commodity and financial market risks 
in addition  dominion purchases and sells commodity based contracts in the natural gas  electricity and oil markets for trading purposes 
in the future  dominion could recognize financial losses on these contracts as a result of volatility in the market values of the underlying commodities or if a counterparty fails to perform under a contract 
in the absence of actively quoted market prices and pricing information from external sources  the valuation of these contracts involves management s judgment or use of estimates 
as a result  changes in the underlying assumptions or use of alternative valuation methods could affect the reported fair value of these contracts 
for additional information concerning derivatives and commodity based trading contracts  see market rate sensitive instruments and risk management and notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
dominion is exposed to market risks beyond its control in its energy clearinghouse operations 
dominion s energy clearinghouse and risk management operations are subject to multiple market risks including market liquidity  counterparty credit strength and price volatility 
many industry participants have experienced severe business downturns resulting in some companies exiting or curtailing participation in the energy trading markets 
this has led to a reduction in the number of trading partners and lower industry trading revenues 
declining creditworthiness of some of dominion s trading counterparties may limit the level of its trading activities with these parties and increase the risk that these parties may not perform under a contract 
successfully executing dominion s exit from the telecommunications business is dependent upon market conditions and timing 
in september  dominion announced it would recognize impairment charges related to dti  its telecommunications investment  and that it plans to exit the telecommunications business 
continued depressed market conditions in the telecommunications industry may make it difficult for dominion to sell the business as a whole  resulting in sales of telecommunications assets that may not include a transfer of all associated liabilities 
additionally  the difficulty in 
table of contents finding suitable buyers for the telecommunications business and in obtaining required state and federal regulatory approvals could delay the sale of the business 
if dominion fails to sell its telecommunications business quickly  dti risks the loss of current customers and key employees 
dti requires external sources of liquidity for its operating funds 
dominion has advanced  and anticipates making additional advances of  operating funds to dti 
given its current financial and operating position  it is unlikely that dti would be able to secure funds from other sources  so it is dependent on continued funding from dominion to sustain its operations 
any additional funds provided by dominion may not be recovered from a sale of the telecommunications business

dominion s exploration and production business is dependent on factors that cannot be predicted or controlled 
factors that may affect dominion s financial results include fluctuations in natural gas and crude oil prices  results of future drilling and well completion activities  dominion s ability to acquire additional land positions in competitive lease areas as well as inherent operational risks that could disrupt production 
dominion s liquidity may also be impacted by margin requirements that result from financial derivatives used to hedge future sales of gas and oil production and require the deposit of funds and other collateral with counterparties to cover the fair value of covered contracts in excess of agreed upon credit limits 
short term market declines in natural gas and oil prices may also result in the permanent write down of dominion s gas and oil properties as required by the full cost method of accounting 
under the full cost method  all direct costs of property acquisition  exploration and development activities are capitalized 
if net capitalized costs exceed the present value of estimated future net revenues based on hedge adjusted period end prices from the production of proved gas and oil reserves the ceiling test  in a given country  at the end of any quarterly period  then a permanent write down of the assets must be recognized in that period 
an inability to access financial markets could affect the execution of dominion s business plan 
dominion relies on access to both short term money markets and longer term capital markets as a significant source of liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by the cash flows from its operations 
management believes that dominion and its subsidiaries will maintain sufficient access to these financial markets based upon current credit ratings 
however  certain disruptions outside of dominion s control may increase its cost of borrowing or restrict its ability to access one or more financial markets 
such disruptions could include an economic downturn  the bankruptcy of an unrelated energy company or changes to dominion s credit ratings 
restrictions on dominion s ability to access financial markets may affect its ability to execute its business plan as scheduled 
changing rating agency requirements could negatively affect dominion s growth and business strategy 
as of february   dominion s senior unsecured debt was rated bbb  negative outlook  by standard poor s and baa  stable outlook  by moody s 
both agencies have recently implemented more stringent applications of the financial requirements for various ratings levels 
in order to maintain its current credit ratings in light of these or future new requirements  dominion may find it necessary to take steps or modify its business plans in ways that may adversely affect its growth and earnings per share 
a reduction in dominion s credit ratings by either standard poor s or moody s could increase its borrowing costs and adversely affect operating results 
potential changes in accounting practices may adversely affect dominion s financial results 
dominion cannot predict the impact future changes in accounting standards or practices may have on public companies in general or the energy industry or its operations specifically 
new accounting standards could be issued that could change the way dominion records revenue  expenses  assets and liabilities
