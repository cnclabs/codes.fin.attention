see forward looking statements 
as previously described  riggs national corporation is a bank holding company headquartered in washington  dc the company engages in a variety of banking and financial services including community  commercial and international banking  trust and investment management services and venture capital investing 
the company has conducted its activities through six reportable segments banking  international banking  riggs co 
wealth management  treasury  riggs capital partners venture capital and other 
with the exception of venture capital investing  the activities of the company are conducted through its principal operating subsidiary  riggs bank  and its subsidiaries and divisions 
venture capital investing is performed through two investments of rnc  riggs capital partners llc and riggs capital partners ii llc 
the company has forty seven branch locations and atms in the metropolitan washington  dc area and a bank in the united kingdom 
there are additional operations or subsidiaries in london england  miami florida  berlin germany  jersey channel islands and nassau bahamas 
riggs serves an array of customers including individuals  partnerships  corporations  foundations  not for profit organizations and foreign embassies and delegations 
the company s principal source of revenue is net interest income  or the difference between what the company earns on interest earning assets  such as loans  securities available for sale  securities held to maturity and short term investments  and what it pays on interest bearing liabilities  such as deposits and the company s short term borrowings and long term debt 
noninterest income  the next largest component of revenue  primarily represents service charges and fees earned on loans  deposits and assets under management  venture capital gains or losses and net securities gains or losses 
noninterest expense  the company s largest source of expenditures  comprises the company s operating expenses and includes salaries and benefits  occupancy  data processing  consulting  advertising and public relations  furniture  fixture and software and other operating expenses 
for the three years ended december   the company s net interest income and net interest margin  or net interest income on a tax equivalent basis as a percent of average earning assets  has been net interest net interest income margin million million million during this same three year period  the company s interest rate spread  or the difference between the rate it earns on interest earning assets and the rate it pays on interest bearing liabilities  has been the three years ended december  were generally a period of declining interest rates during which it became increasingly difficult to adjust the pricing of funding sources as rapidly as earning assets 
this led to rate compression which over this same period caused net interest income  net interest margin and interest rate spread to decrease 
as explained in results of operations beginning on page  declining interest rates also adversely impacted the bank s previously disclosed leverage program as did changes in authoritative accounting literature see riggs capital on page and results of operations on page and the methodology by which riggs is compensated as a financial agent bank by the us treasury see results of operations on page 
noninterest income excluding net security gains  which is excluded because it is deemed to be discretionary on the part of riggs management  has been million million million noninterest income has been positively impacted by the decreasing losses in its venture capital operations during the last three years 
these losses were million in  million and million in and  respectively 
significant factors impacting noninterest income are discussed in results of operations commencing on page noninterest expense for the three years ended december  has been million million million included in the noninterest expense is million of restructuring and other charges 
the expense includes significant amounts related to the implementation of project eps  a two year effort by the company to upgrade its technology and operations 
see results of operations on page for additional analysis of noninterest expenses 
primarily because of the above factors  the company s net income loss for the three years ended december  has been million million million the company s asset quality at december  is good with nonaccrual and renegotiated loans of million  which represents of all loans 
at december  the company s reserve for loan losses is approximately twice the total of nonaccrual  renegotiated and ninety day past due loans 
the company s regulatory capital exceeds regulatory requirements and the company and the bank are well capitalized under regulatory guidelines 
based upon mid year data the company believes it has approximately of the washington  dc fdic insured deposit market and approximately of the fdic insured deposit market in the greater washington dc metropolitan area 
the company cautions that this market share data may not be indicative of future deposit market share because of the change in the methodology by which riggs is compensated as a financial agent bank by the us treasury 
see results of operations commencing on page the company plans to open ten branches per year during the next three years 
this plan is  however  dependent upon the company identifying acceptable branch sites  procuring these sites on reasonable terms and obtaining regulatory approval 
a new branch facility typically requires an investment of between thousand and million depending upon the location and type of branch 
in addition  during and the company will remodel all of its existing branches 
the company anticipates that these upgrades will cost approximately thousand to thousand per location 
risk factors like all regulated financial institutions  the company is exposed to numerous risks that could adversely impact profits  financial condition and cash flows  and  ultimately  franchise value 
in order to mitigate these risks somewhat  the company has various policies  personnel and committees that establish limits for and monitor various aspects of its risk profile 
moreover  in  the company created and staffed the position of chief risk officer  an executive level position 
the chief risk officer develops and implements entity wise risk management policies  serves as internal consultant regarding risk management matters and works with other management members to identify and resolve potential risk management issues 
geographic risks a significant majority of the company s assets  deposits and fee income is generated in the washington  dc metropolitan area 
as a result  deterioration of local economic conditions in this metropolitan area could expose the company to losses associated with higher loan default rates and lower asset collateral values  deposit withdrawals and other factors that could adversely impact its financial condition and results of operations 
exposure to international events the company s exposure to customer relationship risk is significant because of its relatively high concentration of foreign customers  including foreign governments 
these customers may be subject to deteriorating economic conditions  investigations  political and social upheaval  currency depreciation or devaluation  as well as nationalization and expropriation of assets or other factors over which the company has no control  some or all of which may adversely impact the performance or financial condition of the company 
moreover  terrorist activities and other hostile actions against us interests could have an adverse impact upon the general economic condition of the company s foreign customers  as well as the us economy  thereby impacting the activities and performance of the company 
fluctuations in interest rates market risk significant increases in market interest rates  or the perception that an increase may occur  could adversely impact the company s ability to generate new variable loans and cause the value of its fixed rate assets to decline 
an increase in market interest rates may also adversely impact the ability of adjustable rate borrowers to meet repayment obligations  thereby causing nonperforming loans and loan charge offs to increase 
significant decreases in market interest rates could result in an acceleration of loan repayments thereby mitigating the positive impact of declining interest rates on fixed rate assets 
changes in market interest rates  including changes in the relationship between short term and long term market interest rates or between different rate indices  can impact interest rate spread 
see sensitivity to market and other risk on page competition risk the company faces significant competitive pressure from local  regional  national and international banking institutions as well as thrifts  finance companies  credit unions  brokerage and insurance companies and other financial intermediaries 
many of the company s competitors are larger and have greater financial and other resources 
riggs competes on the basis of its reputation  localized decision making  interest rates  convenient locations and quality of customer service 
see competition and environment on page credit risk the company is exposed to credit risk on the loans and other credit instruments it has in its portfolio 
while the portfolio is closely monitored and an on going analysis and evaluation of this risk is performed  because of the nature of the company s business  unexpected credit losses may subsequently be identified as a result of additional analysis performed by the company or comments received from regulatory examiners 
in addition  collateral values may deteriorate subsequent to the making of a loan so that a loss exposure develops 
see asset quality on page legislative and regulatory risk the company s operations are subject to extensive regulation by federal banking authorities and are also subject to various laws and judicial and administrative decisions imposing requirements and restrictions on its operations 
policies adopted and positions taken by these regulatory and administrative entities can impact the company s operations 
in addition  these authorities periodically conduct examinations of the company and may impose various requirements or sanctions 
the regulatory environment may periodically change significantly as new laws and regulations are promulgated 
as a result of new laws and regulations  the competitive environment may also change significantly 
dividend limitation risk the company is a holding company and its operations are conducted primarily through its operating subsidiary  riggs bank 
rnc s ability to pay dividends to its shareholders and to service its debt is dependent primarily upon the ability of the bank to make dividend and other payments to rnc 
certain laws and regulatory requirements restrict the ability of riggs bank to make such payments to the rnc 
see payment of dividends and capital adequacy on page liquidity risk the company closely monitors its liquidity position including its sources of funding and commitments to fund assets or deposit withdrawals 
the company maintains several credit facilities and the company s securities available for sale portfolio is very marketable and is  therefore  a source of liquidity 
in addition  substantially all of the securities available for sale portfolio can be pledged to secure borrowings 
hence  the company believes that it has sufficient liquidity to fund its commitments 
however  changes in the stability of the economic  social or political environments culminating in withdrawals by several of the bank s largest depositors  or a deterioration in the public s confidence in the banking system in general or the company in particular  could have an adverse impact on the company s liquidity position 
while marketable  liquidating the securities available for sale portfolio to fund liquidity requirements may result in the recognition of a loss 
see also cross border outstandings on page and commitments and liquidity on page operational risk the company relies on various information systems for operating significant aspects of its business  including loan and deposit information  as well as internal management systems 
these systems and the company s operations are vulnerable to  among other things  damage or interruption from natural disasters  power loss  network failure  improper operations  security breaches  computer viruses or intentional sabotage 
controls and procedures have been implemented to minimize these risks  but any disruption in the operation of the company s various information systems could adversely impact its operations which may affect its results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  noncompliance with laws  regulations or contractual obligations  or failure to perform in accordance with industry standards could result in claims for damages  fines or monetary sanctions including  but not limited to  monetary sanctions which may be imposed under the provisions of the bsa and related regulations 
bank secrecy act and money laundering compliance  consent order as discussed on page  on march   the bank was informed by the occ and fincen that each is considering whether to assess civil monetary penalties and may modify the existing consent order or take additional enforcement action 
the company cannot currently estimate the amount of these penalties  if any  or  the additional adverse financial consequences that may result from them 
similarly  the company is unable to determine the financial consequences  if any  that may result from modifications to its existing consent order or the imposition of an additional enforcement action  if any 
reputation risk riggs strives to operate in a professional manner and has implemented various personnel policies and procedures  including an employee code of conduct applicable to all employees  to help ensure the maintenance of integrity and professionalism 
nevertheless  riggs or its employees may fail to perform in accordance with these policies and procedures  or riggs may find itself in a situation that is embarrassing from a public relations perspective and  upon this information becoming public knowledge  may suffer damage to its reputation 
this damage could adversely impact customer confidence and have an adverse impact on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
risk caused by fluctuations in currency values riggs is exposed to changes in the relative values of the currencies in which it conducts business and the value of the united states dollar 
where deemed appropriate  the company has attempted to mitigate this risk by entering into hedging transactions 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company also monitors on a quarterly basis its total risk exposure on a country by country basis and has established maximum risk exposures for each country 
see sensitivity to market and other risk on page reliance on outside vendors for significant overhead related activities the company has made a significant investment in the utilization of third party vendors to provide it with certain core services  such as  but not limited to  information technology services and telecommunications 
should these service providers fail to provide the company with the products and services contracted for  fail to keep current with market standards in their respective industries or curtail or cease operations due to market or other conditions  the company s operations could be negatively impacted 
disintermediation in the banking and financial services businesses  disintermediation is the process by which customers and potential customers bypass banks and other traditional financial institutions thereby depleting anticipated revenue streams 
while the company continues its efforts to make its products and services an integral  valuable component of its customers financial transactions  the possibility of disintermediation is an inherent risk in the banking and traditional financial services business as customers may migrate to other financial intermediaries 
concentration of ownership members of a family beneficially own or control approximately of the company stock 
the effect of this concentration could impair or prevent the company s other shareholders from effecting certain actions deemed desirable by such shareholders 
critical accounting policies and estimates management of the company has prepared the consolidated financial statements included in this form k in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america applied on a consistent basis and which follow general practice within the banking industry 
accordingly  management of the company is required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that it believes to be reasonable based upon the information available 
these estimates  judgments and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net interest income  the provision for loan losses  noninterest income and noninterest expense during the periods presented 
based on its consideration of accounting policies that involve the most complex and subjective estimates and assumptions as well as its analysis of whether and to what extent such estimates and assumptions will have a material impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations  management has identified the following critical accounting policies 
due to uncertainty inherent in these matters  actual results of future operations could differ from the estimates  judgments and assumptions used in applying these critical accounting policies 
reserve for loan losses the reserve for loan losses is maintained at a level deemed adequate to absorb probable losses in the loan portfolio 
the determination of the adequacy of the reserve for loan losses is based upon an on going  analytical review of the loan portfolio 
this analysis requires application of judgment  subjective evaluation of economic uncertainties and assessment of business conditions that may change 
because of these and other factors  adjustments to the reserve for loan losses may be required 
the analytical review of the loan portfolio performed to determine the adequacy of the reserve for loan losses includes a review of loans with balances over thousand for impairment  an analysis of historical loss experience by loan type and  for groups of loans with similar characteristics  an evaluation of current economic conditions and all other factors considered pertinent to the analysis 
impaired loans are defined as those credits where the company has determined it probable that all amounts due in accordance with the loan agreements will not be collected or recovered from the disposition of collateral 
impaired loans are generally commercial and financial loans and commercial real estate loans and are usually on non accrual status 
each impaired loan with an outstanding balance equal to or greater than thousand has a specific  identified loan loss reserve associated with it 
impaired loans do not include groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans with similar collateral characteristics  such as residential mortgage and home equity loans 
loss reserves for these types of loans are established on an aggregate basis using historical loss experience 
balances related to impaired loans for which there are specific reserves are excluded when applying historical loss ratios to determine loan loss reserves 
the specific reserves for impaired loans are included in the reserve for loan losses 
impaired loans are valued based upon the fair value of the related collateral if the loans are collateral dependent 
for all other impaired loans  the specific reserves are based on the present values of expected cash flows discounted at each loan s initial effective interest rate 
provisions to the reserve for loan losses are charged against  or credited to  earnings in amounts necessary to maintain an adequate reserve for loan losses 
commercial loans are charged off when it is determined that they cannot be fully recovered and non commercial loans are generally charged off or loan foreclosure proceedings begun upon becoming days delinquent or at such time as permitted by law or other regulations 
recoveries of loans previously charged off are credited to the reserve for loan losses 
the company maintains its reserve for loan losses in accordance with a policy approved by the board of directors 
the company has an established methodology for analyzing its reserve for loan losses that includes an internal loan classification policy 
the company periodically reviews its loan loss methodology to ascertain that it produces accurate assessments of probable loan losses 
domestic and international loans are subjected to similar review procedures 
while the company believes its credit monitoring procedures are adequate  credit losses are  however  inherent to the business  and it is possible there may be unidentified losses in the loan portfolio at december  that may become apparent at a later date pursuant to internal analysis or pursuant to comment following regulatory examination 
the establishment of loan loss reserves for problem credits that are currently unidentified or unanticipated would negatively impact future earnings 
a charge  if any is needed  would generally be recorded in the segment in which the loan is recorded 
venture capital investments venture capital investments are accounted for at fair value with gains and losses included in noninterest income in the consolidated statements of operations 
at december   the company valued its venture capital portfolio at million 
this valuation was arrived at using a variety of factors including  but not limited to market prices  where available  and discounted  if necessary  to reflect trading history  lock up provisions  lack of market liquidity and other factors  cost  if there is no readily determinable market price and there has not been a material event  such as a follow on round of financing or strategic sale  a value higher than cost if indicated by additional financing which fulfills certain requirements  and analysis and commentary from a fund s investment manager general partner 
the largest investment in the venture capital portfolio is valued at million at december  since the company has no present intention to sell or liquidate the venture capital portfolio  the valuation of venture capital investments is subject to uncertainty in that it does not represent a negotiated value between the company  as seller  and an independent  willing buyer that has the necessary knowledge and financial ability to complete the purchase 
additionally  if the company attempted to sell its venture capital portfolio  particularly if it deemed it necessary to liquidate the investments within a short period of time  the actual proceeds from the sale could differ significantly from the recorded carrying value 
the market for the type of venture capital investments riggs holds has since been impacted by a slowing economy  a depressed domestic equity market in which  not withstanding the recent recovery of stock prices  the values of publicly traded companies have declined  and  because of these market conditions  there has been a decline in the number of initial public offerings and acquisitions of private companies by publicly traded firms 
the gradual improvement in these sectors has begun to afford the company better liquidation opportunities and it continues to actively manage the portfolio to maximize current valuations 
although these and other factors have been assessed in determining current values  because of the subjectivity in determining values  it is possible that the company would experience a loss if it chose to liquidate its venture capital portfolio  particularly if it attempted to do so quickly 
the loss  if any  would be recorded in the riggs capital partners segment 
deferred taxes the company records a provision for income taxes based upon the amount of current taxes payable or refundable and the change in net deferred tax assets or liabilities during the year 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax effects of differing carrying values of assets and liabilities for tax and financial statement reporting purposes that will reverse in future periods 
when substantial uncertainty exists concerning the recoverability of a deferred tax asset  the carrying value of the asset is reduced by a valuation allowance 
establishing a valuation allowance results in an increase in income tax expense 
unrealized losses in venture capital operations have resulted in the maintenance of million of deferred tax assets as of december  of this amount  million was established in these assets can be utilized to reduce taxes payable on future capital gains but must be utilized within five years of the year in which the loss is realized for tax return purposes 
because of continuing losses in the venture capital portfolio and the lack of current suitability of alternatives to generate capital gains  riggs has established a valuation allowance of million against the deferred tax asset at december  of the million  million was established in the company believes that the unreserved deferred tax asset balance of million at december   which includes a deferred tax asset related to realized losses of million  will be realized through generation of future net capital gains within its venture capital operations or the implementation of alternative business strategies that generate net capital gains 
management has identified several alternative business strategies that could produce sufficient capital gains to allow the deferred tax asset balance to be realized 
if sufficient net capital gains within the company s venture capital operations are not realized in a timely manner  or if business conditions or other factors make it impossible  impractical or imprudent to implement alternative strategies  an additional valuation allowance  resulting in a charge against income for that portion of the deferred tax asset which will not be utilized  will be recorded in the other segment 
uncertainty related to the utilization of deferred tax amounts generated by foreign subsidiaries resulted in the maintenance of a valuation allowance of million and million as of december  and  respectively 
impairment of long lived assets the company tests for impairment in the carrying value of any asset or group of assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
intangible assets  which were million at december   are reviewed for impairment on at least an annual basis 
in  the company contracted to develop  implement and maintain a computer system to be utilized by the united states department of the treasury treasury in its cash management and reporting 
because of cost overruns and significant uncertainties relating to costs required to complete the system  the willingness of the treasury to fund these additional costs and the recurring revenues to be realized upon implementation of the system  the company recorded impairment charges of million and million in and  respectively 
there was no impairment charge in related to this asset 
this system became operational in september and  subsequent to december   riggs and the government have substantially concluded negotiations that significantly reduce the uncertainties regarding recovery of costs incurred on the contract 
accordingly  beginning in the first quarter of the company will no longer report this matter as a component of its critical accounting policies and estimates 
results of operations net interest income net interest income is the company s largest revenue source representing  and of all revenues in  and  respectively 
revenues of the company include net interest income and noninterest income 
net interest income is affected by changes in the level of interest rates and the composition of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
while the company can exert some effect on its net interest income through its product pricing and promotional decisions  many factors  such as the overall condition of the economy  monetary policy  tax laws  credit demand and competition impact net interest income and are beyond the control of the company see tables a and b of this form k 
net interest income decreased million  or  in compared to and in increased million  or less than  from in general  across almost all components of interest income  decreases in rates more than offset increases in interest income due to increases in volume 
as a result  interest income decreased million  from million in to million in a similar analysis applies to the comparison of to  when interest income decreased million from million in to million in the decline in net interest income in from the prior year is due primarily to the rapid repayment of existing loans  particularly mortgage loans  stimulated by low interest rates 
the company estimates that approximately of its mortgage loan balances at december  were paid off during and an additional of these balances were refinanced into lower rates 
while riggs participated aggressively in the competitive refinancing market  the loans it recorded were at lower rates than those previously on its books 
in addition  many of the older loans had net deferred acquisition costs and purchase premiums which were charged against income at payoff 
net interest income was also adversely impacted by a mid year change in the methodology by which the treasury compensates financial agent banks 
prior to july   riggs was compensated by net interest earned on treasury deposits  which was reflected in net interest income 
beginning on this date  riggs utilizes non interest earning treasury deposits to purchase a non marketable  treasury issued depositary compensation security dcs for the same amount as the treasury deposits 
the dcs and deposit balances are netted in the statements of financial condition in accordance with fin offsetting of amounts related to certain contracts and income earned on the dcs  which was million in  is reflected in the statements of operations as non interest income  rather than a component of net interest income 
the average deposit balance that the treasury maintained at riggs to compensate it as a financial agent bank was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
beginning october   due to the adoption of fin r  the company does not consolidate the two trusts that previously issued million of trust preferred securities  of which million have been repurchased by the company 
as a result  the debt from the company to these trusts no longer eliminates in consolidation and  consequently  the interest on this debt  which was million for the fourth quarter of  negatively impacts net interest income in  but not prior years 
net interest margin was in compared to and in and  respectively 
as noted in table b  the net interest margin decreases in both compared to and compared to are attributable to decreases in interest rates which were partially offset by volume increases 
as reported in the annual report on form k  the company completed a leveraging program whereby it borrowed funds from the federal home loan bank of atlanta fhlb and utilized those funds to purchase mortgage backed securities 
riggs had million and million of borrowings from the fhlb at december  and  respectively 
these borrowings generally are not repayable prior to maturity and  hence  as the mortgages in the mortgage backed securities paid off or refinanced into a lower rate it was not possible for riggs to concurrently lower its funding costs  thereby negatively impacting net interest income 
the leveraging program was expanded during and the average assets in this program were approximately million 
the company anticipated earning a minimum interest rate spread of on these leveraged assets but  because of rapid repayments  estimates its actual spread was approximately 
the company anticipates that interest rates will not decline further and will begin to rise in as a result  the company expects reduced loan pay offs and refinancings in and anticipates improvement in its net interest margin 
interest income on a tax equivalent basis in was million  a decline of million  or  from million in on a tax equivalent basis  interest income decreased million from to as indicated in table a of this form k  average earning assets have increased from billion in to billion in the rates earned on these assets decreased from in to in and in average loan balances increased by million in compared to and decreased by million in compared to in riggs realigned its rbel operations to focus on expatriate and embassy banking rather than on corporate lending and  consequently  sold million in loans and loan commitments 
the next largest average earning asset category  securities available for sale  increased million or from to and million in compared to as with loan yields discussed above  rates earned on available for sale securities declined from in to in and further decreased to in because of attractive tax equivalent rates  riggs acquired state and municipal securities in riggs had an average balance of thousand of these securities in which are classified as securities available for sale and yield on a tax equivalent basis 
the composition of average earning assets for the past three years is as follows loans securities available for sale securities held to maturity time deposits with other banks federal funds sold and reverse repurchase agreements interest expense decreased by million from to decreases in interest expense allocated to decreases in rates occurred across all components of interest expense 
these decreases  along with decreases in the volume of time deposits in domestic offices  were almost entirely offset by increases in interest expense due to a higher volume of long term debt 
the average cost of all interest bearing funds decreased to in from in and further decreased to in this result contrasts with the comparison between and  when the million decrease in interest expense attributable to decreases in rates were far greater than the million increase in interest expense attributable to increases in volume 
the composition of average interest bearing liabilities for the past three years is as follow interest bearing deposits federal funds purchased and repurchase agreements other short term borrowings long term debt provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses in was million compared to thousand in and million in nonaccrual and renegotiated loans were million  thousand and million at december   and  respectively 
this represents  and of all loans at december   and  respectively 
see table j 
noninterest income noninterest income represented of the company s revenue and was and of the company s total revenue in and  respectively 
excluding net securities gains  noninterest income increased by million  or in from including net securities gains  noninterest income increased by million  or from the prior year 
the increase in noninterest income in was primarily attributable to a million reduction in venture capital losses from similarly  venture capital losses decreased to million in from million in also contributing to the increase in noninterest income was a million increase in service charges and fee income in compared to this increase was primarily the result of new fee initiatives initiated as part of project eps 
partially offsetting these improvements was a million  or decrease in trust and investment advisory income 
trust and investment advisory income was adversely impacted by the second quarter renegotiation of a year agreement with the real estate advisor to the multi employer property trust mept  an open commingled real estate fund 
this advisor will now perform all asset management services for the fund but riggs will continue to act as trustee  investment manager and custodian  and will provide portfolio level financial and valuation reporting 
the new agreement  which became effective july   resulted in a reduction in revenue of approximately million from noninterest income in also includes million of life insurance proceeds and a million gain on the sale of the riggs mutual funds 
securities gains were million and million in and  respectively 
substantially all of the s securities gains were attributable to the sale of concord efs  inc  a company in which riggs had an equity investment for many years 
trust and investment advisory income impacts the riggs co 
segment while venture capital losses impact the riggs capital partners segment 
securities gains impact the treasury segment 
service charges and fee income primarily impacts the banking segment 
noninterest expense noninterest expense increased by million  or  to million in compared to million in in  noninterest expenses were adversely impacted by million of consulting and other costs incurred in conjunction with project eps  million of consulting costs incurred to improve the bank s compliance with bsa  a million write down of a building the company is attempting to sell and a thousand write down of goodwill 
in and  respectively  the company approved for award  and  shares to certain key executives under a deferred stock award agreement subject to performance and time vesting 
based on achieved and performance targets   shares were awarded at december  and none at december  the  deferred shares earned at december  will vest in three equal annual installments  beginning in january of a total of thousand in stock compensation expense was recorded at december  and is included in pension and other employee benefits in the consolidated statements of operations 
future expense amounts could vary since the individual to whom the award was granted must be employed by the company on the distribution date each year and new participants could be added 
in riggs increased its matching of employee k plan contributions from for every dollar contributed up to of eligible wages to a dollar for dollar match up to of eligible wages 
this change in matching resulted in an increase in pension and other employee benefits expense of million in compared to pension and other employee benefits costs affect all segments with the exception of riggs capital partners 
in and  respectively  the company awarded  and  shares of its common stock to certain key executives under the terms of a plan approved by shareholders in april this award will vest annually in equal amounts over a period of four to five years  beginning in january and january for the years ended and  respectively  riggs recorded million and thousand of expense related to this award which is recorded in pension and other employee benefits in the consolidated statements of operations 
new participants may be added and  in addition  to obtain this award  the individual to whom it was granted must be employed by the company on the date of distribution each year 
projected expense amounts  therefore  could vary 
the company recorded impairment charges amounting to approximately million in and million in the impairment charge includes a thousand write down of goodwill and also includes a million write down of a facility in london that the company is attempting the sell 
this facility was written down by million in the amount of these facility write downs was determined based upon consultation with real estate experts 
in  as part of project eps  riggs also wrote off million in costs related to prior development of an information system to support bank tellers when it was determined that this development would not be compatible with the company s new technology 
in london  the company incurred a charge of million to exit long term maintenance contracts in and domestically  it wrote down a long term  fixed price  non cancelable technology contract by million due to cost overruns that will not be passed on to subcontractors or other parties to the contract 
noninterest expense increased by million  or to million in compared to million in approximately million of this increase  or  is attributable to the restructuring and other charges described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
other significant changes from the prior year include an additional million or increase in salaries and wages  a million increase in pension and other employee benefits that is primarily attributable to a million increase in the actuarially determined domestic pension plan expense and a million increase in consultants and outsourcing fees  which is primarily due to increased management fees related to an additional venture capital partnership 
decreases in advertising and public relations expense of million partially offset these increases 
in  the company reduced its workforce by  from  full time equivalent positions at december  to  at december  financial position and liquidity summary total assets declined from billion at december  to billion at december   a decrease at million 
the decrease was primarily attributable to decreases in cash and cash equivalents of million and securities available for sale of million  offset in part by an increase in net loans of million  increases in other assets of million  the establishment of a securities held to maturity portfolio of million and an increase in time deposits with other banks of million 
earning assets loans  securities available for sale  securities held to maturity and other short term investments are the company s primary earning assets 
at december   and these assets represented approximately  and  respectively  of the company s total assets and of the company s average assets for each of those years 
loans represent the largest earning asset category 
at december   and loans were  and of earning assets and  and of average earning assets for those years  respectively 
the primary reason for the decrease in compared with was the sale of million of loans and loan commitments by rbel as well as growth in the securities portfolio to secure the additional us government agency deposits 
securities available for sale  the next largest component of earning assets  were  and of earning assets at december   and  respectively  and represented  and of average earning assets for those years 
the third component of the company s earning asset mix  short term investments  was  and of earning assets at december   and  respectively  and represented  and of average earning assets for the those years 
securities held to maturity represent of the company s earning assets at december  and an insignificant portion of average earning assets in the company did not have securities held to maturity in or loans loans are primarily generated in the banking segment through both retail and commercial banking activities and in the international banking segment through embassy banking and rbel see tables c and d of this form k 
total loans at december  were billion  a million or increase from december  the largest increases were in commercial real estate loans  which increased million or  home equity loans  which increased million or  loans to foreign governments and official institutions  which increased million or  and loans to foreign commercial and industrial customers  which increased by million or 
offsetting these increases were decreases in commercial and financial loans of million or  residential mortgage loans of million or  and other foreign loans of million or total loans at december  were billion  a million  or increase from december  the largest increase occurred in commercial and financial and commercial real estate loans which increased million and million or and  respectively 
partially offsetting these increases was a million decrease in total foreign loans primarily attributable to the previously noted sale of loans and commitments at rbel 
at december   approximately of the loan portfolio matures in less than one year 
this compares to at the end of the prior year 
at december   approximately of the loan portfolio has fixed interest rates that do not adjust during the term of the loan and has floating or adjustable interest rates that adjust prior to the loan s maturity 
cross border outstandings riggs extends credit to borrowers domiciled outside of the united states primarily through its international banking segment 
cross border outstandings include loans  acceptances  interest bearing deposits with other banks  investments and other monetary assets 
in addition  cross border outstandings include guarantees issued on behalf of non local third parties and local currency outstandings to the extent they are not funded by local currency borrowings 
while the company routinely reviews these assets  monitors the international economic climate and assesses the impact of any changes on foreign domiciled borrowers  the economic value and recoverability of these assets may be affected by changing economic and political conditions in the respective countries 
in addition  some of the company s loans are to sovereign entities  some of which might be subject to deteriorating economic conditions  political and social upheaval  currency depreciation or devaluation  or other factors over which riggs has no control 
if  for any reason  a loan to such a borrower became past due or a problem credit  collection efforts would be made more difficult because of the sovereign status of the borrower 
several sovereign entities also maintain significant depository relationships with the company 
the simultaneous withdrawal of funds by several of these depositors could adversely impact the company s liquidity position 
at december   riggs had no cross border outstandings exceeding of total assets to countries experiencing difficulties in repaying their external debt 
at december  and at december   the united kingdom was the only foreign country with cross border outstandings in excess of of total assets that had loans in either a nonperforming or past due loan status 
there were no foreign countries with cross border outstandings in excess of that had loans in a nonperforming or past due loan status at december  see tables e and f of this form k and note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
short term investments short term investments are managed in the treasury segment and include time deposits with other banks  federal funds sold and reverse repurchase agreements 
these investments are liquid assets with original maturities generally of less than days 
short term investments are generally lower yielding assets that are highly interest rate sensitive 
the amount of funds available for short term investments is a function of daily movements in the securities  loan and deposit portfolios combined with the company s interest rate risk management strategy 
at december   short term investments totaled million  a decrease of million from december  at december   short term investments totaled million  a decrease of million when compared to year end average short term investments was million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the average yield on short term investments was in  in and in securities available for sale and securities held to maturity at december   the company had billion of securities classified as available for sale of all securities and million of securities classified as held to maturity of all securities 
at december   the company had billion of securities classified as available for sale and no securities held to maturity 
the securities available for sale portfolio is managed by the treasury segment as part of the company s liquidity and interest rate risk management process 
securities available for sale are reflected in the consolidated statements of condition at fair value 
differences between amortized cost and fair value are reported net of applicable taxes as a component of other comprehensive income or loss within shareholders equity 
on a tax equivalent basis the securities available for sale portfolio yielded  and in  and  respectively 
the percentage composition at fair value of the securities available for sale portfolio at december is as follows us treasury securities state and municipal securities government agency securities mortgage backed securities other securities gross unrealized gains and losses at december  were million and million  respectively 
approximately of the available for sale securities have been issued by the us treasury  an agency of the us government or a government sponsored entity such as the federal national mortgage association or the federal home loan mortgage corporation and therefore the repayment of substantially all securities is either guaranteed by the government or a aaa rated entity 
as a result  timely payment of principal and interest is assured and any unrealized gain or loss is primarily attributable to changes in market interest rates 
all of the company s state and municipal securities are insured by an independent  non government third party as to repayment of principal and interest 
at december   and   and of the available for sale portfolio matures within one year and the portfolio duration is   and years  respectively 
although most of the securities have contractual maturity dates that are greater than one year  many have call features which allow the issuer to call the securities away from the bank 
anticipated calls of securities and estimated mortgage prepayments on mortgage backed securities have been factored into the overall portfolio duration calculation see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
see minority interest in trust preferred securities for a discussion of securities held to maturity on page venture capital investments venture capital investments amounted to million at december  and million at the close of the prior year 
the company recorded a loss of million on its venture capital investments in that is primarily attributable to unrealized losses in the fair value of its venture capital investments 
in  the company recorded a million loss  substantially unrealized  on these investments see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the losses in and are attributable to several factors 
first  there has been a general slowing of the domestic economy that was exacerbated by the terrorist attacks in september and continued uncertainty about potential military conflict 
this slowing resulted in large corporations reducing their spending on information technology assets which in turn affected the financial performance and valuations of information technology vendors to which the company s venture capital portfolio was exposed 
while the technology sector of the stock market experienced a rebound in  it remains at depressed levels relative to prior years 
second  the domestic stock market in general declined in and and  in particular  the valuations of publicly traded technology companies declined dramatically 
as a result  the company reduced the carrying value of a number of privately held investments in order to better align its valuations with those of comparable publicly traded companies 
third  initial public offerings ipos and acquisitions by public companies of private companies has declined significantly from prior years 
since venture capital investors typically look to the ipo process and acquisitions as a means of liquidating investments  the lack of such markets was detrimental to the value of investments held 
as previously noted  at december  the company maintained a million valuation allowance against total deferred tax assets of million relating to venture capital losses 
the company has concluded that it is more likely than not that the remaining deferred tax assets which are attributable to losses from venture capital operations will be realized through capital gains generated by its venture capital operations or through such gains generated elsewhere within the company 
commitments and liquidity at december   the company had approximately billion of loan commitments outstanding and was contingently liable for million of letters of credit 
the company also is obligated to fund million of venture capital commitments and has various other contractual obligations arising in the normal course of business  including approximately million of contractual obligations payable in see table o and note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
at december   the company believes it has the necessary liquidity to meet these obligations 
as noted previously  the company had million of short term investments and has approximately million of unused credit lines at december  the securities available for sale portfolio has a relatively short duration of years which can  with the exception of the state and municipal securities  be pledged to secure borrowings 
the company has million of loans and securities available for sale maturing in in addition  despite the fact that average interest bearing deposits declined by million from to  substantially all of this decline is due to a million decline in average time deposits in domestic offices from to the decrease in average time deposits is domestic offices from to is almost entirely attributable to the change in the previously described change in the methodology by which the treasury compensates financial agent banks 
as a result of this change  average treasury time deposits utilized to compensate riggs as a financial agent bank were million less in than average non interest bearing deposits were million in and million in because of these factors  the company believes that its deposit base comprises a stable source of funding 
in late february the bank informed a large depositor that it was terminating its depositary relationship with the customer 
at the end of february this depositor and related parties had approximately million of deposits at the bank  or approximately of the bank s total deposits 
the bank has adequate liquidity to fund this withdrawal 
changes in the stability of the economic  social or political environments culminating in further withdrawals by several of the bank s largest depositors  or a deterioration of the public s confidence in the banking system in general or the company in particular  could be very detrimental 
the further withdrawal of funds by a combination of large depositors could have an adverse impact on the company s liquidity and operations as would the withdrawal of funds by a significant portion of the company s smaller balance depositors 
in addition  the fhlb has the authority to cancel the company s unused lines of credit 
another potential constraint on liquidity is the regulatory limitations on dividends that the bank can pay to rnc 
generally  such dividends are limited to the earnings of the bank for the current and prior two years less any dividend payments during the same period 
however  dividends payable by the bank and its subsidiaries are further limited by requirements for the maintenance of adequate capital and the underlying strength of the bank 
any restrictions on dividends that the bank can pay to rnc could adversely impact the holding company s cash flow and its ability to fund future debt payments and dividends 
since regulatory authorities maintain that a holding company should be a source of financial strength for its subsidiary bank  dividends paid by the bank to the company  or by the company to its shareholders  may be restricted if the regulators conclude that the company s operating condition so warrants 
asset quality credit risk administration since the loan portfolio is the company s largest component of earning assets  one of the company s primary objectives is to maintain a high quality loan portfolio 
this is achieved through promulgation of and adherence to loan underwriting standards and regular evaluation of credit risk within the portfolio 
the potential for loss is  however  inherent to the lending process 
riggs attempts to minimize this risk by stressing the integrity  financial strength and liquidity of borrowers and  if integral to the granting of credit  the stability of supporting collateral values 
the credit administration function establishes credit policies including those related to credit underwriting  limits on the ability of an individual loan officer or group of loan officers to extend credit  policies addressing concentrations of credit risk and internal credit scoring 
the credit administration function reports to a chief credit officer who works with the various business units to ensure the integrity of established procedures and policies 
in addition  the company maintains a loan review group that monitors compliance with these policies and thereby further ensures the integrity of the credit process see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
provision and reserve for loan losses the adequacy of the reserve for loan losses is determined based on an analysis of the composition of the loan portfolio  the level and trend of loan delinquencies  the financial condition of specific delinquent or problem borrowers and related guarantors  historical charge off rates  general economic and industry specific conditions and all other factors deemed relevant  including supervisory comment during the examination process 
based upon this analysis  which is performed quarterly and reviewed by a standing management committee  a provision for loan losses is recorded to maintain the reserve for loan losses at a level adequate to absorb probable losses in the portfolio 
for loan pools with homogeneous characteristics  such as residential mortgage  home equity and consumer loans  provisions are determined using historical loss factors 
for non homogeneous loans  the company allocates specific reserves for loan losses to individual loans in the highest risk categories and provides for the remainder using historical factors 
in addition  the company maintains a qualitative component in its reserve for loan losses 
this portion of the reserve is adjusted when the company concludes that recent charge off experience may not be indicative of future experience  either adverse general economic or industry specific conditions are not manifested as specific problem credits or in delinquency ratios  or the company knows of specific potentially adverse events or conditions of a borrower 
the company maintains its reserve for loan losses in accordance with a board of directors approved policy 
based upon the above  the company recorded a loan loss provision of million in at december   the reserve for loan losses was million  or approximately of loans and of the company s nonaccrual  renegotiated  and days past due credits 
foreign nonperforming assets represent approximately of consolidated nonperforming assets including days past due credits 
the company recorded a loan loss provision of thousand in at december   the reserve for loan losses was million  or approximately 
of loans and of the company s nonaccrual  renegotiated and days past due credits 
the foreign loan loss provision in was approximately million and the domestic provision was million 
the foreign reversal was taken as those reserves were no longer necessary since foreign nonperforming assets decreased by million  or  from the prior year end  aggregate loan balances decreased due to significant pay downs and maturities and the company sold million in commercial loans and commitments from its london operations 
riggs recorded a loan loss provision of million in this provision was comprised of a million foreign provision and a million domestic provision 
the domestic provision was the result of a reduction in domestic nonperforming loans from million at december  to thousand a year later 
during the three years ended december   the reserve for loan losses as a percentage of loans has decreased from to 
during this same period  nonaccrual  renegotiated and days past due credits decreased from million to million 
in addition  of the company s portfolio is secured by residential real estate at december  traditionally  net losses on such loans have been minimal see table h of this form k 
foreign exchange translation adjustments in the reserve for loan losses were thousand and thousand in and  respectively 
these adjustments relate to reserves recorded in british pounds sterling  and are made to account for changes in our reserve for loan losses resulting from fluctuating foreign exchange rates 
the estimated allocation of the reserve for loan losses by loan category is detailed in table i of this form k and represents the company s assessment of existing conditions and risk factors within these categories 
changes in the risk characteristic and loan amounts within the loan portfolio affect the overall level of required reserves 
nonperforming assets and past due loans nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans  renegotiated loans  other real estate owned and other repossessed assets 
nonaccrual loans are loans for which recognition of interest income has been discontinued 
impaired loans are nonaccrual loans for which it is probable that all amounts due will not be collected according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement see tables j and k of this form k 
riggs evaluates each past due commercial loan commercial and financial loans and commercial real estate loans and discontinues the accrual of interest based on the delinquency status  an evaluation of any collateral and the financial condition of the borrower 
if there is doubt as to the collection of either principal or interest  or when interest or principal is days past due and the commercial loan is not well secured and in the process of collection  it is placed into nonaccrual status 
a nonaccrual loan may be restored to accrual status when interest and principal payments are brought current and the collection of future payments is not in doubt 
nonaccrual loans totaled million at december   an increase of million from december  income recognition on non commercial loans is discontinued and the loans are generally charged off or loan foreclosure proceedings begun upon becoming days delinquent or at such time as permitted by law or other regulations 
at this point  any uncollected interest is eliminated from income 
renegotiated loans are those loans where there has been an extension of the original repayment period or a reduction of the obligation to pay principal or interest because of a deterioration in the borrower s financial position 
there were no renegotiated loans at december  or loans are transferred into other real estate owned and other repossessed assets owned when collateral securing the loans is acquired through foreclosure 
other real estate and other repossessed assets owned totaled thousand on december  compared to thousand on december  the days past due loan category amounted to million and million at december  and  respectively 
the balances are primarily attributable to secured residential real estate loans that are in the process of collection and are accruing interest 
at december   the company identified thousand of potential problem loans compared to million of such loans at december  the current year balance consists of six mortgage credits 
potential problem loans are defined as loans that are currently performing but which have certain attributes that may lead to nonaccrual or past due status in the foreseeable future 
foreign loans and other credits may be adversely affected by social  economic and political instabilities  including military confrontations 
the company cannot estimate the losses  if any  associated with any such instabilities see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
deposits and funding sources deposits  short term borrowings  fhlb and long term debt and  until october   trust preferred securities were the company s principal funding sources 
for  these funding sources averaged billion  an increase of million from the billion for in  these funding sources averaged billion 
beginning on october   trust preferred securities are no longer a funding source for the company but  rather  because of the company s previously discussed adoption of fin r  the debt the company has to the two trusts that issued the trust preferred securities is considered a funding source 
deposits deposit balances are the primary funding source of the company 
the average deposit balance for was billion which compares to average deposit balances of billion in and billion in average interest bearing deposits were billion  billion and billion in  and  respectively 
average deposit balances and average interest bearing deposit balances were significantly impacted by the amount of deposits maintained at riggs by the treasury to compensate the company as a financial agent bank and the previously discussed change in methodology by which riggs as a financial agent bank is compensated by the treasury 
as previously noted  the average treasury deposit balances to compensate riggs as a financial agent bank were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
average demand deposits were million  million and million in  and as a means of reducing deposit reserve requirements  the company periodically sweeps excess demand funds into money market accounts 
the average balances transferred  which are not included in demand deposits in table a of this form k  were million in compared to million and million in and  respectively 
the average cost of interest bearing deposits was  and in  and  respectively 
the change in the cost of these funds is primarily attributable to actions of the federal reserve 
from december  to year end  the federal reserve lowered its target federal funds rate by bps  from to 
short term borrowings short term borrowings consist primarily of federal funds purchased and repurchase agreements and  to a lesser extent  short term fhlb borrowings 
these obligations are an additional source of funds used to meet liquidity and interest rate risk management objectives 
on average  short term borrowings were million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the cost of these funds was  and for  and  respectively see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
riggs has secured and unsecured lines of credit with various parties in the amount of billion that can be drawn upon to meet potential funding requirements 
million of these facilities are unused as of december  the fhlb can cancel at any time any unused portion of the credit facilities 
any borrowings under these facilities are subject to the negotiated terms 
fhlb borrowings and other long term debt the billion balance of long term debt at december  consists of million subordinated debentures due in  million payable to the two entities that issued the company s trust preferred securities  million in fhlb advances and in repurchase agreements 
the million subordinated debentures have a fixed interest rate of and are not callable in advance of maturity 
the effective cost of this debt is 
the fhlb advances have maturity dates through and carry a blended interest rate of 
the fhlb may exercise its option to call million of these advances prior to scheduled maturity 
in  million of these advances having an average rate of are repayable 
the million of repurchase agreements mature between and and have an average rate of 
average long term debt was million in compared to million in and million in minority interest in trust preferred securities trust preferred securities totaled at december  included in these securities are million of securities issued in and million of securities issued in the securities were issued by two wholly owned subsidiaries of the company and are classified on the consolidated statements of condition as guaranteed preferred beneficial interests in junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures 
the related expense is included on the year to date september  and december  and consolidated statements of operations as minority interest in income of subsidiaries  net of taxes 
dividends are paid semi annually and these securities cannot be redeemed for ten years from the date of issuance 
the securities have a final maturity of years from their issuance date 
dividends are cumulative and deferrable for a period not to exceed five years 
these securities qualify as tier i capital  with certain limitations 
amounts not included in tier i capital are included in tier ii capital see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
as previously noted  on october  the company adopted fin r and no longer consolidates the two entities that issued its trust preferred securities 
because of this  the company no longer has minority interest expense attributable to the trust preferred securities 
rather  at december  the consolidated statements of condition reflect long term debt of million which is payable by the company to the entities that have issued the trust preferred securities 
beginning october  interest on this debt is included in interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
trust preferred securities that the company has repurchased  totaling million are now reflected as securities held to maturity in the consolidated statements of condition and interest earned on these securities is included in interest income in the consolidated statements of operations 
the market value of these securities is million at december  since the rate on both the series a and series c trust preferred securities is generally above yields that the company can earn on its short term investments  loans and securities  the company is attempting to repurchase additional trust preferred securities but will only do so if the repurchase terms are acceptable 
during the first quarter of  the company acquired more than of the debentures of one of the series  and the company intends to reconsolidate the subsidiary that issued the guaranteed preferred beneficial interests in junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures 
sensitivity to market and other risk as previously noted  the company is exposed to various business risks 
two types of market risk that could materially impact the operating results of the company are interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange exposure 
though the company s asset liability committee alco closely monitors its exposure to these risks  the modeling of these risks requires a variety of assumptions including the level of interest rates  the shape of the yield curve  the asset and liability mix and the path of foreign exchange rates 
if the actual results vary significantly from the forecast  or if errors occur in the company s modeling techniques  the company may be limited in controlling or mitigating such risks 
riggs manages its interest rate risk through the use of an income simulation model which forecasts the impact on net interest income of a variety of different interest rate scenarios 
a most likely interest rate scenario is forecasted based upon an analysis of current market conditions and expectations 
the model then evaluates the impact on net interest income of rates moving significantly higher or lower than the most likely scenario 
most likely is defined as the outlook of the bank s treasury segment on the path of future interest rates 
as of december   the most likely interest rate scenario calls for the federal funds target rate to be through july the federal funds target rate then rises gradually to by june  holding at that level for the remainder of the forecast horizon 
the results are compared to risk tolerance limits set by corporate policy 
the model s results as of december  are shown in table m of this form k 
current policy establishes limits for possible changes in net interest income for and month horizons 
the interest rate scenarios monitored by alco are based upon a bp gradual increase or decrease in rates over a month time period versus the most likely scenario and a bp gradual increase or decrease in rates over a month time period versus the most likely scenario 
as of december   the forecasted impact of rates rising or falling bp versus the most likely scenario over a month time period was a change in net interest income not exceeding 
for a bp movement in rates versus the most likely scenario over a month period  the impact on net interest income did not exceed 
the results of the simulation for december  indicated that the bank was liability sensitive due to a large portion of its assets being comprised of fixed rate instruments 
earnings benefit from the down bp versus most likely from increasing spreads on fixed rate assets but are offset somewhat by floors on deposits and faster prepayment rates on mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities 
in managing interest rate risk  alco uses financial derivative instruments  such as interest rate swaps 
financial derivatives are employed to assist in the management and or reduction of interest rate risk and can effectively alter the interest rate sensitivity of the company 
along with financial derivative instruments  the income simulation model includes assumptions about short term financial instruments  investment securities  loans  deposits  and other borrowings 
at december  and  the company s cumulative one year gap was billion and million  respectively 
a negative gap position indicates that the company would be adversely impacted by rising interest rates since interest bearing deposits would reprice more quickly than interest earning assets 
the company does not monitor its interest rate risk exposure through gap measurement techniques but rather utilizes the income simulation techniques discussed above 
at december   riggs had million in commitments to purchase foreign currency and million in commitments to sell foreign currency 
included in the commitments to sell foreign currency was a foreign exchange contract for a notional amount of million to hedge the investment in london based legal entities 
in addition  interest rate swaps were used to hedge interest rate risk 
at december   there were interest rate swaps totaling million in notional principal balances of which million was used to hedge cash flows from variable rate liabilities see note to consolidated financial statements 
capital resources one of the company s fundamental objectives is to maintain a level of capitalization that promotes depositor and investor confidence 
in addition to maintaining conservative loan underwriting standards  the company places an emphasis on capital strength and its ability to withstand unfavorable economic conditions and business losses 
the company s policy is to ensure that the bank is capitalized in accordance with regulatory guidelines 
as previously discussed  the bank is subject to minimum capital ratios as prescribed by the occ  which are essentially the same as those prescribed by the federal reserve board for bank holding companies 
however  as previously noted  the company has changed the method by which it accounts for trust preferred securities 
because of this change  banking regulators  which currently allow trust preferred securities to be included in regulatory capital to a limited extent  may in the future exclude trust preferred securities from the calculation of regulatory capital 
total shareholders equity at december  was million  a million decrease from year end the decrease was primarily the result of unrealized securities losses  net of taxes of million and million in dividend payments for the year 
offsetting these decreases to equity were increases of million related to issuance of the company s common stock  a million unrealized gain after tax on the company s hedging activities  a million foreign exchange after tax translation gain and net income of thousand 
total shareholders equity at december  was million  a million increase from year end the increase was primarily the result of net income of million  unrealized after tax securities gains of million  and a million increase in paid in capital due to the previously described trust preferred securities repurchases 
these increases were partially offset by million in dividend payments for the year 
banking regulators have issued risk based capital guidelines for banks and bank holding companies 
these requirements provide minimum total  tier i  and leverage capital ratios that measure capital adequacy 
the total capital ratio measures combined tier i and tier ii capital to risk weighted assets 
the tier i capital ratio measures tier i capital to risk weighted assets 
the leverage capital ratio measures tier i capital to average assets 
at december  and  the company s and bank s capital ratios significantly exceeded the well capitalized levels under each of the regulatory ratios see table n of this form k and note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
as previously noted  because of fin r and the deconsolidation of the two entities that have issued trust preferred securities  regulatory authorities may conclude at a future date that the trust preferred securities should no longer be included as a component of tier i regulatory capital 
the company has determined that it and the bank would continue to be well capitalized at december  without including the trust preferred securities as a component of regulatory capital 
fourth quarter vs 
fourth quarter for the quarter ended december   the company reported a net loss of million  or 
per share  compared to net income of million  or per diluted share  in the fourth quarter of net interest income was million in the fourth quarter of compared to million in the comparable quarter of the prior year  a decrease of 
this decrease is primarily attributable to the previously discussed changes as a result of the company s adoption of fin r on october  and mid year changes in the methodology by which riggs  as a financial agent bank  is compensated by the treasury 
average earning assets were billion and billion and the net interest margin was and for the fourth quarter of and  respectively 
the company provided million and thousand for loan losses in the fourth quarter of and  respectively  reflecting strong loan growth in the fourth quarter of compared to the comparable quarter of the prior year 
noninterest income totaled million in the fourth quarter of  an increase of thousand from the million in the comparable quarter of the prior year primarily due to the decreases in venture capital losses noted previously
