item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto 
overview hecla mining company is a precious metals company engaged in the exploration  development  mining and processing of silver  gold  lead and zinc 
we are organized and managed primarily on the basis of our products being produced from our operating units  which during included three primary silver operations  the san sebastian unit in mexico the mexico segment  the greens creek unit in alaska and the lucky friday unit in idaho both in the united states segment  and one gold operation  the la camorra unit in venezuela the venezuela segment 
we produce both metal concentrates  which we sell to custom smelters on contract  and unrefined gold and silver bullion bars dor  which is further refined before sale to metals traders 
our revenue is derived from the sale of silver  gold  lead and zinc and  as a result  our earnings are directly related to the prices of these metals 
silver  gold  lead and zinc prices fluctuate widely and are affected by numerous factors beyond our control 
we have seen recent rises in the prices of the metals we produce and the price increases have assisted in our improved revenues and cash flows 
in the event these metals prices decline  we feel our strong balance sheet and low cost properties will allow us to continue to be successful 
in  we produced more silver at a record low average total cash cost than at any other time in our year history 
in addition  our silver proven and probable reserves increased as the result of a new development plan at the lucky friday unit 
our gold production was approximately less during  when compared to our record production in  however gold proven and probable reserves increased during as a result of successful exploration efforts in venezuela 
our balance sheet improved during with the issuance of million shares of common stock for million in net proceeds 
our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments increased from million at the end of to million at the end of our operating cash flow during was million  a increase over s operating cash flow of million  and debt had been reduced to million by the end of the year 
one of the risks we face is that our mines have a relatively small amount of proven and probable reserves  primarily because we have low volume  underground operations 
throughout our century long history  that has always been the case and is likely to be so in the future 
our strategy to increase production and expand our proven and probable reserves is to focus on development and exploration at  or in the vicinity of  our currently owned properties  as well as potential future acquisitions 
we are in the early stages of exploration in several locations on a majority of our land positions  and during  we will continue our investment in exploration to enable us to achieve our production goals 
we continue to face risks associated with environmental litigation and ongoing reclamation activities 
during the third quarter of  we recorded a million accrual for future reclamation and remediation  including million for potential liability within the coeur d alene basin area and million for future expenditures at the grouse creek mine in central idaho 
in the coeur d alene basin litigation  the judge found that we have some liability 
we estimate that the range of our potential liability is million to million and we have accrued the minimum amount in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  as we believe there is no amount within the range that is more probable 
the court has set january  as the date of the second phase of this trial 
we will continue to manage and prepare for this matter  although the ultimate outcome is not known at this time 
during the fourth quarter of  we entered into exchange agreements with holders of approximately of the then outstanding series b preferred stock in exchange for shares of common stock 
in february  we further reduced the number of preferred shares outstanding by  shares  or 
currently  a total of  shares of preferred stock remain outstanding 
the reduction was accomplished via an exchange offer for preferred stock  which was completed on february   whereby each preferred shareholder who elected to exchange received shares of common stock for each preferred share owned 
in order to eliminate the effect of our dividend arrearages on our capital raising activities  we intend to evaluate and potentially implement further programs to reduce the number of remaining preferred shares outstanding  including the possible redemption of shares 
the following table displays our actual silver and gold production in thousand ounces by operation for the years ended december   and  and projected silver and gold production for the year ending december  projected actual silver ounce production san sebastian unit    greens creek unit     lucky friday unit     total silver ounces     gold ounce production la camorra unit san sebastian unit greens creek unit other sources total gold ounces production commenced in may at the san sebastian unit

 total production costs per ounce oz 
 average metals prices silver handy harman oz 
gold realized oz 
gold london final oz 
lead lme cash pound zinc lme cash pound the lower costs per silver ounce during compared to  and compared to  are due in part to significant by product credits from an increased gold price and increased production from our silver operating properties 
our costs per ounce amounts are calculated pursuant to standards of the gold institute 
costs per ounce of gold are based on the gold produced from gold operating properties only 
gold produced from san sebastian and greens creek is treated as a by product credit in calculating silver costs per ounce 
cash costs per ounce of silver or gold represent non gaap measurements that management uses to monitor and evaluate the performance of its mining operations 
we believe cash costs per ounce of silver or gold provide an indicator of cash flow generation at each location and on a consolidated basis  as well as providing a meaningful basis to compare our results to those of other mining companies and other mining operating properties 
a reconciliation of this non gaap measure to cost of sales and other direct production costs  the most comparable gaap measure  can be found below under reconciliation of total cash costs non gaap to costs of sales and other direct production costs gaap 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make a wide variety of estimates and assumptions that affect i the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements  and ii the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods covered by the financial statements 
our management routinely makes judgments and estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
as the number of variables and assumptions affecting the future resolution of the uncertainties increases  these judgments become even more subjective and complex 
our accounting policies are described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we have identified our most critical accounting policies below that are most important to the portrayal of our current financial condition and results of operations 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosures presented below 
revenue recognition sales of metals products sold directly to smelters are recorded when title and risk of loss transfer to the smelter at current spot metals prices 
due to the time elapsed from the transfer to the smelter and the final settlement with the smelter generally three months  we must estimate the price at which our metals will be sold in reporting our profitability and cash flow 
recorded values are adjusted monthly until final settlement at month end metals prices 
if there was a significant variance in estimated metals prices or assays compared to the final actual metals prices and assays  our monthly results of operations could be affected 
sales of metal in products tolled  rather than sold to smelters  are recorded at contractual amounts when title and risk of loss transfer to the buyer 
changes in the market price of metals significantly affect our revenues  profitability and cash flow 
metals prices can and often do fluctuate widely and are affected by numerous factors beyond our control  such as political and economic conditions  demand  forward selling by producers  expectations for inflation  central bank sales  custom smelter activities  the relative exchange rate of the us dollar  purchases and lending  investor sentiment and global mine production levels 
the aggregate effect of these factors is impossible to predict 
because a significant portion of our revenues is derived from the sale of silver  gold  lead and zinc  our earnings are directly related to the prices of these metals 
if the market price for these metals falls below our total production costs  we will experience losses on such sales 
proven and probable ore reserves on a periodic basis  management reviews the reserves that reflect estimates of the quantities and grades of ore at our mines which management believes can be recovered and sold at prices in excess of the total cost associated with extracting and processing the ore 
management s calculations of proven and probable ore reserves are based on in house engineering and geological estimates using current operating costs  metals prices and demand for our products 
periodically  management obtains external audits of reserves 
reserve estimates will change as existing reserves are depleted through production and as production costs and or metals prices change 
changes in reserves may also reflect that actual grades of ore processed may be different from stated reserve grades because of variation in grades in areas mined  mining dilution and other factors 
reserves estimated for properties that have not yet commenced production may require revision based on actual production experience 
declines in the market price of metals  as well as increased production or capital costs  reduction in the grade or tonnage of the deposit  an increase in the dilution of the ore or reduced recovery rates  may render ore reserves uneconomic to exploit unless the utilization of forward sales contracts or other hedging techniques is sufficient to offset such effects 
if our realized price for the metals we produce  including hedging benefits  were to decline substantially below the levels set for calculation of reserves for an extended period  there could be material delays in the development of new projects  net losses  reduced cash flow  restatements or reductions in reserves and asset write downs in the applicable accounting periods 
reserves should not be interpreted as assurances of mine life or of the profitability of current or future operations 
no assurance can be given that the estimate of the amount of metal or the indicated level of recovery of these metals will be realized 
depreciation and depletion the mining industry is extremely capital intensive 
we capitalize and depreciate property  plant and equipment consistently with industry standards 
the cost of property  plant and equipment is charged to depreciation expense based on the estimated useful lives of the assets using straight line and unit of production methods 
depletion is computed using the unit of production method 
as discussed above  our estimates of proven and probable ore reserves may change  possibly in the near term  resulting in changes to depreciation  depletion and amortization rates in future reporting periods 
impairment of long lived assets management reviews the net carrying value of all facilities  including idle facilities  on a periodic basis 
we estimate the net realizable value of each property based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows that will be generated from operations at each property  the estimated salvage value of the surface plant and equipment and the value associated with property interests 
these estimates of undiscounted future cash flows are dependent upon the future metals price estimates over the estimated remaining mine life 
if undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of a property  an impairment loss is recognized based upon the estimated expected future cash flows from the property discounted at an interest rate commensurate with the risk involved 
management s estimates of metals prices  recoverable proven and probable ore reserves  and operating  capital and reclamation costs are subject to risks and uncertainties of change affecting the recoverability of our investment in various projects 
although management believes it has made a reasonable estimate of these factors based on current conditions and information  it is reasonably possible that changes could occur in the near term which could adversely affect management s estimate of net cash flows expected to be generated from our operating properties and the need for asset impairment write downs 
environmental matters our operations are subject to extensive federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations 
the major environmental laws to which we are subject include  among others  the federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla  also known as the superfund law 
cercla can impose joint and several liability for cleanup and investigation costs  without regard to fault or legality of the original conduct  on current and predecessor owners and operators of a site  as well as those who generate  or arrange for the disposal of  hazardous substances 
the risk of incurring environmental liability is inherent in the mining industry 
we own or operate property  or have owned and operated property  used for industrial purposes 
use of these properties may subject us to potential material liabilities relating to the investigation and clean up of contaminants  claims alleging personal injury or property damage as the result of exposures to  or release of  hazardous substances 
on january   we adopted sfas no 
accounting for asset retirement obligations  which requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred 
sfas no 
requires us to record a liability for the present value of our estimated environmental remediation costs and the related asset created with it 
the liability will be accreted and the asset will be depreciated over the life of the related asset 
adjustments for changes resulting from the passage of time and changes to either the timing or amount of the original present value estimate underlying the obligation will be made 
at our non operating properties  we accrue costs associated with environmental remediation obligations when it is probable that such costs will be incurred and they are reasonably estimable 
accruals for estimated losses from environmental remediation obligations have historically been recognized no later than completion of the remedial feasibility study for such facility and are charged to provision for closed operation and environmental matters 
we periodically review our accrued liabilities for remediation costs as evidence becomes available indicating that our remediation liabilities have potentially changed 
such costs are based on management s current estimate of amounts expected to be incurred when the remediation work is performed within current laws and regulations 
recoveries of environmental remediation costs from other parties are recorded as assets when their receipt is deemed probable 
future closure  reclamation and environment related expenditures are difficult to estimate in many circumstances due to the early stages of investigation  uncertainties associated with defining the nature and extent of environmental contamination  the uncertainties relating to specific reclamation and remediation methods and costs  application and changing of environmental laws  regulations and interpretations by regulatory authorities and the possible participation of other potentially responsible parties 
reserves for closure costs  reclamation and environmental matters totaled million at december   and we anticipate that expenditures relating to these reserves will be made over the next thirty years 
this amount was derived from a range of reasonable estimates in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for contingencies 
it is reasonably possible that the ultimate cost of remediation could change in the future and that changes to these estimates could have a material effect on future operating results as new information becomes known 
for environmental remediation sites known as of december   if the highest estimate from the range based upon information presently available were recorded  the total estimated liability would have increased million in for additional information  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
foreign exchange gains in venezuela beginning late in the fourth quarter of  venezuela experienced a general strike that ended in february following the general strike  the venezuelan government implemented exchange controls on foreign currency transactions 
rules and regulations regarding the implementation of exchange controls in venezuela have been published and periodically revised and or updated 
from february through the beginning of february  the venezuelan government fixed exchange rate had been  bolivares to one us dollar  which was the exchange rate we utilized to translate the financial statements of our venezuelan subsidiary included in our consolidated financial statements 
on february   the venezuelan government fixed exchange rate was increased to  bolivares to one us dollar 
due to the exchange controls in place since february  la camorra recognized a foreign exchange gain of million as a reduction to cost of sales during due to the use of multiple exchange rates in valuing us dollar denominated transactions 
as discussed above  the venezuelan government had fixed the exchange rate of the bolivar to the us dollar at  to  to as of february   however  markets outside of venezuela reflect a devaluation of the venezuelan currency at approximately 
by product credits at the san sebastian unit in mexico cash costs per ounce of silver at the san sebastian unit include significant by product credits from increased gold production and the continued increase in the price of gold 
cash costs per ounce are calculated pursuant to standards of the gold institute and are consistent with how costs per ounce are calculated within the mining industry 
for the years ended december   the total cash cost was a negative per silver ounce  compared to per silver ounce in for the years ended december  and  gold by product credits were approximately per silver ounce and per silver ounce  respectively 
by product credits at the san sebastian unit are deducted from operating costs in the calculation of cash costs per ounce 
if our accounting policy was changed to treat gold production as a co product  the following total cash costs per ounce would be reported silver gold cash costs per ounce of silver or gold represent non us generally accepted accounting principles gaap measurements that management uses to monitor and evaluate the performance of its mining operations 
we believe cash costs per ounce of silver or gold produced provide an indicator of cash flow generation at each location and on a consolidated basis  as well as providing a meaningful basis to compare our results to those of other mining companies and other mining operating properties 
a reconciliation of this non gaap measure to cost of sales and other direct production costs  the most comparable gaap measure  can be found under reconciliation of total cash costs to costs of sales and other direct production costs 
compared to for the year ended december   we recorded a net loss of million  compared to net income of million in  primarily due to an accrual in totaling million for future environmental and reclamation expenditures  offset primarily by significantly improved operating results  including a increase in gross profit 
for the years ended december  and  we recorded losses applicable to common shareholders of approximately million per common share and million per common share  respectively 
included in the losses were preferred stock dividends of million and million  respectively  for and  which included non cash dividend charges of approximately million and million  respectively  related to exchanges of preferred stock for common stock 
the non cash dividends represent the difference between the value of the common stock issued in the exchange transactions and the value of the shares of common stock that would have been issued if the shares of the preferred stock had been converted into common stock pursuant to their terms 
for more information  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in september  we recorded accruals totaling million for future environmental and reclamation expenditures  primarily for future anticipated expenditures in idaho s coeur d alene basin million and for the grouse creek mine cleanup in central idaho million 
the accrual for the coeur d alene basin was recorded in response to a united states district court ruling in september from phase i of the trial  which held that we had some liability for yet to be determined natural resource damages and response costs due to our historic mining practices 
although the us government previously issued a record of decision proposing a cleanup plan totaling approximately million  based upon the court s prior orders  including its september order and other factors and issues to be addressed by the court in phase ii of the trial  we estimated the range of our potential liability in the basin to be million to million  with no amount in the range being more likely than any other number at this time 
based upon generally accepted accounting principles  we accrued the minimum liability within the range 
as of december   we have estimated and accrued a potential liability for claims in the coeur d alene basin litigation of million 
for additional information on the coeur d alene basin and court ruling  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
at the grouse creek mine  which suspended operations in  we have commenced dewatering of the tailings impoundment and are updating a year closure plan that has provided the basis for the increase in estimated costs 
this updated year plan is currently being reviewed by regulatory agencies 
as of december   we have estimated and accrued a liability for reclamation activities at the grouse creek mine of million 
included in the loss is a positive cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of million relating to the adoption of sfas no 
accounting for asset retirement obligations 
this statement was adopted on january   and required that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred 
the gain of million represents the difference between the amounts determined under sfas no 
and amounts previously recorded in our consolidated financial statements 
for additional information  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we also benefited from a million cash settlement received from zemex corporation during the first quarter of for its subsidiary s failure to close on its agreement to purchase the kentucky tennessee clay company  kentucky tennessee feldspar corporation  kentucky tennessee clay de mexico collectively the k t group in january in furtherance of our determination to focus operations on silver and gold mining and to raise cash to retire debt and provide working capital  in  our board of directors made the decision to sell the industrial minerals segment 
in march  we completed a sale of the k t group and certain other minor inactive industrial minerals companies 
in march  we completed a sale of the pet operations of the colorado aggregate division cac of mwca  inc reflected in the loss applicable to common shareholders during is a loss from discontinued operations of million per common share 
in march  we sold the remaining inventories of the briquette division of cac  which represented the remaining portion of our industrial minerals segment 
as of december   we no longer produce or sell any product from our former industrial minerals segment and all activity during is considered a general corporate activity and presented as other where appropriate 
for the year ended december   cac reported a loss from operations of approximately  during  and  we shipped approximately  tons   tons and  tons  respectively  from the industrial minerals segment 
for additional information on our former industrial minerals segment  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the mexico segment for the year ended december   the san sebastian unit  located in the state of durango  mexico  reported sales of million  compared to million in  and income from operations of million in  compared to million in these increases are primarily due to a and increase in silver and gold production  respectively  resulting from significantly higher silver and gold ore grades  combined with higher average metals prices 
cost of sales and other direct production costs as a percentage of sales from products decreased to in  from in  primarily due to increased sales during and the cost saving transition to owner mining during the first quarter of san sebastian commenced mining operations in may and reached full capacity during the second quarter of the grade of silver ore at san sebastian improved to approximately ounces per ton during compared to ounces per ton during san sebastian had an average grade of ounce of gold per ton during and an average grade of ounce of gold per ton during despite a decrease in tons milled due to the transition to owner mining and associated learning curve that was expected  the increases in ore grade increased silver production to million ounces during when compared with million ounces produced in  while gold production increased to approximately  ounces in compared to approximately  ounces produced in silver and gold production at san sebastian are estimated to be approximately million ounces and  ounces  respectively  for the year ending december  the total cash cost at san sebastian decreased by during to a negative  from during because gold is considered a by product of our silver production  it contributed to the decrease in average total costs during the comparable periods due primarily to increased gold production and a higher average gold price 
for the years ended december  and  gold by product credits were approximately per silver ounce and per silver ounce  respectively 
the united states segment greens creek the greens creek unit  a owned joint venture arrangement with kennecott greens creek mining company located on admiralty island  near juneau  alaska  reported sales of million for our account during  as compared to million during  and income from operations of million in  compared to million in  primarily due to higher average metals prices  a increase in tons milled and a increase in silver production  resulting in approximately million ounces in  offset by lower gold and zinc production of and  respectively 
cost of sales and other direct production costs as a percentage of sales from products decreased to in  from in  primarily due to increases in gold  silver  lead and zinc prices during  all of which contributed to increased revenues 
since  greens creek has made many improvements to the mill which have led to a steady increase in processing throughput 
the increase from to was due to several minor improvements  primarily from de bottlenecking the grinding circuit 
ore grades remained approximately the same during when compared to  at approximately ounces per ton of silver for both periods and approximately ounce of gold per ton in compared to ounce of gold per ton in the total cash costs per silver ounce decreased by approximately from per silver ounce during  to per silver ounce during the decreases in costs per ounce are primarily due to the increased by product credits primarily from a higher average gold price during for the year ending december   production is forecasted to total approximately million silver ounces   ounces of gold and  and  tons of lead and zinc  respectively 
lucky friday the lucky friday unit  located in northern idaho and a producing mine for hecla since  reported sales of approximately million during  compared to million during  and income from operations of million in  compared with a loss from operations of million in the increase in both sales and income from operations during over is due primarily to an increase in metals prices and a increase in the silver ore grade resulting in approximately million ounces in silver production  an increase of over  offset slightly by a decrease in tons milled 
also contributing to the increases during both comparable periods is an increase in lead and zinc production  as well as increases in their prices 
cost of sales and other direct production costs as a percentage of sales from products decreased to in  from in  primarily due to the increase in sales  offset by increased costs for equipment upgrades and increased maintenance and development costs 
in december  we announced the approval by the board of directors to develop the level of the gold hunter deposit  currently anticipated to cost approximately million 
due primarily to the increase in silver production  the total cash costs per silver ounce for decreased to  compared to during for the year ending december   production is forecasted to total approximately million silver ounces and  tons of lead 
the venezuela segment we currently operate the la camorra unit  located in the eastern venezuelan state of bolivar  approximately miles southeast of puerto ordaz 
at the present time  la camorra is our sole designated gold operation 
sales of product decreased to million  or by  during  from sales of million in  primarily due to a decrease in gold ounces produced due to lower grade ore  offset by increases in the realized price of gold  which increased during from our realized gold price per ounce at la camorra for and was and  respectively  compared to the london final gold price per ounce of and  respectively 
our realized gold prices were less than the london final prices due to forward gold sales commitments at per ounce for a portion of our production 
as of december   a total of  ounces of gold are subject to forward contracts at the price of per ounce  all scheduled for delivery in for the year ended december   income from operations decreased to million  or  compared to million during  primarily due to the above mentioned decrease in sales  as well as an increase in exploration expenditures 
during  la camorra produced approximately  gold ounces at a total cash cost of per ounce  compared to a record year of approximately  gold ounces at a total cash cost of per ounce during during  la camorra produced gold at an average grade of ounces of gold per ton  compared to an average grade of ounce of gold per ton during total gold production for the la camorra unit  including custom milling and anticipated production from the isidora mine  is projected to reach approximately  ounces for the year ending december  cost of sales and other direct production costs as a percentage of sales from products decreased slightly to during  from during we have been able to maintain low costs during as compared to despite the lower production levels  in part due to the weakening of the venezuelan currency  the bolivar 
as described below  the venezuelan government had fixed the exchange rate of the bolivar to the us dollar at  to  to as of february   however  markets outside of venezuela reflect a devaluation of the venezuelan currency at approximately  which benefited our cost structure despite the lower production levels during beginning late in the fourth quarter of  venezuela experienced a general strike that ended in february the results of the strike included shortages of oil and gas supplies in venezuela and a severe economic downturn 
we continued to operate the la camorra unit during the general strike and were able to obtain adequate supplies  including oil and gas for our operations 
there have also been efforts in venezuela to remove the country s president from office 
in december  approximately million signatures were collected on petitions calling for a presidential recall referendum 
on march   venezuela s election council ruled that million signatures on the petitions were deemed valid  and another  signatures may be valid  if citizens confirm that they signed the petition 
a total of approximately million valid signatures are needed for a recall election 
in its ruling  the election council stated that the  citizens whose signatures may be valid need to report to voting centers between march and   to confirm they signed the petition 
this announcement has sparked protests 
although we believe we will be able to manage and operate the la camorra unit and related exploration projects successfully  due to the continued political  regulatory and economic uncertainty and its ramifications on the office of the president  exchange controls and their efforts on our operations including  among other things  labor stoppages and supplies of oil  gas and other products  there can be no assurance we will be able to operate without interruptions to our operations 
following the general strike in venezuela  the venezuelan government implemented exchange controls on foreign currency transactions 
rules and regulations regarding the implementation of exchange controls in venezuela have been published and periodically revised and or updated 
from february through the beginning of february  the venezuelan government fixed exchange rate had been  bolivares to one us dollar  which was the exchange rate we utilized to translate the financial statements of our venezuelan subsidiary included in our consolidated financial statements 
on february   the venezuela government fixed exchange rate was increased to  bolivares to one us dollar 
because of the exchange controls in place and their impact on local suppliers  some supplies  equipment parts and other items previously purchased in venezuela have been ordered outside the country 
increased lead times in receiving orders from outside venezuela has created an increased supply inventory at december   compared to december  although management is actively monitoring exchange controls in venezuela  there can be no assurance that the exchange controls will not further affect our operations in venezuela in the future 
corporate matters the provision for closed operations and environmental matters increased million during compared to  principally due to a provision for future reclamation and other closure costs during the third quarter of million  primarily for future anticipated expenditures in idaho s coeur d alene basin million and for the grouse creek mine cleanup in central idaho million as discussed above 
provision for income taxes increased million during compared to  primarily a result of utilization of deferred tax assets in mexico and accrued mexican withholding tax payable on interest expense during  offset by a net income tax benefit of approximately million primarily due to the reversal of a valuation allowance in mexico for existing net operating loss carryforwards of million 
for further information see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
exploration expense increased million during compared to  primarily due to increased exploration expenditures in mexico on the don sergio vein million and other areas at or near san sebastian million  and in venezuela on the block b concessions million and the canaima resource million  offset by lower expenditures at or near the la camorra mine million 
also included in the increased exploration expenditures during are increased project evaluation costs million and increased exploration expenditures at the lucky friday unit million 
pre development expense increased million during compared to  due to increased activity at the hollister development block in nevada 
interest income increased million  from million in to million during  primarily due to interest income received during the second and third quarters of from the mexican government for interest on unpaid value added tax receivables million and interest income generated from an increased cash balance due to the public offering in january million 
other operating income  net of other operating expenses  increased million during compared to  primarily due to a cash settlement from zemex corporation during the first quarter of for its subsidiary s failure to close on the sale of the k t group in million and lower legal  consulting and accounting expenses that were incurred related to our preferred stock exchange offer in july million 
these positive variances are offset by a foreign exchange variance in mexico million  a foreign exchange gain due to the devaluation of the venezuelan bolivar in million  lower mark to market adjustments on our outstanding gold lease rate swap  primarily due to less ounces in the contract to be delivered million  increased corporate insurance expense  primarily due to increased directors and officers liability policies million  and increased tax offset bonuses paid on employee stock option plans  as well as accruals for tax offset bonuses on employee stock options outstanding due to the increases in our common stock price throughout compared to million 
general and administrative expenses increased million during compared to  primarily due to employee incentive compensation during million 
interest expense decreased million during compared to  principally due to lower average borrowings and lower interest rates on debt 
compared to for the years ended december  and  respectively  we recorded losses applicable to common shareholders of approximately million per common share and million per common share 
included in the losses applicable to common shareholders were preferred stock dividends of million and million in and  respectively 
the dividends include a non cash dividend charge of approximately million related to the completed preferred stock exchange offer discussed in more detail in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
our loss for also includes a loss from discontinued operations of approximately million per common share  compared to income from discontinued operations of approximately million per common share during the income from discontinued operations in is principally due to a gain of recognized on the sale of the k t group 
the mexico segment for the year ended december   the san sebastian unit reported sales of million  compared to million for the year ended december   and income from operations of million in  compared to a loss from operations of million in  primarily because operations commenced in may and reached full production during the second quarter of cost of sales and other direct production costs as a percentage of sales from products decreased to during from in during  san sebastian produced approximately million ounces of silver and  ounces of gold  respectively  at a total cash cost of per silver ounce  compared to million ounces of silver and  ounces of gold  respectively  at a total cash cost of per silver ounce in the low costs per silver ounce are due in part to significant by product credits from gold production 
for the years ended december  and  gold by product credits were approximately per silver ounce and per silver ounce  respectively 
the united states segment greens creek the greens creek unit reported sales of million for the year ended december   as compared to million during  and income from operations of million in  compared to a loss from operations of million in  primarily due to increased mill throughput resulting in higher concentrate tons produced combined with better recoveries in the gravity circuit  leading to improved lead silver gold distributions 
costs of sales and other direct production costs as a percentage of sales from products decreased to during from in our share of greens creek s silver production remained approximately the same at million ounces  compared to million ounces  for the years ended december  and  respectively  while production of gold ounces and lead and zinc tons increased by approximately  and  respectively 
the total cash cost per silver ounce decreased from during to in  primarily due to increased by product credits resulting from a higher average gold price during lucky friday the lucky friday unit reported sales of approximately million for the year ended december   as compared to million during  and a loss from operations of million in  compared to million in the reduction in sales at the lucky friday unit is primarily due to the decision in october to reduce production due to low silver and lead prices 
costs of sales and other direct production costs as a percentage of sales from products was in  compared to in the total cash cost per silver ounce decreased from in to in for the year ending december   production totaled approximately million silver ounces and  tons of lead  as compared with total production for the year ended december   of million silver ounces and  tons of lead  respectively 
the venezuela segment at the la camorra unit  our sole designated gold operation  sales of product increased by million and cost of sales and other direct production costs as a percentage of sales from products decreased to during the year from in the improvement to sales during  as well as to cost of sales and other direct production costs as a percentage of sales  is primarily due to increased mine equipment availability and improvements to the crushing  milling and adsorption capacities  allowing for increases in tons milled and gold ounces produced 
also contributing to the improvements were increases in the average realized price of gold  which increased during when compared to corporate matters for the year ended december   we reported an income tax benefit of approximately million primarily due to the reversal of a valuation allowance in mexico for existing net operating loss carryforwards of million 
the reversal of the valuation allowance was principally due to the performance of san sebastian and the existence of evidence the unit will be able to utilize existing net operating loss carryforwards in and during  no income tax benefit or provision was recognized 
for further information  see note in notes to consolidated financial statements

reconciliation of total cash costs non gaap to cost of sales and other direct production costs gaap the following tables present reconciliations between non gaap total cash costs to cost of sales and other direct production costs gaap for our gold the venezuela segment only and silver operations the mexico and united states segments  as well as a reconciliation for each individual silver operating property  for the years ended december   and in thousands  except costs per ounce 
we believe cash costs per ounce of silver or gold provide an indicator of cash flow generation at each location and on a consolidated basis  as well as providing a meaningful basis to compare our results to those of other mining companies and other operating mining properties 
cost of sales and other direct production costs is the most comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with gaap to total cash costs 
the sum of the cost of sales and other direct production costs for our silver and gold operating properties in the t ables below  as well as the cost of sales and other direct production costs associated with our former industrial minerals segment only  is presented in our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income loss

for additional information regarding the public offering  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
at december   we held cash and cash equivalents of million  compared to million at december   and million in short term investments with maturities due within the next twelve months 
our cash needs for will be primarily related to capital expenditures  exploration activities  reclamation activities and repayment of debt and will be funded through a combination of current cash  maturities or sales of investments  future cash flows from operations and or future borrowings or debt or equity security issuances 
although we believe existing cash and cash equivalents are adequate  we cannot project the cash impact of possible future investment opportunities or acquisitions  and our operating properties may require more cash than forecasted 
contractual obligations and contingent liabilities and commitments the table below presents our fixed  noncancelable contractual obligations and commitments primarily with regards to payment of debt  future funding for reclamation bonds  our earn in agreement obligations  certain capital expenditures and lease arrangements as of december  in thousands

see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information about our debt and related matters 
there are no provisions in our outstanding debt agreements that would accelerate the debt payments listed above 
during the first two months of  approximately million was paid associated with our long term debt agreements 
during the third quarter of  the parties to the greens creek joint venture determined it would be necessary to replace existing surety requirements via the establishment of a million restricted trust for reclamation funding in the future 
approximately million was placed into restricted cash in january  with the balance estimated to be funded from operating cash flows within the first six months of our portion of the million will be approximately million  including million of the million restricted in january as of december   we were committed to approximately million for the construction of a shaft at the la camorra mine 
in august  we entered into an earn in agreement with rodeo creek gold  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of great basin gold ltd 
great basin  concerning exploration  development and production on great basin s hollister development block gold property 
the agreement provides us with an option to earn a working interest in the hollister development block in return for funding a two stage  advanced exploration and development program leading to commercial production 
as of december   we were contractually committed to approximately million  which represents the remaining portion of the first stage of the agreement 
the million has not been recorded in our consolidated financial statements  although project to date  we have incurred expenditures of million  which has been recorded on our consolidated financial statements as pre development expenditures 
we enter into operating leases in the normal course of business 
substantially all lease agreements have fixed payment terms based on the passage of time 
some lease agreements provide us with the option to renew the lease or purchase the leased property 
our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these renewal options and if we entered into additional operating lease arrangements 
we maintain reserves for costs associated with mine closure  reclamation of land and other environmental matters 
at december   our reserves for these matters totaled million  for which no contractual or commitment obligations exist 
future expenditures related to closure  reclamation and environmental expenditures are difficult to estimate  although we anticipate we will make expenditures relating to these obligations over the next thirty years 
during  expenditures for environmental remediation and reclamation are estimated to be in the range of million and million

operating activities operating activities provided approximately million in cash during  an increase of million compared to  primarily from cash provided by la camorra  san sebastian and greens creek  increased balances in accounts payable and other accrued expenses  primarily at la camorra million  and by an increase in accrued taxes payable primarily in mexico million 
net cash provided by operating activities was negatively affected by increases in accounts and notes receivable  primarily due to increased value added tax receivables recorded in venezuela and mexico  and increased receivables at san sebastian and greens creek due to the timing and value of product shipments million  cash required for reclamation activities and other noncurrent liabilities  including the payment of deferred compensation and interest million  increases in both supply and product inventories primarily due to la camorra as discussed below million  and changes in other current and noncurrent assets due to increased prepaid expenses at la camorra  primarily for vendors requiring prepayment before shipment million

beginning late in the fourth quarter of  venezuela experienced a general strike that ended in february the result of the strike included shortages of oil and gas supplies in venezuela and a severe economic downturn 
we continued to operate the la camorra unit during the general strike and were able to obtain adequate supplies  including oil and gas for our operations 
there have also been efforts in venezuela to remove the country s president from office 
in december  approximately million signatures were collected on petitions calling for a presidential recall referendum 
on march   venezuela s election council ruled that million signatures on the petitions were deemed valid  and another  signatures may be valid  if citizens confirm that they signed the petition 
a total of approximately million valid signatures are needed for a recall election 
in its ruling  the election council stated that the  citizens whose signatures may be valid need to report to voting centers between march and   to confirm they signed the petition 
this announcement has sparked protests 
although we believe we will be able to manage and operate the la camorra unit and related exploration projects successfully  due to the continued political  regulatory and economic uncertainty and its ramifications on the office of the president  exchange controls and their effects on our operations including  among other things  labor stoppages and supplies of oil  gas and other products  there can be no assurance we will be able to operate without interruptions to our operations 
following the general strike in venezuela  the venezuelan government implemented exchange controls on foreign currency transactions 
rules and regulations regarding the implementation of exchange controls in venezuela have been published and periodically revised and or updated 
from february through the beginning of february  the venezuelan government fixed exchange rate had been  bolivares to one us dollar  which was the exchange rate we utilized to translate the financial statements of our venezuelan subsidiary included in our consolidated financial statements 
on february   the venezuelan government fixed exchange rate was increased to  bolivares to one us dollar 
because of the exchange controls in place and their impact on local suppliers  some supplies  equipment parts and other items previously purchased in venezuela have been ordered outside the country 
increased lead times in receiving orders from outside venezuela has created an increased supply inventory at december   compared to december  although management is actively monitoring exchange controls in venezuela  there can be no assurance that the exchange controls will not further affect our operations in venezuela in the future 
investing activities investing activities required million in cash during primarily for additions to properties  plants and equipment million and the purchase of short term investments million  offset by maturities of investments million and proceeds received on the sale of fixed assets of million

in  we estimate our capital expenditures will be in the range of to million  which represents sustaining capital at our existing operations and expansion capital for shaft construction at the la camorra mine  equipment and development at the isidora mine and development at the lucky friday unit 
there can be no assurance that our estimated capital expenditures for will be in the range we have projected 
financing activities during  financing activities generated approximately million in cash due to the public offering in january for million  proceeds of million for common stock issued upon exercise of a warrant issued to great basin gold ltd 
million shares and employee stock options  shares  as well as short term borrowings on a line of credit for national currency in venezuela million 
these positive factors were offset slightly by the repayment of project financing debt million  including the line of credit in venezuela 
other holders of our series b preferred stock are entitled to receive cumulative cash dividends at the annual rate of per share  payable quarterly  when and if declared by the board of directors 
as of january   we had not declared and paid the equivalent of six quarterly dividends  entitling holders of the preferred stock to elect two directors at our annual shareholders meeting 
on may   holders of the preferred stock  voting as a class  elected two additional directors 
as of january   we have not declared or paid million of preferred stock dividends 
we are currently not planning to reinstate the preferred stock dividend other than in connection with any potential program to reduce the number of remaining preferred shares outstanding 
on january   we announced an exchange offer for the  remaining outstanding shares of our preferred stock at an exchange rate equal to  divided by the volume weighted average of the reported sales price on the new york stock exchange of our common stock for the five trading days ending at the close of the second trading day prior to the expiration date of the exchange offer not to exceed common shares 
on february   the exchange rate was set at common shares for each share of preferred stock 
as a result of this exchange offer   shares of preferred stock were exchanged for  shares of common stock 
following the completed exchange offer  a total of  shares of preferred stock remain outstanding with a liquidation value of million 
the completed exchange offer eliminated million in past accumulated dividends on the preferred stock  and reduced the annual dividend payable on the preferred stock by million to million 
as a result of this exchange offer  we expect to record an additional non cash dividend of approximately million during the first quarter of as of december   we reviewed and modified our assumptions regarding our benefit plans based upon current market conditions and our current compensation structure 
as a result  we reduced the discount rate utilized in determining the future pension liability from to 
we do not believe the change in the discount rate will have a material impact on the amount of pension income to be recognized in as compared to as of the measurement date for pension obligations september   plan assets totaled million and exceeded the benefit obligation by million 
as a result  we do not expect to make contributions to the plans in we are subject to legal proceedings and claims that have not been finally adjudicated 
the ultimate disposition of these matters and various other pending legal actions and claims is not presently determinable

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our risk management activities includes forward looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties  as well as summarizes the financial instruments and derivative instruments held by us at december   which are sensitive to changes in interest rates and commodity prices and are not held for trading purposes 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
in the normal course of business  we also face risks that are either nonfinancial or nonquantifiable see part i  item risk factors 
interest rate risk management at december   our debt and short term investments were subject to changes in market interest rates and were sensitive to those changes 
we currently have no derivative instruments to offset the risk of interest rate changes 
we may choose to use derivative instruments in the future  such as interest rate swaps  to manage the risk associated with interest rate changes 
the following table presents principal cash flows in thousands for debt outstanding and short term investments at december   by maturity date and the related average interest rate 
the variable rates are estimated based on implied forward rates in the yield curve at the reporting date 
expected maturity date total fair value subordinated debt   average interest rate project financing debt average interest rate project financing debt  average interest rate short term investments  average interest rate commodity price risk management at times  we use commodity forward sales commitments  commodity swap contracts and commodity put and call option contracts to manage our exposure to fluctuation in the prices of certain metals which we produce 
contract positions are designed to ensure that we will receive a defined minimum price for certain quantities of our production 
we use these instruments to reduce risk by offsetting market exposures 
we are exposed to certain losses  generally the amount by which the contract price exceeds the spot price of a commodity  in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to these agreements 
the instruments held by us are not leveraged and are held for purposes other than trading 
these contracts meet the criteria to be treated as normal sales in accordance with sfas no 
and as a result  these contracts are not required to be accounted for as derivatives under sfas no

the ounces covered under the swap are adjusted each quarter  in accordance with the expiration of the gold forward contracts 
at december   the fair market value of the gold lease rate swap was approximately  which represents the amount the counterparty would have to pay us if the contract was terminated
