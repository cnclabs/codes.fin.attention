critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
accounting estimates are an integral part of the preparation of the financial statements and the financial reporting process and are based upon current judgments 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
certain accounting estimates are particularly sensitive because of their complexity and the possibility that future events affecting them may differ materially from the company s current judgments and estimates 
this listing of critical accounting policies is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of the company s accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by u 
s 
generally accepted accounting principles  with no need for management s judgment regarding accounting policy 
the company believes that of its significant accounting policies  as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements included herein for the year ended september   the following involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity impairment of long lived assets and goodwill as of september   the company s long lived assets were comprised primarily of million of property  equipment and leasehold improvements and million of contract and lease rights

as of september   the company had million of goodwill 
the company accounts for goodwill and other intangible assets under the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the determination and measurement of an impairment loss under these accounting standards require the significant use of judgment and estimates 
the determination of fair value of these assets utilizes cash flow projections that assume certain future revenue and cost levels  assumed discount rates based upon current market conditions and other valuation factors  all of which involve the use of significant judgment and estimation 
the company recorded impairment losses of approximately million in property related losses and an additional million in discontinued operations during the year ended september  as a result of certain locations that were either under performing  terminated  disposed  or prematurely closed 
future events may indicate differences from management s judgments and estimates which could  in turn  result in increased impairment charges in the future 
future events that may result in increased impairment charges include increases in interest rates  which would impact discount rates  unfavorable economic conditions or other factors which could decrease revenues and profitability of existing locations  and changes in the cost structure of existing facilities 
for the fiscal year ended september   the company recorded million of impairment charges related to long lived assets in continuing operations and million of impairment charges related to long lived assets in discontinued operations 

table of contents contract and lease rights as of september   the company had million of contract and lease rights 
the company capitalizes payments made to third parties  which provide the company the right to manage or lease facilities 
lease rights and management contract rights which are purchased individually are amortized on a straight line basis over the terms of the related agreements  which range from to years 
management contract rights acquired through acquisition of an entity are amortized as a group over the estimated term of the contracts  including anticipated renewals and terminations based on the company s historical experience typically years 
if the renewal rate of contracts within an acquired group is less than initially estimated  accelerated amortization or impairment may be necessary

additionally  the company had a recorded allowance for doubtful accounts of million 
the company reports management accounts receivable  net of an allowance for doubtful accounts  to represent its estimate of the amount that ultimately will be realized in cash

lease termination costs the company has recognized lease termination costs related to disposal activities initiated after december  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  in its financial statements 
lease termination costs related to disposal activities initiated prior to december  were recognized in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
lease termination costs are based upon certain estimates of liabilities related to costs to exit an activity 
liability estimates may change as a result of future events  such as the settlement of a lease termination for an amount less than the amount contractually required 
insurance the company purchases comprehensive liability insurance covering certain claims that occur at parking facilities it owns  leases or manages 
the primary amount of such coverage is million per occurrence and million in the aggregate per facility 
in addition  the company purchases umbrella excess liability coverage 
the company s various liability insurance policies have deductibles of up to  that must be met before the insurance companies are required to reimburse the company for costs incurred relating to covered claims 
in addition  the company s worker s compensation program has a deductible of  the company also provides health insurance for many of its employees and purchases a stop loss policy with a deductible of  per claim 
as a result  the company is  in effect  self insured for all claims up to the deductible levels 
the company applies the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  in determining the timing and amount of expense recognition associated with claims against the company 
the expense recognition is based upon management s determination of an unfavorable outcome of a claim being deemed as probable and reasonably estimable  as defined in sfas no 
this determination requires the use of judgment in both the estimation of probability and the amount to be recognized as an expense 
the company engages an actuary to assist in determining the estimated liabilities for customer injury  employee medical costs and worker s compensation claims 
management utilizes historical experience with similar claims along with input from legal counsel in determining the likelihood and extent of an unfavorable outcome for certain general litigation 
future events may indicate differences from these judgments and estimates and result in increased expense recognition in the future 
income taxes the company uses the asset and liability method of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  to account for income taxes 
under this method  deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the company has certain net operating loss carry forwards which expire between and the ability of the company to fully utilize these net operating losses to offset taxable income is limited due to changes in ownership of the companies which generated these losses 
these limitations have been 
table of contents considered in the determination of the company s deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
the valuation allowance was established for certain net operating loss carry forwards where their recoverability is deemed to be uncertain 
the carrying value of the company s net deferred tax assets assumes that the company will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions  based on estimates and assumptions 
if these estimates and related assumptions change in the future  the company will be required to adjust its deferred tax valuation allowances 
during fiscal year  the company eliminated deferred tax valuation allowances on acquired operating loss carry forwards totaling  because management determined that the deferred tax assets from these operating loss carry forwards would be realized 
since these deferred tax assets were obtained from previous acquisitions where goodwill was recorded  the company reduced such goodwill by the amount of the elimination of the deferred tax valuation allowance

the closing of streets in the vicinity of the world trade center and other areas of new york city and the imposition of certain restrictions on traffic and other security measures in new york city and at the nation s airports also had a negative impact on the company s operations 
the company s operations are concentrated heavily in the downtown areas of major us cities and some are located near landmarks or other sites that have been mentioned as potential targets of terrorists 
in addition  the company manages the parking operations at approximately airports 
additional terrorist attacks or the imposition of additional security measures  particularly in new york  washington  dc or other major cities in which the company has a significant presence  or at airports  could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
the offer or sale of a substantial amount of central parking common stock by significant shareholders of the company could have an adverse impact on the market price of central parking common stock 
in february  the company filed a registration statement on form s covering  shares of the company s common stock held by certain shareholders of the company 
these shares were registered pursuant to registration rights previously granted to these shareholders 
although the company believes a significant portion of these shares has been sold  these shareholders may sell any remaining shares that were registered on any stock exchange  market or trading facility on which the shares are traded  or in private transactions 
other substantial shareholders of the company  including the chairman and chief executive officer of central parking  monroe carell  jr  the carell children s trust  and other family members and related entities the carell family  are permitted to sell significant amounts of the company s common stock under rule and other exemptions from registration under the federal securities laws 
in addition  the carell family has certain rights to register substantially all of the shares held by the family and related entities 
the offer or sale of substantial amounts of central parking common stock by these or other significant shareholders  particularly if such offers or sales occur simultaneously or relatively close in time  could have a significant negative impact on the stock s market price 
the company is dependent on the continued availability of capital to support its business 
the company has significant working capital requirements  including but not limited to  repair and maintenance obligations for many of its parking facilities 
the company is dependant on the cash generated from its operations and its credit facility to meet its working capital requirements 
the credit facility contains covenants including those that require the company to maintain certain financial ratios  restrict further indebtedness and certain acquisition activity and limit the amount of dividends paid 
the primary ratios are a leverage ratio  senior leverage ratio and a fixed charge coverage ratio 
quarterly compliance is calculated using a four quarter rolling methodology and measured against certain targets 
the company s inability to meet debt covenants and debt service payments under the credit facility would have a material adverse effect on the company 

table of contents the company is subject to interest rate risk 
the company is subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based upon its financing  investing and cash management activities 
the credit facility bears interest at libor plus a tier based margin dependent upon certain financial ratios 
there are separate tiers for the revolving loan and term loan 
the weighted average margin as of september   was basis points 
the amount outstanding under the company s credit facility was million with a weighted average interest rate of as of september  the company has reduced a portion of its interest rate risk by executing two interest rate swap transaction whereby the company has fixed million of floating rate debt 
the term loan is required to be repaid in quarterly payments of million through march and quarterly payments of million from june through march an increase decrease in libor of would result in an increase decrease of annual interest expense of million based on the company s outstanding credit facility balance of million at september  the company expects to pay both quarterly principle amortization and monthly interest payments out of operating cash flow 
the company s large number of leased and owned facilities increases the risk that the company may become unprofitable and that it may not be able to cover the fixed costs of its leased and owned facilities 
the company leased or owned  facilities as of september  although there is more potential for income from leased and owned facilities than from management contracts  they also carry more risk if there is a downturn in the economy  property performance or commercial real estate occupancy rates because a significant part of the costs to operate such facilities typically is fixed 
for example  in the case of leases  there are typically minimum lease payments that must be made regardless of the revenues or profitability of the facility 
in particular  it is difficult to forecast revenues of newly constructed parking facilities because these facilities do not have an operating history 
start up costs  the length of the break in period during which parking demand is built and economic conditions at the time the facility is opened  are very difficult to predict at the time the lease is executed and the base rent is agreed upon  which is often two or more years prior to the opening of the facility 
in the case of owned facilities  there are the normal risks of ownership and costs of capital 
in addition  operating expenses for both leased and owned facilities are borne by central parking and are not passed through to the owner  as is the case with management contracts 
in the case of owned facilities and generally in the case of longer term leased facilities  the company also is responsible for property taxes and all maintenance and repair costs  including structural  mechanical and systems repairs 
performance of central parking s parking facilities depends  in part  on the company s ability to negotiate favorable contract terms and control operating expenses  economic conditions prevailing generally and in areas where parking facilities are located  the nature and extent of competitive parking facilities in the area  weather conditions and the real estate market 
an increase in government regulation or taxation could have a negative effect on the company s profitability 
the company s business is subject to numerous federal  state and local laws and regulations  and in some cases  municipal and state authorities directly regulate parking facilities 
in addition  many cities impose a substantial tax or surcharge on parking services  which generally range from to 
the company s business is also affected by increases in property taxes 
several state and local laws have been passed in recent years which are designed to encourage car pooling or the use of mass transit or impose 
table of contents certain restrictions on automobile usage 
an example is the restrictions imposed by the city of new york in the wake of the september terrorist attacks  which included street closures and a requirement for passenger cars entering certain bridges and tunnels to have more than one occupant during the morning rush hour 
the company also is subject to federal  state and local employment and labor laws and regulations  and several cities in which the company has operations either have adopted or are considering the adoption of so called living wage ordinances 
the adoption of such laws and regulations  the imposition of additional parking taxes or surcharges and increases in property and other taxes could adversely impact the company s profitability 
the sureties for our performance bond program may increase rates further and require additional collateral to issue or renew performance bonds in support of certain contracts 
under substantially all of our contracts with municipalities and government entities and airports  we are required to provide a performance bond to support our obligations under the contract 
we are also required to provide performance bonds under certain leases and other contracts with non governmental entities 
due to our financial results in fiscal and the financial state of the surety bond industry  the sureties for our performance bond program have increased and rates have required us to collateralize a greater percentage of our performance bonds with letters of credit 
as a result  our working capital needs have increased and our borrowing capacity has decreased since letters of credit used by us to collateralize surety bonds reduces the availability of funds under our credit facility 
although the company believes its performance bond program is adequate for its present needs  if we are unable to provide sufficient collateral in the future  our sureties may not issue performance bonds to support our obligations under certain contracts 
as is customary in the industry  a surety provider can refuse to provide a bond principal with new or renewal surety bonds 
if any existing or future surety provider refuses to provide us with surety bonds  there can be no assurance that we would be able to find alternate providers on acceptable terms  or at all 
our inability to provide surety bonds could result in the loss of existing contracts or future business  which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 
our net income could be adversely affected if accruals for future insurance losses are not adequate 
we provide liability  medical and worker s compensation insurance coverage 
we are obligated to pay for each loss incurred up to the amount of a deductible specified in our insurance policies 
our financial statements reflect our anticipated costs based upon loss experience and guidance and evaluation we have received from third party insurance professionals  such as actuaries 
there can be no assurance  however  that the ultimate amount of such costs will not exceed the amount presently accrued  in which case we would need to increase accruals and pay additional expenses 
the operation of our business is dependent on key personnel 
our success is  and will continue to be  substantially dependent upon the continued services of our management team 
the loss of the services of one or more of the members of our senior management team could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and the results of operations 
although we have entered into employment agreements with  and historically have been successful in retaining the services of our senior management  there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain these senior management people in the future 
in addition  our future growth depends on our ability to attract and retain skilled operating managers and employees 
we have foreign operations that may be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
central parking operates in the united kingdom  germany  mexico  the republic of ireland  chile  poland  greece  switzerland  colombia  peru  venezuela  canada and spain  and seeks to expand its business in these and other international locations 
for the year ended september   revenues from foreign operations represented of central parking s total revenues  excluding reimbursement of management contract expenses 
the company s united kingdom operations accounted for of total revenues from foreign operations  excluding reimbursement of management contract expense and excluding earnings from joint ventures 
central parking receives revenues and incurs expenses in various foreign currencies in connection with its foreign operations and  as a result  central parking is subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations 
central parking intends to continue to invest in foreign leased or owned parking facilities  either independently or through joint ventures  where appropriate  and may become increasingly exposed to foreign currency fluctuations 
central parking believes it has currently limited exposure to foreign currency risk and does not have a foreign currency hedging program 
in connection with ownership or operation of parking facilities  we may be potentially liable for environmental problems 
under various federal  state  and local environmental laws  ordinances  and regulations  a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on  under  or in such 
table of contents property 
such laws typically impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of  or was responsible for  the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances 
there can be no assurance that a material environmental claim will not be asserted against central parking or against its owned or operated parking facilities 
the cost of defending against claims of liability  or of remediating a contaminated property  could have a negative effect on central parking s business and financial results 
if we cannot maintain positive relationships with labor unions representing our employees  a work stoppage may adversely affect our business 
approximately  employees of central parking are represented by labor unions 
there can be no assurance that central parking will be able to renew existing labor union contracts on acceptable terms 
employees could exercise their rights under these labor union contracts  which could include a strike or walk out 
in such cases  there are no assurances that central parking would be able to staff sufficient employees for its short term needs 
any such labor strike or the inability of central parking to negotiate a satisfactory contract upon expiration of the current agreements could have a negative effect on central parking s business and financial results 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rates the company s primary exposure to market risk consists of changes in interest rates on variable rate borrowings 
as of september   the company had million of variable rate debt outstanding under the credit facility  priced at libor plus a weighted average basis points 
the company is required under the credit facility to enter into and maintain interest rate protection agreements designed to limit the company s exposure to increases in interest rates 
on may   the company entered into two interest rate swap transactions for a total of million 
both transactions swapped the company s floating libor interest rates for fixed interest of until june  both of these derivative instruments have terms consistent with the terms of the credit facility and qualify as cash flow hedges 
the weighted average interest rate on the company s credit facility at september  was 
the rate includes all outstanding libor contracts and swap agreements at september  an increase decrease in libor of would result in an increase decrease of annual interest expense of million assuming the company s outstanding credit facility balance of million less million swapped to a fixed rate at september  remained the same 
in march  a limited liability company of which the company is the sole shareholder  purchased a parking structure for million and financed million with a five year note bearing interest at one month floating libor plus basis points 
to fix the interest rate  the company entered into a five year libor swap  yielding an effective interest cost of for the five year period 
the notional amount of the swap is reduced in conjunction with the principal payments on the related variable rate debt 
foreign currency exposure the company s exposure to foreign exchange risk is minimal 
as of september   the company has approximately gbp million usd million of cash and cash equivalents denominated in british pounds  eur million usd million denominated in euros  cad million usd million denominated in canadian dollars  and usd million denominated in various other foreign currencies 
the company also has eur million usd million of notes payable denominated in euros at september  these notes bear interest at a floating rate of as of september   and require monthly principal and interest payments through the company does not hold any hedging instruments related to foreign currency transactions 
the company monitors foreign currency positions and may enter into certain hedging instruments in the future should it determine that exposure to foreign exchange risk has increased 
based on the company s overall currency rate exposure as of september   management does not believe a near term change in currency rates  based on historical currency movements  would materially affect the company s financial statements
