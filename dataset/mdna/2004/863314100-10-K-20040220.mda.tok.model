risks and uncertainties that may affect future performance are detailed from time to time in reports filed by the company with the sec  including forms q and k  and include  among others  the following international  national and local general economic and market conditions  the size and growth of the overall footwear and general retail market  intense competition among designers  marketers  distributors and sellers of footwear  demographic changes  changes in consumer fashion trends that may shift to footwear styling not currently included in our product lines  popularity of particular designs and categories of products  seasonal and geographic demand for the company s products  difficulties in anticipating or forecasting changes in consumer preferences  delays in the opening of new stores  difficulties in implementing  operating and maintaining the company s complex information systems and controls  including  without limitation  the systems related to the company s retail stores  systems related to demand and supply planning  and inventory control  interruptions in data and communications systems  fluctuations and difficulty in forecasting operating results  the ability of the company to sustain  manage or forecast its growth and inventories  the size  timing and mix of purchases of the company s products  the underperformance or delay of new products  the possible failure to retain the tommy hilfiger footwear license  the ability to secure and protect trademarks  patents and other intellectual property  performance and reliability of products  customer service  adverse publicity  the loss of significant suppliers or customers  such as department stores and specialty retailers  the consolidation or restructuring of such customers  including large department stores  which may result in unexpected store closings  dependence on china manufacturing  the ability to secure raw materials  delays and increased costs of freight and transportation to meet delivery deadlines  the impact on product development or manufacturing as a result of health risks such as sars severe acute respiratory syndrome  changes in business strategy or development plans  general risks associated with doing business outside the united states  including  without limitation  import duties  tariffs  quotas and political and economic instability  changes in government regulations  liability and other claims asserted against the company  the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel  and other factors referenced or incorporated by reference in this report and other reports 
the risks included here are not exhaustive 
other sections of this report may include additional factors which could adversely affect the company s business and financial performance 
moreover  the company operates in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment 
new risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors  nor can it assess the impact of all such risk factors on the company s business or the extent to which any factor  or combination of factors  may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statements 
given these risks and uncertainties  investors should not place undue reliance on forward looking statements as a prediction of actual results 
investors should also be aware that while the company does communicate with securities analysts from time to time  it is against our policy to disclose to them any material non public information or other confidential information 
accordingly  investors should not assume that we agree with any statement or report issued by any analyst irrespective of the content of the statement or report 
furthermore  the company has a policy against issuing or confirming financial forecasts or projections issued by others 
therefore  to the extent that reports issued by securities analysts contain any projections  forecasts or opinions  such reports are not the responsibility of the company 
critical accounting estimates the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to 
table of contents make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
we believe that the estimates  assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements  therefore we consider these to be our critical accounting estimates 
the most significant estimates included in these financial statements include valuation allowances and reserves for accounts receivable  inventory and income taxes 
these areas are subject to the risks and uncertainties described above 
actual results  therefore  could differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition revenues consist of sales to customers and royalty income 
wholesale revenues are recognized when title passes and the risks and rewards of ownership have transferred to the customer  based on the shipping terms 
retail store revenues are recognized at the time of sale 
royalty income  which accounted for approximately million  million and million in fiscal years  and  respectively  is recognized when earned 
we permit merchandise returns from our customers under certain circumstances and engage in buy down programs with certain retailers  principally in the form of product markdown allowances for obsolete and slow moving products that are in the retailer s inventory 
the buy down programs are accounted for as a reduction in revenues 
the returns allowance is recorded as a reduction to revenues for the estimated sales value of the projected merchandise returns and as a reduction in cost of products for the corresponding cost amount 
allowances for product markdowns are estimated and deducted from revenue at the time that revenue is recognized 
our procedure for estimating product returns and markdown allowances is based upon our historical experience  product sell through performance by product and by customer  current and historical trends in the footwear industry and changes in demand for our products 
from time to time actual results will vary from the estimates that were previously established 
due to the existence of good monitoring systems  our visibility into our customers inventory levels and the ongoing communication with our customers  we are able to identify variances in our estimates in a timely manner  that are then properly reflected in our financial statements 
reserve for uncollectable accounts receivable we make ongoing estimates relating to the collectability of our accounts receivable balances and maintain a reserve for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if actual losses differ from estimated losses there will be an effect on net income and liquidity 
in determining the amount of the reserve  we consider our historical level of credit losses and make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations 
these evaluations  which are performed by our corporate credit department  include  but are not limited to  analyzing our customer s financial statements  maintaining a credit watch list to monitor accounts receivable exposure and reviewing the customer s prior payment history 
we predominantly sell our products to large retailers 
historically  we have not experienced significant losses related to trade receivables 
however  there is a risk that some of these retail customers could experience financial difficulties  particularly in a weak economy  that may cause them to extend payment times or default on their obligations to us 
if a large customer were to default on its financial obligations to us  we could experience a decrease in liquidity 
we believe  however  that we have sufficient financial resources to mitigate the effect that a large default would have on our ability to continue to operate our business 
in addition to the impact on liquidity  we could also experience a decrease in future revenues and operating margins related to this loss of business 
inventory reserves the fashion oriented nature of our business  along with the potential for changes in customer preferences and the extended product development lead times  leave us vulnerable to the risk of inventory obsolescence both at our own stores and also to our wholesale inventories 
we make ongoing estimates relating to the net realizable 
table of contents value of inventories  based upon our assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if we estimate that the net realizable value of our inventory is less than the cost of the inventory recorded on our books  we record a reserve equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value 
if changes in market conditions result in reductions in the estimated net realizable value of our inventory below our previous estimate  we would increase our reserve in the period in which we made such a determination 
we have continually managed these risks in the past and believe we can successfully manage them in the future 
however  our revenues and operating margins may suffer if we are unable to effectively manage these risks 
property and equipment property and equipment is recorded at cost and is depreciated over its estimated useful life 
when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of property and equipment may be impaired  we estimate the future undiscounted cash flows to be derived from the asset to determine its fair market value and whether or not a potential impairment exists 
if the carrying value exceeds the estimate of future undiscounted cash flows  we then calculate the impairment as the excess of the carrying value of the asset over the estimate of its fair market value 
any impairment charges are recorded as part of selling and administrative expenses 
we estimate future undiscounted cash flows using assumptions about their expected future operating performance 
the estimates of undiscounted cash flows may change in future periods due to  among other things  technological changes  economic conditions  changes in business operations or inability to meet business plans 
such changes may result in impairment charges in the period in which such changes in estimates are made 
defined benefit pension plan we sponsor a defined benefit pension plan 
major assumptions used in the accounting for this employee benefit plan include the discount rate  expected return on plan assets and rate of increase in employee compensation levels 
assumptions are determined based on our data and appropriate market indicators  and are evaluated each year as of the plan s measurement date 
a change in any of these assumptions would have an effect on net periodic pension benefit costs reported in the consolidated financial statements 
in fiscal  the discount rate was lowered to 
the expected return on plan assets will remain at in fiscal  reflecting current economic conditions 
pension expense in is not expected to be negatively impacted by these changes 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
taxes we record income tax liabilities utilizing known obligations and estimates of potential obligations 
a deferred tax asset or liability is recognized whenever there are future tax effects from existing temporary differences and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
we must make estimates and judgments on future taxable income  considering feasible tax planning strategies and taking into account existing facts and circumstances  to determine if a valuation allowance is necessary 
a valuation allowance has not been assigned to our deferred tax assets since we believe it is more likely than not that we will fully realize the benefits of such tax assets 
when we determine that deferred tax assets could be realized in greater or lesser amounts than recorded  the asset balance and income statement reflects the change in the period such determination is made 
due to changes in facts and circumstances and the estimates and judgments that are involved in determining the proper valuation allowance  differences between actual future events and prior estimates and judgments could result in adjustments to a future valuation allowance 
we use an estimate of our annual effective tax rate at each interim period based on the facts and circumstances known at that time  while the actual effective tax rate is calculated at year end 
this estimation process periodically results in a change to our expected effective tax rate for the fiscal year 
when this occurs  we adjust the income tax provision during the period in which the change in estimate occurs so that the year to date provision equals the expected annual rate 
the preparation of federal and state tax returns requires interpretations  judgments and estimates which are subject to the review and audit of taxing authorities 
we believe that the results of audits will not adversely affect earnings 

table of contents contingencies the sale of tommy hilfiger branded footwear is a significant portion of our business 
the tommy hilfiger footwear sales are contingent on our licensing agreement with tommy hilfiger licensing  inc during fiscal  we negotiated the renewal of the agreement for an additional term 
in early january  we finalized the terms of the license agreement  which will expire in march whether our license with tommy hilfiger will remain in effect depends on our achieving certain minimum sales levels for the licensed products 
we expect to continue to meet the minimum sales levels required by the tommy hilfiger license agreement 
we believe that no provision is currently required for costs related to the potential loss of this license 
if we lose the tommy hilfiger license  our business would be materially and adversely affected

table of contents the overall business climate remained difficult in generally  the uncertainty of global unrest  a weak economy  the cold spring and a sluggish retail climate  particularly in soft goods  affected the company s overall sales 
in addition  fashion trends did not favor canvas and leather sneaker styles  which weakened our sales results  particularly in our keds brand 
during fiscal  consolidated net sales increased million to million  or above the sales level achieved in fiscal revenues related to the company s wholesale brands increased million while overall retail sales increased million or when compared to fiscal unit shipments of current line merchandise during fiscal for the company s wholesale brands were above the prior year 
the average first quality wholesale selling price declined from fiscal first quality wholesale gross sales decreased by million  or below the wholesale gross sales level achieved in fiscal offsetting this decrease was a million increase in the sale of promotional products  a million increase in closeout sales and a million decrease in returns and allowances compared to the fiscal year  which resulted in the overall increase in wholesale net sales 
this  combined with the strong retail store sales comparisons to last year  contributed to the overall increase of million in consolidated net sales 
the overall increase in net sales of the stride rite children s group was primarily attributable to increased sales of children s group company owned retail stores 
in fiscal  sales to independent retailers decreased when compared to last year 
this decrease reflects a trend of consistent sales declines in the children s group wholesale sales primarily attributable to the negative impact of the economy on certain licensed partners and trade accounts as well as reductions in sales of the department store channel 
although the fourth quarter wholesale sales increased versus  we expect the stride rite children s group wholesale sales in to continue this gradual decline 
offsetting this decrease were sales levels of children s group s company owned retail stores  which were up from the comparable period last year 
sales at comparable children s group retail stores stores open for weeks in each fiscal year increased in fiscal driving this increase in the comparable stores category was a greater proportion of newer stores that are now included in the computation 
these newer comparable stores generally have had greater comparable sales increases than our more mature stores 
at the end of fiscal  the stride rite children s group operated stores 
this is a net increase of stores  or from the end of fiscal in fiscal  ten children s shoe stores and one outlet store were opened and five children s shoe stores and three outlet stores were closed 
current plans call for the addition of approximately retail stores  of which we anticipate to be from licensed dealer acquisitions  during the fiscal year 
the decrease in the sales of keds branded products was primarily the result of weaknesses in the women s and children s basic product lines  which were adversely affected by the cold spring  poor economy and a soft canvas sneaker market 
the grasshopper product line was also unfavorably affected  decreasing million or from fiscal also contributing to the decline in keds sales in was the disappointing performance of some new major product offerings and  to a lesser degree  the keds children s line 
somewhat offsetting these decreases was an increase in closeout sales 
keds closed one retail store in fiscal  with no new store openings  to bring the total keds retail store count to five 
we are currently evaluating these five retail stores 
in fiscal  the overall tommy hilfiger footwear net sales growth can be attributed to the growth in the independent store channel achieved through the initial sales to large chains in the family footwear category slightly offset by a decline in the department stores 
this increase in tommy hilfiger footwear net sales was the result of growth in the women s outdoor and dress casual styles in independent channels along with a similar growth pattern in the men s dress and athletic styles 
also contributing to the overall increase in tommy hilfiger footwear net sales was an increase of million in the pro keds product line  which remains relatively small 
going forward  we anticipate this trend of declining sales in the department stores and increased sales in the independent channels to continue 

table of contents the major contributors to the increase in net sales of sperry top sider products were strong sales of both men s and women s performance boat shoes as well as promotional items 
sales in the department store and marine outdoor channels showed growth over fiscal the stride rite international division continued to be affected by weakness in the global economy  particularly in south america and the middle east 
this negatively impacted their net sales in fiscal gross profit in fiscal year our gross profit of million increased million or above fiscal our gross profit rate improved percentage points to as compared to the rate achieved in fiscal the significant factors contributing to the improved gross margin were million in lower closeout  excess inventory and obsolescence costs primarily achieved through improved inventory management  a decline in returns and allowances of million  combined with an additional million in gross margin related to the wholesale retail mix of revenue that was positively impacted by the growth of revenues from our company owned retail stores which have somewhat higher gross profit margin than our wholesale businesses 
operating costs selling and administrative expenses in fiscal increased million to million or above the expense level incurred in fiscal as a percent of sales  selling and administrative costs were in fiscal compared to in fiscal these increases were primarily attributable to increased pension expense of million  increased advertising costs of million and higher retail store expenses of million 
the increase in pension expense was primarily due to investment losses and changes in plan assumptions including the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets 
pension expense in fiscal is expected to remain at about the same level as fiscal during fiscal  advertising costs were of net sales versus in fiscal most of this increase was attributable to increased spending by both keds and sperry 
retail store expenses increased in fiscal as compared to the prior fiscal year 
the primary cause of this increase was the full year impact of the new children s group stores opened throughout fiscal as well as the addition of stores in fiscal other income and taxes non operating income expense increased our pre tax earnings by million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal investment income increased by million in fiscal  the result of the  gain on the sale of the company s minority interest in the thailand factory joint venture  as well as a gain on a prior year investment  offset by lower investment income 
higher average investments were unable to offset lower average interest rates 
interest expense in fiscal decreased million from fiscal  as there were no short term borrowings during fiscal in fiscal  the provision for income taxes increased million due to an increase in pre tax income combined with a higher effective tax rate 
our effective income tax rate was in fiscal versus in fiscal the higher tax rate in fiscal as compared to fiscal was due principally to a lower effective income tax rate which reflected a reduction in previously established tax accruals which were no longer needed 
the effective income tax rate is expected to increase in fiscal to 
net income we earned million in fiscal  million or above fiscal s net income amount 
the higher earnings in fiscal resulted from higher net sales and an increased gross profit percentage somewhat offset by higher selling and administrative expenses and a higher effective income tax rate 

table of contents fiscal compared to fiscal net sales the breakdown of net sales is as follows in millions  except percentages percent change vs 
stride rite children s group wholesale stride rite children s group retail stride rite children s group keds tommy hilfiger footwear sperry top sider stride rite international elimination of intercompany sales n a total net sales fiscal years and restated for the transfer of tommy hilfiger kids from tommy hilfiger to stride rite children s group and pro keds from keds to tommy hilfiger 
during fiscal  consolidated net sales increased million to million  or above the sales level achieved in fiscal this increase was somewhat attributable to the company s sales performance during the fourth quarter  which was up versus the fourth quarter of fiscal performance comparatives of fiscal to fiscal after the third quarter of fiscal were affected by the general business slowdown occurring since the post time period 
during fiscal the overall business climate remained difficult 
unit shipments of current line merchandise during fiscal for the company s wholesale brands were below the prior year 
the average first quality wholesale selling price declined from fiscal first quality wholesale gross sales decreased by million  or below the wholesale gross sales level achieved in fiscal the company also recorded a million reduction in the sale of closeout items versus the prior year 
partially offsetting these decreases was a million increase in the sale of promotional products compared to the fiscal year 
the increased sale of promotional products was a major reason for the sales increase for the fiscal year versus the prior year 
retail sales increased million  or versus the sales levels recorded in fiscal higher sales allowances reduced gross sales by million versus the fiscal year 
this was partially offset by lower returns which decreased million as compared to fiscal royalty income increased by million in fiscal as compared to the amount recorded in fiscal sales at comparable children s group retail stores stores open for weeks in each fiscal year decreased for the fiscal year  following a increase in fiscal although the children s group s store count increased by only from the prior fiscal year  versus  there were a significant number of stores that were either opened or closed during fiscal the children s group opened a total of retail stores during the fiscal year 
the children s group closed under performing retail stores along with successfully exiting from the federated children s leased department stores 
sales at stores newly opened during fiscal were sufficient to offset the sales declines that resulted from the exit of the federated children s leased department stores 
approximately of the children s group s stores were newly opened during fiscal the sales decrease of the keds branded products was principally the result of weaknesses in the women s basics product lines 
during fiscal several women s basic programs were transitioned to new product 
table of contents offerings 
these transitions were not successfully received in the market and consequently they were not able to duplicate the performance realized in fiscal these declines were partially offset by both sales of pro keds products  which were new for fiscal and the increased sale of promotional products 
during fiscal the design and marketing of the pro keds product line was transferred under the tommy hilfiger footwear unit to better match the customer profile for the development and marketing effort for the brand 
keds also opened one additional retail store in fiscal bringing the store count to six 
the major factors contributing to the sales increase of tommy hilfiger footwear products were the expansion of distribution to independents and shoe chain accounts as well as promotional products 
this has lessened the tommy hilfiger footwear unit s dependence on the department store sector  which has been experiencing a general weakness 
beginning with fiscal  the tommy hilfiger children s product line was transitioned to the stride rite children s group 
the improvement in sperry sales is primarily attributable to promotional items  increases in the sale of women s products and fewer returns 
the increase in sales of the stride rite international division was principally due to increased sales of tommy hilfiger products 
gross profit in fiscal year our gross profit of million increased million or above fiscal our gross profit rate improved percentage points to as compared to the rate achieved in fiscal included in the fiscal cost of sales was a reversal of million of the prior fiscal year s million charge associated with the write down of inventory caused by the exit of the leased department store business 
additional discussion regarding this write down of inventory can be found in note to the consolidated financial statements 
negatively affecting the comparison of the fiscal year s gross profit to the fiscal year amount was million due to reduced first quality wholesale product sales and million from increased sales allowances 
gross profit was also adversely affected by the west coast port s labor dispute  as approximately million in additional costs were spent in order to expedite the receipt of inventory 
offsetting these amounts was the increase in retail sales  which added million to gross profit comparisons of fiscal versus also contributing to the improvement of the gross profit comparisons was the performance of promotional and closeout items which added approximately million to gross profit in fiscal year  versus restructuring charges in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company completed the prior year restructuring and recorded income of  less than per share after tax related to the reversal of unused prior year restructuring accruals 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company recorded pre tax restructuring charges of  
per share after tax related to a restructuring of its administrative staff  the closing of the wilmington  massachusetts returns and product sample facility  the exit of the federated leased department store business and retail system asset impairment costs 
the fiscal restructuring included streamlining certain corporate and divisional operations reducing the administrative workforce by approximately or positions 
cash payments and other non cash items for the restructuring included  related to severance payments and other employee benefit costs   related to the consolidation of the wilmington  massachusetts returns and product sample facility into the huntington  indiana distribution center and  of other costs associated with the restructuring 
the fiscal restructuring charges also included expenses associated with exiting the federated leased department store business which resulted in a write down of leaseholds and other assets of  and the impairment cost associated with the existing retail system totaling  during fiscal  the company charged  of costs to the fiscal restructuring accrual balance 
included in fiscal cost of sales is a reversal of million of the prior year s million charge associated with the 
table of contents write down of inventory caused by the exit of the federated leased department store business 
the following table summarizes the accrued costs associated with the fiscal restructuring actions by type and related activity through november  in thousands accrued severance and other employee related costs accrued facility closing costs asset writedowns accrued other costs total restructuring charges fiscal cash payments balance november  cash payments non cash items reversals and other adjustments balance november  operating costs selling and administrative expenses excluding restructuring charges in fiscal decreased million to million or below the expense level incurred in fiscal as a percent of sales  selling and administrative costs were in fiscal compared to in fiscal included in expenses for fiscal were executive termination costs of million 
pension expense added million to operating costs as compared to fiscal retail store expenses increased in fiscal as compared to the prior fiscal year 
the addition of new children s group retail stores during fiscal resulted in higher costs due to start up requirements for these new stores 
the disproportionate level of start up costs more than offset the cost savings that resulted from the exit of the federated leased department stores during the second quarter of fiscal offsetting a portion of the increased retail store expenses were reductions that resulted from the restructuring that was initiated in the fourth quarter of fiscal and advertising expenses which decreased in fiscal as compared to fiscal during fiscal advertising costs were of net sales versus of net sales in fiscal most of this decline was attributable to reductions in keds advertising  the result of transitioning the product line 
other income and taxes non operating income expense increased our pre tax earnings by million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal investment income decreased by million in fiscal  the result of both lower interest rates and lower average investments 
interest expense in fiscal decreased from fiscal  million because of both lower average borrowing levels and lower average interest rates 
in fiscal  the provision for income taxes increased million due to an increase in pre tax income combined with a higher effective tax rate 
our effective income tax rate was in fiscal and in fiscal the higher tax rate in fiscal as compared to fiscal was due principally to an increase in the need for certain state income tax accruals that were not necessary in the prior year 
our effective tax rates in and were reduced as compared to fiscal because of tax accruals previously established  which were no longer required 
net income we earned million in fiscal  million or above fiscal s net income amount 
after excluding last year s after tax non recurring charges from the fiscal net income amount  the increase in net income for fiscal year would have been million or 
the higher earnings in fiscal resulted from higher net sales  an increased gross profit percent  lower operating expenses and non recurring charges somewhat offset by a higher income tax rate 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources at the end of fiscal  our balance sheet reflected a current ratio of to with no debt 
our cash and cash equivalents totaled million at november   an increase of million from the total cash and cash equivalents of million at the end of fiscal this increase in our cash balance was primarily the result of a decrease in inventory as well as an overall increase in net sales and net income 
during fiscal  our operations generated cash of million  less than the operating cash flows of million in fiscal yet higher than million in fiscal our accounts receivable level of million  increased million from the year earlier levels 
the higher level of accounts receivable was primarily the result of the increase in fourth quarter sales  which were up million or 
at november   our average day s sales outstanding dso totaled days  favorable compared to both the dso of days at year end and the dso of days at year end much of this improvement in dso is attributable to more effectively pursuing past due receivables and a reduction in customer chargebacks 
year end inventories totaled million  which was million or lower than the million at fiscal year end the inventory decrease in fiscal followed a similar decrease of million in fiscal some portion of this decrease in inventory related to accelerated inventory receipts in fiscal in anticipation of the potential disruptions related to the labor dispute at the west coast ports 
during fiscal year  our inventory turnover averaged times which compares favorably to the lower turnover rates of times during fiscal and times realized in fiscal the improved inventory performance during fiscal was the result of shortened production lead times for certain products  which allow for reduced inventory quantities  more effective sale of close out products and our ability to monitor the sell through performance of our larger retail customers to better forecast product demand 
we do not anticipate similar decreases in inventory levels in fiscal additions to property and equipment totaled million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal and million in fiscal this decrease in capital spending is primarily attributable to the lower number of store openings in fiscal capital expenditures in fiscal included million related to both new retail stores and the renovation of existing retail locations and million related to the new retail merchandise planning system 
during fiscal we opened children s group retail stores 
in fiscal years and we opened and new retail stores  respectively 
during the fiscal year our current plans call for the addition of approximately new retail stores 
in fiscal year  we are planning capital expenditures to be approximately million 
the opening of new stores  renovation of existing stores and the next phase of a new retail merchandise planning system are the most significant items planned 
funding for our capital expenditures is expected to be provided from internal sources 
if business conditions are not favorable and do not allow for the funding of capital purchases internally  our plans will be re evaluated 
our pension liabilities increased million in fiscal due to the declines in investment performance and interest rates 
these pension liabilities are developed from actuarial calculations and valuations 
inherent in these valuations are assumptions  including discount rates and the expected return on plan assets 
the expected long term rate of return on our plan assets was developed by examining historical return rates based on the pension plan s asset allocation and considering such factors as return differentials for active investment management 
the expected rate of return was lowered in fiscal to from in fiscal in response to external factors  specifically lower market interest rates and plan asset returns 
due to the long term nature of this assumption  it is not expected that the rate of return percentage will vary yearly 
the expected long term rate of return for fiscal year will be  which is the same rate used in the prior fiscal year 
the discount rate used for the calculation of plan liabilities at fiscal year end was  which is basis points below the rate used in fiscal we consider market conditions  including changes in interest and investment rates  in developing these assumptions 
at fiscal year end our non cash minimum pension liability totaled million 
this liability was created by the shortfall of plan assets versus the accumulated benefit obligation 
pension expense  a non cash item  for fiscal was million and it is expected to remain at the same level in fiscal during the fiscal year we contributed million to the company s defined benefit pension plan 
current plans for fiscal year anticipate a pension contribution of approximately million 

table of contents during fiscal year we returned million to stockholders through share repurchases and cash dividends 
we spent million in fiscal to repurchase  common shares under our share repurchase program 
over the three year period ended november   we repurchased a total of million common shares at an aggregate cost of million 
as of november   we have million shares remaining on our share repurchase authorization that the board of directors approved in september we believe that share repurchases are a good investment and an effective means of providing value to our stockholders 
we plan to continue to make opportunistic share repurchases during the fiscal year 
we have paid a dividend to our stockholders each quarter since we became a public company in we used million of cash for dividend payments during fiscal  which was a decrease  due to a lower share number as a result of stock repurchases  from the million used in fiscal  and the million in fiscal funds for these share repurchases and dividends were provided from internal sources 
under the terms of our revolving credit agreement  we are not allowed to make annual distributions to stockholders in excess of million 
both dividend payments and share repurchases are considered distributions to stockholders 
during the normal course of business  our financial position and results of operations are routinely subject to a variety of risks  including the market risk associated with interest rate movements on short term borrowings and cash equivalents 
additionally  economic conditions in countries where we source our products could negatively affect future inventory purchase commitments 
we purchase substantially all of our inventory from outside the united states 
because these purchases are primarily denominated in us dollars  we are not directly subject to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
accordingly  we do not engage in forward foreign exchange and other similar contracts because the associated risk is not considered significant 
if circumstances should change and we conclude that the hedging of foreign exchange risks becomes appropriate  we will begin to do so 
we utilize cash from operations  short term investments and short term borrowings to fund our working capital and investment needs 
in addition to internal sources of funding  we maintain a bank line of credit to satisfy the seasonal borrowing requirements that are imposed by the sales patterns that are characteristic of stride rite and of the footwear industry 
because of these seasonal demands  there are times during the year when we are less liquid 
during fiscal  we entered into a three year  revolving credit agreement with five banks providing for loans of up to million 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we renewed this line of credit with substantially the same group of banks through october  the revolving credit agreement requires us to meet certain financial ratios and covenants and to maintain a minimum consolidated tangible net worth 
under the terms of the revolving credit agreement  we may borrow at interest rates that vary with libor 
in addition  the agreement calls for facility fees of per annum on the committed line 
at year end  we had no outstanding borrowings under this credit line  leaving the entire million available for use 
during fiscal we did not make any borrowings under our revolving credit agreement  during fiscal  our borrowings averaged million compared to the average borrowings of million in fiscal as of november   letters of credit for million were outstanding for the purchase of inventories 
all letters of credit generally expire within one year 
our significant long term financial obligations as of november  are as follows cash payments due during the fiscal years in thousands description of commitment thereafter total operating leases we do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as such  we are not exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships
