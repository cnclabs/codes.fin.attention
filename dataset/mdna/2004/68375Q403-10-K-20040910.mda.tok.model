controls and procedures disclosure controls and procedures 
subject to the limitations described below  our management  with the participation of our chief executive officer  joseph y 
liu  and our chief financial officer  bruce d 
horn  has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of june  changes in internal control over financial reporting 
there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended june  that has materially affected  or is reasonably likely to materially affect  our internal control over financial reporting 
limitations on the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures 
our management  including our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer  does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will necessarily prevent all error and all fraud 
a control system  no matter how well conceived and operated  can only provide reasonable  not absolute  assurance that the objectives of the control system are met 
any control system will reflect inevitable limitations  such as resource constraints  a cost benefit analysis based on the level of benefit of additional controls relative to their costs  assumptions about the likelihood of future events and human error 
because of the inherent limitations in a cost effective control system  misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not be detected 
accordingly  our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable  not absolute  assurance that the objectives of our disclosure control system are met and  as set forth above  our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded  based on their evaluation as of june   that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that the objectives of our disclosure controls and procedures were met
