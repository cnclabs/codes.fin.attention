item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
this discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and historical results of operations should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
overview the company has three lines of business offshore energy support  marine transportation and marine towing 
o offshore energy operates vessels and is one of the world s largest providers of support services to the offshore oil and gas exploration  development and production industry 
o marine transportation operates ten us flag tankers 
the tankers  operating in the domestic trade  carry crude oil  petroleum products and chemicals 
five of the vessels have double hulls and are the most modern in the us fleet 
o marine towing operates vessels and has one of the most modern fleets operating in the us we provide towing and harbor assist services in seven ports 
since a limited number of customers account for a significant amount of the company s worldwide revenue  our results are subject to volatility from changes in spending for energy distribution  exploration  development and production 
a significant slowdown in capital spending in our markets can create uncertainty as to the level of demand for our equipment 
as a result of the uncertainty  an accurate estimate of earnings and cash flow is difficult 
the following themes and events are important to an understanding of our business o our results of operations since have been adversely affected by the continued slowdown in natural gas and crude oil activity in the gulf of mexico 
international demand remains high  however  rates and utilization for our vessels have declined as a result of increased competition as vessels are shifted from weak markets increasing the supply in stronger markets  o the company has initiated certain changes to improve profitability including selective new buildings for offshore vessels  selective acquisitions and charters of existing vessels  repositioning vessels  and joint ventures to overcome local cabatoge laws 
o we continue to reduce our exposure to low margin assets and sell vessels that are not an integral part of our core operations 
we continue to reduce our operating expenses through restructuring of our personnel requirements in our offshore division in both domestic and international operations 
o the company incurs substantial capital requirements for debt service  vessel maintenance  vessel replacement and upgrades to the fleet to comply with increased regulatory requirements 
o in august  the company issued million senior unsecured notes to increase the company s liquidity and renegotiated its primary credit facility 
the notes require the semiannual payment of interest only  principal is paid at maturity in the company entered into an interest rate swap for the notes to mitigate its exposure to interest rate risk 
the company effectively converted the fixed rate to a floating rate currently at 
the company s credit facility was amended at the same time to an million revolving facility 
o the company is restricted from distributing excess cash from the five double hull tankers to fund the company s general working capital requirements unless the double hull tankers meet certain financial ratios 
in  the five double hull tankers distributed million to the company for working capital purposes 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  useful lives of vessels and equipment  deferred tax assets  and certain accrued liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
revenue is generally recorded when services are rendered 
we have a signed charter agreement or other evidence of an arrangement  pricing is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
for the majority of the offshore energy support and marine towing segments  revenues are recorded on a daily basis as services are rendered 
for the marine transportation segment  revenues are earned under time charters  bareboat charters or affreightment voyage contracts 
revenue from time charters is earned and recognized on a daily basis 
certain time charters contain performance provisions  which provide for decreased fees based upon actual performance against established targets such as speed and fuel consumption 
revenue from bareboat charters is earned and recognized on a monthly basis 
bareboat charters provide for fixed fees for a period of time based upon the terms of the agreement 
revenue for affreightment voyage contracts is recognized based upon the percentage of voyage completion 
the percentage of voyage completion is based on the number of voyage days worked at the balance sheet date divided by the total number of days expected on the voyage 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
asset impairment 
we record impairment losses on long lived assets used in operations when indications of impairment are present and the estimated undiscounted cash flows to be generated by those assets are less than the assets carrying amounts 
if the carrying value is not recoverable  the carrying value of the assets is reduced to estimated fair value 
useful lives of fixed assets 
we determine the useful lives of the vessels and equipment based upon regulatory requirements such as opa  market conditions and operational considerations 
we continue to evaluate the reasonableness of the useful lives of the vessels and equipment 
major maintenance costs 
currently  the costs incurred to drydock our vessels are deferred and amortized on a straight line basis over the period to the next drydocking  generally to months 
in june  the accounting executive committee acsec of the american institute of certified public accountants issued an exposure draft of a proposed statement of position sop entitled accounting for certain costs and activities related to property  plant and equipment 
under the proposed sop  the company would expense major maintenance costs as incurred and be prohibited from deferring of the entire cost of a planned major maintenance activity 
currently  the costs incurred to drydock the company s vessels are deferred and amortized on a straight line basis over the period to the next drydocking  generally to months 
at its september  meeting  acsec voted to approve the sop 
the sop is expected to be presented for fasb clearance in the second quarter of and would be applicable for fiscal years beginning after december  management has determined that this sop may have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements 
at december   the net book value of the deferred drydocking costs was million 
valuation of deferred tax assets 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
after application of the valuation allowance  our net deferred tax assets and liabilities are zero at december  and overview of revenue we derive our revenue from three main lines of business offshore energy support  marine transportation  and marine towing 
seabulk offshore  our domestic and international offshore energy support business  accounted for approximately and of company revenue in and  respectively 
seabulk tankers  our marine transportation business  consists of the company s jones act tanker business  in which it owns nine petroleum and chemical product carriers in the domestic coastwise trade and leases one chemical product carrier 
seabulk tankers accounted for approximately and of company revenue in and  respectively 
seabulk towing  our domestic harbor and offshore towing business  accounted for approximately and of company revenue in and  respectively 
seabulk offshore revenue from our offshore energy support operations is primarily a function of the size of our fleet  vessel day rates or charter rates  and fleet utilization 
rates and utilization are primarily a function of offshore exploration  development  and production activities 
in certain areas where we conduct offshore energy support operations particularly the us gulf of mexico  contracts for the utilization of offshore energy support vessels commonly include termination provisions with three to five day notice requirements and no termination penalty 
as a result  companies engaged in offshore energy support operations including us are particularly sensitive to changes in market demand 
as the company s offshore energy support fleet gets older  the company s strategy is to look for opportunities to upgrade its offshore fleet to higher value  larger and newer vessels and to reduce the number of older and smaller vessels  mainly crewboats  in its fleet 
the company is planning a newbuild program for offshore fleet replacement and enhancement  and currently has commitments from various lenders 
in anticipation of this program  the company has already added three vessels to its west african fleet the seabulk africa  seabulk south atlantic and seabulk asia  two vessels to its southeast asia fleet the seabulk badamyar and seabulk nilar  and an inaugural vessel to its brazilian fleet  the seabulk ipanema 
the company has also executed contracts for two offshore newbuilds for deployment in brazil  and one long term contract in angola 
the company sold offshore energy support vessels and three tugs during for an aggregate total of million and a gain of approximately million 
the company sold offshore energy support vessels during for an aggregate total of million and a gain of approximately  the following table represents revenue for seabulk offshore by major operating area as of december in thousands year ended december  domestic

the following tables set forth  by primary area of operation  average day rates achieved by the offshore energy fleet owned or operated by the company and average utilization for the periods indicated 
average day rates are calculated by dividing total revenue by the number of days worked 
utilization percentages are based upon the number of working days over a day year and the number of vessels in the fleet on the last day of the quarter

domestic revenue for was adversely affected by the continued slowdown in natural gas and crude oil drilling activity in the us gulf of mexico 
despite high natural gas and petroleum prices  exploration and production companies in the us gulf of mexico have been unwilling to invest in new projects 
some exploration and drilling companies have reduced their expectations for energy prospects in the mature gulf of mexico market 
in the meantime  the company is exploring charter opportunities in mexico  which remains an active market 
during the year  the company operated four vessels in mexico 
international offshore revenues for were adversely affected by the decrease in vessel count and utilization 
in west africa  the demand for vessels  and hence overall utilization  remained relatively strong as this is an oil driven deepwater market with longer time horizons and increasing exploration and production budgets primarily from oil company majors 
however  revenue decreased due to increased competition and as a result  vessel count and utilization declined slightly from the company sold six vessels five to a joint venture in its west african fleet during the company also redeployed one vessel and added three newbuild vessels to its west african operations during the recent unrest in nigeria did not have a significant impact on the company s operation 
international vessel demand is primarily driven by crude oil exploration and production 
during  crude oil prices and demand remained relatively firm 
the company expects  based on oil company projections and independent analyses  international exploration and production spending to continue to increase in west africa  which should maintain vessel demand in that area 
however  as a result of increased competition from additional vessels from other weaker markets  rates and utilizations of our vessels have been negatively affected in west africa 
revenue and utilization increased for the company s middle east operations versus the prior year 
revenue decreased slightly for the company s southeast asia operations versus the prior year 
seabulk tankers revenue from the company s marine transportation services business is derived from the operations of tankers carrying crude oil  petroleum products and chemical products in the us jones act trade 
the company s tanker fleet operates on either long term time charters  bareboat charters  or pursuant to consecutive voyage charters or contracts of affreightment 
the company currently has six tankers operating under long term charters  one under a consecutive voyage charter  and three under contracts of affreightment 
the following table sets forth the number of vessels and revenue for the company s petroleum and chemical product carriers year ended december  number of vessels owned at end of period revenue in thousands a    a excludes revenue from the company s shipyard operations  which were discontinued in march tanker revenue increased by in as a result of improved rates 
petroleum tankers 
demand for the company s crude oil and petroleum product transportation services is dependent on several factors  including production and refining levels in the united states  domestic consumer and commercial consumption of petroleum products and chemicals and competition from foreign imports 
the company owned eight petroleum product tankers at december  five of these are double hull  state of the art vessels  of which two have chemical carrying capability 
since january  a major oil company charterer had exclusive possession and control of one of the petroleum product tankers 
the oil company charterer was responsible for all operating and drydocking expenses of the vessel until december when the company converted the bareboat charter to a consecutive voyage charter under which the vessel began trading in foreign commerce in january during  one tanker s time charter with a major oil company was renewed for two years 
two other time charters with another oil company were renewed for periods of one year and two and one half years  respectively 
although the company s jones act fleet has benefited from a tightening domestic tanker market  increased competition from foreign imported products has had a moderating effect on jones act tanker rates 
none of the company s single hull vessels is scheduled for retirement under opa before chemical tankers 
demand for industrial chemical transportation services generally coincides with overall economic activity 
the company operated two chemical tankers and one of the five double hull vessels in the chemical trade as of december  the two chemical tankers are double bottom ships 
the changing industrial needs in us markets  as well as increased competition from foreign imports  have had a moderating effect on chemical tanker rates 
seabulk towing revenue derived from the company s tug operations is primarily a function of the number of tugs available to provide services  the rates charged for their services  the volume of vessel traffic requiring docking and other ship assist services  and competition 
vessel traffic is a function of the general trade activity in the region served by the port 
the following table summarizes certain operating information for the company s tugs 
year ended december  number of tugs at end of period towing revenue in thousands    towing revenue increased to million in from million in due to increased vessel traffic in certain of the company s ports  higher rates and improved utilization 
overview of operating expenses and capital expenditures the company s operating expenses are primarily a function of fleet size and utilization 
the most significant expense categories are crew payroll and benefits  maintenance and repairs  fuel  insurance and charter hire 
during periods of decreased demand for vessels  the company temporarily ceases using certain vessels  ie  lays up vessels  to reduce expenses for marine operating supplies  crew payroll and maintenance 
in addition to variable expenses associated with vessel operations  we incur fixed charges  which are capitalized and amortized for our vessels and other assets 
the company provides for depreciation on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets 
opa mandates the useful life of the company s product carriers  except for the five double hull carriers 
under applicable regulations  the company s chemical and product carriers  offshore service vessels  and its four largest tugs are required to be drydocked twice in each five year period for inspection and routine maintenance and repairs 
these vessels are also required to undergo special surveys every five years involving comprehensive inspection and corrective measures 
the company s harbor tugs generally are not required to be drydocked on a specific schedule 
during the years ended december   and  the company drydocked  and vessels  respectively  at an aggregate cost exclusive of lost revenue of million  million and million  respectively 
the company accounts for its drydocking costs under the deferral method  under which capitalized drydocking costs are expensed over the period preceding the next scheduled drydocking 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company had capital expenditures  including drydocking costs  in the years ended december   and of million  million and million  respectively 
the cost of fuel is an item which has significant impact on the company s operating results on contracts of affreightment 
during  consumables and fuel costs represented approximately of operating costs 
insurance costs consist primarily of premiums and substantial deductibles  and self retention layers for o protection and indemnity insurance for our marine liability risks  which are insured by two mutual insurance associations of which we are members and through the commercial insurance markets  o hull and machinery insurance and other maritime related insurance  which are provided through the commercial marine insurance markets  and o general liability and other traditional insurance  which is provided through the commercial insurance markets 
insurance costs  particularly costs of marine insurance  are directly related to overall insurance market conditions and industry and individual loss records  which vary from year to year 
the increase in p i costs due to higher deductibles and higher self insured retention levels caused an increase in p i insurance expense in of approximately million 
premiums by both marine and non marine insurers have been adversely impacted by the erosion of reserves  underwriting losses and increased reinsurance costs 
no assurance can be given that affordable insurance will be available to the company in the future 
we maintain high levels of self insurance for p i and hull and machinery risks through the use of substantial deductibles and self insured retentions which may increase in the future 
we carry coverage related to loss of earnings on revenues subject to fourteen day deductibles for our tanker operations  but not for our offshore and tug operations 
insurance costs represented approximately of operating costs in results of operations the following table sets forth certain selected financial data and percentages of net revenue for the periods indicated year ended december  dollars in millions revenue operating expenses overhead expenses depreciation  amortization  drydocking and other gain loss on disposal of assets income from operations interest expense  net other income expense  net a loss before provision for income taxes net loss a includes loss on early extinguishment of debt of million in the third quarter of  consisting of the write off of the unamortized financing cost on the senior notes and bank debt of million  unamortized original issue discount on the senior notes of million and contractual redemption premiums on the senior notes of million 
compared with revenue 
revenue decreased to million for from million for due to decreased revenue from the company s offshore energy support segment 
offshore energy support revenue decreased to million for from million for the same period in  primarily due to reduced revenue from the us gulf of mexico and west africa 
revenue from the us gulf of mexico decreased during compared to the same period in primarily due to reduced exploration and production activity 
the decrease in west africa revenue was driven by lower rates and utilization and lower vessel count 
as a result of increased competition from additional vessels from other weaker markets  rates and utilizations of our vessels were negatively affected in west africa 
marine transportation revenue decreased to million for compared to million for the decrease in revenue is primarily due to the sale of our inland barge and shipyard operations in  as well as an increase in off hire days in as a result of vessel drydockings and repairs 
towing revenue increased by to million for from million for the increase in revenue was due to increased vessel traffic in certain of the company s ports  higher rates and improved utilization of the company s tug fleet 
operating expenses 
operating expenses decreased to million from million for the same period in payroll decreased in the us gulf of mexico market due to lower crewing costs and in the tanker segment due to payroll expense control 
repair and maintenance expenditures decreased due to unusually high repairs in the marine transportation segment in the prior year 
fuel and consumables decreased as a result of the sale of our inland barge and shipyard operations in this was partially offset by an increase in insurance costs 
overhead expenses 
overhead expenses remained substantially the same at million in as compared to million for the same period in depreciation  amortization  drydocking and other 
depreciation  amortization  drydocking and other expenses remained substantially the same at million for from million for other includes a write down of assets held for sale of million see note 
this is offset by a decrease in drydocking amortization due to a reduction in drydockings in the offshore energy segment as the company has been selling its older and smaller vessels 
net interest expense 
net interest expense decreased to million for from million for the same period in the decrease was primarily due to a lower debt balance and lower interest rates as a result of the recapitalization in september other expense  net 
other expense  net decreased to million in compared to other expense of million in this decrease is primarily due to the reduced losses on the early extinguishment of debt 
the company had a loss on early extinguishment of debt of million in compared to a loss on early extinguishment of debt of million in compared with revenue 
revenue decreased to million for from million for due to decreased revenue from the company s offshore energy support segment 
offshore energy support revenue decreased to million for from million in  primarily due to reduced revenue from the us gulf of mexico 
this was offset in part by higher revenue from the west africa operating region 
revenue from the us gulf of mexico decreased during primarily due to reduced exploration and production activity in response to average natural gas prices  high inventories and reduced demand for energy 
the increase in west africa revenue was driven by higher day rates and an expanded vessel count as offshore exploration and production activity remained strong 
the company took advantage of the expanding west africa market by mobilizing three of its gulf of mexico supply boats and one southeast asia utility boat for redeployment to west africa and reactivating one anchor handling tug from held for sale status to active status in west africa during the first half of marine transportation revenue remained substantially the same at million for as compared to million for tanker revenue increased by as a result of improved rates for the company s three chemical carriers operating under contracts of affreightments  as well as better rates on long term time charters 
this was offset by a decrease in revenue for sun state as a result of discontinuing operations in march towing revenue decreased by to million for from million for the decrease in revenue was due to reduced vessel traffic in certain of the company s ports  reflecting the slowdown in international trade  as well as reduced demand for towing services in the offshore market 
operating expenses 
operating expenses decreased to million from million for primarily due to the change from voyage charters to time charters for two tankers  the bareboat charter of a third tanker  and the sale of sun state s marine transportation assets in the first quarter 
since two tankers were changed from voyage charters to time charters in  fuel and port charges significantly decreased as these expenses are the responsibility of the charterer under time charters 
under a bareboat contract  the charterer is responsible for crewing and operating the vessel 
operating expenses for were also adversely affected by a million charge reflecting current and anticipated investment losses sustained by the company s protection and indemnity marine insurance club 
overhead expenses 
overhead expenses increased to million in as compared to million for the same period in the increase was primarily due to an increase in insurance expenses as a result of purchasing a million d o policy for the departing board members due to the recapitalization in september other overhead also increased due to higher bad debt reserve in our west african operations 
as a percentage of revenue  overhead expenses increased to for compared to for the same period in depreciation  amortization  drydocking and other 
depreciation  amortization  drydocking and other expenses increased to million for from million for  primarily due to higher planned drydocking expenditures for offshore energy support vessels and tankers during the second half of and in as a result  drydock amortization expense is also higher as drydock costs are amortized on a straight line basis over the period to the next drydocking generally months 
net interest expense 
net interest expense decreased to million for from million for the same period in the decrease was primarily due to the combination of lower interest rates on variable rate debt and lower outstanding debt balances under our term loans and revolving credit facility 
interest expense also decreased as a result of the recapitalization in september the interest rate on the new credit facility is substantially less than the rate on the company s senior notes  which were redeemed on october  in november  the interest rate under the new credit facility was increased by basis points in accordance with the terms of the commitment letter with the lending banks to syndicate the new credit facility by november  other expense  net 
other expense  net increased to million in compared to other expense of in the increase in other expense is primarily due to a loss on early extinguishment of debt of million in liquidity and capital resources at december   the company had cash on hand of million and working capital of approximately million 
the company s main sources of liquidity are cash from operations  borrowings under our amended credit facility  and proceeds from the sale of vessels with marginal operating performance 
in  cash from operations totaled million  which was million greater than at december   availability under our million amended senior credit facility was approximately million 
additionally  the company received million from the sale of vessels during while the company believes cash from operations will continue to be a meaningful source of liquidity  factors that can affect our operating earnings and liquidity are discussed further in this report under additional business and corporate risk factors in part  item the company relies on external financing to fund a substantial portion of the purchase price of new vessels to its fleet 
the company currently has commitments from various lenders to fund at least of the cost of vessels it has contracted to purchase 
long term debt

the net proceeds of the offering were used to repay a portion of the company s indebtedness under a million credit facility 
interest on the notes will be payable semi annually in arrears  commencing on february  the interest rate on the notes sold to private institutional investors is 
the notes are senior unsecured obligations guaranteed by certain of the company s subsidiaries 
the notes are subject to certain covenants  including  among other things  limiting the company s ability to incur additional indebtedness or issue preferred stock  pay dividends to stockholders  and make investments or sell assets 
on october   the company filed a registration statement with the sec to register substantially identical senior notes to be exchanged for the notes pursuant to a registration rights agreement  so that the notes may be eligible for trading in the public markets 
on november   the registration statement was declared effective and the company completed the exchange offer on december  in connection with the notes offering  the company amended and restated its million credit facility 
the amended credit facility consists of an million revolving credit facility and has a five year maturity 
the amended credit facility is subject to semi annual reductions commencing february  the principal reductions on the amended credit facility are as follows million each in through  and million in interest on the loans is payable monthly  with a variable interest rate

it is secured by first liens on certain of the company s vessels excluding vessels financed with title xi financing and some of its other vessels  second liens on two vessels  and stock of certain subsidiaries and is guaranteed by certain subsidiaries 
the amended credit facility is subject to various financial covenants  including minimum ratios of adjusted ebitda to adjusted interest expense and a minimum ratio of adjusted funded debt to adjusted ebitda  minimum adjusted tangible net worth  and minimum fair market value of the company s vessels 
in october  the company entered into a ten year interest rate swap agreement with fortis bank and other members of its bank group 
the company entered into this transaction in order to mitigate its exposure to interest rate risk 
through this derivative instrument  which covers a notional amount of million  the company effectively converted the interest rate on its outstanding senior notes due august to a floating rate based on libor 
the current effective floating interest rate is 
the swap agreement is secured by a second lien on the assets that secure the company s amended credit facility 
the company entered into the swap transaction at market  and as a result there was no exchange of a premium at the initial date of the transaction 
capital requirements 
the company s capital requirements arise primarily from its need to service debt  fund working capital  maintain and improve its vessels  and make vessel acquisitions 
during  the company incurred million in capital improvements for drydocking costs and newbuild vessels 
approximately million was for drydockings and approximately million was for the purchase of the seabulk africa and the seabulk ipanema 
progress payments on the two brazilian newbuild vessels in totaled approximately million 
the company s expected capital requirements for drydocking costs are million and million for newbuild vessels 
in addition  the company has agreed to purchase two double hull product tankers for approximately million and expects to fund the vessels by a combination of new borrowings and available cash 
the company expects that cash flow from operations will continue to be a significant source of funds for its working capital and capital requirements 
the company s amended credit agreement contains certain restrictive financial covenants that  among other things  requires minimum levels of ebitda and tangible net worth 
a covenant has been amended as of february  to allow the company a greater degree of flexibility under the debt ebitda ratio 
the company is in compliance with the financial covenants of the senior notes at december  the senior notes require the company to make payments of interest only 
based on current financial projections  the company expects to be in compliance through the balance of management continues implementation of the initiative to sell unprofitable vessels in an effort to improve profitability and liquidity 
the possibility exists that unforeseen events or business or regulatory conditions  including deterioration in the markets  could prevent the company from meeting targeted operating results 
if unforeseen events or business or regulatory conditions prevent the company from meeting targeted operating results  the company will continue to pursue alternative plans including additional asset sales  additional reductions in operating expenses  and deferral of capital expenditures  which should enable the company to satisfy essential capital requirements 
while the company believes it could successfully complete alternative plans  if necessary  there can be no assurance that such alternatives would be available or that the company would be successful in its implementation 
cash flows 
net cash provided by operating activities totaled million for the year ended december  compared to million for the same period in the increase in cash provided by operating activities in resulted from lower costs associated with the early retirement of debt in net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the same period in the increase in cash used in investing activities was due primarily to the purchase of vessels and equipment 
in  the company used approximately million for the purchase of the seabulk africa and the seabulk ipanema and approximately million in progress payments for the two brazilian newbuild vessels 
net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the same period in the decrease in cash used in financing activities in is mainly attributable to additional vessel financing  partially offset by the early payout of title xi debt of million see note and payment of deferred financing costs for senior notes and amended credit facility 
debt service and other contractual obligations 
the company s principal and interest obligations for were and million  respectively 
in addition to the required debt service  the company issued million in senior notes to retire million in term loans and million of the revolver  refinanced three of its offshore vessels for million  and paid off million in title xi debt related to three of its towing vessels 
in  principal and interest obligations are expected to be and  respectively 
in  the company had obligations of and for debt and interest  respectively  exclusive of the title xi debt on its five double hull tankers 
in  principal and interest obligations are expected to be and  respectively 
the company is required to make deposits to a title xi reserve fund based on a percentage of net income attributable to the operations of the five double hull tankers  as defined by the title xi bond agreement 
cash held in a title xi reserve fund is invested by the trustee of the fund  and any income earned thereon is either paid to the company or retained in the reserve fund 
withdrawals from the title xi reserve fund may be made for limited purposes  subject to prior approval from us maritime administration marad 
in the second quarter of  the first deposits to the reserve fund were made in the amount of million 
additionally  according to the title xi financial agreement  the company is restricted from distributing excess cash from the operations of the five double hull tankers until certain working capital levels have been reached and maintained 
accordingly  at december   the company had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents that are restricted for use for the operations of the five double hull tankers and cannot be used to fund the company s general working capital requirements 
however  in  the five double hull tankers distributed approximately million to the company for general working capital purposes 
the company expects to receive million during the first quarter of the following summarizes the company s contractual obligations at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on its liquidity and cash flow in future periods 
payments due by period less than over contractual obligations total year years years years in millions long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases newbuild vessels tankers purchase commitment total contractual cash obligations future capital requirements 
our near term cash requirements are related primarily to funding operations 
we cannot provide assurance that our actual cash requirements will not be greater than we currently expect 
if the company cannot generate sufficient cash flow from operations  we may obtain additional sources of funding through capital market transactions 
the company cannot provide assurance that these sources will be available 
effects of inflation the rate of inflation has not had a material impact on our operations 
moreover  if inflation remains at its recent levels  it is not expected to have a material impact on our operations for the foreseeable future 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the accounting executive committee acsec of the american institute of certified public accountants issued an exposure draft of a proposed statement of position sop entitled accounting for certain costs and activities related to property  plant and equipment
