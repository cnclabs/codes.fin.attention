item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we are a global provider of software and hardware products and services that help companies efficiently and securely manage their internet traffic 
our products enhance the delivery  optimization and security of application traffic on internet based networks 
we market and sell our products primarily through indirect sales channels in north america  europe  japan and the asia pacific region 
enterprise customers fortune or business week global companies in financial services  manufacturing  transportation and mobile telecommunications industries continue to make up the largest percentage of our customer base 
our management monitors and analyzes a number of key performance indicators in order to manage our business and evaluate our financial and operating performance 
those indicators include revenues 
the majority of our revenues are derived from sales of our core products  big ip local traffic manager  big ip global traffic manager  big ip isp traffic manager  and firepass ssl vpn servers 
we also derive revenues from the sales of services including annual maintenance contracts  installation  training and consulting services 
we carefully monitor the sales mix of our revenues within each reporting period 
we believe customer acceptance rates of our new products and feature enhancements are key indicators of future trends 
we also consider overall revenue concentration by customer and by geographic region as additional indicators of current and future trends 
cost of revenues and gross margins 
we strive to control our cost of revenues and thereby maintain our gross margins 
significant items impacting cost of revenues are hardware costs paid to our contract manufacturers  third party software license fees  amortization of developed technology  personnel and overhead expenses 
our margins have remained relatively stable over the past two years  however factors such as sales price  product mix  inventory obsolescence  returns  component price increases  and warranty costs could significantly impact our gross margins from quarter to quarter and represent the significant indicators we monitor on a regular basis 
operating expenses 
operating expenses are substantially driven by personnel and related overhead expenses 
existing headcount and future hiring plans are the predominant factors in analyzing and forecasting future operating expense trends 
other significant operating expenses that we monitor include marketing and promotions  travel  professional fees  computer costs related to the development of new products  facilities and depreciation expenses 
liquidity and cash flows 
our financial condition remains strong with significant cash and investments and no long term debt 
the significant increase in cash and investments was primarily due to the net proceeds of million  from the sale of  shares of common stock in a public offering during the first quarter of fiscal going forward  we believe the primary driver of our cash flows will be net income from operations 
capital expenditures during the fiscal year were comprised primarily of tenant improvements to our facilities  computer hardware and software for our information technology infrastructure and equipment related to new product introductions 
during the fiscal year  we acquired magnifire for cash of million of 
table of contents which we have paid million as of september  with the remainder expected to be paid in the upcoming fiscal year 
we will continue to evaluate possible acquisitions of or investments in businesses  products  or technologies that we believe are strategic  which may require the use of cash 
balance sheet 
we view cash  short term and long term investments  deferred revenue  accounts receivable balances and day s sales outstanding as important indicators of our financial health 
deferred revenues increased to million at the end of fiscal  up from million in the prior year 
the increase was due to continued growth in the amount of annual maintenance contracts purchased on new products and maintenance renewal contracts related to our existing product installation base 
our day s sales outstanding were and as of the fiscal years ended september  and  respectively 
the decrease was due to improved collections and changes in the linearity of invoicing during the respective period 
results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
years ended september  in thousands  except for percentages net revenues products services total percentage of net revenues products services total net revenues 
total net revenues increased in fiscal year from fiscal year  compared to an increase of in fiscal year from fiscal year the improvement was due to increased demand for our application traffic management products and higher services revenues resulting from our increased installed base of products 
during fiscal year  each of our primary geographic regions reported higher revenues compared to the prior year period 
international revenues represented  and of net revenues in fiscal years  and  respectively 
we expect international sales will continue to represent a significant portion of net revenues  although we cannot provide assurance that international revenues as a percentage of net revenues will remain at current levels 
net product revenues increased in fiscal year and in fiscal year as compared to the previous fiscal year  respectively 
the increase in fiscal was primarily due to absolute growth in the volume of product sales of our big ip product line as well as incremental revenues derived from sales of our recently introduced firepass product line 
sales of our big ip local traffic manager products represented   and of total product revenues in fiscal years  and  respectively 
the decrease as a percentage of total sales was due to an improvement in sales of our other products  such as our firepass products which represented of product revenues in fiscal year we reported no revenue from sales of trafficshield  our application security product recently acquired as part of our purchase of magnifire 
net service revenues increased in fiscal year compared to a increase for fiscal year from the prior year  respectively 
the continued increases in services revenue were due to an increase 
table of contents in the renewal of service and support contracts by existing customers  as well as an increase in service and support contracts sold with sales of new products 
ingram micro inc  one of our domestic distributors  accounted for and of our total net revenues in fiscal years and  respectively 
ingram micro accounted for and of our accounts receivable as of september   and  respectively

cost of net product revenues consist of finished products purchased from our contract manufacturers  manufacturing overhead  freight  warranty  provisions for excess and obsolete inventory  and amortization expenses in connection with developed technology from recent acquisitions 
cost of net product revenues as a percentage of net product revenues increased to in fiscal year as compared to in fiscal year the increase was due to higher indirect product costs including amortization charges of our acquired technology and warranty costs associated with the growth in overall product installation base 
the decrease in fiscal year was primarily the result of lower warranty  manufacturing and component costs as compared to fiscal year cost of net service revenues 
cost of net service revenues consist of the salaries and related benefits of our professional services staff  travel  facilities  and depreciation expenses 
cost of net service revenues as a percentage of net service revenues decreased to in fiscal year as compared to and in fiscal years and  respectively 
the continued decrease is the result of leveraging our existing services operating infrastructure to support the increased net service revenue 
the increase in absolute dollars in fiscal year is primarily due to increased salary and benefits attributed to growth in headcount 
professional services headcount at the end of fiscal year increased to from at the end of fiscal year going forward  we expect to increase our cost of service revenues to support our expanded product lines and growing customer base 

table of contents years ended september  in thousands  except for percentages operating expenses sales and marketing research and development general and administrative restructuring charges amortization of unearned compensation total operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue sales and marketing research and development general and administrative restructuring charges amortization of unearned compensation total sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist of salaries  commissions and related benefits of our sales and marketing staff  the costs of our marketing programs  including public relations  advertising and trade shows  travel  facilities and depreciation expenses 
the decrease in sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total net revenues is the result of leveraging our existing sales and distribution infrastructure to support the increased net revenues 
in absolute dollars  sales and marketing expenses increased in fiscal year and in fiscal year as compared to the previous fiscal year  respectively 
the increase in fiscal year was primarily due to higher commission  salary  and employee benefit related expenses 
the increase in commission expenses is consistent with the increased revenue for the corresponding period 
the increased salary and benefits were the result of growth in our employee headcount in fiscal year sales and marketing headcount at the end of fiscal increased to from at the end of fiscal the increase in fiscal year  compared to fiscal year  related primarily to increased payroll and related personnel costs  and to a lesser extent higher travel costs associated with increased travel activities 
we will strive to further leverage our sales costs as a percentage of net revenues  but expect to continue to increase sales and marketing expenses in absolute dollars in order to grow revenues and increase our market share 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist of the salaries and related benefits for our product development personnel  prototype materials and expenses related to the development of new and improved products  facilities and depreciation expenses 
in absolute dollars  research and development expenses increased in fiscal year and in fiscal year as compared to the previous fiscal year  respectively 
the increases in fiscal years and were primarily due to higher salary and benefits costs attributed to an increase in headcount to from in fiscal year and in fiscal the growth in employee headcount was primarily related to our acquisition of uroam  inc in july of and the acquisition of magnifire in may of we expect to continue to increase research and development expenses as our future success is dependent on the continued enhancement of our current products and our ability to develop new  technologically advanced products that meet the changing needs of our customers 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist of the salaries  benefits and related costs of our executive  finance  information technology  human resource and legal personnel  third party professional service fees  bad debt charges  facilities  and depreciation expenses 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total net revenues is the result of leveraging our existing corporate infrastructure to support the increased net revenues 
in absolute dollars  general and administrative expenses increased in fiscal year and decreased in fiscal year as compared to the previous fiscal year  respectively 
the increase in fiscal year is due to increased 
table of contents salary and benefit expenses  higher legal expenses related to a patent suit filed by us against a competitor that has since been settled  and increased professional services fees 
general and administrative headcount at the end of fiscal increased to from at the end of fiscal the decrease in fiscal year is primarily due to lower bad debt charges and a decrease in professional services related to patent prosecution and other activities related to our intellectual property 
restructuring charges 
during the third quarter of fiscal year  we recorded a restructuring charge of million in connection with management s decision to exit the cache appliance business 
as a result of changes in the business  we wrote down certain assets  consolidated operations and terminated employees throughout all divisions of the company 
in july  all identified employees had been notified and terminated resulting in an additional charge of million related to employee separation costs 
amortization of unearned compensation 
we have recorded million of stock compensation costs since our inception through september  these compensation costs represented the difference between the exercise price and the deemed fair value of certain stock options granted to our employees and outside directors 
these stock options generally vested ratably over a four year period 
we amortized these compensation costs using an accelerated method as prescribed by fasb interpretation no 
fin no 

as of december   the balance of unearned compensation was fully amortized 
years ended september  in thousands  except for percentages other income and income taxes income loss from operations other income  net income loss before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net income loss other income and income taxes as percentage of revenue income loss from operations other income  net income loss before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net income loss other income  net 
other income  net  consists primarily of income  realized gains and losses of sales of investments  and foreign currency transaction gains and losses 
other income  net  increased in fiscal year and decreased in fiscal year as compared to the previous fiscal year  respectively 
the increase in fiscal year was due to interest income earned on proceeds from our public offering completed in november of the decrease in fiscal year was due to realized losses on sales of investments  declining interest rates and interest income  and an increase in foreign currency transaction losses 
provision for income taxes 
the primary difference between the statutory tax rate and the effective tax rate was due to previous unrecognized deferred tax assets 
sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  or sfas  provides for the recognition of deferred tax assets if realization is more likely than not 
based on available evidence  which includes our historical operating performance and the reported cumulative net losses in all prior years  we had provided for a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets during fiscal years and based upon our operating performance in fiscal year and expected future taxable income  we determined that our us deferred tax assets were more likely than not to be realizable 
therefore  the valuation allowance was reversed and as a result we realized an income tax benefit of million 
the credit from the release of the valuation allowance was partially offset by actual us and international tax expenses resulting in a net benefit for income taxes of million in fiscal year 
table of contents the provision for income taxes in fiscal years and consisted primarily of taxes payable in foreign jurisdictions 
we currently expect our effective tax rate for fiscal to be approximately  however our effective tax rate may fluctuate based on a number of factors including variations in estimated taxable income in our geographic locations  changes in the valuation of our net deferred tax assets or changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof 
liquidity and capital resources we have funded our operations with our cash balances  cash generated from operations and proceeds from public offerings 
years ended september  in thousands liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents and investments cash provided by operating activities cash used in investing activities cash provided by financing activities cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and long term investments totaled million as of september  compared to million as of september   representing an increase of million 
the increase was due to the net proceeds of million from the sale of  shares of common stock in a public offering in november in addition  cash flow from operations and cash from employee stock option exercises contributed significantly to the overall increase since the beginning of our fiscal year 
the overall increase in cash for the year was partially offset by net cash used for the acquisition of magnifire of million as of september  cash provided by operating activities during fiscal year was million compared to million in fiscal year and cash provided in operating activities was million in fiscal year cash provided by operating activities in fiscal years and resulted primarily from cash generated from net income  after adjusting for non cash charges  changes in operating assets and liabilities and an increase in advance payments from customers 
advanced payments from customers increased due to higher sales of service maintenance contracts  which are typically billed at the beginning of the contract term and recognized as revenue over the service period 
in fiscal year  cash provided by operating activities  after adjusting for non cash charges  resulted primarily from changes in operating assets and liabilities  partially offset by net losses for the period 
cash used in investing activities was million for the fiscal year  million for fiscal year and million for fiscal year the cash used in fiscal year was due to the purchase of investments  primarily made possible by the proceeds of our public offering  and the purchase of property and equipment and the acquisition of magnifire  partially offset by the sale of investments 
the cash used in fiscal year was primarily the result of the cash used to acquire substantially all the assets of uroam and the purchase of investments and property and equipment partially offset by the sale of investments 
the cash used in the fiscal year was primarily due to the purchase of investments and property and equipment partially offset by the sale of investments 
cash provided by financing activities was million for fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year and million for the fiscal year during the fiscal year  our financing activities consisted of million net proceeds received from a public stock offering as well as cash received from the exercise of employee stock options and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan 
in fiscal years and  our financing activities primarily related to cash received from the exercise of employee stock options and the purchase of common shares under our employee stock purchase plan 

table of contents we expect that our existing cash and investment balances and cash from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated working capital and capital expenditures for the foreseeable future 
obligations and commitments the following table summarizes our contractual payment obligations and commitments as of september  payment obligations by year thereafter total in thousands operating leases purchase obligations total we lease our facilities under operating leases that expire at various dates through purchase obligations are comprised of purchase commitments with our contract manufacturers 
the agreement with our primary contract manufacturer allows them to procure component inventory on our behalf based on our production forecast 
we are obligated to purchase component inventory that the contract manufacturer procures in accordance with the forecast  unless cancellation is given within applicable lead times 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue in accordance with the guidance provided under statement of position sop no 
 software revenue recognition  and sop no 
modification of sop no 
 software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions  statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists  and sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  and sab no 
 revenue recognition 
we sell products through distributors  resellers  and directly to end users 
we recognize product revenue upon shipment  net of estimated returns  provided that collection is determined to be probable and no significant obligations remain 
in certain regions where we do not have the ability to reasonably estimate returns  revenue is recognized upon sale to the end user 
in this situation  we receive a sales report from the channel partner to determine when the sales transaction to the end user has occurred 
payment terms to domestic customers are generally net days 
payment terms to international customers range from net to days based on normal and customary trade practices in the individual markets 
we have offered extended payment terms ranging from three to six months to certain customers  in which case  revenue is recognized when payments are made 
whenever a software license  hardware  installation and post contract customer support pcs elements are combined into a package with a single bundled price  a portion of the sales price is allocated to each element of the bundled package based on their respective fair values as determined when the individual elements are sold separately 
revenues from the license of software are recognized when the software has been shipped and the customer is obligated to pay for the software 
when rights of return are 
table of contents present and we cannot estimate returns  we recognize revenue when such rights of return lapse 
revenues for pcs are recognized on a straight line basis over the service contract term 
pcs includes rights to upgrades  when and if available  a limited period of telephone support  updates  and bug fixes 
installation revenue is recognized when the product has been installed at the customer s site 
consulting services are customarily billed at fixed rates  plus out of pocket expenses  and revenues are recognized when the consulting has been completed 
training revenue is recognized when the training has been completed 
reserve for doubtful accounts 
estimates are used in determining our allowance for doubtful accounts and are based upon an assessment of selected accounts and as a percentage of our remaining accounts receivable by aging category 
in determining these percentages  we evaluate historical write offs  current trends in the credit quality of our customer base  as well as changes in the credit policies 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition and generally do not require any collateral 
if there is deterioration of a major customer s credit worthiness or actual defaults are higher than our historical experience  our allowance for doubtful accounts may not be sufficient 
reserve for product returns 
in some instances  product revenue from distributors is subject to agreements allowing rights of return 
product returns are estimated based on historical experience and are recorded at the time revenues are recognized 
accordingly  we reduce recognized revenue for estimated future returns at the time revenue is recorded 
when rights of return are present and we cannot estimate returns  revenue is recognized when such rights lapse 
the estimates for returns are adjusted periodically based upon changes in historical rates of returns  inventory in the distribution channel and other related factors 
it is possible that these estimates will change in the future or that the actual amounts could vary from our estimates 
reserve for warranties 
a warranty reserve is established based on our historical experience and an estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date 
while we believe that our warranty reserve is adequate and that the judgment applied is appropriate  such amounts estimated to be due and payable could differ materially from what will actually transpire in the future 
accounting for income taxes 
we utilize the liability method of accounting for income taxes pursuant to sfas accordingly  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure  including assessing the risks associated with tax audits  together with assessing temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
due to the evolving nature of tax rules combined with the large number of jurisdictions in which we operate  it is possible that our estimates of our tax liability could change in the future  which may result in additional tax liabilities and adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
sfas provides for the recognition of deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that those deferred tax assets will be realized 
management reviews deferred tax assets periodically for recoverability and makes estimates and judgments regarding the expected geographic sources of taxable income in assessing the need for a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to their estimated realizable value 
we determined that the valuation allowance relating to net operating loss carryovers in the united kingdom was still necessary and maintained a valuation allowance of approximately million as of september  however  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we reversed the valuation allowance on our u 
s deferred tax assets and as a result realized a benefit of million 
this credit was partially offset by actual tax expenses of million resulting in a net benefit for income taxes of million for the fiscal year factors such as our cumulative profitably in the us and our projected future taxable income were the key criteria in deciding to release the valuation allowance 
if the estimates and assumptions used in our determination change in the future  we could be required to revise our estimates of the valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets and adjust our provisions for additional income taxes 

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements in march  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
eitf provides guidance on other than temporary impairment models for marketable debt and equity securities accounted for under sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  and sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments held by not for profit organizations  and non marketable equity securities accounted for under the cost method 
the eitf developed a basic three step model to evaluate whether an investment is other than temporarily impaired 
on september   the fasb approved the issuance of fasb staff position fsp eitf  which delays the effective date until additional guidance is issued for the application of the recognition and measurement provisions of eitf to investments in securities that are impaired 
we do not expect the adoption of eitf to have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
on march   the fasb issued an exposure draft  share based payment an amendment of fasb statement no 
and the proposed statement addresses the accounting for transactions in which an enterprise receives employee services in exchange for a equity instruments of the enterprise or b liabilities that are based on the fair value of the enterprise s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments 
the proposed statement would eliminate the ability to account for share based compensation transactions using apb no 
 and generally would require instead that such transactions be accounted for using a fair value based method 
as proposed  companies would be required to recognize an expense for compensation cost related to share based payment arrangements including stock options and employee stock purchase plans 
as proposed  the new rules would be applied on a modified prospective basis as defined in the exposure draft  and would be effective for public companies for periods beginning after june  the company is currently evaluating option valuation methodologies and assumptions in light of the evolving accounting standards related to employee stock options 
current estimates of option values using the black scholes method may not be indicative of results from valuation methodologies ultimately adopted in the final rules 
in september  the eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
 the effect of contingently convertible debt on diluted earnings per share 
eitf requires that all issued securities that have embedded conversion features that are contingently exercisable upon the occurrence of a market price condition should be in the calculation of diluted earnings per share  regardless of whether the market price trigger has been met 
eitf will become effective in the period when the proposed amendment to sfas no 
 earnings per share  becomes effective 
we currently have no contingently convertible debt and the adoption of eitf is not expected to materially impact our diluted earnings per share 
risk factors in addition to the other information in this report  the following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating our company and its business 
our success depends on sales and continued innovation of our big ip product line for the fiscal year ended september   we derived of our product revenues from sales of our big ip local traffic manager product line 
we expect to derive a significant portion of our net revenues from sales of our big ip products in the future 
implementation of our strategy depends upon big ip being able to solve critical network availability and performance problems of our customers 
if big ip is unable to solve these problems for our customers  or if we are unable to sustain the high levels of innovation in big ip s product feature set needed to maintain leadership in what will continue to be a competitive market environment  our business and results of operations will be harmed 

table of contents our success depends on our timely development of new products and features  market acceptance of new product offerings and proper management of the timing of the life cycle of our products we expect the secure application traffic management market to be characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product introductions  changes in customer requirements and evolving industry standards 
our continued success depends on our ability to identify and develop new products and new features for our existing products to meet the demands of these changes  and for those products and features to be accepted by our existing and target customers 
if we are unable to identify  develop and deploy new products and new product features on a timely basis  our business and results of operations may be harmed 
in september  we announced the release of our next generation big ip product featuring the traffic management operating system  or tm os 
this major new version of big ip represents the culmination of over two years of research and development efforts and our continued success depends significantly on the acceptance of the new hardware and software platforms associated with this release by our existing and target customers 
the current life cycle of our products is typically to months 
the introduction of new products or product enhancements may shorten the life cycle of our existing products  or replace sales of some of our current products  thereby offsetting the benefit of even a successful product introduction  and may cause customers to defer purchasing our existing products in anticipation of the new products 
this could harm our operating results by decreasing sales  increasing our inventory levels of older products and exposing us to greater risk of product obsolescence 
we have also experienced  and may in the future experience  delays in developing and releasing new products and product enhancements 
this has led to  and may in the future lead to  delayed sales  increased expenses and lower quarterly revenue than anticipated 
also  in the development of our products  we have experienced delays in the prototyping of our products  which in turn has led to delays in product introductions 
in addition  complexity and difficulties in managing product transitions at the end of life stage of a product can create excess inventory of components associated with the outgoing product that can lead to increased expenses 
any or all of the above problems could materially harm our business and operating results 
we may not be able to compete effectively in the emerging secure application traffic management market the markets we serve are new  rapidly evolving and highly competitive  and we expect competition to persist and intensify in the future 
our principal competitors in the secure application traffic management market include cisco systems  inc  nortel networks corporation  foundry networks  inc  netscaler  inc  redline networks  inc  radware ltd 
and juniper networks  inc we expect to continue to face additional competition as new participants enter the secure application traffic management market 
in addition  larger companies with significant resources  brand recognition and sales channels may form alliances with or acquire competing traffic management or security solutions and emerge as significant competitors 
potential competitors may bundle their products or incorporate an internet traffic management or security component into existing products in a manner that discourages users from purchasing our products 
our quarterly and annual operating results are volatile and may cause our stock price to fluctuate our quarterly and annual operating results have varied significantly in the past and will vary significantly in the future  which makes it difficult for us to predict our future operating results 
in particular  we anticipate that the size of customer orders may increase as we continue to focus on larger business accounts 
a delay in the recognition of revenue  even from just one account  may have a significant negative impact on our results of operations for a given period 
in the past  a majority of our sales have been realized near the end of a quarter 
accordingly  a delay in an anticipated sale past the end of a particular quarter may negatively impact our results of operations for that quarter  or in some cases  that year 
additionally  we have exposure to the credit risks of some of our customers and sub tenants 
although we have programs in place that are designed to monitor and mitigate the associated risk  there 
table of contents can be no assurance that such programs will be effective in reducing our credit risks adequately 
we monitor individual payment capability in granting credit arrangements  seek to limit the total credit to amounts we believe our customers can pay  and maintain reserves we believe are adequate to cover exposure for potential losses 
if there is a deterioration of a sub tenant s or major customer s creditworthiness or actual defaults are higher than expected  future resulting losses  if incurred  could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
further  our operating results may be below the expectations of securities analysts and investors in future quarters or years 
our failure to meet these expectations will likely harm the market price of our common stock 
the average selling price of our products may decrease and our costs may increase  which may negatively impact gross profits we anticipate that the average selling prices of our products will decrease in the future in response to competitive pricing pressures  increased sales discounts  new product introductions by us or our competitors or other factors 
therefore  in order to maintain our gross profits  we must develop and introduce new products and product enhancements on a timely basis and continually reduce our product costs 
our failure to do so will cause our net revenue and gross profits to decline  which will harm our business and results of operations 
in addition  we may experience substantial period to period fluctuations in future operating results due to the erosion of our average selling prices 
it is difficult to predict our future operating results because we have an unpredictable sales cycle our products have a lengthy sales cycle  which is difficult to predict 
historically  our sales cycle has ranged from approximately two to three months and has tended to lengthen as we have increasingly focused our sales efforts on the enterprise market 
also  as our distribution strategy has evolved into more of a channel model  utilizing value added resellers  distributors and systems integrators  the level of variability in the length of sales cycle across transactions has increased and made it more difficult to predict the timing of many of our sales transactions 
sales of our big ip  firepass and trafficshield products require us to educate potential customers in their use and benefits 
sales of our products are subject to delays from the lengthy internal budgeting  approval and competitive evaluation processes that large corporations and governmental entities may require 
for example  customers frequently begin by evaluating our products on a limited basis and devote time and resources to testing our products before they decide whether or not to purchase 
customers may also defer orders as a result of anticipated releases of new products or enhancements by our competitors or us 
as a result  our products have an unpredictable sales cycle that contributes to the uncertainty of our future operating results 
our business may be harmed if our contract manufacturer is not able to provide us with adequate supplies of our products or if this single source of hardware assembly is lost or impaired we rely on a third party contract manufacturers to assemble our products 
we outsource the manufacturing of our hardware platforms to contract manufacturers who assemble these hardware platforms to our specifications 
we have experienced minor delays in shipments from contract manufacturers in the past 
however  if we experience major delays in the future or other problems  such as inferior quality and insufficient quantity of product  any one or a combination of these factors may harm our business and results of operations 
the inability of our contract manufacturers to provide us with adequate supplies of our products or the loss of our contract manufacturer may cause a delay in our ability to fulfill orders while we obtain a replacement manufacturer and may harm our business and results of operations 
in particular  because we subcontract substantially all of our manufacturing to a single contract manufacturer  with whom we do not have a long term contract  any termination  loss or impairment in our arrangement with this single source of hardware assembly  or any impairment of their facilities or operations  would harm our business  financial condition and results of operation 

table of contents if the demand for our products grows  we will need to increase our raw material and component purchases  contract manufacturing capacity and internal test and quality functions 
any disruptions in product flow may limit our revenue  may harm our competitive position and may result in additional costs or cancellation of orders by our customers 
our business could suffer if there are any interruptions or delays in the supply of hardware components from our third party sources we currently purchase several hardware components used in the assembly of our products from a number of single or limited sources 
lead times for these components vary significantly 
any interruption or delay in the supply of any of these hardware components  or the inability to procure a similar component from alternate sources at acceptable prices within a reasonable time  may delay assembly and sales of our products and  hence  our revenues  and may harm our business and results of operations 
we may not adequately protect our intellectual property and our products may infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure of confidential and proprietary information to protect our intellectual property rights 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology 
monitoring unauthorized use of our products is difficult  and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation of our technology  particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
our industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
in the ordinary course of our business  we are involved in disputes and licensing discussions with others regarding their claimed proprietary rights and cannot assure you that we will always successfully defend ourselves against such claims 
if we are found to infringe the proprietary rights of others  or if we otherwise settle such claims  we could be compelled to pay damages or royalties and either obtain a license to those intellectual property rights or alter our products so that they no longer infringe upon such proprietary rights 
any license could be very expensive to obtain or may not be available at all 
similarly  changing our products or processes to avoid infringing the rights of others may be costly or impractical 
in addition  we have initiated  and may in the future initiate  claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights  including infringement of a patent we hold on our cookie persistence technology  to determine the scope and validity of our proprietary rights or those of our competitors 
any of these claims  whether claims that we are infringing the proprietary rights of others  or vice versa  with or without merit  may be time consuming  result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel or require us to cease using infringing technology  develop non infringing technology or enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
further  our license agreements typically require us to indemnify our customers and resellers for infringement actions related to our technology  which could cause us to become involved in infringement claims made against our customers or resellers 
any of the above described circumstances relating to intellectual property rights disputes could result in our business and results of operations being harmed 
future changes in financial accounting standards or our revenue recognition policies may cause adverse unexpected revenue fluctuations and affect our reported results of operations a change in accounting policies can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective 
new pronouncements and varying interpretations of pronouncements have occurred with frequency and may occur in the future 
changes to existing rules or the questioning of current practices may adversely affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business 

table of contents in particular  if we are required to record stock option grants as compensation expense on our income statement  our profitability may be reduced significantly 
the current methodology for expensing such stock options is based on  among other things  the historical volatility of the underlying stock 
our stock price has been historically volatile 
therefore  the adoption of an accounting standard requiring companies to expense stock options would negatively impact our profitability and may adversely impact our stock price 
in addition  the adoption of such a standard could limit our ability to continue to use stock options as an incentive and retention tool  which could  in turn  hurt our ability to recruit employees and retain existing employees 
similarly  while we believe our current revenue recognition policies and practices are consistent with applicable accounting standards  current revenue recognition accounting standards  and accounting guidance with respect to such standards  are subject to change 
such changes could lead to unanticipated changes in our current revenue accounting practices  and such changes could significantly reduce our future revenues and earnings  which would likely have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock 
we are required to comply with section of the sarbanes oxley act of regarding internal control attestation and any inability to do so may negatively impact the report on our financial statements to be provided by our independent auditors we are in the process of implementing the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act of which requires our management to assess the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting and include an assertion in our annual report as to the effectiveness of our controls 
subsequently  our independent auditors  pricewaterhousecoopers llp  will be required to attest to whether our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting is fairly stated in all material respects and separately report on whether it believes we maintained  in all material respects  effective internal controls over financial reporting as of september  we are in the process of performing the system and process documentation  evaluation and testing required for management to make this assessment and for the auditors to provide its attestation report 
we have not completed this process or its assessment  and this process will require significant amounts of management time and resources 
we expect to comply with the reporting disclosure requirements of section by our year ending september   including remediation of any deficiencies identified in our existing internal controls 
however  if we are not able to remediate any identified deficiencies in a timely fashion or to otherwise comply with the section requirements for the year ending september   we will not be able to give assurance regarding the effectiveness of our internal controls and the attestation report on our evaluation of our internal controls provided by our independent auditors may be negatively affected 
we may not be able to sustain or develop new distribution relationships and a reduction or delay in sales to a significant distribution partner could hurt our business our sales strategy requires that we establish and maintain multiple distribution channels in the united states and internationally through leading industry resellers  systems integrators  internet service providers and other channel partners 
we have a limited number of agreements with companies in these channels  and we may not be able to increase our number of distribution relationships or maintain our existing relationships 
if we are unable to establish and maintain our indirect sales channels  our business and results of operations will be harmed 
in addition  one domestic distributor of our products accounted for and of our total net revenue for the fiscal years and  respectively 
a substantial reduction or delay in sales of our products to this or any other key distribution partner could harm our business  operating results and financial condition 

table of contents undetected software errors may harm our business and results of operations software products frequently contain undetected errors when first introduced or as new versions are released 
we have experienced these errors in the past in connection with new products and product upgrades 
we expect that these errors will be found from time to time in new or enhanced products after commencement of commercial shipments 
these problems may cause us to incur significant warranty and repair costs  divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts and cause significant customer relations problems 
we may also be subject to liability claims for damages related to product errors 
while we carry insurance policies covering this type of liability  these policies may not provide sufficient protection should a claim be asserted 
a material product liability claim may harm our business and results of operations 
our products must successfully operate with products from other vendors 
as a result  when problems occur in a network  it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem 
the occurrence of software errors  whether caused by our products or another vendor s products  may result in the delay or loss of market acceptance of our products 
the occurrence of any of these problems may harm our business and results of operations 
our expansion into international markets may not succeed we intend to continue expanding into international markets 
international sales represented of our net revenues for the fiscal year ended september   of our net revenues for the fiscal year ended september  and of our net revenues for the fiscal year ended september  we have engaged sales personnel throughout japan  europe and the asia pacific region 
our continued growth will require further expansion of our international operations in the japanese  european  asia pacific and other markets 
if we are unable to expand our international operations successfully and in a timely manner  our business and results of operations may be harmed 
such expansion may be more difficult or take longer than we anticipate  and we may not be able to successfully market  sell  deliver and support our products internationally 
our operating results are exposed to risks associated with international commerce as our international sales increase  our operating results become more exposed to international operating risks 
these risks include risks related to potential recessions in economies outside the united states  foreign currency exchange rates  managing foreign sales offices  regulatory  political  or economic conditions in specific countries  military conflict or terrorist activities  changes in laws and tariffs  inadequate protection of intellectual property rights in foreign countries  foreign regulatory requirements  and natural disasters 
all of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in particular  in fiscal year  we derived of our total revenue from the japanese market 
this revenue is dependent on a number of factors outside our control  including the viability and success of our resellers and the strength of the japanese  which has been weak in recent years 
acquisitions  including our recent acquisition of magnifire  present many risks and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that are contemplated at the time of the transaction with respect to our may acquisition of all of the capital stock of magnifire  as well as any other future acquisitions we may undertake  we may find that the acquired assets do not further our business strategy as expected  or that we paid more than what the assets are later worth  or that economic conditions change  all of which may generate future impairment charges 
there may be difficulty integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired business  and we may have difficulty retaining the key personnel of the acquired business 
in the case of the acquisition of magnifire  because it was based in israel and because the employees we hired in connection with the acquisition were not relocated to seattle  the above mentioned integration and personnel retention issues represent a particular risk to us 
we may have difficulty in incorporating the acquired technologies or products with our existing product lines 
our ongoing business and management s attention may be disrupted or diverted by transition or 
table of contents integration issues and the complexity of managing geographically and culturally diverse locations 
we may have difficulty maintaining uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies across locations 
we may experience significant problems or liabilities associated with the product quality  technology and other matters 
our inability to successfully operate and integrate newly acquired businesses appropriately  effectively and in a timely manner  or to retain key personnel of magnifire or any other acquired business  could have a material adverse effect on our ability to take advantage of further growth in demand for integrated traffic management and security solutions and other advances in technology  as well as on our revenues  gross margins and expenses 
in particular  in connection with our acquisition of magnifire  we initiated a significant change in our organizational structure  forming a new security business unit headed by one of our most senior executives 
the aim of this new division  which includes our firepass and trafficshield products  is to provide focus and expertise across research and development  marketing  sales and services to position our business for success and leadership in application security  however  we may find that this organizational realignment does not achieve our desired goals with respect to the application security market and that the shift in resources away from our core application traffic management market may result in a weakening of our competitive position in the latter market and ultimately have a material adverse effect on our overall business results 
our success depends on our key personnel and our ability to attract  train and retain qualified marketing and sales  professional services and customer support personnel our success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our key management  product development  sales  marketing and finance personnel  many of which may be difficult to replace 
the complexity of our secure application traffic management products and their integration into existing networks and ongoing support  as well as the sophistication of our sales and marketing effort  requires us to retain highly trained professional services  customer support and sales personnel 
in spite of the economic downturn  competition for qualified professional services  customer support and sales personnel in our industry is intense because of the limited number of people available with the necessary technical skills and understanding of our products 
our ability to retain and hire these personnel may be adversely affected by volatility or reductions in the price of our common stock  since these employees are generally granted stock options 
the loss of services of any of our key personnel  the inability to retain and attract qualified personnel in the future or delays in hiring qualified personnel  may harm our business and results of operations 
we face litigation risks we are a party to lawsuits in the normal course of our business 
litigation in general  and intellectual property and securities litigation in particular  can be expensive  lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations 
moreover  the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict 
we believe that we have defenses in the lawsuits pending against us and we are vigorously contesting these allegations 
responding to the allegations has been  and will likely continue to be  expensive and time consuming for us 
an unfavorable resolution of the lawsuits could adversely affect our business  results of operations  or financial condition 
anti takeover provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us our board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to determine the price  rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions  including voting rights  of those shares without any further vote or action by the stockholders 
the rights of the holders of common stock may be subject to  and may be adversely affected by  the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
the issuance of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change of control of our company without further action by our stockholders and may adversely affect the voting and other rights of the holders of common stock 
further  certain provisions of our bylaws  including a provision limiting the ability of stockholders to raise matters at a meeting of 
table of contents stockholders without giving advance notice  may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or management of our company  which could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
in addition  our articles of incorporation provide for a staggered board  which may make it more difficult for a third party to gain control of our board of directors 
similarly  state anti takeover laws in the state of washington related to corporate takeovers may prevent or delay a change of control of our company 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate risk 
our cash equivalents consist of high quality securities  as specified in our investment policy guidelines 
the policy limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue or issuer to a maximum of of the total portfolio with the exception of us treasury securities  commercial paper and money market funds  which are exempt from size limitation 
the policy requires investments in securities that mature in three years or less  with the average maturity being no greater than one and a half years 
these securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if interest rates increase 
a decrease of one percent in the average interest rate would have resulted in a decrease of approximately million in our interest income 
maturing in three months three months greater than or less to one year one year total fair value in thousands  except for percentages september  included in cash and cash equivalents weighted average interest rate included in short term investments weighted average interest rates included in long term investments weighted average interest rates september  included in cash and cash equivalents weighted average interest rate included in short term investments weighted average interest rates included in long term investments weighted average interest rates september  included in cash and cash equivalents weighted average interest rate included in short term investments weighted average interest rates foreign currency risk 
the majority of our sales and expenses are denominated in us dollars and as a result  we have not experienced significant foreign currency transaction gains and losses to date 
while we have conducted some transactions in foreign currencies during the fiscal year ended september  and expect to continue to do so  we do not anticipate that foreign currency transaction gains or losses will be significant at our current level of operations 
however  as we continue to expand our operations internationally  transaction gains or losses may become significant in the future 
we have not engaged in foreign currency hedging to date 
however  we may do so in the future
