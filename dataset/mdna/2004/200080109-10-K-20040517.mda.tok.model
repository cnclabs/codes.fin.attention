item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the discussion that follows provides analysis and information that management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto included in part ii  item of this report  and the section entitled risk factors  uncertainties and other factors that may affect results of operations and financial condition included in part i  item of this report 
overview comarco  inc  through its subsidiary comarco wireless technologies  inc 
collectively  we  comarco  or the company  is a leading provider of wireless test solutions for the wireless industry 
comarco also designs and manufactures emergency call box systems and mobile power products for notebook computers  cellular telephones  pdas  and other handheld devices 
our operations consist solely of the operations of comarco wireless technologies  inc cwt 
our revenue is primarily derived from sales of our wireless test solutions and wireless applications products  and from services related to the maintenance of deployed emergency call box systems 
we have two reportable operating segments wireless test solutions wts and wireless applications 
see segment reporting in note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this report 
critical accounting policies we have identified the following as critical accounting policies to our company revenue recognition  software development costs  accounts receivable  inventory  income taxes  valuation of goodwill  and valuation of long lived assets 
revenue recognition we recognize product revenue upon shipment of products provided there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
for our wireless test solutions products that are integrated with embedded software  we recognize revenue using the residual method pursuant to requirements of statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition  and other applicable revenue recognition guidance and interpretations 
under the residual method  we allocate revenue to the undelivered element  typically maintenance  based on its respective fair value  with the fair value determined by the price charged when that element is sold separately 
we amortize the revenue allocated to the maintenance element evenly over the term of the maintenance commitment made at the time of sale 
we expense as incurred the costs associated with honoring the maintenance commitment 

table of contents we recognize service revenue as services are performed 
maintenance revenue from extended warranty sales is deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance agreement  typically months 
revenue for services under long term contracts  for engineering services  which ceased operations in the second quarter of fiscal  was recognized using the percentage of completion method on the basis of percentage of costs incurred to date on a contract  relative to the estimated total contract costs 
profit estimates on long term contracts were revised periodically based on changes in circumstances and any losses on contracts were recognized in the period in which such losses became known 
significant management judgments must be made and used in connection with the recognition of revenue in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if our management made different judgments 
software development costs we capitalize software developed for sale or lease in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed 
software costs incurred subsequent to the determination of the technological feasibility of the software product are capitalized 
our policy is to capitalize the costs associated with development of new products but expense the costs associated with subsequent maintenance releases  if any 
significant management judgment is required in determining whether technological feasibility has been achieved for a particular software project 
capitalization ceases and amortization of capitalized costs begins when the software product is available for general release to customers 
capitalized software development costs  net of related amortization  are compared to management s estimate of projected revenues quarterly to determine if any impairment in value has occurred that would require an adjustment in the carrying value or change in expected useful lives under the guidelines established under sfas no 
we also continually evaluate the recoverability of software acquired through acquisition or by direct purchase of technology 
we had million of capitalized software at january   net of accumulated amortization of million 
capitalized software amortization expense is included in cost of revenue 
the amortization period for the software costs capitalized is the shorter of the economic life of the related product  typically two to four years  or based on expected unit sales under the sales ratio method 
accounts receivable we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits and related terms based upon payment history and our customers current credit worthiness 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
since our accounts receivable are concentrated in a relatively few number of customers  a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any one of these customers could have a material adverse effect on the collectibility of our accounts receivable and our future operating results 
specifically  our management must make estimates of the uncollectibility of our accounts receivable 
management analyzes specific customer accounts  historical bad debt  trends  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the allowance for doubtful accounts in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our losses for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
inventory we value our inventory at the lower of the actual cost to purchase and or manufacture the inventory calculated on average costs  which approximates first in  first out basis or the current estimated market value of the 
table of contents inventory 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on our estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements for the next twelve months 
as experienced during fiscal  demand for our products can fluctuate significantly 
a significant increase in the demand for our products could result in a short term increase in the cost of inventory purchases while a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory on hand 
in addition  our industry is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product development  and rapid product obsolescence that could result in an increase in the amount of obsolete inventory quantities on hand 
additionally  our forecasts of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may have understated or overstated the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory 
in the future  if our inventory were determined to be overvalued  we would be required to recognize such costs in our cost of goods sold at the time of such determination 
therefore  although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our operating results 
income taxes we assess our deferred tax assets to determine the amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
we consider future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
various other indicators are also considered  including the existence of cumulative tax losses during recent years 
if the company can not generate sufficient taxable income during the fiscal year  it may be necessary to reserve some or all of the deferred tax assets 
if we determine that we will not realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  we will establish a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets  which will be charged to income tax expense in the period of such determination 
valuation of goodwill effective february   we implemented sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
establishes new standards for goodwill acquired in a business combination  eliminates amortization of goodwill  and sets forth methods for periodically evaluating goodwill for impairment 
under sfas no 
 goodwill impairment is deemed to exist if the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value generally determined using a discounted cash flow methodology applied to the particular unit 
this methodology differs from our previous policy  in accordance with accounting standards existing at that time  of using undiscounted cash flows on an enterprise wide basis to determine recoverability 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we recorded a non cash charge of million to write down fully the carrying value of the goodwill related to our edx reporting unit 
this reporting unit is included in our wireless test solutions segment for financial reporting purposes  and the related goodwill was generated through our acquisition of edx engineering  inc in december such charge is reflected as a component of discontinued operations 
future impairments of intangible assets  if any  will be recorded as operating expenses 
we assess goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter of each year or on an interim basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 
the purchase method of accounting for acquisitions requires extensive use of accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price to the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired 
the 
table of contents amounts and useful lives assigned to intangible assets impact future amortization 
if the assumptions and estimates used to allocate the purchase price are not correct  purchase price adjustments or future asset impairment charges could be required 
valuation of long lived assets we evaluate long lived assets used in operations  including purchased intangible assets  when indicators of impairment  such as reductions in demand or significant economic slowdowns that negatively impact our customers or markets  are present 
reviews are performed to determine whether the carrying value of assets is impaired based on comparison to the undiscounted expected future cash flows 
if the comparison indicates that there is impairment  the impaired asset is written down to fair value  which is typically calculated using a weighted average of the market approach and the discounted expected future cash flows using a discount rate based upon our cost of capital 
impairment is based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets 
significant management judgment is required in the forecast of future operating results that is used in the preparation of expected discounted cash flows 
it is reasonably possible that the estimates of anticipated future net revenue  the remaining estimated economic life of the products and technologies  or both  could differ from those used to assess the recoverability of these assets 
in that event  additional impairment charges or shortened useful lives of certain long lived assets could be required 
results of operations continuing operations wireless test solutions our wts business designs and manufactures hardware and software tools for use by wireless carriers  equipment vendors  and others 
radio engineers  network improvement professionals and technicians  and others use these test tools to design  deploy  and optimize wireless networks  and to verify the performance of the wireless networks once deployed 
management currently considers the following events  trends  and uncertainties to be important to understanding our wts business the wireless communications industry has historically experienced a dramatic rate of growth both in the united states and internationally 
during the past several years  however  many wireless carriers have re evaluated their network deployment plans in response to downturns in the capital markets  changing perceptions regarding industry growth  the adoption of new wireless technologies  increasing price competition for subscribers and a general economic slowdown in the united states and internationally 
that trend appears to have just recently begun to change 
during fiscal year  in response to consumer demand for improved network coverage  quality of service  and enhanced data services  domestic wireless carriers increased capital spending on their networks  which we believe results in increased demand for our wts products 
we expect this trend to continue in fiscal our european operation experienced year over year revenue growth primarily driven by sales of our seven 
five product platform to european wireless carriers 
we expect our european operation to continue to experience year over year revenue growth in fiscal based on the demand we are experiencing during the first quarter of fiscal  as well as planned technology deployments by wireless carriers 
during the first half of fiscal  we completed the development of our seven 
five hardware platform and various related software applications  and began shipping products to customers in europe  north america and latin america 
seven 
five is a hardware and software solution that is flexible  scalable  and modular allowing our customers to work with all g  g and g technologies 

table of contents the seven 
five product family consists of the following seven 
five solo suited for network deployment activities  solo is a single calling module product available with a family of audio and data qos algorithms 
it is an entry level product  capable of seamless migration to the seven

duo supports up to two calling modules  which can have mixed technologies  and one multi band  multi technology rf scanner 
a portability kit is available for in building needs 
seven 
five multi designed for flexibility and scalability  seven 
five multi can house up to any combination of six calling modules or scanners in each chassis 
multiple chassis can be combined to allow for up to calling modules 
the customer can mix and match technologies for benchmarking applications or configure a system with similar technologies for optimization activities 
multi is also available with a portability kit for in building and pedestrian testing needs 
seven 
five multi band  multi technology rf scanner the most advanced scanner for field test applications 
capable of scans of over channels per second in multiple frequency bands  with multiple technologies  doing dvcc  bsic and pn decoding simultaneously 
the scanner offers spectrum analyzer type measurements and full baseband decoding for gsm  edge  is  cdma and wcdma 
wireless applications our wireless applications business designs and manufactures emergency call box systems and mobile power products for notebook computers  cellular telephones  pdas  and other handheld devices 
our call box products provide emergency communication over existing wireless networks 
in addition to the call box products  we provide system installation and long term maintenance services 
currently  there are approximately  call boxes that we service and maintain under long term agreements which expire at various dates through february management currently considers the following events  trends  and uncertainties to be important to understanding our wireless applications business anticipated projects to upgrade and expand existing emergency call box systems are concentrated with several customers that are agencies of california s state and local governments 
due to california s financial challenges  we are unable to forecast the timing of these projects and related revenue 
we are transitioning the distribution of our chargesource mobile power products to a new and exclusive distributor 
we expect this transition to continue to take place through the second quarter of fiscal during this transition period  we are unable to accurately forecast the timing of the product roll out by our new distribution partner 
however  based on our past experience of sales of similar products to national electronics retailers  and our estimated roll out timing  we expect revenue for the second half of fiscal to exceed the same for the first half of the fiscal year 
we also expect that by the fourth quarter of fiscal  revenue from the sale of our chargesource products to be on an annual run rate of approximately million 
approximately percent of our call box revenue is derived from agencies of california s state and local governments 
the state of california is currently experiencing severe financial challenges 
we believe these challenges have created uncertainty with respect to the spending patterns of our california based customers 
as a result  projects and the related contracts to upgrade and expand certain call box systems have been delayed 
while we currently believe that these projects will move ahead during fiscal  we are unable to forecast the timing of such events in the near term 

table of contents our wireless applications business also includes the chargesource family of mobile power products 
designed with the needs of the traveling professional in mind  our chargesource mobile power products provide a high level of functionality and compatibility in an industry leading compact design 
our current and planned product offering consists of universal ac dc  ac  and dc power adapters designed for the right mix of power output and functionality for most retail  oem  and enterprise customers 
our chargesource products are also universal allowing those who use rechargeable electronic devices to carry just one power adapter 
by simply changing the compact smarttip connected to the end of the charging cable  our universal power adapters are capable of charging and powering multiple target devices  including most notebook computers  cellular telephones  pdas  and other handheld devices 
until recently  most notebook computers required no more than watts of power to operate 
however  the personal computer industry is currently transitioning to notebook computers with increasing power requirements 
as power requirements increase  so does the size of the oem power adapter sold with each notebook computer 
to address this industry wide trend  we have developed a family of high power chargesource products that are compatible with most legacy  current  and planned notebook computers 
these new chargesource products are able to deliver up to watts of power in a very small form factor 
we believe our patented electrical designs will continue to be the basis for even higher power universal power adapters that are expected to meet evolving global standards  including the planned standards of the european union eu  and the increasing power requirements of the notebook computer oems  and allow us to offer customers cutting edge technology without significantly increasing the size or weight of our products 
we also expect these higher power universal power adapters to continue to be significantly smaller and lighter than their oem counterpart 
historically  our chargesource mobile power products have been distributed by targus group international targus 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal we terminated our relationship with targus and entered into a strategic agreement with belkin corporation belkin 
under this agreement belkin is granted exclusive worldwide distribution rights to distribute our chargesource products in several strategic end market categories including electronic retailers  specialty retailers  oem third party options and fortune corporate customers 
however  due to the exclusive nature of our agreement with belkin  our direct access to certain significant distribution channels has been limited 
on march  and in cooperation with the us consumer products safety commission cpsc  we voluntarily initiated a product safety recall of our legacy chargesource watt universal ac power adapters 
this product safety recall impacts approximately  units that were sold in fiscal comarco and targus entered into an agreement to address the impact of the recall action 
under the terms of the agreement comarco issued a million credit to targus in fiscal in consideration of a full release 
of the million credit issued to targus in the fourth quarter of fiscal  qualifying product returns totaling million were received from targus through october  during the third quarter of fiscal  the remaining million unused credit was recorded as revenue  consistent with the expiration of the right of return and the term of the agreement 
additionally  in the fourth quarter of fiscal we accrued  in costs related to the recall action in cost of revenue 
we believe that any additional product recall costs will be minor and any such costs will be expensed as incurred

as discussed below  the decrease is attributable to decreased sales of our wireless application products and services partially offset by increased sales of our wts products 
total revenue for fiscal was million compared to million for fiscal  a decrease of approximately million or percent 
the decrease was due to an million decrease in sales of our wts products and services  partially offset by a million increase in sales of our wireless applications products and services 
for fiscal as compared to the prior year  revenue from products decreased percent to million while revenue from services decreased percent to million 
the product revenue decrease reflects the decreased demand for our call box products  which declined million or percent  offset by an increase in sales of our wts products of million or percent and an increase in sales of our chargesource products of million or percent  including million of revenue recognized in the third quarter of fiscal related to the reversal of an unused recall credit initially recognized in the fourth quarter of fiscal the services revenue decrease was due to our exit from the engineering services business during the second quarter of fiscal revenue from engineering services totaled and million for fiscal and  respectively 
the fiscal services revenue decrease was offset by a  increase in call box service revenue in the current year 

table of contents for fiscal as compared to the prior year  revenue from products decreased percent to million  while revenue from services decreased percent to million 
the product revenue decrease reflected the softness in the wireless industry and decreased demand for our legacy wts products  which declined million or percent  offset by an increase in sales of our chargesource products of million or percent  net of a million credit issued to targus in conjunction with the product safety recall of our watt universal chargesource power adapter and a million  or percent  increase in call box product sales 
see the section below titled chargesource product safety recall for additional discussion 
the services revenue decrease was due to our exit from the engineering services business during the second quarter of fiscal cost of revenue and gross margin total cost of revenue for fiscal decreased million or percent to million 
as discussed below  we recorded non recurring charges in the amount of million to cost of sales in the prior fiscal year 
as a percentage of revenue  gross margin increased to percent compared to percent  adjusted for non recurring charges  for fiscal total cost of revenue for fiscal was million compared to million for fiscal  an increase of approximately million or percent 
cost of revenue for fiscal included a non cash inventory impairment charge  totaling approximately million and a million non cash write off of software development costs 
these charges are attributable to our wireless test solutions business 
see the section below entitled asset impairment charges for additional discussion 
cost of revenue for fiscal also included approximately million of costs accrued in connection with the product safety recall of our chargesource watt universal power adapters 
see the section below entitled chargesource product safety recall for additional discussion 
excluding the inventory impairment  software development write off and product safety recall charges  total cost of revenue for fiscal was million 
as a percentage of revenue  gross margin for fiscal decreased to percent compared to percent for the prior fiscal year 
as discussed below  the decrease in gross margin was primarily due to a change in our mix of business  our exit from engineering services  and the negative effect of significantly reduced sales and decreasing gross margins of our historically higher margin wireless test solution products 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased million or percent to million in fiscal the increase was due to legal settlements and related fees in the amount of million incurred during the first half of fiscal  partially offset by reductions in other indirect costs and reduced legal fees in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal selling  general and administrative costs for fiscal were million compared to million for the prior fiscal year  a decrease of million or percent 
this decrease was due to reduced staffing levels  selling expenses  and incentive compensation driven by significantly reduced sales of our wts products and services

asset impairment charges during fiscal  as a response to reduced demand for legacy wts products in the wireless marketplace and our strategy of investing available resources in the development of seven 
five  we analyzed the carrying value of all assets attributable to our wts business 
based on this analysis  we recorded asset impairment charges totaling million during the second quarter of fiscal the following table sets forth the impaired assets and corresponding impairment charges in thousands for fiscal 
table of contents property and equipment software development costs included in cost of revenue intangible assets included in discontinued operations goodwill included in discontinued operations in addition to the asset impairment charges above  an inventory impairment charge totaling million was recorded as cost of revenue during fiscal the above impaired assets  as well as the inventory impairment charge  were exclusively related to our legacy g wireless test solutions products and did not include any assets related to our engineering services business  which ceased operations during the second quarter of fiscal the exit costs associated with our exit from the engineering services business totaled  chargesource product safety recall in fiscal and in cooperation with the us cpsc  we announced a voluntary product safety recall of approximately  detachable plugs used on our chargesource watt universal ac power adapter 
in conjunction with the product safety recall  the company and targus  the exclusive distributor of the chargesource products at that time  entered into an agreement addressing the impact of the recall action 
accordingly  we accrued both a million credit due to targus reducing sales and additional recall costs of approximately million classified in cost of revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal during the third quarter of fiscal in conjunction with the expiration of the right of return and the term of the agreement  we recognized the unused portion of the credit in the amount of million as revenue 
engineering and support expenses we capitalize costs incurred for the development of software embedded in our wireless test solutions products subsequent to establishing technological feasibility 
these capitalized costs are subject to an ongoing assessment of recoverability based on anticipated future revenue and changes in hardware and software technologies 
costs that are capitalized include direct labor and related overhead 
engineering and support costs for fiscal and are as follows january  in thousands engineering less capitalized software development support costs engineering and support costs  net of capitalized software development costs  for fiscal were million compared to million for the prior fiscal year  an increase of approximately million 
gross engineering and support costs  before reduction for capitalized software development costs  remained flat at million in comparison to fiscal engineering costs increased million related to higher staffing levels for the development of our newly released chargesource products 
support costs decreased million related to reduced staffing levels for the wireless test solutions department  consistent with the development and release of the seven 
five product family  which operates under a single platform 

table of contents engineering and support costs for fiscal and are as follows january  in thousands engineering less capitalized software development support costs engineering and support costs  net of capitalized software development costs  for fiscal increased percent to million compared to fiscal gross engineering and support costs  before reduction for capitalized software development costs  decreased million in comparison to fiscal this decrease is a result of our strategy of reducing the cost structure supporting our wireless test solutions business and developing a single flexible product platform 
offsetting this cash savings and consistent with the reduction in the number of on going software development programs  capitalized software development costs decreased million resulting in an increase in engineering and support costs  net of capitalized software development costs  of million for fiscal in comparison to the prior fiscal year 
other income  net other income  net  consisting primarily of interest income  decreased approximately million to million for fiscal compared to the prior fiscal year 
this decrease was primarily due to lower invested cash balances and reduced interest rates earned on invested cash balances 
other income decreased million to million for fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily as a result of lower invested cash balances for much of fiscal income tax expense the effective tax rate for fiscal   and was percent  percent  and percent  respectively

the increase reflects sales of our new product platform  seven 
five  which was released in the first quarter of fiscal wireless test solutions revenue for fiscal was million compared to million for fiscal  a decrease of approximately million or percent 
this decrease primarily reflects the reduced demand for our legacy g wireless test solution products  as well as reduced engineering services  which we ceased providing during the second quarter of fiscal revenue from engineering services for fiscal and totaled million and million  respectively 
cost of revenue and gross margin wireless test solutions cost of revenue for fiscal was million compared to million for fiscal  a decrease of approximately million or percent 
excluding the inventory impairment charge and software development write off of million recorded in fiscal  gross margin increased percent from percent to percent in fiscal the increase in margin is attributable to increased absorption of manufacturing overhead expenses and reduced labor costs when viewed as a percentage of revenue  driven by increased sales of our hardware and software tools

as discussed above  during fiscal  we recorded non cash impairment charges totaling approximately million 
excluding this asset impairment charge  wireless test solutions cost of revenue for fiscal was million 
as a percentage of revenue  gross margin for fiscal decreased to percent compared to percent for the prior fiscal year 
the decrease in gross margin is primarily due to decreased absorption of fixed costs attributable to dramatically lower revenue 
wireless applications years ended january  restated in thousands revenue cost of revenue cost of goods sold software development amortization total cost of revenue gross profit gross margin revenue wireless applications revenue for fiscal was million compared to million for fiscal  a decrease of million or percent 
the decrease is primarily due to decreased call box products revenue of million  partially offset by increased call box service revenue of million and chargesource product sales of million 
in fiscal we completed a text telephony tty call box upgrade for the hearing impaired for the county of orange  california  and a system expansion for the metropolitan transportation commission mtc in california that contributed and million  respectively  to call box product sales 
in fiscal  we had no similar installation or upgrade projects 
we believe that the current political and financial challenges facing the state of california have adversely impacted our call box product sales 

table of contents in the second quarter of fiscal we began shipping our newest generation of chargesource products  the watt ac dc and dc adapters 
the increase in chargesource product sales of million includes the million unused recall credit issued to our former distributor in conjunction with the product safety recall of our chargesource watt universal ac power adapter 
wireless applications revenue for fiscal was million compared to million for fiscal  an increase of approximately million or percent 
this increase was primarily due to increased sales of our chargesource mobile power products 
our combined chargesource sales increased approximately million to million for fiscal  net of the million credit issued to our exclusive distributor in conjunction with the product safety recall of our chargesource watt universal ac power adapter  as discussed above 
all chargesource products were distributed exclusively by targus under non cancelable commitments during fiscal years   and for fiscal   and  sales to targus totaled approximately million  million  and million  respectively 
under our new distributor agreement with belkin  belkin has certain non cancelable commitments to purchase our chargesource products 
in the event belkin is unable to perform under these commitments due to its inability to take delivery of ordered products and or pay for such products in a timely manner  we would be required to establish alternative distribution channels 
the financial impact of a material change in our relationship with belkin cannot be precisely quantified  but we believe that a six to twelve month disruption in the distribution of our chargesource products would have a negative impact on our revenue and operating results  which could also result in decreased liquidity 
cost of revenue and gross margin wireless applications cost of revenue for fiscal was million compared to million for fiscal  a decrease of million or percent 
as a percentage of revenue and excluding the recall credit and costs associated with the product safety recall incurred in fiscal  gross margin for fiscal decreased to percent from percent

excluding the cost of the product safety recall  cost of revenue for fiscal was million 
as a percentage of revenue and excluding the credit and costs associated with the product safety recall  gross margin for fiscal increased to percent from percent for fiscal the increase in wireless applications gross margin is primarily attributable to several higher margin call box upgrade projects completed during fiscal discontinued operations on january   we sold the assets of the reporting unit edx 
this reporting unit was formerly included in the wireless test solutions segment  and has been classified as discontinued operations 
income from discontinued operations was  for fiscal  which includes income from operations of  on revenue of million  plus an after tax gain of  on the sale of edx 
the loss from discontinued operations for fiscal and was million and  respectively 
the loss from discontinued operations for fiscal included the asset impairment charges in the amount of million to write off the goodwill and intangible assets related to the edx reporting unit 
these charges were offset by a million tax benefit 
excluding these items income from discontinued operations would have been  in fiscal the loss from discontinued operations for fiscal included amortization of edx related goodwill and intangible assets in the amount of  excluding amortization expense  income from discontinued operations would have been  in fiscal restatement of previously issued financial statements the company has restated its previously issued financial statements for the items described below estimated employee bonuses were accrued at the end of the fiscal prior to the filing of the company s fiscal form k  the compensation committee of the board of directors decreased the estimated bonus award by approximately  but the company did not adjust the bonus accrual 
the fiscal operating results have been restated to reflect reduced bonus expense of  the restatement adjustment was allocated between selling  general and administrative costs and engineering and product support costs in the amount of  and  respectively 
prior to the fiscal year  the company allocated revenue from the sales of its wireless test solutions products between the product and first year maintenance using an estimate of the fair value of such maintenance as a percentage of the total sales price 
the company has determined that the fair value of the first year maintenance based on vendor specific objective evidence was higher than the previously estimated percentage  percent versus percent 
see note for a further discussion of the company s revenue recognition policies 
the fiscal and financial statements have been restated using the actual fair value of the first year maintenance as a percentage of the total sales price 
the effect of the restatement was to increase revenue in fiscal and by  and  respectively 
the restatement attributable to this matter also decreased january  retained earnings by  during fiscal  the company completed the sale of its defense and commercial staffing businesses 
the sales and operations of the businesses sold were reported as discontinued operations 
at the time of the sale  the company recognized liabilities for contingencies and various costs associated with exiting these businesses 
the company has now concluded that the reserves for contingencies recognized during fiscal and earlier periods did not satisfy the probable and reasonably estimable criteria applicable to accounting for such contingencies 
accordingly  january  retained earnings has been restated and increased by  net of tax expense of  the company also did not adjust these accrued liabilities for subsequent changes in the original estimates of the costs associated with exiting the discontinued businesses 
the company has restated its fiscal and financial statements to reflect changes in the estimated costs of exiting the discontinued operations 
the pre tax effect of the restatement adjustments has been to decrease the loss from discontinued operations in fiscal and by  and  respectively 
during fiscal  the company recorded the costs attributable to collecting a note which was received during fiscal as partial consideration for the sale of its commercial staffing business 
these costs  which included the write off of principal and accrued interest  and legal fees  totaled approximately  and were charged against various divestiture liabilities originally recognized at the time of the sale 
the fiscal financial statements have been restated to recognize these costs as a bad debt expense charged against continuing operations which is included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
during fiscal  the company recorded estimated losses associated with the recall of its legacy chargesource watt universal ac power adapter 
included in the estimated loss were costs attributable to a third party service bureau engaged to administer the company s recall efforts 
these specific costs should have been charged to expense as incurred 
accordingly  the fiscal financial statements have been restated to reduce the estimated cost of the recall recorded during fiscal this restatement had the effect of reducing fiscal cost of revenue by  during fiscal  the company recognized a  million transitional adjustment  net of tax of zero  for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle upon the adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
this transitional adjustment was attributable to the company s edx reporting unit 
the company has since determined that the amount recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle should have been reported as a fiscal goodwill impairment and reflected in fiscal continuing operations 
the fiscal financial statements have been restated accordingly 
during fiscal  the company sold the net assets of the edx reporting unit 
accordingly  all of the current and prior operations of that reporting unit have been reclassified to discontinued operations  including the aforementioned goodwill impairment change see note 
effective the beginning of fiscal and in conjunction with the implementation of sfas no 
 the company re evaluated the useful lives of its identifiable intangible assets  including acquired algorithms with a net book value of  and an original historical cost basis of million 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
 the software algorithms were being amortized over five years 
upon the adoption of sfas no 
 it was initially concluded that the software algorithms had an indefinite useful life and therefore were not subject to amortization  but rather  a periodic evaluation for impairment 
it has now been concluded that the original useful life of five years should have been applied after the adoption of sfas no 
as a result  fiscal results of operations are being restated to reflect additional amortization expense of  the remaining  in net book value of the software algorithms as of january  was amortized to expense during the first half of fiscal during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company acquired all of the outstanding stock of edx engineering  inc approximately million of the purchase price was allocated to identifiable intangible assets with a tax basis of zero 
at the time  the company did not record the required deferred tax liability of  related to the temporary difference between the financial reporting book value and the tax basis 
such an entry also would have resulted in a corresponding increase to goodwill of  the financial statements have been restated to reflect the effects of recording the incremental increase to deferred tax liabilities and goodwill at the time edx was acquired 
as a consequence  amortization expense and deferred tax benefit have increased by  during the fiscal year 
upon the adoption of sfas no 
at the beginning of fiscal  amortization of goodwill ceased 
during the second quarter of fiscal  the edx goodwill and identifiable intangibles were determined to be fully impaired and were written off 
as a consequence  the restated fiscal year financial statements reflect an additional charge to write off the incremental net book value of goodwill of  this incremental charge was offset by incremental deferred tax benefit of  during the fiscal year  edx was sold and reported as a discontinued operation 
accordingly  the incremental effects of the restatements adjustments described in this paragraph have been reclassified to discontinued operations 
during the second quarter of fiscal  the company wrote off  of capitalized software costs 
the write off was originally recorded to a line item labeled asset impairment charges 
the financial statements have been restated to reclassify the  write off of capitalized software to cost of revenue 
as a result of the foregoing adjustments  income tax expense for continuing operations for fiscal and including the tax benefit of  described in the preceding paragraph related to edx has been decreased by  and  respectively 
income tax expense for discontinued operations for fiscal and has been decreased by million and  respectively

the restatement had no effect on net cash provided by or used in operating  investing or financing activities for fiscal or 
table of contents liquidity and capital resources our financial position remains strong  with cash and cash equivalents of million as of january  and no outstanding debt 
cash flows from operating activities cash used in operating activities was million for the year ended january  compared to cash provided by operating activities of million for the year ended january  our loss from continuing operations was million in fiscal  coupled with the fact that sales increased in the second half of the fiscal year  causing accounts receivable to increase million 
additionally  inventory increased million reflecting increased purchases to fill our back log of orders 
these uses of cash were offset by increases in current liabilities of million 
cash provided by operating activities is primarily derived from the sale of our products 
cash provided by operating activities was million and million for the years ended january  and  respectively 
early in fiscal and in cooperation with the us cpsc  we announced a voluntary product safety recall of approximately  detachable plugs used on our chargesource watt universal ac power adapter 
the detachable ac plug can crack if the plug s swivel connector is extended beyond the degrees of allowed rotation  creating the potential for electric shock 
to date  no injuries have been reported 
in conjunction with the product safety recall  the company and targus entered into an agreement addressing the impact of the recall action 
due to the recall action and the agreement with targus  we accrued a million credit to targus as a reduction of sales and additional recall costs of approximately million classified in cost of revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal the credit to targus was based on unsold and unopened units in the distribution channel expected to be returned to us within a six month period 
the accrued additional recall costs were related to replacing ac plugs in the hands of consumers 
cash flows from investing activities net cash used in investing activities was million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal and million for fiscal in all periods  capital expenditures for property and equipment  acquisitions  and software development constituted substantially all of our cash used in investing activities 
the development of software is critical to our products currently under development 
on january   we sold the assets of the reporting unit edx for million in cash and recognized a gain of million 

table of contents on july   we acquired an percent equity stake in swissqual for million in cash 
based in zuchwil  switzerland  swissqual is a developer of voice quality systems and software for measuring  monitoring  and optimizing the quality of mobile  fixed  and ip based voice and data communications 
under this alliance  comarco and swissqual will jointly develop  sell  and support wireless network quality of service and optimization products for the european marketplace 
in addition to expanding our access to european wireless carriers  swissqual will provide domain expertise and development guidance in the evolution of g and g system test solutions 
cash flows from financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was million for fiscal and million for fiscal compared to net cash used in financing activities of million for fiscal in all periods  proceeds from the sales of common stock issued through employee and director stock option plans  offset by the repurchase of our common stock  constituted substantially all of our cash flows from financing activities 
during  our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program of up to million shares of our common stock 
from program inception through january   we repurchased approximately million shares for an average price of per share 
during fiscal  we repurchased approximately  shares in the open market for an average price of per share 
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalent balances will provide us sufficient funds to satisfy our cash requirements for at least the next twelve months 
in addition to our cash and cash equivalent balances  we expect to derive a portion of our liquidity from our cash flows from operations 
as discussed above  certain factors and events could negatively affect our cash flows from operations  including due to the uncertainties associated with the spending patterns of our customers and the corresponding demand for our wts products  we have experienced and expect to continue to experience significant fluctuations in demand 
such fluctuations have caused and may continue to cause significant reductions in revenue and operating results  in the event targus or belkin  the distributors of our chargesource products  are unable to perform under their non cancelable commitments due to their inability to take delivery of the products and or pay for such products in a timely manner  we would be required to establish alternative distribution channels 
we are focused on preserving our cash balances by continuously monitoring expenses  identifying cost savings  and investing only in those development programs and products most likely to contribute to our profitability 
contractual obligations in the course of our business operations  we incur certain commitments to make future payments under contracts such as operating leases and purchase orders 
payments under these contracts are summarized as follows as of january  in thousands payments due by period less than year to years to years operating lease obligations purchase obligations recent accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
this interpretation addresses the consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities as defined in the interpretation 
the interpretation applies immediately to variable interests in variable interest entities created after january   and to variable interests in variable interest entities obtained after january  the application of this interpretation did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
the interpretation requires certain disclosures in financial statements issued after january  if it is reasonably possible that we will consolidate or disclose information about variable interest entities when the interpretation becomes effective 
in october  the fasb deferred the effective date of this interpretation for pre existing variable interest entities to no later than february the company has no variable interest entities that would require disclosure or consolidations under fin no 
in december  the fasb issued a revision to fin no

are effective immediately 
however  generally sfas no

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk currency risk we are exposed to the risk of changes in currency exchange rates 
as of january   we had no material accounts receivable denominated in foreign currencies 
our standard terms require customers to pay for our products and services in us dollars 
for those orders denominated in foreign currencies  we may limit our exposure to losses from foreign currency transactions through forward foreign exchange contracts 
to date  sales denominated in foreign currencies have not been significant and we have not entered into any foreign exchange contracts 
interest rate sensitivity the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities that we have invested in may be subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises  the principal amount of our investment will probably decline in value 
to minimize this risk  we maintain a significant portion of our cash balances in money market funds 
in general  money market funds are not subject to interest rate risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate 
we do not hold any derivative financial instruments 
our cash and cash equivalents have maturities dates of three months or less and the fair value approximates the carrying value in our financial statements 
equity price risk our short term investments consist of balances maintained in a non qualified deferred compensation plan funded by our executives and directors 
we value these investments using the closing market value for the last day of each month 
these investments are subject to market price volatility 
we reflect these investments on our balance sheet at their market value  with the unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings 
we have also invested in equity instruments of swissqual  a privately held company 
we evaluate whether any decline in value of certain public and non public equity investments was other than temporary 
we had no such impairments during fiscal due to the inherent risk associated with some of our investments  and in light of current stock market conditions  we may incur future losses on the sales  write downs  or write offs of our investments 
we do not currently hedge against equity price changes
