item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview since its inception in february  genta has devoted its principal efforts toward drug discovery and research and development 
genta s strategy is to build a product and technology portfolio primarily focused on its cancer related products 
genta has been unprofitable to date and expects to incur substantial operating losses due to continued requirements for ongoing and planned research and development activities  pre clinical and clinical testing  manufacturing activities  regulatory activities and establishment of a sales and marketing organization 
from our inception to december   we have incurred a cumulative net loss of million 
we have experienced significant quarterly fluctuations in operating results and we expect that these fluctuations in revenues  expenses and losses will continue 
our financial results in may be significantly affected by fda action with respect to genasense 
we have filed a new drug application nda for genasense to be used in combination with dacarbazine for the treatment of patients with advanced melanoma who have not previously received chemotherapy 
the fda accepted our nda filing on february  and granted priority review status to the application  which targets an agency action on or before june  on february   we were invited by the fda to meet on may  with the fda oncology drugs advisory committee 
if the fda approves the nda and qualifies avecia  our contract manufacturer  then aventis  genta s collaborative partner  will begin to market the product in the united states  avecia will begin to manufacture the product and genta will sell the product to aventis 
genta will also earn a royalty from aventis on all sales of genasense

the initial payments received from aventis are being recognized over the original estimated useful life of the related first to expire patent of months 
in october  the company launched the commercial product ganite for the treatment of cancer related hypercalcemia that is resistant to hydration  generating million in product sales 
research and development expenses research and development expenses before reimbursement were million in compared to million in and million in research and development expenses in include a million write off of acquired in process research and development resulting from the acquisition of salus therapeutics  inc see note to our financial statements 
during genta purchased substantial amounts of drug substance to be used in genasense phase clinical trials  leading to higher research and development expenses in than in during  total research and development expenses declined  primarily due to significantly lower purchases of clinical drug substance 
of the million in research and development expenses for the twelve months ended december   million is related to acquired in process research and development and million is reimbursable pursuant to our collaborative agreement with aventis  million of which related to the three months ended december   is expected to be reimbursed by aventis in the first quarter of see note to our financial statements 
services and capabilities that have not been retained within the company are out sourced through short term contracts or from consultants 
substantially  all pre clinical biology and clinical trial work are now conducted through such collaborations with external scientists and clinicians 
the company anticipates that  if sufficient collaborative revenues and other funding are available  research and development expenses may increase in future years due to requirements for pre clinical studies  clinical trials and increased regulatory costs 
the company will continue to assess the potential cost benefit ratio of developing its own antisense oligonucleotide manufacturing  if and as such products are successfully developed and approved for marketing 
it is anticipated that research and development expenses will continue to increase in the future  as genta expands its other product development programs 
furthermore  the company is also pursuing other opportunities for new product development candidates  which  if successful  will require additional research and development expenses 
in an effort to focus its research and development on areas that provide the most significant commercial opportunities  the company continually evaluates its ongoing programs in light of the latest market information and conditions  availability of third party funding  technological advances  and other factors 
as a result of such evaluation  the company s product development plans have changed from time to time  and the company anticipates that they will continue to do so in the future 
corporate acquisitions in august  genta acquired salus therapeutics  inc  salus  a privately held company that specializes in the identification and development of dna and rna based drugs including antisense  rna interference  and delivery systems for dna rna based drugs 
the acquisition provided enhanced laboratory capabilities that complement the company s oncology drug discovery programs in dna and rna medicines 
under the terms of the merger agreement  genta issued million shares of common stock with a fair value of approximately million to salus stockholders in exchange for all of the outstanding shares of salus common stock  including those issued pursuant to the conversion of salus preferred stock 
contingent upon the achievement of certain preclinical and clinical milestones  an additional million may be paid in stock or cash at genta s option 
the purchase price was allocated to the assets purchased and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values  which was determined by an independent valuation 
acquired in process research and development expense represents that portion of the purchase price of an acquisition related to the research and development activities that are yet to demonstrate their technological feasibility and have no alternative future use 
accordingly  in process research and development of million was charged to operations in the fourth quarter of selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses were million in compared to million in and million in expenses have substantially increased due to the creation of a sales force  ganite launch activities  a larger administrative staff and higher general corporate expenses driven by business growth 
there were no sales and marketing related expenses reimbursable at pursuant to our collaborative agreement with aventis for the twelve months ended december   as sales and marketing related expenses related to genasense are incurred by  billed to and paid by aventis 
in  selling  general and administrative expenses include 
million of expense reimbursement from aventis 
aventis reimbursement under the collaborative agreement with aventis  see note to our financial statements  aventis will pay of us nda directed development costs incurred by either genta or aventis and of all other development  marketing and sales costs incurred within the us and elsewhere as subject to the collaborative agreement 
expense reimbursement from aventis of million for the year ended december  increased from million for the year ended december  due to the following factors the comparison of twelve months of activity in compared to eight months in  greater activity resulting from the nda filing for genasense and reimbursement for and drug substance purchases used in phase clinical trials

critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended december  in preparing our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  management is required to make estimates and assumptions that  among other things  affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
these estimates are most significant in connection with our critical accounting policies  namely those of our accounting policies that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
these judgments often result from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
actual results may differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes that the following represent its critical accounting policies revenue recognition 
our policy is to recognize revenues under license arrangements when delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
royalties are recognized when earned 
consistent with staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition  initial funding of ongoing development received from aventis  after the achievement of certain research and development milestones are being recognized on a straight line basis over the original estimated useful life of the related first to expire patent of months see note to our financial statements 
any subsequent milestone payments that may be received from aventis will also be recognized over the then remaining estimated useful life of the related first to expire patent 
genta recognizes revenue from product sales when title to product and associated risk of loss has passed to the customer and we are reasonably assured of collecting payment for the sale 
all revenue from product sales are recorded net of applicable allowances for returns  rebates and other applicable discounts and allowances 
we allow return of our product for up to twelve months after product expiration 
research and development costs 
all such costs are expensed as incurred  including raw material costs required to manufacture drugs for clinical trials 
reimbursements for applicable genasense related costs  under the collaborative agreement between genta and aventis  will continue to be recorded as a reduction to expense see note to our financial statements 
intangible assets 
our intangible assets consist primarily of licensed technology and capitalized patent costs  and are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives 
our policy is to evaluate the appropriateness of the carrying values of the unamortized balances of intangible assets on the basis of estimated future cash flows undiscounted and other factors 
if such evaluation were to indicate an impairment of these intangible assets  such impairment would be recognized by a corresponding write down of the applicable assets 
we evaluate the continuing value of patents and patent applications each financial reporting period 
as a result of this evaluation  we may elect to continue to maintain  seek to out license  or abandon these patents 
inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost being determined using the first in  first out fifo method 
acquired in process research and development 
costs to acquire in process research and development projects and technologies which have no alternative future use and which have not reached technological feasibility at the date of acquisition are expensed as incurred see note to our financial statements 
acquired in process research and development is considered as part of total research and development expense 
liquidity and capital resources since inception  we have financed our operations primarily through private placements and public offerings of our equity securities 
cash provided from these offerings totaled approximately million through december   including net proceeds of million received in and million received in during  cash flow used in operating activities was million  primarily resulting from a net loss of million and lower accounts payable and accrued expenses of million 
total debt increased million  resulting from borrowings under the line of credit from aventis see note to our financial statements 
total cash and cash equivalents declined million in at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling million compared to million at december  and million at december  during  cash flow used in operating activities was million primarily resulting from a net loss of million offset by the initial million licensing fee and million development funding received from aventis under our collaborative agreement in see note to our financial statements 
the company had proceeds of million from a private placement of common stock and million from the sale of convertible debt to aventis 
total cash and cash equivalents declined million in from million to million 
in march  genta and aventis negotiated a line of credit for an amount up to million which terminates with respect to additional borrowings on the earlier to occur of fda approval of genasense or december  loans under this line of credit are subject to repayment six months after termination 
as of december   approximately million remained available under this line of credit 
fda approval of genasense would trigger a milestone payment from aventis of million and an obligation by aventis to purchase at our option million of convertible notes from genta 
management believes that at the current rate of spending  primarily in support of ongoing and anticipated clinical trials  and after considering expense reimbursement and the line of credit provided by aventis  we should have sufficient cash funds to maintain our present operations through our principal expenditures relate to our research and development activities  which include our on going and future clinical trials 
we expect these expenditures to continue 
we expect increased total expenditures  prior to expense reimbursement  for clinical trials and drug supply related to genasense as a result of our collaboration agreement with aventis 
in addition  expenditures associated with other products under development by us may increase as research and development activities become more focused and as other clinical trials are initiated 
if we successfully secure sufficient levels of collaborative revenues and other sources of financing  we expect to use such financing to continue to expand our ongoing research and development activities  pre clinical testing and clinical trials  costs associated with the market introduction of potential products and expansion of our administrative activities 
we anticipate that significant additional sources of financing  primarily expense reimbursement from aventis  will be required in order for us to continue our planned operations 
we also anticipate seeking additional product development opportunities through potential acquisitions or investments 
such acquisitions or investments may consume cash reserves or require additional cash or equity 
our working capital and additional funding requirements will depend upon numerous factors  including i the progress of our research and development programs  ii the timing and results of pre clinical testing and clinical trials  iii the level of resources that we devote to sales and marketing capabilities  iv technological advances  v the activities of competitors  and vi our ability to establish and maintain collaborative arrangements with others to fund certain research and development efforts  to conduct clinical trials  to obtain regulatory approvals and  if such approvals are obtained  to manufacture and market products 
contractual obligations future contractual obligations at december  are as follows thousands total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations   convertible debt   operating lease obligations     drug purchase obligations to avecia    drug purchase obligations to jmi total      consists of amounts under our line of credit with aventis  which are due six months after termination  which will occur on the earlier of fda approval of genasense or december  fda approval of genasense would trigger a milestone payment from aventis of million and an obligation by aventis to purchase at our option million of convertible notes from us see note to our financial statements 
consists of drug purchase obligations to avecia which are subject to fda approval of genasense and qualification and validation of avecia s production facilities expansion 
the amounts actually purchased will be dependent upon the aforementioned conditions  as well as the volume purchased in any given year 
pursuant to the collaborative agreement with aventis  see note to our financial statements  the company anticipates that it will be reimbursed from to of these purchase commitments after the drug is shipped to aventis for clinical use or commercial sales 
for a further description of our agreement with avecia  see part i  item  b 
summary of business and research and development manufacturing 
if genasense is not approved or avecia s production facility expansion is not validated  our total drug purchase obligations will be million 
we may terminate our avecia contract if we determine that genasense will not be approved by the fda 
in addition  we have committed up to million of advance financing to the drug substance manufacturer  for facility expansion  which would be recovered with interest through future payments determined as a function of drug substance purchases to be made by genta in the future 
consists of drug purchase obligations to johnson matthey inc jmi 
genta is obligated to purchase of drug substance requirements for ganite from jmi 
the sales projections for ganite are very dependent on the company s ability to obtain compendial listings and or approvals for the use of ganite as a chemotherapy drug 
the sales projections reflected in the contractual obligations reflect the current approved hypercalcemia indication and limited sales as a chemotherapy drug 
depending on the company s ability to obtain additional compendial listings and or approvals  the sales projections and resulting contractual obligations could be higher 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our carrying values of cash  marketable securities  accounts payable  accrued expenses and debt are a reasonable approximation of their fair value 
the estimated fair values of financial instruments have been determined by us using available market information and appropriate valuation methodologies see note to our financial statements 
however  considerable judgment is required in interpreting market data to develop the estimates of fair value 
accordingly  the estimates utilized in the consolidated financial statements are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that we could realize in a current market exchange 
we have not entered into  and do not expect to enter into  financial instruments for trading or hedging purposes 
we do not currently anticipate entering into interest rate swaps and or similar instruments 
genta s primary market risk exposure with regard to financial instruments is to changes in interest rates  which would impact interest income earned on such instruments 
we have no material currency exchange or interest rate risk exposure as of december  therefore there will be no ongoing exposure to material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operation for sensitivity to changes in interest rates or to changes in currency exchange rates
