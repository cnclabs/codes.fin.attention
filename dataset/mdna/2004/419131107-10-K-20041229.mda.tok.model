seasonal nature of sales as the chart above indicates  there is a seasonal pattern to our quarterly sales 
listed below are the primary causes of our seasonal sales 
spacer 
gif 

spacer 
gif 
our product is sold through retail outlets or to oem s who include our product as a component of their system 
spurred on by the holiday spending  our sales during our first fiscal quarter  which encompasses the holiday season  have historically been the highest of our fiscal year 

spacer 
gif 

spacer 
gif 
our fiscal second quarter is historically our second best sales quarter 
post holiday sales  mid year school sales  disposal income generated from year end bonuses  gift certificates  holiday cash gifts and mid year school purchases fuel the sales of our second quarter 

spacer 
gif 

spacer 
gif 
we sell over of our sales into the european market 
during our fiscal third quarter we begin to experience a slowdown due to the summer holiday period in europe 
we also see decreased spending in the u 
s during the summer months 
this has historically caused sales for our fiscal third quarter to be the lowest for the year 

spacer 
gif 

spacer 
gif 
during the latter part of august and into september  which is the last half of our fiscal fourth quarter  sales activity begins to increase 
the increase is fueled by computer spending for school needs  the replenishment of stock in the european market and the start of the product ramp up for the holiday season 
this post summer sales activity has resulted in our fourth quarter being the third best sales quarter of our fiscal year 
although our strategy has been to diversify our sales to minimize the seasonal nature of our business  we anticipate similar seasonal trends for the near term future

increase in our average euro to usd contract rates  used to convert euro sales to us dollar sales of about us for the three months ended september  versus and versus for the twelve months ended september  over the same periods of last year 
since about of our european inventory is purchased in us dollars  while most of the european sales are invoiced in euros or british pound sterling  the company benefits from the higher converted euro to us dollar sales  which are sold against either stable or declining us dollar unit inventory cost the decrease in the gross profit percentage of attributable to the mix of oem sales for the twelve months ended september was due to the following 
spacer

spacer 
gif 
increase in oem sales 
sales of oem boards for the twelve months ended september  were  or of sales compared to  or of sales for the twelve months ended september  the higher mix of lower margin oem sales for fiscal compared to fiscal resulted in a decrease in gross profit percent of compared to the prior year 

spacer

spacer 
gif 
the decrease in the gross profit percent of attributable to labor related and other costs for the twelve months ended september  was due to the percentage increase in labor related and other costs for the twelve months ended september  over the twelve months ended september  of exceeding the increase in sales

volatility of gross profit percent the chart above details the quarterly fluctuations in gross profit percent 
over the last twelve quarters  the gross profit percent has ranged from a low of to a high of 
factors affecting the volatility of our gross profit percent are 
spacer 
gif 

spacer 
gif 
mix of product 
gross profit percents vary within our retail family of products as well as for oem products 
varying sales mix of these different products affect the monthly gross profit percentage 

spacer 
gif 

spacer 
gif 
fluctuating quarterly sales caused by seasonal trends 
embedded as a component of cost of sales are certain fixed costs  mainly for production and warehouse labor and the overhead cost of our ireland distribution facility 
due to this  when unit and dollar sales decline due to seasonal market trends  these fixed costs get spread over lower units  thus increasing product unit costs causing these fixed costs to grow as a percentage of sales 

spacer 
gif 

spacer 
gif 
competitive pressures 
our market is constantly changing with new competitors joining our established competitors 
these competitive pressures from time to time result in declining prices  which can reduce gross profit 

spacer 
gif 

spacer 
gif 
supply of component parts 
in times when supply of component parts are in short supply  we have to manage price increases 
consequently  when product supply is high  we are usually able to secure price decreases 

spacer 
gif 

spacer 
gif 
sales volume 
as unit sales volume increases  we have more leverage in negotiating volume price decreases with our component suppliers and our contract manufacturers 

spacer 
gif 

spacer 
gif 
cost reductions 
we evaluate the pricing we receive from our suppliers and our contract manufacturers and we are constantly looking to achieve component part and contract manufacturer cost reductions 
managing product mix  moderating seasonal trends and achieving cost reductions are a company priority and critical to our competitive position in the market 
although our goal is to optimize gross profit and minimize gross profit fluctuations  we anticipate the continuance of gross profit percent fluctuations

total year selling  general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales declined to its lowest level in three years for fiscal  the result of increased sales over the prior two fiscal years 
we expect a similar fixed versus variable cost structure for the near future 
due to this  we expect selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales to reflect a trend that is similar to the historical trends we have experienced over the prior three fiscal years

travel costs due to interaction between taiwan and us staff arbitration proceeding we were involved in arbitration proceedings before the american arbitration association  which had been brought against the company by the estate of the late mr 
kenneth aupperle  one of the company s founders and former president estate 
the estate was claiming property rights and interest in the company  certain amounts due and owing to the estate based on various corporate agreements with mr 
aupperle and certain insurance policies  which amounts were claimed to be not less than  on april   the arbitration panel awarded the estate a total of  no other fees or expenses were awarded 
the company accrued a charge of  in the second quarter of fiscal year to cover the award 
the award was paid in may litigation proceeding in march  polywell international  inc polywell  a supplier of cables to the company  commenced an action seeking  in damages plus exemplary damages  attorney s fees  costs and interest with relation to certain unpaid invoices 
the company paid these invoices to the sales representative  who subsequently failed to forward the payments to polywell 
the company had dealt with this sales representative over a number of years  who also represented himself as polywell s payment and collection agent 
the case went to trial and was heard before a jury in the united states district court in the northern district of texas  dallas division 
since the company had dealt with the said sales representative for several years with respect to all purchasing and payment issues  the company believed that paying the invoices to this sales representative was tantamount to paying polywell 
the jury however ruled in favor of polywell and the court granted polywell a judgment against the company  awarding an amount of  to polywell 
in addition  the company is obligated to pay polywell s attorney s fees and interest 
the company accrued a charge of  during the second fiscal quarter of fiscal to cover the award 
subsequent negotiation reduced the award to  and the company paid the award in june the reduction in the final award has been reflected in our third quarter results

re measurement of accounts denominated in currencies other than the euro we follow the rules prescribed in paragraph of sfas foreign currency translation  which states that accounts denominated in a currency other than an entities functional currency  excluding inter company accounts which are long term in nature  need to be re measured into the entities functional currency  and any gain or loss from this re measurement are included in the determination of net income and are booked as other income loss section under the description foreign currency transaction gains losses 
accumulated other comprehensive income loss the euro is the functional currency of the company s european subsidiary  hde sarl 
assets and liabilities of this subsidiary are translated to us dollars at the exchange rate in effect at the end of each reporting period  while equity accounts are translated to us dollars at the historical rate in effect at the date of the contribution 
operating results are translated to us dollars at the average prevailing exchange rate for the period  with the exception of sales which are translated to us dollars at the average monthly forward exchange contract rate 
the use of differing exchange rates results in foreign currency translation gains or losses 
since the euro denominated accounts on hde sarl s books result in a net asset position total euro assets are in excess of euro liabilities  an increase in the euro value results in a deferred gain for the translation of euro accounts to us dollars 
the company had a translation gain of  recorded on the balance sheet as of september  for the twelve months ended september   the company recorded on the balance sheet deferred translation gains of  resulting in a translation gain of  recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income as of september  the company uses forward exchange contracts to manage our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currencies related to us dollar purchases of inventory 
mark to market gains and losses on these open contracts result from the difference between the usd value of our open foreign currency forward contracts at the average contract rate as opposed to the same contracts translated at the month end forward rate

for the last five fiscal years  our domestic operation has incurred losses 
we analyzed the future realization of our deferred tax assets as of september  and we concluded that under the present circumstances  it would be appropriate for us to record a valuation allowance against the increase in the deferred tax asset attributable to the loss incurred during fiscal from domestic operations 
as a result of all of the above items mentioned in the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  we earned net income of  for the twelve months ended september   which resulted in basic net income per share of and diluted net income per share of on weighted average basic and diluted shares of  and  respectively  compared to a net loss of  for the twelve months ended september   which resulted in basic and diluted net loss per share of on weighted average basic and diluted shares of  options to purchase  and  shares of common stock at prices ranging to and and  respectively  were outstanding for the twelve month period ending september  and  respectively  but were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because they were anti dilutive 
results of operations twelve months september  compared to september results of operations for the twelve months ended september  compared to september  are as follows

the improved gross profit percentage on assembled boards due to product mix was primarily caused by unit price reductions from our suppliers and subcontractors on our analog product lines and digital video satellite products  offset somewhat by sales of lower average margin set top box products 
oem sales of products for windows xp media center for the twelve months ended september  were  which accounted for of the net sales for fiscal although oem sales require less sales and marketing support  their gross profit percentages are substantially less than those of our retail products 
our oem sales had an average gross profit percentage of for the twelve months ended september  there were no significant oem sales in the previous year 
the increased product mix of oem sales during fiscal contributed to the reduction in our fiscal gross profit percentage when compared to the previous year 
during the latter part of fiscal  the factors below affected the realization of the company s inventory 
spacer

spacer 
gif 
the loss during the fourth quarter of of a long time direct corporate customer impacted the existing value of assembled boards and component inventory relating to this customer 
spacer

spacer 
gif 
a change with a major contract manufacturer from consigning component parts to the contract manufacturer to purchasing the assembled boards on a turnkey basis impacted the value of component inventory 
spacer

spacer

the second consecutive year of declining sales resulted in slower sales of older models 
spacer

spacer

engineering changes made to our usb and macintosh products which rendered certain inventory associated with this product obsolete 
spacer

spacer 
gif 
the better use of new software that assisted the company in identifying slow moving inventory with respect to the factors above  we deemed it necessary to increase our reserve for obsolete and slow moving inventory 
an additional reserve of  was recorded during the fourth quarter of fiscal and charged to cost of sales 
during fiscal  there were certain assembled boards and component material inventory that we were able to sell through the use of a liquidation firm 
in recognition of this  we reduced our inventory reserve to reflect the decrease in the obsolete inventory value due to the liquidation of such products 
there was no similar obsolete inventory liquidation during fiscal  which resulted in a comparative reduction in our gross profit percentage between fiscal and fiscal for the twelve months ended september   the increase in the gross profit margin percentage of relating to labor related and other costs was due to the percentage increase in sales of for the twelve months ended september  over september  being in excess of the percentage increase in labor related and other costs of for the twelve months ended september  over september  the chart below illustrates the components of selling  general and administrative expenses

the decrease in total other expense was due to current year gains on non operational usd to euro currency re measurements due to increases in the euro offset by lower interest income due to lower investment yields 
non operational usd to euro currency re measurement we follow the rules prescribed in paragraph of sfas foreign currency translation  which states that accounts denominated in a currency other than an entity s functional currency need to be re measured into the entity s functional currency  and any gain or loss from this re measurement are included in the determination of net income 
re measurement gains and losses on inter company accounts that are of a long term investment nature and for which settlement is not planned or anticipated in the foreseeable future are excluded in determining net income and are reported in the same manner as are translation gains and losses 
accumulated other comprehensive income loss the euro is the functional currency of the company s european subsidiary  hde sarl 
assets and liabilities of this subsidiary are translated to us dollars at the exchange rate in effect at the end of each reporting period  while equity accounts are translated to us dollars at the historical rate in effect at the date of the contribution 
operating results are translated to us dollars at the average prevailing exchange rate for the period  with the exception of sales which are translated to us dollars at the average monthly forward exchange contract rate 
the use of differing exchange rates results in foreign currency translation gains or losses 
since the euro accounts on hde sarl s books result in a net asset position total euro assets are in excess of euro liabilities  an increase in the euro value results in a deferred gain for the translation of euro accounts to us dollars 
the company had a translation loss of  recorded on the balance sheet as of september  for the year ended september   the company recorded in other comprehensive income deferred translation gains  resulting in a translation gain of  recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income as of september  the company uses forward exchange contracts to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currencies 
mark to market gains and losses on these open contracts result from the difference between the usd value of our open foreign currency forward contracts at the average contract rate as opposed to the same contracts translated at the month end forward rate 
the company qualifies for cash flow hedge accounting as prescribed under fas  which allows the company to record the mark to market gains and losses in the equity section of our balance sheet under accumulated other comprehensive income 
the company had mark to market gains of  recorded on the balance sheet as of september  for the year ended september   the company recorded  as a component of other comprehensive income  a mark to market loss of  resulting in a mark to market loss of  for contracts open as of september  as stated above  accumulated other comprehensive income loss consists of two components

our luxembourg operation had a profit net of licensing fees for fiscal and fiscal  which resulted in an income tax liability inclusive of commission agents of  and  respectively 
for the last four fiscal years  our domestic operation has incurred losses 
we analyzed the future realization of our deferred tax assets as of september  and and we concluded that under the present circumstances  it would be appropriate for us to record a valuation allowance against the increase in the deferred tax asset attributable to the loss incurred in fiscal from domestic operations 
during the fiscal year ended september  the company adjusted the prior year provision for estimated income tax receivable and income tax payable  based in part upon the completion of a tax examination 
the net result was a charge of  as a result of all of the above items mentioned in the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  we incurred a net loss of  for the year ended september   which resulted in basic and diluted net loss per share of on weighted average basic and diluted shares of  compared to a net income of  for the year ended september   which resulted in basic and diluted net income per share of on weighted average basic and diluted shares of  and  respectively 
options to purchase  and  shares of common stock at prices ranging to and and  respectively  were outstanding for the years ending september  and  but were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because they were anti dilutive 
the improved gross profit percentage on assembled boards was primarily a result of unit price reductions from our suppliers and subcontractors coupled with a larger sales mix of higher gross margin product 
the increase in the gross profit percentage of due to labor related and other costs was due to the decrease in labor related and other costs of being in excess of the sales decrease of 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  in recognition of the sales decline from fiscal  slower sales of older product lines and engineering changes to products  we reviewed the net realizable value of our inventory as of september  we deemed it necessary to increase our reserve for obsolete and slow moving inventory 
an additional reserve of  was recorded during the fourth quarter of fiscal and charged to cost of sales 
a similar provision was not required in fiscal  thus there was an improvement in gross profit percentage of for fiscal seasonality as our sales are primarily to the consumer market  we have experienced certain seasonal revenue trends 
our peak sales quarter  due to holiday season sales of computer equipment  is our first fiscal quarter october to december  followed by our second fiscal quarter january to march 
in addition  our international sales  mostly in the european market  were  and of sales for the years ended september   and  respectively 
our fiscal fourth quarter sales july to september can be potentially impacted by the reduction of activity experienced in europe during the july and august summer holiday period 
to offset the above cycles  we target a wide range of customer types in order to moderate the seasonality of retail sales

translation of assets and liabilities denominated in non functional currencies on our european financial statements revenue recognition our revenues are primarily derived from the sale of computer boards which enable you to view television programs on your personal computer 
sales of computer boards are commonly classified as computer hardware 
our sales are primarily to retailers  distributors and original equipment manufacturers 
sales to our customers are documented by a purchase order which describes the conditions of sale 
sales are recorded when products are shipped to our customers  the product price is fixed and determinable  collection of the resulting receivable is probable and product returns are reasonably estimable 
revenue from freight charged to customers is recognized when products are shipped 
provisions for customer returns and other adjustments are provided for in the period the related sales are recorded based upon historical data 
management s estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts for revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates estimates  including those related to sales provisions  as described above  income taxes  bad debts  inventory allowances and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical data  when available  experience  and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the combined results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates

collected in local currency primarily the euro on the supply side  since we predominantly deal with north american and asian suppliers and contract manufacturers  approximately of our inventory required to support our european sales are purchased and paid in us dollars 
the combination of sales billed in euros supported by inventory purchased in us dollars results in an absence of a natural local currency hedge 
consequently  our financial results are subject to market risks resulting from the fluctuations in the euro to us dollar exchange rates 
we attempt to reduce these risks by entering into foreign exchange forward contracts with financial institutions 
the purpose of these forward contracts is to hedge the foreign currency market exposures underlying the us dollar denominated inventory purchases required to support our european sales 
we do not try to hedge against all possible foreign currency exposures because of the inherent difficulty in estimating the volatility of the euro 
the contracts we procure are specifically entered into to as a hedge against forecasted or existing or foreign currency exposure 
we do not enter into contracts for speculative purposes 
although we maintain these programs to reduce the short term impact of changes in currency exchange rates  long term strengthening or weakening of the us dollar against the euro impacts our sales  our gross profit  operating income and retained earnings

translation of assets and liabilities denominated in non functional currencies on our european financial statements the functional currency of our european subsidiary is the euro 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to translate assets and liabilities denominated in a non functional currency  mainly us dollars  to euros on the books of our european subsidiary 
this process results in exchange gains and losses depending on the changes in the euro to us dollar exchange rate 
under the relevant accounting guidance  with the exception of inter company accounts which are considered long term in nature  we are obligated to include these gains and losses on our statement of operations  which we report in other income or expense under the caption foreign currency 
the extent of these gains and losses can fluctuate greatly from month to month depending on the change in the exchange rate  causing results to vary widely 
due to the past volatility of the euro  it is difficult to forecast the long term trend of these gains and losses 
inflation while inflation has not had a material effect on our operations in the past  there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to offset the effects of inflation on the costs of our products or services through price increases to our customers without experiencing a reduction in the demand for our products  or that inflation will not have an overall effect on the computer equipment market that would have a material affect on us 
euro on january   the euro was adopted in europe as the common legal currency among of the member countries of the european community 
on that date  the participating countries established fixed euro conversion rates ie the conversion exchange rate between their existing currencies and the euro 
the euro now trades on currency exchanges and is available for non cash transactions 
a new european central bank was established to direct monetary policy for the participating countries 
prior to the adoption of the euro  we billed our european customers in german marks or british pound sterling  depending upon which currency the customer preferred to be billed in 
effective january   we began invoicing our customers  who are located in the eleven member countries  in euros 
we continue to bill customers located in the united kingdom in british pound sterling 
the benefits to billing customers in euros were twofold

risk factors if tv technology for the pc  or our implementation of this technology  is not accepted  we will not be able to sustain or expand our business 
our future success depends on the growing use and acceptance of tv and video applications for pcs

potential inability to remain ahead of the development of competing technologies could each have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we rely upon sales of a small number of product lines  and the failure of any one product line to be successful in the market could substantially reduce our sales 
we currently rely upon sales from our internal and external products to generate a majority of our sales 
while we continue to develop additional products within these and other product lines  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in doing so 
consequently  if the existing or future products are not successful  sales could decline substantially  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we rely heavily on the success of dealers and oems to market  sell and distribute our products 
if these resellers do not succeed in effectively distributing our products  our sales could be reduced 
these resellers may not effectively promote or market our products or they may experience financial difficulties and even close operations 
these dealers and retailers are not contractually obligated to sell our products 
therefore  they may  at any time 
spacer 
gif 

spacer 
gif 
refuse to promote our products and 
spacer 
gif 

spacer 
gif 
discontinue the use of our products in favor of a competitor s product also  with this distribution channel standing between us and the actual end user  we may not be able to accurately gauge current demand and anticipate future demand for our products 
for example  dealers may place large initial orders for a new product just to keep their stores stocked with the newest products and not because there is a significant demand for them 
our distribution network includes several consumer channels  including large distributors of products to computer software and hardware retailers  which in turn sell products to end users 
they also sell consumer products directly to certain retailers 
rapid change and financial difficulties of distributors have characterized distribution channels for consumer retail products 
these arrangements have exposed us to the following risks  among others 
spacer 
gif 

spacer 
gif 
we may be obligated to provide price protection to certain retailers and distributors and  while certain agreements limit the conditions under which products can be returned  we may be faced with product returns or price protection obligations 
spacer

spacer 
gif 
the distributors or retailers may not continue to stock and sell our products and 
spacer 
gif 

spacer 
gif 
retailers and retail distributors often carry competing products if these resellers do not succeed in effectively distributing our products  this could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we operate in a highly competitive market  and many of our competitors have much greater resources  which may make it difficult for us to remain competitive 
our business is subject to significant competition 
competition exists from larger companies that possess substantially greater technical  financial  human  sales and marketing resources than we do 
the dynamics of competition in this market involve short product life cycles  declining selling prices  evolving industry standards and frequent new product introductions 
we compete against companies such as ati technologies inc and pinnacle systems  inc our mediamvp and dec products compete in the consumer electronics market  where competition comes from sony corp  toshiba corporation  cisco systems inc and others 
we believe that competition from new entrants will increase as the market for digital video in a pc expands 
there can be no assurance that we will not experience increased competition in the future 
such increased competition may have a material adverse affect on our ability to successfully market our products 
competition is expected to remain intense and  as a result  we may lose some of our market share to our competitors 
further  we believe that the market for our products will continue to be price competitive and thus we could continue to experience lower selling prices  lower gross profit margins and reduced profitability levels for such products than in the past 
rapid technological changes and short product life cycles in our industry could harm our business 
the technology underlying our products and other products in the computer industry  in general  is subject to rapid change  including the potential introduction of new types of products and technologies  which may have a material adverse impact upon our business  operating results and financial condition 
we will need to maintain an ongoing research and development program  and our potential future success  of which there can be no assurances  will depend  in part  on our ability to respond quickly to technological advances by developing and introducing new products  successfully incorporating such advances in existing products  and obtaining licenses  patents  or other proprietary technologies to be used in connection with new or existing products 
we expended approximately   and  for research and development expenses for the years ended september   and  respectively 
there can be no assurance that our research and development will be successful or that we will be able to foresee and respond to such advances in technological developments and to successfully develop additional products 
additionally  there can be no assurances that the development of technologies and products by competitors will not render our products or technologies non competitive or obsolete 
if tv or video capabilities are included in pcs or in operating systems  it could result in a reduction in the demand for add on tv and video devices 
although we believe that our software is a competitive strength  as operating systems such as windows move to integrate and standardize software support for video capabilities  we will be challenged to further differentiate our products 
our operating results and ability to retain our market share are also dependent on continued growth in the underlying markets for pc  tv and video products 
we may not be able to timely adopt emerging industry standards  which may make our products unacceptable to potential customers  delay our product introductions or increase our costs 
our products must comply with a number of current industry standards and practices established by various international bodies 
failure to comply with evolving standards  including video compression standards  tv transmission standards  and pc interface standards  will limit acceptance of our products by the market 
if new standards are adopted in the industry  we will be required to adopt those standards in our products 
it may take a significant amount of time to develop and design products incorporating these new standards  and we may not succeed in doing so 
we may also become dependent upon products developed by third parties and have to pay royalty fees  which may be substantial  to the developers of the technology that constitutes the newly adopted standards 
we are heavily dependent upon foreign markets for sales of our products  primarily the european market  and adverse changes in these markets could reduce our sales 
our future performance will likely be dependent  in large part  on our ability to continue to compete successfully in the european markets  where a large portion of our current and potential customers are located 
our ability to compete in these markets will depend on many factors  including

we may not be able to introduce new products on a timely basis  that are accepted by the market  and that sell in quantities sufficient to make the products viable for the long term

there can be no assurances that such cost and management controls can be implemented and maintained  and if implemented  that they will be successful 
we have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  intense downward pricing pressure on our products  which could substantially impair our operating performance 
we are experiencing  and are likely to continue to experience  downward pricing pressure on our products 
as a result  we have experienced  and we expect to continue to experience  declining average sales prices for our products 
increases in the number of units that we are able to sell and reductions in per unit costs may not be sufficient to offset reductions in per unit sales prices  in which case our net income would be reduced and we could incur losses 
since we typically negotiate supply arrangements far in advance of delivery dates  we may need to commit to price reductions for our products before we are aware of how  or if  these cost reductions can be obtained 
as a result  any current or future price reduction commitments and our inability to respond to increased price competition could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we are dependent upon contract manufacturers for our production 
if these manufacturers do not meet our requirements  either in volume or quality  then we could be materially harmed 
during fiscal  we subcontracted the manufacturing and assembly of our products to three independent third parties at facilities in various countries 
relying on subcontractors involves a number of significant risks  including

unexpected increases in component costs we may need to hold more inventory than is immediately required to compensate for potential manufacturing disruptions 
if our significant subcontractors becomes unable or unwilling to continue to manufacture these products in required volumes  we will have to identify qualified alternate subcontractors 
additional qualified subcontractors may not be available  or may not be available on a timely or cost competitive basis 
any interruption in the supply of  or increase in  the cost of the products manufactured by third party subcontractors could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we are dependent upon single or limited source suppliers for our components and assembled products 
if these suppliers do not meet the demand  either in volume or quality  then we could be materially harmed 
if the supply of a key component or assembled product such as the dec and wintv dvb were to be delayed or curtailed or in the event a key manufacturing or sole vendor delays shipment of such components or completed products  our ability to ship products in desired quantities and in a timely manner would be adversely affected 
our business  operating results and financial condition could also be adversely affected  depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source or  if possible  to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source 
we attempt to mitigate these potential risks by working closely with our key suppliers on product introduction plans  strategic inventories  coordinated product introductions  and internal and external manufacturing schedules and levels 
we are also seeking out alternative sources for assembled products  making us less dependent on a single or limited source 
we may need to hold more inventory than is immediately required to compensate for potential component shortages or discontinuation 
this could lead to an increase in the costs of manufacturing or assembling our products 
if any single or limited source supplier becomes unable or unwilling to continue to supply these components or assembled products in required volumes  we will have to identify and qualify acceptable replacements or redesign our products with different components 
additional sources may not be available  or product redesign may not be feasible on a timely basis 
any interruption in the supply of or increase in the cost of the components and assembled products provided by single or limited source suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we may incur excessive expenses if we are unable to accurately forecast sales of our products 
we generally ship products within one to four weeks after receipt of orders 
therefore  our sales backlog is typically minimal 
accordingly  our expectations of future net sales and our product manufacturing and materials planning are based largely on our own estimates of future demand and not on firm customer orders 
if we obtain orders in excess of our internal forecasts  we may be unable to timely increase production to meet demand which could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
if our net sales do not meet expectations  our business  operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected  we may be burdened with excess inventory  and we may be subject to excess costs or inventory write offs 
we may experience a reduction in sales if we are unable to respond quickly to changes in the market for our products 
our net sales can be affected by changes in the quantity of products that our distributor and oem customers maintain in their inventories 
we may be directly and rapidly affected by changes in the market  including the impact of any slowdown or rapid increase in end user demand 
despite efforts to reduce distribution channel inventory exposure  distribution partners and oem customers may still choose to alter their inventory levels  which could cause a reduction in our net sales  this could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we may accumulate inventory to minimize the impact of shortages from manufacturers and suppliers  which may result in obsolete inventory that we may need to write off resulting in losses 
managing our inventory is complicated by fluctuations in the demand for our products as well as the issues of using contract manufacturers and procuring components from suppliers mentioned above 
as we must plan to have sufficient quantities of products available to satisfy our customers demands  we sometimes accumulate inventory for a period of time to minimize the impact of possible insufficient capacity or availability of components from our manufacturers and suppliers 
although we expect to sell the inventory within a short period of time  products may remain in inventory for extended periods of time and may become obsolete because of the passage of time and the introduction of new products or new components within existing products 
in these situations  we would be required to write off obsolete inventory which could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we may need financing  and may not be able to raise financing on favorable terms  if at all  which could limit our ability to grow and increase our costs 
we anticipate that we may need to raise additional capital in the future to continue our long term expansion plans  to respond to competitive pressures or to respond to unanticipated requirements 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain additional financing on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
our failure or inability to obtain financing on acceptable terms could require us to limit our plans for expansion  incur indebtedness that has high rates of interest or substantial restrictive covenants  issue equity securities that will dilute existing stockholders holdings or discontinue a portion of our operations  each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we may become involved in costly intellectual property disputes 
with the proliferation of new products and rapidly changing technology  there is a significant volume of patents and other intellectual property rights held by third parties 
there are a number of companies that hold patents for various aspects of the technologies incorporated in some of the pc and tv industries standards 
given the nature of our products and development efforts  there are risks that claims associated with such patents or intellectual property rights could be asserted by third parties against us 
we expect that parties seeking to gain competitive advantages will increase their efforts to enforce any patent or intellectual property rights that they may have 
the holders of patents from which we may have not obtained licenses may take the position that it is required to obtain a license from them 
if a patent holder refuses to offer such a license or offers such a license on terms unacceptable to us  there is a risk of incurring substantial litigation or settlement costs regardless of the merits of the allegations  or which party eventually prevails 
if we do not prevail in a litigation suit  we may be required to pay significant damages and or to cease sales and production of infringing products and accordingly  may incur significant defense costs 
additionally  we may need to attempt to design around a given technology  although there can be no assurances that this would be possible or economical 
we currently use technology licensed from third parties in certain products 
our business  financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected by a number of factors relating to these third party technologies  including

failure by a licensor to accurately develop  timely introduce  promote or support the technology

excess customer support or product return costs due to problems with licensed technology  and

termination of our relationship with such licensors we may be unable to enforce our intellectual property rights 
we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property through patent  copyright  trademark and other means of protection 
if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property  our intellectual property rights may be misappropriated by others  invalidated or challenged  and our competitors could duplicate our technology or may otherwise limit any competitive technological advantage we may have 
due to the rapid pace of technological change  we believe our success is likely to depend more upon continued innovation  technical expertise  marketing skills and customer support and service rather than upon legal protection of our proprietary rights 
however  we intend to aggressively assert our intellectual property rights when necessary 
even though we typically develop our products independently  our success  of which there can be no assurances  will depend  in a large part  on our ability to innovate  obtain or license patents  protect trade secrets  copyrights and trademarks  and draw upon our proprietary technology without infringing on the proprietary rights of others 
we maintain copyrights on our designs and software programs  but currently we have no patent on the wintv board as we believe that such technology cannot be patented 
we have no patents issued or pending that relate to our technology 
we are subject to a number of risks relating to intellectual property rights  including the following

the means by which we seek to protect our proprietary rights may not be adequate to prevent others from misappropriating our technology or from independently developing or selling technology or products with features based on or similar to our products 
spacer

spacer

our products may be sold in foreign countries that provide less protection to intellectual property than is provided under us laws  and 
spacer 
gif 

spacer 
gif 
our intellectual property rights may be challenged  invalidated  violated or circumvented and may not provide us with any competitive advantage we may not be able to attract and retain qualified managerial and other skilled personnel 
our success  of which there can be no assurances  depends  in part  on our ability to identify  attract  motivate and retain qualified managerial  technical and sales personnel 
our success  of which there can be no assurances  is dependent on our ability to manage effectively the enhancement and introduction of existing and new products and the marketing of such products 
we are particularly dependent on our ability to identify  attract  motivate and retain qualified managers  engineers and salespersons 
the loss of the services of a significant number of engineers or sales people or one or more senior officers or managers could be disruptive to product development efforts or business relationships and could seriously harm our business 
we depend on a limited number of key personnel  and the loss of any of their services could adversely affect our future growth and profitability and could substantially interfere with our operations 
our products are complex and our market is evolving 
the success of our business depends in large part upon the continuing contributions of our management and technical personnel 
the loss of the services of any of our key officers or employees could adversely affect our future growth and profitability and could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
our dependence upon our key officers and employees is increased by the fact that they are responsible for our sales and marketing efforts  as well as our overall operations 
we do not have key person life insurance policies covering any of our employees other than mr 
plotkin  our chairman of the board  chief executive officer  president  chief operating officer and vice president of marketing and the insurance coverage that we have on him may be insufficient to compensate us for the loss of his services 
we may not be able to effectively integrate businesses or assets that we acquire we may identify and pursue acquisitions of complementary companies and strategic assets  such as customer bases  products and technology 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition opportunities 
if any such opportunity involves the acquisition of a business  we cannot be certain that 
spacer

spacer

we will successfully integrate the operations of the acquired business with our own 
spacer

spacer

all the benefits expected from such integration will be realized

management s attention will not be diverted or divided  to the detriment of current operations

amortization of acquired intangible assets will not have a negative effect on operating results or other aspects of our business

delays or unexpected costs related to the acquisition will not have a detrimental effect on the combined business  operating results and financial condition

customer dissatisfaction with  or performance problems at  an acquired company will not have an adverse effect on our reputation  and 
spacer

respective operations  management and personnel will be compatible in most cases  acquisitions will be consummated without seeking and obtaining stockholder approval  in which case stockholders will not have an opportunity to consider and vote upon the merits of such an acquisition 
although we will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular acquisition  there can be no assurance that we will properly ascertain or assess such risks 
our products could contain defects  which could result in delays in recognition of sales  loss of sales  loss of market share  or failure to achieve market acceptance  or claims against us 
we develop complex products for tv and video processing 
despite testing by our engineers  subcontractors and customers  errors may be found in existing or future products 
this could result in  among other things  a delay in recognition of sales  loss of sales  loss of market share  failure to achieve market acceptance or substantial damage to our reputation 
we could be subject to material claims by customers  and may need to incur substantial expenses to correct any product defects 
we do not have product liability insurance to protect against losses caused by defects in our products  and we also do not have errors and omissions insurance 
as a result  any payments that we may need to make to satisfy our customers may be substantial and may result in a substantial charge to earnings 
we may experience fluctuations in our future operating results  which will make predicting our future results difficult 
historically  our quarterly and annual operating results have varied significantly from period to period  and we expect that our results will continue to do so 
these fluctuations result from a variety of factors  including

market acceptance of our products

changes in order flow from our customers  and their inability to forecast their needs accurately

increased competition  including changes in pricing by us and our competitors

delays in deliveries from our limited number of suppliers and subcontractors  and

difficulty in implementing effective cost management constraints as our sales are primarily to the consumer market  we have experienced certain seasonal revenue trends 
our peak sales quarter  due to holiday season sales of computer equipment  is our first fiscal quarter october to december  followed by our second fiscal quarter january to march 
in addition  our international sales  mostly in the european market  were  and of sales for the years ended september   and respectively 
our fiscal fourth quarter sales july to september can be potentially impacted by the reduction of activity experienced in europe during the july and august summer holiday period 
accordingly  any sales or net income in any particular period may be lower than the sales and net income in a preceding or comparable period 
period to period comparisons of our results of operations may not be meaningful  and should not be relied upon as indications of our future performance 
in addition  our operating results may be below the expectations of securities analysts and investors in future periods 
failure to meet such expectations  should such an event occur  will likely cause our share price to decline 
our common stock price is highly volatile 
the market price of our common stock has been  and may continue to be  subject to a high degree of volatility

the by laws do not permit stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders and consequently  an expensive proxy contest cannot occur other than in connection with the annual meeting of stockholders 
the by laws also impose strict requirements for shareholder proposals and nominations of prospective board members other than those nominated by or at the discretion of the board of directors 
these amendments may collectively or individually impact a person s decision to purchase voting securities in the company and may have anti takeover effects in that any merger or takeover may be delayed 
accordingly  any premium over market price that an acquirer might otherwise pay may be reduced 
on july   the board of directors declared a dividend distribution of one right for each outstanding share of the company s common shares to stockholders of record at the close of business on august  each right entitles the registered holder to purchase from the company one common share at a purchase price of per share  subject to adjustment and terms set out in the rights agreement between the company and north american transfer agent  as rights agent 
the rights may have certain anti takeover effects 
the rights will cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire the company in a manner which causes the rights to become discount rights unless the offer is conditional on a substantial number of rights being acquired 
accordingly  any premium over market price that an acquirer might otherwise pay may be reduced

collected in local currency primarily the euro on the supply side  since we predominantly deal with north american and asian suppliers and contract manufacturers  approximately of our inventory required to support our european sales are purchased and paid in us dollars 
the combination of sales billed in euros supported by inventory purchased in us dollars results in an absence of a natural local currency hedge 
consequently  our financial results are subject to market risks resulting from the fluctuations in the euro to us dollar exchange rates 
we attempt to reduce these risks by entering into foreign exchange forward contracts with financial institutions 
the purpose of these forward contracts is to hedge the foreign currency market exposures underlying the us dollar denominated inventory purchases required to support our european sales 
we do not try to hedge against all possible foreign currency exposures because of the inherent difficulty in estimating the volatility of the euro 
the contracts we procure are specifically entered into to as a hedge against forecasted or existing or foreign currency exposure 
we do not enter into contracts for speculative purposes 
although we maintain these programs to reduce the short term impact of changes in currency exchange rates  long term strengthening or weakening of the us dollar against the euro impacts our sales  our gross profit  operating income and retained earnings 
factors that could impact the effectiveness of our hedging program are

accuracy of our inventory forecasts additionally  there is the risk that foreign exchange fluctuations will make our products less competitive in foreign markets  which would substantially reduce our sales 
as of september   we had foreign currency contracts outstanding of approximately  against the delivery of the euro 
the contracts expire through march our accounting policies for these instruments designate such instruments as cash flow hedging transactions 
we do not enter into such contracts for speculative purposes 
we record all derivative gains and losses on the balance sheet as a component of stockholders equity under the caption accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
the company recorded a deferred gain of  for the twelve months ended september  as of september   a deferred loss of  reflecting the cumulative mark to market loss of our derivatives  was recorded on our balance sheet as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in our equity section 
we use the average monthly forward contract exchange rate to translate our euro denominated sales into our us dollar reporting currency 
for the twelve month period ending september   the use of the monthly average spot rate instead of the average monthly forward contract exchange rate to value euro denominated sales would have resulted in an increase in sales of  this sales increase is related to our contracts that closed during these periods and the changes in the fair value of our derivative contracts
