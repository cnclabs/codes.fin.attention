item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following information should be read in conjunction with the information contained in the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
overview we are a premier global management consulting firm 
we help leading organizations worldwide to understand and leverage technology to reduce costs  incorporate flexibility into their businesses  address changing regulations and markets  improve operations  and grow their business 
we work collaboratively with our clients  utilizing small  multidisciplinary teams of consultants because we believe the most lasting and significant improvements occur when the client is integrally involved in the change 
during the fiscal year ended march  we generated net revenue before reimbursements of out of pocket expenses of million from clients 
at march   we employed consultants and had nine offices in north america  europe and latin america  which included barcelona  chicago  d sseldorf  lisbon  london  madrid  m nich  paris  and s o paulo 
our revenue is driven by our ability to secure new client engagements  maintain existing client engagements and develop and implement solutions that add value to our clients 
our revenue is comprised of professional fees for services rendered to our clients plus reimbursement of out of pocket expenses 
prior to the commencement of a client engagement  we and our client agree on fees for services based upon the scope of the project  our staffing requirements and the level of client involvement 
we recognize revenue as services are performed in accordance with the terms of the client engagement agreement 
we bill our clients for these services on either a monthly or semi monthly basis in accordance with the terms of the client engagement 
accordingly  we recognize amounts due from our clients as the related services are rendered and revenue is earned even though we may not be able to bill for those services until a later date 
provisions are made based on our experience for estimated uncollectible amounts 
these provisions  net of write offs of accounts receivable  are reflected in the allowance for doubtful accounts 
we also set aside a portion of the revenue from each client engagement to cover the estimated costs that are likely to be incurred subsequent to targeted project completion 
this portion of the project revenue is reflected in deferred revenue and is calculated based on our historical experience 
while we have been required to make revisions to our clients estimated 
table of contents deliverables and to incur additional project costs in some instances  to date there have been no such revisions that have had a material adverse effect on our operating results 
we generate revenue in many different countries throughout the world and our revenues are denominated in multiple currencies  including the us dollar  the euro  the british pound sterling and the brazilian real 
as such  our revenues and expenses may be significantly impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
the strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar over the last several quarters has had a favorable foreign currency translation impact on our consolidated financial statements and increased our revenues 
for the fiscal year ended march   our net revenue was million  an increase of million  or  compared with the same period in the prior year 
assuming constant foreign currency translation rates  net revenue for the fiscal year ended march  would have increased million or 
our ability to generate revenue is affected by the level of business activity of our clients  which in turn is affected by the level of economic activity in the industries and markets that they serve 
a decline in the level of business activity of our clients could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and profit margin 
during the two year period ending in late fiscal  our business had been negatively impacted by weakened economic conditions  which had caused some clients to reduce or defer their expenditures for consulting services 
we have implemented and will continue to implement cost savings initiatives to manage our expenses as a percentage of revenue as appropriate 
the largest portion of our operating expenses consists of project personnel and related expenses 
project personnel expenses consist of payroll costs  variable compensation  and related benefits associated with professional staff 
other related expenses include travel  subcontracting  third party vendor payments and non billable costs associated with the delivery of services to our clients 
we consider the relationship between project personnel expenses and net revenue to be an important measure of our operating performance 
the relationship between project personnel expenses and net revenue is driven largely by the chargeability of our consultant base  the prices we charge to our clients and the non billable costs associated with securing new client engagements and developing new service offerings 
the remainder of our recurring operating expenses are comprised of expenses associated with the development of our business and the support of our client serving professionals  such as professional development and recruiting  marketing and sales  and management and administrative support 
professional development and recruiting expenses consist primarily of recruiting and training content development and delivery costs 
marketing and sales expenses consist primarily of the costs associated with the development and maintenance of our marketing materials and programs 
management and administrative support expenses consist primarily of the costs associated with operations including finance  information systems  human resources  facilities including the rent of office space  and other administrative support for project personnel 
as with revenues  the strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar over the last several quarters has increased our expenses 
the increase of both revenues and expenses created as a result of foreign currency translation results in an immaterial impact on net income 
we regularly review our fees for services  professional compensation and overhead costs to ensure that our services and compensation are competitive within the industry  and that our overhead costs are balanced with our revenue level 
in addition  we monitor the progress of client projects with client senior management 
we manage the activities of our professionals by closely monitoring engagement schedules and staffing requirements for new engagements 
however  a rapid decline in the demand for the professional services that we provide could result in lower utilization of our professionals than we planned 
in addition  because most of our client engagements are terminable by our clients without penalty  an unanticipated termination of a client project could require us to maintain underutilized employees 
while professional staff levels must be adjusted to reflect active engagements  we must also maintain a sufficient number of senior professionals to oversee existing client engagements and participate in our sales efforts to secure new client assignments 
disclosure regarding forward looking statements this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act and section e of the exchange act relating to our operations  results of 
table of contents operations and other matters that are based on our current expectations  estimates and projections 
words such as expects  intends  plans  projects  believes  estimates and similar expressions are used to identify these forward looking statements 
these statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict 
forward looking statements are based upon assumptions as to future events that may not prove to be accurate 
actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecast in these forward looking statements 
the reasons for this include changes in general economic and political conditions  including fluctuations in exchange rates  and the following factors our results of operations are materially affected by economic conditions  levels of business activity and rates of change in the industries we serve 
our profitability will suffer if we are not able to maintain our pricing and utilization rates and control our costs 
a continuation of pricing pressures could result in permanent changes in pricing policies and delivery capabilities 
if we are unable to attract  retain and motivate employees  we will not be able to compete effectively and will not be able to grow our business 
we may face damage to our professional reputation or legal liability if our clients are not satisfied with our services 
our global operations pose complex management  foreign currency  legal  tax and economic risks  which we may not adequately address 
our engagements with clients may not be profitable 
our business will be negatively affected if we are not able to anticipate and keep pace with rapid changes in technology or if growth in the use of technology in business is not as rapid as in the past 
the consulting and technology markets are highly competitive 
as a result  we may not be able to compete effectively if we cannot efficiently respond to market developments in a timely manner 
our quarterly revenues  operating results and profitability will vary from quarter to quarter  which may result in increased volatility of our share price 
for a more detailed discussion of these factors  see exhibit to this annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended march  we undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward looking statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
as such  we are required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
the significant accounting policies which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following revenue recognition we earn revenues from a range of consulting services  including helping organizations worldwide to leverage technology to develop and implement growth strategies  improve operations  and capitalize on technology 
our revenues are comprised of professional fees for services rendered to our clients plus reimbursement of out of pocket expenses 
prior to the commencement of a client engagement  we and our client agree on fees for services based upon the scope of the project  our staffing requirements and the level of client involvement 
we recognize revenue as services are performed in accordance with the terms of the client engagement 

table of contents service revenue recognition inherently involves a degree of estimation 
examples of important estimates in this area include determining the level of effort required to execute the project  calculating costs incurred and assessing our progress toward project completion on an ongoing basis 
we believe that these are critical accounting estimates because they can materially affect our revenues and earnings and require us to make judgments about matters that are uncertain 
we utilize a number of management processes to monitor project performance and revenue recognition including monthly reviews of the progress of each project against plan  staff and resource usage  service quality and client feedback 
from time to time  as part of our normal management process  circumstances are identified that require us to revise our estimates of the revenues to be realized on a project 
in most cases  these revisions relate to changes in the scope of the project  and do not significantly impact the expected fees on a contract 
to the extent that a revised estimate affects revenue previously recognized  we record the full effect of the revision in the period when the underlying facts become known 
allowance for doubtful accounts and deferred revenue we earn our revenues by providing consulting services to clients 
we bill our clients for these services on either a monthly or semi monthly basis in accordance with the terms of the client engagement 
accordingly  we recognize amounts due from our clients as the related services are rendered and revenue is earned even though we may not be able to bill for those services until a later date 
the terms of our client engagements also require us to assume the risk of non collection of amounts billed to clients 
management makes estimates of the amount of our billed and unbilled accounts receivable that may not be collected from clients 
we believe the allowance for doubtful accounts is a critical accounting estimate because it can materially affect our operating results and requires us to make judgments about matters that are uncertain 
in making these estimates  management specifically analyzes individual client balances  the composition of the aging of accounts receivable  historical bad debts  customer credit worthiness and current economic trends  and considers our overall experience with estimating uncollectible amounts 
we recognize the effect of changes in our estimates  assumptions and assessments of the factors impacting the collectibility of amounts due from customers on an ongoing basis 
as of march   our accounts receivable balance was million  including unbilled accounts receivable of million  and net of allowance for doubtful accounts of million 
unbilled receivables represent revenues earned for services performed that have not been billed 
unbilled receivables are typically billed the following month 
although we and our clients agree on the scope of projects  expected deliverables and related fees in advance  from time to time we have made revisions to the scope of work and deliverables without making a corresponding adjustment to the fees for the project 
we refer to this as project run on as these revisions generally cause a project to extend beyond its targeted completion 
we monitor our actual project run on experience on an ongoing basis and perform monthly reviews of projects in progress against plan 
we provide for project run on costs based on our analysis of historical experience 
these provisions  net of actual costs incurred on completed projects  are reflected in deferred revenue 
as of march   our deferred revenue balance was million 
also included in the deferred revenue balance are million of prepaid client fees related to consulting services that the company expects to earn in subsequent periods 
while we have been required to make revisions to our clients estimated deliverables and to incur additional project costs in some instances  to date there have been no such revisions that have had a material adverse effect on our operating results 
operating expenses the largest portion of our operating expenses consists of project personnel and related expenses 
project personnel expenses consist of payroll costs and related benefits associated with professional staff 
other related expenses include travel  subcontracting  third party vendor payments and unbillable costs associated with the delivery of services to our clients 
the amount of these other direct costs can vary substantially from period to period depending largely on revenue 
however  project personnel and related expenses are relatively fixed in nature  and declines in revenue will often result in reduced utilization of professional personnel and lower operating margins 

table of contents the remainder of our recurring operating expenses are comprised of expenses associated with the development of our business and the support of our client serving professionals  such as professional development and recruiting  marketing and sales  and management and administrative support 
professional development and recruiting expenses consist primarily of recruiting and training content development and delivery costs 
marketing and sales expenses consist primarily of the costs associated with the development and maintenance of our marketing materials and programs 
management and administrative support expenses consist primarily of the costs associated with operations  finance  information systems  facilities  including the rent of office space  and other administrative support for project personnel 
in december  september  december and june we recorded restructuring charges related to specific actions we took to better align our cost infrastructure with our near term revenue expectations 
for the december  september and december restructuring charges  we estimated these costs based upon our restructuring plans and accounted for these plans in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
for the june restructuring charge  we estimated these costs based upon our restructuring plan and accounted for this plan in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
the restructuring charges and accruals required certain significant estimates of costs related to severance and other personnel related expenses  as well as costs related to reductions in office space and estimated sublease income to be realized in the future  the write off of associated leasehold improvements  and the establishment of accruals for other contractual commitments which are not expected to provide future benefit 
these estimates and assumptions are monitored on at least a quarterly basis for changes in circumstances 
although we do not expect there to be significant changes to our plans  it is reasonably possible that such estimates could change in the near term due to unanticipated events  resulting in adjustments to the amounts recorded  and the effect could be material 
such revisions will be reflected in the financial statements in the period they occur 
valuation of long lived assets and goodwill on april   we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
with the adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other indefinite life intangible assets intangibles are no longer subject to amortization  rather  they are subject to an assessment for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred  but at least annually  by applying a fair value based test 
under sfas no 
 goodwill impairment is assessed at the reporting unit level  using a discounted cash flow method 
prior to april   the company amortized goodwill and identifiable intangible assets on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives not to exceed years  and periodically reviewed the recoverability of these assets based on the expected future undiscounted cash flows 
our goodwill was recognized in connection with acquisitions we made in fiscal and the majority of our goodwill related to our acquisition of cluster telecom bv  a pan european consulting firm specializing in wireless technology and digital strategies  which occurred in november under sfas no 
 goodwill impairment is determined using a two step process 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test is used to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its net book value or carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not to be impaired and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination 
that is  the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had 
table of contents been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid to acquire the reporting unit 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit under the first step of the goodwill impairment test and determining the fair value of individual assets and liabilities of a reporting unit including unrecognized intangible assets under the second step of the goodwill impairment test requires our management to make significant judgments  assumptions and estimates 
these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and also the magnitude of any such charge 
to assist in the process of determining goodwill impairment  the company obtains appraisals from independent valuation firms 
in addition to the use of independent valuation firms  the company performs internal valuation analyses and considers other market information that is publicly available 
estimates of fair value are primarily determined using discounted cash flows 
this approach requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions including projected future cash flows including timing  discount rate reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows and perpetual growth rate  among others 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we completed our initial impairment review following the guidance in sfas no 
and recorded a million non cash pretax charge for the impairment of goodwill  all of which was generated in the acquisition of cluster telecom bv 
the charge reflected overall market declines since the acquisition was completed in november  was non operational in nature and is reflected as a cumulative effect of an accounting change in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we performed the required annual impairment review for goodwill and recorded an additional non cash charge of million  which was recorded as a component of operating income loss in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations 
this impairment charge was recognized to reduce the carrying value of goodwill at our europe and latin america reporting unit million and our north american reporting unit million 
these charges reflect the units lower than expected performance  including the continued decline in the consulting market  and lower valuations in the consulting industry primarily due to current market conditions and related competitive pressures 
the impairment charges are non cash in nature and do not affect the company s liquidity 
as a result of the charges recognized during the year ended march   the carrying value of our goodwill was reduced to zero at march  and remained zero at march  valuation of deferred tax assets in determining our current income tax provision we assess temporary differences resulting from differing treatments of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are recorded in our consolidated balance sheets 
when we maintain deferred tax assets we must assess the likelihood that these assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
to the extent we believe recovery is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance 
we record an allowance to reduce the net deferred tax asset to a value we believe will be recoverable by future taxable income 
we believe the accounting estimate related to the valuation allowance is a critical accounting estimate because it is highly susceptible to change from period to period as it requires management to make assumptions about the company s future income over the life of the deferred tax asset  and the impact of increasing or decreasing the valuation allowance is potentially material to our results of operations 
management s assumptions about future income require significant judgment because actual income has fluctuated in the past and may continue to do so 
in estimating future income  we use our internal operating budgets and long range planning projections 
we develop our budgets and long range projections based on recent results  trends  economic and industry forecasts influencing our performance  our project pipeline  and other appropriate factors 
as of march   we had a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets of million 
if the realization of deferred tax assets in the future is considered more likely than not  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase net income in the period or periods such determination was made

this resulted in a decrease in demand for our services as companies tempered their spending on consulting services 
the weakened economic conditions led to pricing pressures  a lengthening of the company s sales cycle and reductions and or deferrals of client expenditures for consulting services 
however  over the last year the environment for our services has markedly improved 
on a global basis  revenue before out of pocket expense reimbursements increased to million during fiscal as compared to million during fiscal total revenue  including out of pocket expense reimbursements  increased to million for fiscal compared with million reported for fiscal our annualized revenue per professional increased to thousand during fiscal compared to thousand in fiscal due to revenue growth and headcount reduction

goodwill goodwill amortization decreased million to zero during fiscal as compared to fiscal as a result of the company s adoption of sfas no 
on april  as a percentage of net revenues  these expenses decreased from to zero 
goodwill amortization remained at zero during fiscal noncash compensation noncash compensation decreased from million or of net revenue during fiscal to million or of net revenue during fiscal noncash compensation expense had been primarily due to the amortization of unearned compensation resulting from the issuance of stock and stock options at prices below fair market value to cluster employees in connection with the cluster acquisition 
effective april   noncash compensation also includes amortization of the fair value of employee stock awards granted or modified after april  calculated under the fair value method of sfas  accounting for stock based compensation 
in both cases  stock based compensation is earned over the service period and is contingent on the continued employment of these employees 
the decrease in noncash compensation is primarily due to stock option cancellations as a result of forfeitures from terminated employees 
reversal of amortization for previously recognized expense for forfeitures increased million in fiscal compared with fiscal in addition  million less expense was recorded in fiscal than fiscal due to cancelled options  and million less amortization was recorded in fiscal than fiscal due to only a partial year of amortization remaining on some restricted shares 
finally  the decrease in noncash compensation is also attributable to the non recurring nature of the million of expense recognized during fiscal consisting of the remaining unamortized original intrinsic value of certain non vested stock options cancelled by the company on may   pursuant to an offer to employees other than senior officers to surrender certain stock options previously granted to them in exchange for a future grant of new options to purchase the same class of shares 
during fiscal  noncash compensation increased to million or of net revenue from million or of net revenue during fiscal noncash compensation expense in fiscal is primarily due to the amortization of unearned compensation resulting from the issuance of stock options at prices below fair market value to cluster employees in connection with the cluster acquisition 
the unearned compensation will be earned over time contingent on the continued employment of these employees 
the increase in noncash compensation expense is due to the recognition of million of additional expense 
table of contents related to the remaining unamortized original intrinsic value of certain non vested stock options cancelled by the company 
restructuring charges restructuring charge expense was million during fiscal compared to million during fiscal during fiscal  restructuring charge expense increased to million from million during fiscal year during fiscal years  and early  our company suffered from a decrease in global demand as we saw clients decrease their spending on consulting services 
as a result  management implemented plans to restructure the company s operating infrastructure to better align it with the anticipated levels of business during those times and beyond 
we recorded four separate restructuring charges during fiscal years   and the primary actions underlying these restructuring charges included facilities downsizing  workforce reduction  and fixed asset write offs 
we expected annualized savings from these charges to be a combined million to million 
refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements for a detailed description of the activities surrounding each of these restructuring charges 
impairment charge on long lived assets during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company conducted its annual assessment of the carrying value of goodwill 
as a result  the company recorded an impairment charge of million to write down the carrying value of goodwill to zero 
this impairment charge was recognized to reduce the carrying value of goodwill at our europe and latin america reporting unit million and our north american reporting unit million 
these charges reflect the units lower than expected performance  including the continued decline in the consulting market  and lower valuations in the consulting industry primarily due to current market conditions and related competitive pressures 
the impairment charges are noncash in nature and do not affect the company s liquidity 
as of march  and  the carrying amount of goodwill was zero 
other income expense other income  net increased million from million in fiscal to million during fiscal this increase is primarily due to increased foreign exchange gains recorded in fiscal year partially offset by a decrease in interest income as well as the write down of fixed assets in connection with the downsizing of certain european offices 
during fiscal  other income  net decreased million to million from million in fiscal  primarily due to a decrease in interest yields and cash balances throughout fiscal year resulting in a decrease in interest income of million  which was partially offset by foreign exchange gains 
income tax expense income tax expense decreased from million during fiscal to million during fiscal the income tax expense recorded in fiscal year was related to the income earned by certain foreign subsidiaries in jurisdictions where we do not have tax loss carryforwards 
the income tax expense recorded in fiscal year was principally related to the million increase in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets recognized by the company 
we have deferred tax assets which have arisen primarily as a result of operating losses incurred in fiscal year and fiscal year  as well as differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their related amounts in the financial statements 
sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  requires the establishment of a valuation allowance to reflect the likelihood of realization of deferred tax assets 
management judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against the gross deferred tax assets 
as of march   the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets was million and covered the full amount of our net federal  state and international deferred tax assets 
income tax expense increased from an income tax benefit of million during fiscal to an income tax expense of million during fiscal due principally to a non cash charge of million to increase the valuation allowance against the net federal  state and international deferred tax assets

as of march   there were no outstanding borrowings and we had approximately million available under this line of credit 
cash flow from operating activities during the fiscal year ended march   net cash provided by operating activities was million 
this primarily resulted from the following activities the net loss was million 
the net loss includes noncash charges aggregating million that must be excluded to arrive at cash flows from operating activities 
the principal noncash charges are stock based compensation million  the restructuring charges million  and depreciation and amortization million 
cash outflows to reduce the restructuring accrual aggregated million  including payments under contractual lease obligations and severance and related costs 
changes in assets and liabilities that result from operating activities are also considered in arriving at cash flows from operations

this plan of recapitalization was based on a detailed review of our system of corporate governance 
the board considered the effect of the sarbanes oxley act and the corporate governance standards being developed for listed companies by the nasdaq national market 
after a thorough review  the board concluded that a modification to the corporation s restated certificate of incorporation and internal governance agreements should be made to assure continued independence of a majority of the board and the proper functioning of the audit and other committees of the board 
because each outstanding share of class b common stock had five votes  the holders of the class b common stock could significantly influence all matters brought to a vote of our stockholders 
in addition  all of the holders of our class b common stock had granted proxies to our chief executive officer to vote their shares 
accordingly  the chief executive officer had the right to vote of the outstanding shares of class b common stock 
our board of directors had determined that it was no longer in our best interest for our chief executive officer to have such voting control 
the board of directors approved this plan of recapitalization in order to bring our system of corporate governance more in line with the governance of other public companies 
implementation of this plan eliminated the voting control then held by our chief executive officer by reducing the number of votes for employee shares and eliminating the ceo proxy  although certain aspects of our internal governance procedures remain under the partners operating agreement  as amended 
on may   we offered employees other than senior officers a plan  approved by the board of directors  which gave employees a choice to surrender certain stock options previously granted to them in exchange for a future grant of a smaller number of new options to purchase the same class of shares  a majority of which would vest over a three year period 
the original options were granted under diamondcluster s stock option plan and under diamondcluster s equity incentive plan 
employees who accepted this offer were required to make an election with respect to all covered options by may  in order to receive the new options  the employees were required to remain employed by diamondcluster until november  the exchange offer was not available to the members of the board of directors or senior officers of diamondcluster 
a total of million stock options were surrendered as part of this plan 
certain of these options had intrinsic value at the original grant date  the unvested portion of which had not been amortized to noncash compensation expense at the date surrendered 
the voluntary surrender of these options resulted in a noncash charge to compensation expense of million during the quarter ended june   relating to the remaining unamortized compensation expense associated with these surrendered options 
on november   approximately million new options were granted to employees who remained employed by diamondcluster 
the exercise price for a majority of the options granted on november  was  or of the fair market value of the company s common stock on that date 
on january   we offered our employees other than senior officers a plan  approved by the board of directors  which gave employees a choice to cancel certain stock options granted to them in exchange for a future grant of a lesser number of new options to purchase the same class of shares  a majority of which would vest proportionately over a four year period 
the original options were granted under diamondcluster s stock option plan and under diamondcluster s equity incentive plan 
employees who accepted the offer were required to make an election with respect to all covered options by february  in order to receive the new options  the employees were required to remain employed by diamondcluster until august  the exchange offer was not available to the members of the board of directors or senior officers of diamondcluster 
a total of million stock options were cancelled as part of this plan 
on august   a total of million of new options were granted as part of this plan  which represented between and of the original grant and had an exercise price that was set on the grant date 
the exercise price for a majority of the options granted on august  was set at fair market value 
summary we believe that our current cash balances  existing lines of credit  and cash flow from existing and future operations will be sufficient to fund our operating requirements at least through fiscal year if necessary  
table of contents we believe that additional bank credit would be available to fund any additional operating and capital requirements 
in addition  we could consider seeking additional public or private debt or equity financing to fund future growth opportunities 
however  there is no assurance that such financing would be available to us on acceptable terms 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk sensitive instruments 
foreign currency risk international revenues are generated primarily from our services in the respective countries by our foreign subsidiaries and are typically denominated in the local currency of each country  most of which are the euro 
these subsidiaries also incur most of their expenses in the local currency  most of which are the euro 
accordingly  all foreign subsidiaries use the local currency as their functional currency 
our international business is subject to risks typical of an international business  including  but not limited to  differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions and foreign exchange rate volatility 
our future results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in these or other factors 
the financial statements of our non us businesses are typically denominated in the local currency of the foreign subsidiary in order to centralize foreign exchange risk with the parent company in the united states 
as a result  we are also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars in consolidation 
as exchange rates fluctuate  these results  when translated  may vary from expectations and adversely impact overall expected results and profitability 
in the past  the company has entered into transactions to reduce the effect of foreign exchange transaction gains and losses on recorded foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities  and to reduce the effect of foreign exchange translation gains and losses on the parent company s net investment in its foreign subsidiaries 
these transactions involved the use of forward foreign exchange contracts in certain european currencies 
as of march   there were no open forward foreign exchange contracts outstanding 
a forward foreign exchange contract obligates the company to exchange predetermined amounts of specified foreign currencies at specified exchange rates on specified dates or to make an equivalent us dollar payment equal to the value of such exchange 
as a result  increases or decreases in the us dollar value of the company s foreign currency transactions and investments in foreign subsidiaries are partially offset by gains and losses on the forward contracts  so as to mitigate the possibility of significant foreign currency transaction and translation gains and losses 
the company does not use foreign currency contracts for trading purposes 
the company does not currently hedge anticipated foreign currency denominated revenues and expenses 
all foreign currency transactions and outstanding forward contracts are marked to market on a monthly basis 
diamondcluster has net investments in foreign operations located throughout europe and latin america 
in some cases  the company hedges its euro exposures through the use of euro us dollar forward contracts in order to mitigate the impact of foreign currency movements on the company s financial position 
these contracts have been designated and have qualified as hedging instruments of the foreign currency exposure related to the company s net investment in its foreign operations 
accordingly  the net amount of gains or losses on these forward foreign exchange contracts offset losses and gains on the company s exposure to foreign currency movements related to its net investments in its foreign operations and are reflected in the cumulative translation adjustment account and included as a component of other comprehensive income 
at march   the company had one euro us dollar forward contract outstanding in the notional principal amount of eur million 
on june   the company settled its euro us dollar forward contract for eur million 
as noted above  the company entered into this contract to mitigate the effect of an adverse movement of foreign exchange rates 
as a result of the weakening of the us dollar against the euro in the first quarter of fiscal  the company recorded a net loss on the forward exchange contract of million in the cumulative translation adjustments account which was offset by the related gain on the net investment in the foreign operations during the period 
during fiscal year and as of march   there were no open euro us dollar or other forward contracts outstanding 

table of contents interest rate risk the company invests its cash in highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less 
the interest rate risk associated with our investing activities at march  is not material in relation to our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
we have not used derivative financial instruments in fiscal year to alter the interest rate characteristics of our investment holdings
