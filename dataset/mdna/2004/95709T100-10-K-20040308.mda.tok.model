item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction we are the largest electric utility in kansas 
we produce  transmit and sell electricity at retail in kansas and at wholesale in a multi state region in the central united states under the regulation of the kcc and the ferc 
our goals are to improve our core utility business by improving customer service  continuing to expand our wholesale sales  continuing to reduce debt  improving credit quality and improving our relationships with regulators  shareholders  employees and other interested parties 
our focus during was the reduction of debt  primarily through the disposition of non utility and non core operations 
in  we reduced our debt by million primarily through use of the proceeds from the sale of our oneok stock and through the retirement of million of debt that was economically defeased in with the closing of the sale of our interest in protection one on february   we received proceeds of million  which will also be used to reduce debt 
we plan to issue million to million of equity during key factors affecting our business in any given period include the weather  the economic well being of our kansas service territory  performance of our electric generating facilities  conditions in fuel markets and the markets for wholesale electricity and the cost of dealing with public policy initiatives 
as you read management s discussion and analysis  please refer to our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes  which contain our operating results 
critical accounting estimates our discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with gaap 
note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  summary of significant accounting policies  contains a summary of our significant accounting policies  many of which require the use of estimates and assumptions by management 
the policies highlighted below have an impact on our reported results that may be material due to the levels of judgment and subjectivity necessary to account for uncertain matters or susceptibility of matters to change 
pension benefit plans in accounting for our retirement plans and other post retirement benefits  we make assumptions regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets 
the reported costs of our pension benefit plans  which include our portion of wcnoc s costs  are impacted by management estimates regarding earnings on plan assets  contributions to the plan  discount rates used to determine our projected benefit obligation and pension costs and employee demographics including age  compensation levels and employment periods 
a change in any of these assumptions could have a significant impact on future costs  which may be reflected as an increase or decrease in net income in the period  or on the amount of related liabilities reflected on our consolidated balance sheets or may also require cash contributions 

table of contents the following table shows the annual impact of a decrease in certain assumptions 
if the discount rate increased by  the impact would be a similar amount in the opposite direction 
change in assumption annual increase in projected benefit obligation annual increase in pension liability annual increase in projected pension expense in thousands discount rate decrease    rate of return on plan assets decrease  revenue recognition energy sales revenues from energy sales are recognized upon delivery to the customer and include an estimate for energy delivered but unbilled at the end of each year 
our estimate of revenue attributable to this unbilled portion is based on the total energy available for sale during the year measured against total billed sales and our estimates  based on historical data  of the portion of the unbilled revenues attributable to each of our different rate classes retail or wholesale 
if actual sales differ from the estimate  our revenues could be affected 
at december   we had estimated unbilled revenue of million 
energy marketing activities are accounted for under the mark to market method of accounting 
under this method  changes in the portfolio value are recognized as gains or losses in the period of change 
the net mark to market change is included in energy sales on our consolidated statements of income loss 
the resulting unrealized gains and losses are recorded as energy trading assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets 
we use quoted market prices to value our energy marketing and derivative contracts when such data are available 
when market prices are not readily available or determinable  we use alternative approaches  such as model pricing 
the quoted market prices used to value these transactions reflect our best estimate of fair values of our trading positions 
results actually achieved from these activities could vary materially from intended results and could affect our consolidated financial results 
the tables below show fair value of energy trading contracts outstanding for the year ended december   their sources and maturity periods fair value of contracts in thousands net fair value of contracts outstanding at the beginning of the period less contracts realized or otherwise settled during the period plus fair value of new contracts entered into during the period fair value of contracts outstanding at the end of the period 
table of contents the sources of the fair values of the financial instruments related to these contracts are summarized in the following table fair value of contracts at end of period total fair value maturity less than year maturity years maturity years maturity in excess of years in thousands sources of fair value prices actively quoted futures prices provided by other external sources swaps and forwards prices based on the black option pricing model options and other a total fair value of contracts outstanding a the black option pricing model is a variant of the black scholes option pricing model 
operating results westar energy consolidated we are pursuing a strategy to return to our core business of providing electric service 
we have discussed our significant accomplishments elsewhere throughout this document 
as described in further detail in the segments of business discussion that follows  our operating results for improved based on a variety of factors 
compared to income from operations improved from million in to million in improved electric sales revenues and the significant decline in selling  general and administrative expense more than offset increased fuel and purchased power expense 
administrative expenses in were significantly higher due to expenses related to work force reductions and other costs described below 
other income increased by million in because the gain on the sale of our oneok stock in more than offset other declines in investment earnings  losses associated with the settlement of the call option related to our putable callable notes and losses on the extinguishment of debt 
interest expense declined primarily due to the reduction in our outstanding debt balance 
the results of discontinued operations were significantly improved as compared to results in were adversely impacted by large impairment charges  which are described below 
the net effect of these improvements in our consolidated financial position was net income of million in compared to a net loss of million in compared to income from operations improved from million in to million in improved electric sales revenues and declines in purchased power and depreciation expenses more than offset increases in administrative expenses related to special committee and grand jury investigation costs  work force reductions and amounts recorded for potential liabilities to mr 
wittig and mr 
lake 
additionally  results of discontinued operations more than offset the improvement in our income from operations 
in  we recorded impairment charges of million  net of million tax  associated with goodwill and customer account assets of our monitored services businesses 
these large impairment charges are reflected in the results of our discontinued operations and are the primary reason for our net loss of million in segments of business we evaluate segment performance based on earnings per share and have two reportable segments electric utility and other 
we have no single customer from which we receive or more of our revenues 
electric utility consists of our integrated electric utility operations  including the generation  transmission and distribution of power to our retail customers in kansas and to wholesale customers  as well as our energy marketing activities 

table of contents other includes our former ownership interests in oneok  protection one and protection one europe and other investments that in the aggregate are immaterial to our business or consolidated results of continuing operations 
we expect the other segment will be immaterial in future periods 
electric utility regulated electric utility sales are significantly impacted by such things as rate regulation  customer conservation efforts  wholesale demand  the overall economy of our service area  the weather and competitive forces 
our wholesale sales are impacted by demand inside and outside our service territory  the cost of fuel and purchased power  price volatility and available generation capacity

table of contents the following table reflects changes in electric sales volumes  as measured by thousands of mwh of electricity  for the two years ended december  and no sales volumes are shown for network integration or energy marketing because these activities are unrelated to electricity we generate 
change change thousands of mwh residential commercial industrial other total retail wholesale total assets attributable to our electric utility segment are summarized in the table below december  change change in thousands identifiable assets retail sales revenues declined primarily because of the effect of the weather on usage of electricity by residential customers  which caused residential sales volumes to decline  as well as the sale of a small portion of our rural distribution territory 
commercial and industrial sales revenues showed slight decreases while sales volumes remained relatively flat compared to the decline in retail sales volumes accounted for approximately million of the decline in retail sales revenues 
the remainder of the decline in retail sales revenues was due to the accrual of approximately million to be refunded to customers in and pursuant to a kcc order 
the increases in energy marketing and wholesale sales revenues more than offset the decline in retail sales revenues 
higher wholesale market prices were the primary cause of improvement in energy marketing and wholesale sales revenues 
the higher wholesale market prices more than offset the decline in wholesale sales volumes 
purchased power expenses increased million during during periods of high energy use in  we purchased more power from other sources than we did during the same periods of because it was more economical to purchase power than to operate our peaking units 
this is also the primary reason our fuel expense decreased 
selling  general and administrative expenses declined in  which reflects a reduction in numerous incremental administrative expenses incurred in these administrative expenses included a million charge related to our work force reduction  a million charge related to an exchange of restricted share units for common stock and an expense of million for potential liabilities to mr 
wittig and mr 
lake 
the decline in selling  general and administrative expenses for was partially offset by million in charges related to the special committee and grand jury investigations in as compared to charges of million in related to these investigations 
decreases in depreciation and amortization and operating and maintenance expenses also contributed to the decline in total operating expenses for depreciation and amortization expense decreased due primarily to the adoption of new depreciation rates on april  pursuant to a kcc order 
operating and maintenance expense declined due primarily to the million gain recorded on the sale of utility assets  which was recorded as an offset to operating expenses 
general maintenance expenses at our generating facilities increased by million  partially offsetting the decline in operating expenses 
other income expense improved significantly in primarily because the mark to market charge to record the fair value of the call option associated with the putable callable notes for was million compared to a charge of million for the smaller mark to market charge in was the result of the settlement of the call options related to our putable callable notes in august on november   the kcc issued an order that directed us to reverse all transactions recorded in as equity investments by us in westar industries so such transactions were reflected as intercompany payables owed by westar industries to us 
during  as a result of the november  kcc order  we recorded interest income associated with the intercompany receivable owed by westar industries to westar energy 
this resulted in an offset to interest expense in of million as compared to million in the remainder of the improved interest expense was due to the significant decline in our outstanding debt balances 
in response to a subsequent kcc order  the intercompany receivable owed by westar industries to westar energy was again reclassified as an equity investment by us in westar industries 
no additional interest income is expected to be recorded in the future

table of contents assets attributable to our electric utility segment are summarized in the table below december  change change in thousands identifiable assets residential sales revenues increased due primarily to the increase in residential sales volumes 
the increase was due primarily to favorable weather conditions but was partially offset by lower retail rates 
the lower retail rates are attributable to the rate reductions ordered by the kcc in july commercial sales revenues were similarly affected by favorable weather conditions  the increased volumes and the lower retail rates 
industrial sales revenues decreased primarily because of weak economic conditions experienced in our service territory  principally associated with the downturn in the aircraft industry 
other retail revenues  which include public street and highway lighting and miscellaneous electric revenues  also decreased 
the factors affecting this decline were a million provision for rate refunds recorded during and a million decline in other electric revenues  primarily related to changes in transmission revenues received as a result of open access to our transmission lines 
wholesale revenues increased primarily as a result of an increase in wholesale sales volumes 
revenues attributable to the increase in wholesale sales volumes were partially offset by lower market prices 
energy marketing revenues declined due primarily to the lower market prices 
purchased power expense decreased due primarily to lower wholesale market prices 
the remainder of the decline is due to a decrease in the quantity purchased because of the increased availability of our generating units

the subsidiary was sold during the first quarter of other income increased in as compared to due primarily to the gain of million recorded on the sale of oneok stock 
this gain was partially offset by a reduction in investment earnings  of which million was due to the cessation of dividends and equity earnings on the oneok shares we sold 
investment earnings in were also lower than in because of the one time payment of approximately million received during the first quarter of as a partial recovery of an investment in a foreign power project 
a million charge on the mark to market adjustment on the call option of the putable callable notes also affected the increase in the loss on extinguishment of debt 
interest expense increased primarily as the result of intercompany interest expense of million paid to westar energy in that was not paid in this interest expense was recorded as a result of the november  kcc order as discussed in the electric utility segment above 
the million loss on discontinued operations for includes impairment charges of million  net of tax benefit of million  on our monitored services businesses that was based on actual sale proceeds received on the sale of our interest in protection one europe and the estimate of value that we believed would be recovered in connection with a sale of our interest in protection one

uncertainties affecting our ability to meet these requirements include  among others  factors affecting sales described above  economic conditions  including the impact of inflation on operating expenses  regulatory actions  conditions in the capital markets  our ability to implement the debt reduction plan  including the issuance of additional westar energy common stock and compliance with environmental regulations 

table of contents as of december   our total outstanding long term debt  excluding current maturities  was approximately billion 
at december   our current maturities of long term debt were million  due primarily to the reclassification of million of debt that matures in august from long term to short term debt 
our indebtedness could have a negative impact on  among other things  our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures and general corporate purposes and our ability to withstand a downturn in our business or the economy in general 
capital resources we had million in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents at december  we consider cash equivalents to be highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the time they are purchased 
at december   we also had million of restricted cash classified as a current asset and million of restricted cash classified as a long term asset

table of contents we expect to issue equity securities in in private transactions  public offerings or both 
cash flows from operating activities our primary source of operating cash flows is the operations of our electric utility business 
cash flows from operating activities decreased million to million in from million in this decrease was mostly attributable to taxes paid in of million compared to an income tax refund received in of million  an increase in maintenance expenditures at our generating facilities in as compared to  and increased legal expenditures in related to investigations and litigation 
the increased taxes paid in were mostly attributable to the gain on the sale of oneok stock

we received net cash flows from financing activities of million in in  an increase in short term debt was the principal source of cash flows from financing activities 
cash from financing activities was used to fund the retirement of long term debt and to pay dividends 
future cash requirements the debt reduction plan requires us to pay rebates to retail customers of million on may  and million on january  we believe we can fund these rebates with internally generated cash flow and available borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility 
if we are required to update emissions controls or take other remedial action as a result of the epa s investigation  the costs could be material 
we may also have to pay fines or penalties or make significant capital or operational expenditures related to the notice of violation we received from the epa in connection with certain projects completed at the jeffrey energy center 
in addition  significant capital or operational expenditures may be required in order to comply with future environmental regulations or in connection with future remedial obligations 

table of contents our business requires significant capital investments 
through  we expect we will need cash mostly for ongoing utility construction programs designed to improve facilities providing electric service 
other than making planned upgrades to existing facilities  we do not anticipate needing additional generating capacity through at least we expect these cash needs to be met with internally generated cash flow

debt covenants some of our debt instruments contain restrictions that require us to maintain various coverage and leverage ratios as defined in the agreements 
our calculations of these ratios are performed in accordance with our debt agreements and are used solely to determine compliance with our various debt covenants 
we were in compliance with these covenants as of december  accounts receivable sales program on july   westar energy and kge entered into an agreement with wr receivables corporation  a wholly owned  bankruptcy remote special purpose entity spe to sell all of their accounts receivable arising from the sale of electricity to the spe

new accounting pronouncements accounting for energy trading contracts in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
amends the accounting for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts for hedging activities  and clarifies which contracts qualify as normal purchase normal sale contracts 
sfas no 
also amends certain other existing pronouncements and requires contracts with comparable characteristics to be accounted for similarly 
in particular  sfas no 
clarifies when a contract with an initial net investment meets the characteristics of a derivative and when a derivative that contains a financing component will require special reporting in the statement of cash flows 
sfas no 
was effective for contracts entered into or modified after june  adoption of sfas no 
has not had a material effect on our consolidated results of operations  financial position or cash flows 

table of contents in october  the fasb  through the emerging issues task force eitf  reached consensus on eitf issue no 
 issues involved in accounting for derivative contracts held for trading purposes and contracts involved in energy trading and risk management activities 
eitf issue no 
 in part  rescinded issue no 
 accounting for contracts involved in energy trading and risk management activities 
as a result  all new contracts entered into after october  can no longer be marked to market and recorded in earnings unless they fall within the scope of sfas no 
we were unaffected by this change in accounting principle and were not required to reclassify any of our contracts since our energy trading contracts qualify as derivative instruments under the guidance of sfas no 
eitf issue no 
also requires reporting energy trading contracts and derivatives in the income statement on a net basis effective january   whether the contracts are settled financially or physically 
we began classifying our energy trading contracts on a net basis during the third quarter of and have reclassified all prior periods to reflect this presentation 
in august  the fasb issued eitf issue  reporting realized gains and losses on derivative instruments that are subject to the fasb statement no 
and not held for trading purposes as defined in issue no 
the reporting of realized gains and losses on physically settled derivative contracts based on the economic substance of the transaction 
our physically settled transactions are reported on a gross basis in the income statement in accordance with eitf issue guidance 
potential accounting changes at its september  meeting  the american institute of certified public accountants accounting standards executive committee approved a statement of position sop  accounting for certain costs and activities related to property  plant  and equipment  subject to the accounting standards executive committee s positive clearance of certain revisions and the fasb clearance 
the revised draft sop sent to the fasb for clearance provides guidance on accounting for certain costs and activities relating to property  plant and equipment pp e 
the following principles apply to the accounting for pp e costs within the scope of the sop 
pp e consists of one or more components  which should be recorded at cost 
a pp e component should be depreciated over its expected useful life 
the costs of a replacement component and the component replaced should not concurrently be recorded as assets 
the sop requires that an entity determine the level of component accounting for its pp e  which should be set no higher than the functional unit level ie  a power plant  a building 
a component is a tangible part or portion of pp e that an entity has elected to account for separately as an asset and is expected to provide economic benefit for more than one year 
in order for a replacement to be capitalized  the replaced item needs to have been previously separately accounted for as a component 
if an entity replaces a part or portion of a separate component that previously has not been accounted for as a separate component  the replacement would be charged to expense 
if  however  the entity determines that the replacement will be accounted for as a separate component in the future  this constitutes a change in accounting principle under apb opinion the method is to be applied consistently from period to period 
indirect  general and administrative costs and occupancy costs should be charged to expense as incurred 
additionally  under provisions of the sop  major maintenance costs are to be expensed as incurred 
accordingly  we would be required to expense wolf creek refueling costs as incurred absent the regulatory treatment afforded these costs by the kcc 
removal costs should be considered costs associated with the removed component rather than any replacement component  and should be charged to expense 
the sop would be effective for fiscal years beginning after december  other information sale of utility assets in august  we sold a portion of our transmission and distribution assets and rights to provide service to approximately  customers in an area of central kansas 
total sales proceeds received were million and we recorded a gain of million  which is included as a reduction in operating and maintenance expenses on our consolidated income statement 
we may enter into similar transactions in the future 

table of contents city of wichita franchise on february   the wichita city council approved a ten year renewal of the franchise pursuant to which kge provides retail electric service to the city of wichita 
the new ten year franchise agreement is on terms that we believe to be reasonably similar to those previously in effect 
network integration transmission service effective january   we began taking network integration transmission service under the spp s open access transmission tariff 
this provides a way for us to participate in a broader market of generation resources 
this tariff provides for a zonal rate structure  whereby transmission customers pay a pro rata share  in the form of a reservation charge  for the use of the facilities for each transmission owner that serves them 
as a result  the spp has functional control over our transmission system  although we still own our transmission assets and maintain responsibility for dispatching electricity  providing reliable transmission service  maintaining our transmission system and restoring our transmission system in the event there is a disruption to our system 
currently  all revenues collected within an spp zone for network integration transmission costs are allocated back to the transmission owner serving the zone 
in  our transmission costs for the westar energy zone were approximately million 
this amount  less million that was retained by the spp as administration cost  was returned to us as revenues 
in  our transmission costs were approximately million with an administration cost of million retained by the spp 
the spp administration cost is recovered as part of retail rates and a charge to the applicable wholesale customers taking network integration transmission service 
the revenues received are reflected in electric sales  and the related charges are expensed and included in reported operating expense 
stranded costs stranded costs for a utility business are commitments or investments in  and carrying costs on  pp e  contractual obligations and other regulatory assets that exceed the amount that can be recovered in a competitive market 
we currently apply accounting standards that recognize the economic effects of rate regulation and record regulatory assets and liabilities related to our electric utility operations 
if we determine that we no longer meet the criteria of sfas no 
 we may have a material non cash charge to earnings 
reasons for discontinuing sfas no 
accounting treatment include increasing competition that may restrict our ability to charge prices needed to recover costs already incurred or a significant change by regulators from cost based rate regulation to another form of rate regulation 
we periodically review sfas no 
criteria and believe our net regulatory assets are probable of future recovery 
if we discontinue sfas no 
accounting treatment based on competitive or other events  the value of our net regulatory assets and our utility plant investments  particularly wolf creek  may be significantly impacted 
regulatory changes could adversely impact our ability to recover our investment in these assets 
as of december   we have recorded regulatory assets currently subject to recovery in future rates of approximately million 
of this amount  million is a receivable for income tax benefits previously passed on to customers 
the remainder of the regulatory assets are items that may give rise to stranded costs  including asset retirement obligations  loss on reacquired debt  refinancing costs on the lacygne lease  deferred employee benefit costs  deferred plant costs and coal contract settlement costs 
in a competitive environment  we may not be able to fully recover our entire investment in wolf creek 
kge presently owns of wolf creek 
we may also have stranded costs related to an inability to recover our environmental remediation costs and long term fuel contract costs in a competitive environment 
if we determine that we have stranded costs and we cannot recover our investment in these assets  our future net utility income will be lower than our historical net utility income has been unless we compensate for the loss of such income with other measures 
asset retirement obligations in january  we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
requires recognition of legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets that result from the 
table of contents acquisition  construction  development or normal operation of such assets 
concurrent with the recognition of the liability  the estimated cost of an asset retirement obligation is capitalized and depreciated over the remaining life of the asset 
any income effects are offset by regulatory accounting pursuant to sfas no 
legal liability wolf creek on january   we recognized the liability for our share of the estimated cost to decommission wolf creek 
sfas no 
requires the recognition of the present value of the asset retirement obligation we incurred at the time wolf creek was placed into service in on january   we recorded an asset retirement obligation of million 
in addition  we increased our property and equipment balance  net of accumulated depreciation  by million 
we also established a regulatory asset for million  which represents the accretion of the liability since and the increased depreciation expense associated with the increase in plant 
the asset retirement obligation is included on our consolidated balance sheets in other long term liabilities 
costs to retire wolf creek are currently being recovered through rates as provided by the kcc 
non legal liability cost of removal we have recovered amounts in rates to provide for recovery of the probable costs of removing utility plant assets  but which do not represent legal retirement obligations 
the amounts recovered were included as a component of depreciation expense in accordance with the ferc and kcc required ratemaking treatment 
with the adoption of sfas no 
we were required to quantify the net cost of removal included in accumulated depreciation 
at december   we had million included in accumulated depreciation that has been reclassified to other assets 
at december   we had million in removal costs that have been classified as a regulatory asset 
the net amount related to non legal retirement costs can fluctuate based on amounts related to removal costs recovered compared to removal costs incurred 
therefore  if in the future we recover removal costs in excess of amounts incurred we will recognize a regulatory liability for that amount 
we do not anticipate that the adoption of sfas no 
will have any impact on our electric rates

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk hedging activity we use financial and physical instruments to hedge a portion of our anticipated fossil fuel needs 
at the time we enter into these transactions  we are unable to determine what the value will be when the agreements are actually settled 
in an effort to mitigate fuel commodity price market risk  we use hedging arrangements to reduce our exposure to increased coal  natural gas and oil prices 
our future exposure to changes in fossil fuel prices will be dependent on the market prices and the extent and effectiveness of any hedging arrangements into which we enter 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  financial instruments  energy trading and risk management derivative instruments and hedge accounting hedging activities  for detailed information regarding hedging relationships and an interest rate swap we entered into during the third quarter of market price risks our hedging and trading activities involve risks  including commodity price risk  equity price risk  interest rate risk and credit risk 
commodity price risk is the risk that changes in commodity prices may impact the price at which we are able to buy and sell electricity and purchase fuels for our generating units 
these commodities have experienced price volatility in the past and can be expected to do so in the future 
this volatility may increase or decrease future earnings 
equity price risk represents the risk we may be exposed to based on changes in the market value of our equity securities 

table of contents interest rate risk represents the risk of loss associated with movements in market interest rates 
in the future  we may continue to use swaps or other financial instruments to manage interest rate risk 
credit risk represents the risk of loss resulting from non performance by a counterparty of its contractual obligations 
we have exposure to credit risk and counterparty default through our retail  energy marketing and trading activities 
we maintain credit policies intended to reduce overall credit risk  and we actively monitor these policies to reflect changes and scope of operations 
we employ additional credit risk control mechanisms when appropriate  such as letters of credit  parental guarantees and standardized master netting agreements from counterparties that allow for some of the offsetting of positive and negative exposures 
credit exposure is monitored and  when necessary  the activity with a specific counterparty is limited until credit enhancement is provided 
results actually achieved from hedging and trading activities could vary materially from intended results and could materially affect our consolidated financial results depending on the success of our credit risk management efforts 
commodity price exposure we engage in both financial and physical trading to manage our commodity price risk 
we trade electricity  coal  natural gas and oil for the benefit of our regulated operations and our power marketing activities 
we use a variety of financial instruments  including forward contracts  options and swaps and trade energy commodity contracts daily 
we also use hedging techniques to manage overall fuel expenditures 
we procure physical product under fixed price agreements and spot market transactions 
we are involved in trading activities primarily to reduce risk from market fluctuations and enhance system reliability 
net open positions exist  or are established  due to the origination of new transactions and our assessment of  and response to  changing market conditions 
to the extent we have open positions  we are exposed to the risk that changing market prices could have a material  adverse impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
we manage and measure the market price risk exposure of our trading portfolio using a variance covariance value at risk var model 
var is designed to measure the predicted worst case loss at a specific confidence level over a specified period of time 
in addition to var  we employ additional risk control processes such as stress testing  daily loss limits  and commodity position limits 
we expect to use the same var model and control processes in the use of the var method requires a number of key assumptions  including the selection of a confidence level for losses and the estimated holding period 
we express var as a potential dollar loss based on a confidence level using a one day holding period 
the calculation includes derivative commodity instruments used for both trading and risk management purposes 
the var amounts for and were as follows in thousands high low average we have considered a number of risks and costs associated with the future contractual commitments included in our energy portfolio 
these risks include credit risks associated with the financial condition of counterparties  product location basis differentials and other risks 
declines in the creditworthiness of our counterparties could have a material adverse impact on our overall exposure to credit risk 
we maintain credit policies with regard to our counterparties that  in management s view  reduce our overall credit risk 
there can be no assurance that the employment of var  or other risk management tools we employ  will eliminate the risk of loss 
we are also exposed to commodity price changes outside of trading activities 
we use derivative contracts for non trading purposes and a mix of various fuel types primarily to reduce exposure relative to the volatility of market and commodity prices 
the wholesale power market is extremely volatile in price and supply 
this volatility impacts our costs of power purchased and our participation in energy trades 
if we were unable to generate an 
table of contents adequate supply of electricity for our retail customers  we would purchase power in the wholesale market to the extent it is available  subject to possible transmission constraints  and or implement curtailment or interruption procedures as allowed for in our tariffs and terms and conditions of service 
the increased expenses or loss of revenues associated with this could be material and adverse to our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
from to  we experienced an increase in the average price per mwh of electricity purchased for utility operations 
purchased power market volatility could be greater than the average price increase indicates 
additionally  short term  but extreme price volatility could potentially be of greater significance than the change in the average price would indicate  especially during adverse weather or market conditions 
if we were to have a increase in our purchased power price from to  given the amount of power purchased for utility operations during  we would have exposure of approximately million of operating income 
due to the volatility of the power market  past prices cannot be used to predict future prices 
we use various fossil fuel types  including coal  natural gas and oil  to operate our system 
a significant portion of our coal requirements are purchased under long term contracts 
during  we experienced an approximate increase  or per mmbtu  in our average cost for natural gas purchased for utility operations 
due to this substantial increase in natural gas cost  we decreased our natural gas usage by million mmbtu compared to the amount burned in due to the volatility of natural gas prices  we have begun to increasingly utilize our ability to switch to lower cost fuel types as the market allows  primarily by using oil in our natural gas burning facilities 
during  we increased our oil usage by million mmbtu compared to the amount burned in although the average cost for oil purchased for utility operations increased per mmbtu  or approximately  compared to the average cost in  it was per mmbtu cheaper than the average cost of the natural gas we burned 
we use uranium to fuel our nuclear generating station and have on hand or under contract of wolf creek s uranium needs and of their uranium conversion needs for in addition  of the uranium and of the uranium conversion required for operation of wolf creek through october is under contract 
the balance of the uranium requirements is expected to be purchased on the secondary spot market  which means we will be exposed to the price risk associated with these components 
additional factors that affect our commodity price exposure are the quantity and availability of fuel used for generation and the quantity of electricity customers consume 
quantities of fossil fuel used for generation vary from year to year based on the availability  price and deliverability of a given fuel type as well as planned and scheduled outages at our facilities that use fossil fuels and the nuclear refueling schedule 
our customers electricity usage could also vary from year to year based on the weather or other factors 
interest rate exposure we had approximately million of variable rate debt and current maturities of fixed rate debt as of december  a basis point change in each debt series benchmark rate  used to set the rate for such series would impact net income on an annualized basis by approximately million
