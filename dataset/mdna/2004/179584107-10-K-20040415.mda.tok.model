table of contents overview and consolidated operations we are a leading specialty retailer of value priced fashion accessories and jewelry for pre teens and teenagers as well as young adults 
we are primarily organized based on our geographic markets  which include our north american operations and our international operations 
as of march  we operated a total of  stores in all states of the united states  puerto rico  canada  the virgin islands  the united kingdom  switzerland  austria  germany  or sag  france  ireland and japan 
the stores are operated mainly under the trade names claire s boutiques  claire s accessories  icing by claire s  afterthoughts and the icing 
we are in the process of transitioning our afterthoughts stores to icing by claire s stores to capitalize on the claire s brand name 
we have two store concepts claire s accessories  which caters to fashion conscious girls and teens in the to age range  and icing by claire s  which caters to fashion conscious teens and young women in the to age range 
our merchandise typically ranges in price between and  with the average product priced at about our stores share a similar format and our different store concepts and trade names allow us to have multiple store locations in a single mall 
although we face competition from a number of small specialty store chains and others selling fashion accessories  we believe that our stores comprise the largest and are among the most successful chain of specialty retail stores in the world  devoted to the sale of value priced fashion accessories for pre teen  teenage and young adult females 
fundamentally  our business model is to offer the customer a compelling price value relationship and a wide array of products to choose from 
we seek to deliver a high level of profitability and cash flow by maximizing the effectiveness of our retail product pricing through promotional activity minimizing our product costs through economies of scale as the world s leading mall based retailer of value priced accessories and jewelry reinvesting operating cash flows into opening new stores  remodeling existing stores and infrastructure in order to create future revenues and build brand name loyalty returning profits to shareholders through dividends and increased share price while our financial results have grown steadily and record sales performance was achieved during fiscal  the retail environment remains very competitive 
management s plan for future growth is dependent on our ability to successfully identify merchandise appealing to our customers displaying our merchandise at convenient  accessible locations staffed with personnel that provide courteous and professional customer service sourcing our merchandise to achieve a positive value price relationship increasing sales at existing store locations expanding our sales  especially in our international segment  through additional store locations our ability to achieve these objectives will be dependent on various factors  including those outlined in cautionary note regarding forward looking statements and risk factors 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements requires us to estimate the effect of various matters that are inherently uncertain as of the date of the financial statements 
each of these required estimates varies in regard to the level of judgment involved and its potential impact on our reported financial results 
estimates are deemed critical when a different estimate could have reasonably been used or where changes in the estimate are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  and would materially impact our financial condition  changes in financial condition  or results of operations 
our significant accounting policies are discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  critical estimates inherent in these accounting policies are discussed in the following paragraphs 
inventory valuation our inventories in north america and sag are valued at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined using the retail method 
inherent in the retail inventory calculation are certain significant management judgments and estimates including  among others  merchandise markups  markdowns and shrinkage  which impact the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as resulting gross margins 
the methodologies used to value merchandise inventories include the development of the cost to retail ratios  the groupings of homogeneous classes of merchandise  development of shrinkage reserves and the accounting for retail price changes 
the inventories in our united kingdom  irish and french stores are accounted for under the lower of cost or market method  with cost determined using the average cost method 
inventory valuation is impacted by the estimation of slow moving goods  shrinkage and markdowns 
valuation of long lived assets we evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that a potential impairment has occurred 
a potential impairment has occurred if the projected future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the assets 
the estimate of cash flows includes management s assumptions of cash inflows and outflows directly resulting from the use of the asset in operations 
when a potential impairment has occurred  an impairment charge is recorded if the carrying value of the long lived asset exceeds its fair value 
fair value is measured based on a projected discounted cash flow model using a discount rate we feel is commensurate with the risk inherent in our business 
our impairment analyses contain estimates due to the inherently judgmental nature of forecasting long term estimated cash flows and determining the ultimate useful lives of assets 
actual results may differ  which could materially impact our impairment assessment 
during fiscal  we recorded impairment charges of million relating to fixed assets in our international segment due to those assets not being recoverable by estimated discounted cash flows 
we recorded no impairment during fiscal goodwill impairment we continually evaluate whether events and changes in circumstances warrant revised estimates of the useful lives or recognition of an impairment loss of unamortized goodwill 
the conditions that would trigger an impairment assessment of unamortized goodwill include a significant  sustained negative trend in our operating results or cash flows  a decrease in demand for our products  a change in the competitive environment and other industry and economic factors 
we measure impairment of unamortized goodwill utilizing the discounted cash flow method 
the estimated discounted cash flows are then compared to our goodwill amounts 
if the unamortized balance of the goodwill exceeds the estimated discounted cash flows  the excess of the unamortized balance is written off 
future cash flows may not meet projected amounts  which could result in impairment 
we performed these analyses during fiscal and and no impairment was recorded 

table of contents intangible asset impairment we continually evaluate whether events and changes in circumstances warrant revised estimates of the useful lives or recognition of an impairment loss for intangible assets 
future adverse changes in market and legal conditions  or poor operating results of underlying assets could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the intangible asset  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
the company has concluded that certain intangible assets  comprised primarily of lease rights  qualify as indefinite life intangible assets 
fair market value of the lease rights was determined through the use of third party valuation 
in addition  we make investments through our international subsidiaries in intangible assets upon the opening and acquisition of many of our store locations in europe 
these other intangible assets  which are subject to amortization  are amortized over the useful lives of the respective leases  not to exceed years 
we evaluate the market value of these assets periodically and record the impairment charge when we believe the asset has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
we recorded impairment charges of approximately million in fiscal because the market value of certain lease rights included in our international segment were determined to be less than their carrying values 
we recorded no impairment during fiscal income taxes we are subject to income taxes in many jurisdictions  including the us  individual states and localities and abroad 
we must first determine which revenues and expenses should be included in each taxing jurisdiction 
this process involves the estimation of our actual current tax exposure  together with the assessment of temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of income or expense items for tax and accounting purposes 
we establish deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of these temporary differences 
if we adjust our estimates in the future such that we would not expect to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets  we may need to establish  or adjust a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets  which could also materially affect our effective tax rate 
we establish tax reserves in our consolidated financial statements based on our estimation of current tax exposures 
if we prevail in tax matters for which reserves have been established or we are required to settle matters in excess of established reserves  our effective tax rate for a particular period could be materially affected 
income tax expense also reflects our best estimate and assumptions regarding  among other things  the level of future taxable income  interpretation of tax laws  and tax planning 
future changes in tax laws  changes in projected levels of taxable income and tax planning could affect the effective tax rate and tax balances recorded by us 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
although management believes that the estimates discussed above are reasonable and the related calculations conform to generally accepted accounting principles  actual results could differ from these estimates  and such differences could be material 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to them 

table of contents overall  our operating results for fiscal were a record in terms of sales and profitability 
a summary of our consolidated results of operations is as follows dollars in thousands  except per share data fiscal year net sales comparable store sales gross profit percentage selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales income from continuing operations net income income from continuing operations per diluted share number of stores at the end of the period excludes claire s nippon results of consolidated operations net sales in fiscal increased by million  or  from fiscal  which in turn was million  or higher than fiscal the increase in net sales was primarily attributable to comparable store sales increases of and during fiscal and fiscal  respectively  new stores opened in our international division which produced higher average store sales than the stores we closed in our north american division  and the effects of the weak us dollar when translating our foreign operations at higher exchange rates 
the positive comparable sales experienced in our north american division were across most merchandise categories  most notably in the jewelry related areas 
we believe we experienced this trend through successfully meeting our customers demand for current fashion trends in jewelry and superior customer service in our stores 
we noted a deterioration of comparable sales during the second half of fiscal within our international division  while comparable sales in north america continued the positive trends experienced throughout the year 
we are actively employing strategic initiatives in an attempt to reverse the negative comparable store sales trend in our international division 
these initiatives include sharing best practices employed in our north american division for merchandise selection  store operations and attentive customer service 
the following table compares our sales of each product category for the last three fiscal years dollars in thousands fiscal year ended jan 
 feb 
 feb 
 jewelry accessories gross profit percentages increased by basis points and basis points during fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the increase during fiscal was caused primarily by improved merchandise margins relating to the shift in business from accessories to jewelry  as jewelry carries a higher initial markup and profit margin than that of accessories 
in addition  comparable sales increased at a rate faster than the increase in our occupancy related costs  creating positive leverage on those costs 
the increased gross profit percentages during fiscal were the result of improved merchandise margins made possible through reduced promotional activity and markdowns during the year due to managing inventories more efficiently than the prior year 

table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses increased million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
these increases are primarily attributable to the increases in compensation paid to store personnel due to average wage increases and additional hours worked in our north american stores and the effects of the weak us dollar when translating our foreign operations at higher exchange rates 
additional hours worked in the north american stores were necessary to achieve the resulting positive comparable store sales experienced during these periods 
in addition  during fiscal  increased store  field and corporate bonuses were earned in north america due to the positive comparable store sales and profit results during the period 
we also recorded a charge of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal related to the retirement compensation package of our founder and former chairman of the board 
as a percentage of sales  however  selling  general and administrative expenses improved by basis points and basis points during fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
this improvement was primarily due to comparable store increases greater than the overall increases in the underlying expenses 
income taxes for fiscal includes the benefit of approximately million attributable to recently concluded tax examinations that were settled more favorably than anticipated 
our tax rate in future years will depend on several variables  including the mix of earnings between domestic and international operations and our overall level of earnings  and could also be affected by the resolution of tax contingencies for amounts different from our current estimates 
income from continuing operations increased by approximately million during each of fiscal and fiscal these increases were made possible primarily by the increase in comparable store sales and improved merchandise margins achieved during the period  as well as the leverage attained on our fixed costs 
net income for fiscal includes approximately million after tax loss from the discontinuation of our mr 
rags apparel stores 
we sold mr 
rags in fiscal  please refer to note to our consolidated financial statements for further information 
seasonality and quarterly results our business is seasonal by nature  with the christmas  easter and back to school periods historically accounting for the largest percentage of annual net sales 
in fiscal  the christmas  easter and back to school periods together accounted for approximately of our annual net sales 
see note of our consolidated financial statements for our quarterly results of operations 
impact of inflation inflation impacts several of our operating costs including  but not limited to cost of goods and supplies  occupancy costs and labor expenses 
we seek to mitigate these effects by passing along inflationary increases in costs through increased sales prices of our products or by increasing sales volumes 
matters affecting comparability included within interest and other income during fiscal is approximately million of income recognized on our investment in claire s nippon 
we recorded no income during fiscal and fiscal as our portion of losses incurred by claire s nippon were in excess of our investment and advances 
under the equity method of accounting  those losses would not be reflected in our financial statements once our investment and advances were reduced to zero 
store counts for the three years included in the tables above and below exclude claire s nippon stores 
we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets in the beginning of fiscal sfas requires that goodwill and certain other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives are no longer amortized but are reviewed annually for impairment 
had the provision of sfas been applicable to fiscal  income from continuing operations would have been 
as compared to 
per diluted share 
refer to note to our consolidated financial statements for further information 

table of contents foreign currency movements within our international division increased net sales by million and million and income from continuing operations by million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
these increases were due primarily to the further weakening of the us dollar against the euro and the british pound during fiscal these items had a significant impact on continuing operations in the periods reported 
we believe that an understanding of our reported results and our ongoing financial performance is not complete without considering the impact of these items and other transactions  as described within management s discussion and analysis 
segment operations we are organized into two business segments north america and international 
following is a discussion of results of operations by business segment 
north america key statistics and results of operations for our north american division are as follows dollars in thousands fiscal year net sales comparable store sales gross profit percentage number of stores at the end of the period it is our objective to increase sales in north america primarily through generating comparable store sales increases and also by increasing our quantity of profitable store locations 
net sales in north america during fiscal increased by million  or  from fiscal  which in turn was million  or higher than fiscal the increase in net sales was primarily attributable to comparable store sales increases of and during fiscal and fiscal  respectively  partially offset by a decrease of and stores during the respective periods 
we acquired afterthoughts stores in december since that time  it has been our objective to close  or not renew  a number of under performing or duplicative stores  and to re name  upon lease renewal or landlord approval  the remaining afterthoughts stores to icing by claire s in order to capitalize on the claire s brand 
since we acquired the afterthoughts stores  have been closed or not renewed and have been renamed to either claire s or icing by claire s 
we believe that the re naming of these stores has contributed to the comparable store increases experienced during fiscal  and we plan to continue to re name the remaining stores upon lease renewal or as landlords permit 
the positive comparable sales experienced in north america were across most merchandise categories  most notably in the jewelry related areas 
we believe we experienced this trend through successfully meeting our customers demand for current fashion trends in jewelry and superior customer service in our stores 
in addition  best practices in merchandise buying  planning and allocation from claire s have been shared with the icing by claire s and afterthoughts stores  which we believe have contributed significantly to the comparable store sales increases experienced during fiscal the higher concentration of sales in jewelry as compared to accessories experienced during fiscal has had the result of improved gross profit percentages due to the higher initial markup realized on jewelry 
the increased gross profit percentages during fiscal were the result of improved merchandise margins made possible through reduced promotional activity and markdowns during the year as a result of managing inventories more efficiently than the prior year 

table of contents international division key statistics and results of operations for our international division are as follows dollars in thousands fiscal year net sales comparable store sales gross profit percentage number of stores at the end of the period it is our objective to increase sales in the international division primarily through store growth and also through comparable store sales increases 
we also continue to explore adding operations in countries in which we do not currently operate 
net sales in our international division during fiscal increased by million  or  from fiscal  which in turn was million  or higher than fiscal the increase in net sales during fiscal was primarily attributable to the net addition of stores  the effects of the weak us dollar when translating our foreign operations at higher exchange rates of approximately million  offset by comparable store sales decreases of during the period 
we believe that the deterioration of comparable store sales during fiscal was caused both by the difficult economic environments in several european countries for which we have store locations and also the deviation from best practices learned and practiced in north america 
we are actively employing strategic initiatives in an attempt to reverse the negative comparable store sales trend in our international division 
these initiatives include sharing best practices for merchandise selection  store operations and attentive customer service 
in addition  investment in operational systems infrastructure is being made in order to facilitate the greater level of complexity and precision now required of the business 
the increase in net sales during fiscal was primarily attributable to the net addition of stores  the effects of the weak us dollar when translating our foreign operations at higher exchange rates  and by comparable store sales increases of during the period 
the increase in comparable store sales during fiscal was primarily attributable to more units per customer and higher average transaction amounts  offset by a lower number of total transactions 
gross profit percentages improved by basis points in fiscal and by basis points in fiscal the primary source of this improvement during both fiscal years was the ability of our international division to source a significant portion of goods at a lower cost due to those goods being purchased from our vendors in us dollars 
the lower cost was available due to the weakness in the us dollar as compared to the british pound and the euro 
most of the goods sourced for sale in our international division are purchased in us dollars 
analysis of consolidated financial condition a summary of cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities is outlined in the table below dollars in thousands fiscal year ended january  february  february  operating activities investing activities financing activities 
table of contents we have consistently satisfied operating liquidity needs and planned capital expenditure programs through our normal conversion of sales to cash 
over the three years ended in fiscal  we generated over million of cash flows from operating activities from continuing operations 
we ended the year with approximately million in cash and cash equivalents  an increase of million from the prior year 
we ended the year with no debt outstanding  a reduction of million from the prior year 
the increase in cash and cash equivalents was due to cash generated from operations  offset by the repayment of debt  capital expenditures and the payment of dividends 
our major source of cash from operations is store sales  nearly all of which are generated on a cash or credit card basis 
our primary outflow of cash from operations is the purchase of inventory  net of customary credit arrangements with vendors  operational costs  the payment of current taxes and capital expenditures 
cash flows provided by operating activities in fiscal reflect higher net income as compared to fiscal due to changes in working capital and depreciation 
working capital at the end of fiscal was million compared to million at the end of fiscal changes in working capital reflect higher accounts payable  which is due to the timing of inventory payments and increased accrued expenses  which reflects the increased bonuses earned by store  field and corporate employees that were not yet paid at the end of the year 
in addition  accrued expenses include the retirement compensation package granted to our founder and former chairman of the board in the fourth quarter of fiscal our million of capital expenditures were made primarily to remodel existing stores  but also to open new stores 
we generally experience a noticeable increase in sales in locations where a store has been recently remodeled 
we also invested approximately million in intangible assets within our international division which generally represents acquired lease rights on new store locations in certain countries 
we expect to fund between million and million of capital expenditures and million to million of purchased lease rights in fiscal in an effort to continue to expand and remodel our store base 
as a result of our million in debt repayments made during fiscal  we have no borrowed debt at january  this represents a milestone to us as the debt was originally incurred in fiscal in connection with the acquisition of the afterthoughts stores 
we also paid dividends of million during fiscal  an increase of approximately million from the prior year 
dividends were increased again at the end of fiscal  so we now expect to pay at least million in dividends in fiscal we also received proceeds from the exercise of stock options of approximately million  most of which was in connection with the retirement of our founder and former chairman of the board 
liquidity and capital resources we entered into a new credit facility in march this credit facility is a revolving line of credit of up to million  is secured by inventory in the united states and is due to expire march  the borrowings under this facility are limited based on certain calculations of availability  based primarily on the amount of inventory on hand in the united states 
at march   the entire amount of million would have been available for borrowing by us  subject to reduction for million of outstanding letters of credit 
the credit facility is cancelable by us without penalty and bears interest at an initial margin of basis points over the london interbank borrowing rate libor 
the margin is then adjusted periodically based on certain liquidity measurements 
the credit facility also contains other restrictive covenants which limit  among other things  our ability to make dividend distributions 
this credit facility replaced our prior credit facility  which included a million revolving line of credit and a million five year term loan 
on january  no borrowings were outstanding under our prior credit facility and we were in compliance with all debt covenants 

table of contents our non us subsidiaries have credit facilities totaling approximately  with banks 
the facilities are used for working capital requirements  letters of credit and various guarantees 
these credit facilities have been arranged in accordance with customary lending practices in their respective countries of operation 
at january   there were no borrowings under these credit facilities 
management believes that our present ability to borrow is greater than our established credit lines 
however  if market conditions change and sales were to dramatically decline or we could not control operating costs or other expenses  our cash flows and liquidity could be reduced  and we could experience an increase in borrowing costs  or even a reduction in or elimination of our access to debt and or equity markets 
contractual obligations at january   we remain as a guarantor on real estate leases for mr 
rags store locations with future rental payments of approximately million 
at january   we also had a contingent liability as lessee under a master lease agreement on million of gross future lease payments for operating leases of equipment and leasehold improvements of mr 
rags that were assigned to mr 
rags at the time of the sale 
based on the bankruptcy filing by lux corp 
in january and the related impact on mr 
rags ability to fulfill the commitments under these real estate and operating leases  we accrued a liability of million at february   of which million remains accrued at january  we finance certain leasehold improvements and equipment used in our stores through transactions accounted for as non cancelable operating leases 
as a result  the rental expense for these leasehold improvements and equipment is recorded during the term of the lease contract in our consolidated financial statements  generally over four to seven years 
in the event that any of the real property leases where leasehold improvements or equipment are located that are subject to these non cancelable operating leases are terminated by us or our landlord prior to the scheduled expiration date of the real property lease  we will be required to accrue all future rent payments under these operating leases 
at january   we had  accrued related to future payment obligations on leasehold improvement leases for closed stores 
as of january   our future financial commitments under these arrangements were as follows payments due by period contractual obligations less than more than in millions total year years years years real estate obligations operating leases for equipment and leasehold improvements letters of credit total 
table of contents recent accounting pronouncements in january  the financial accounting standards board  fasb issued interpretation no 
consolidation of variable interest entities 
the interpretation defines a variable interest entity as a corporation  partnership  trust or any other legal structure used for business purposes that either a does not have equity investors with voting rights or b has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the equity to support its activities 
a variable interest entity often holds financial assets  including loans or receivables  real estate or other property 
a variable interest entity may be essentially passive or it may engage in research and development or other activities on behalf of another company 
this interpretation requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns or both 
we would have to consolidate any of our variable interest entities that meet the above criteria as of july  the interpretation also requires disclosures about variable interest entities that we are not required to consolidate but in which we have a significant variable interest 
we have determined that none of our interests in unconsolidated entities qualify as variable interest entities 
in december  the fasb issued interpretation no 
revised december  consolidation of variable interest entities fin r  which replaced fin fin r addresses how a business enterprise should evaluate whether it has a controlling interest in an entity through means other than voting rights 
this interpretation requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or is entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns or both 
the interpretation also requires disclosures about variable interest entities that we are not required to consolidate but in which we have a significant variable interest 
we are required to adopt fin r by the end of the first reporting period ending after march  we have completed our initial evaluation of fin r  and have concluded that adoption of fin r is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
cautionary note regarding forward looking statements and risk factors the private securities litigation reform act of  or the act  provides a safe harbor for forward looking statements made by or on our behalf 
we and our representatives may from time to time make written or verbal forward looking statements  including statements contained in this and other filings with the securities and exchange commission and in our press releases and reports to shareholders 
all statements which address operating performance  events or developments that we expect or anticipate will occur in the future  including statements relating to our future financial performance  planned capital expenditures and new store openings for fiscal  are forward looking statements within the meaning of the act and as defined in section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
the forward looking statements are and will be based on management s then current views and assumptions regarding future events and operating performance and we assume no obligation to update any forward looking statement 
forward looking statements involve known or unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors  including changes in estimates and judgments discussed under critical accounting policies and estimates which may cause our actual results  performance or achievements  or industry results to be materially different from any future results  performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 

table of contents we believe that the following factors  among others  that are specific to our business  could cause or contribute to our actual results  performance or achievements differing from the future results  performance or achievements expressed or implied in our forward looking statements inability to respond to emerging fashion trends including decreased demand for jewelry changes in customer preference after merchandise has been purchased by us  which could result in markdowns of our sales prices inability to adequately stock inventory to meet demand inability to execute our international expansion or successfully integrate our international operations inability to increase comparable store sales at recent historical rates loss of one or more members of our senior management team disruption in the operation of our north american or international distribution centers inability to negotiate favorable lease terms for new leases or renewal leases changes in tax rules or regulations applicable to us adverse determinations on litigation matters not covered by insurance we believe that the following factors  among others  that are general to our business  could cause or contribute to our actual results  performance or achievements differing from the future results  performance or achievements expressed or implied in our forward looking statements changes in economic conditions  including  but not limited to  recessionary or inflationary trends  increased gasoline prices affecting travel to our retail locations  and overall consumer confidence potential new competition from both retail stores and alternative methods or channels of distribution changes in the cost or availability of a suitable workforce to manage and support our operating strategies potential tariffs imposed on products that we import fluctuation of the us dollar against foreign currencies adjustments to the exchange rate of the chinese yuan from a fixed exchange rate against the us dollar to a flexible exchange rate which would cause our cost of merchandise imported from china to fluctuate terrorist activities in the us  as well as the international war on terrorism disruption of international  national or regional transportation systems  including dock strikes or increased security measures lack of availability or access to sources of inventory 
table of contents imposition of new restrictions or regulations regarding importation of our merchandise or on the composition of the merchandise that we sell occurrence of severe weather events or natural disasters  which could significantly damage or destroy retail locations or prohibit customers from traveling to our retail locations  especially during peak holiday seasons increases in ocean freight rates inability to timely receive asian shipments due to the potential emergence of a disease item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency we are exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on the us dollar value of foreign currency denominated transactions and our investment in foreign subsidiaries 
we manage this exposure to market risk through our regular operating and financing activities  and foreign currency options 
exposure to market risk for changes in foreign exchange rates relates primarily to foreign operations buying  selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries 
we manage our exposure to foreign exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying  selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by using foreign currency options from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure 
at january   we had entered into foreign currency options with notional amounts of million  which are accounted for as cash flow hedges 
we do not generally hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries  since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries 
during fiscal  included in comprehensive income and stockholders equity is million reflecting the unrealized gain on foreign currency translation 
based on our average net currency positions in fiscal  the potential gain or loss due to a adverse change on foreign currency exchange rates could be significant to our operations 
as of the date of this filing  there has been significant speculation that china may elect to adjust the exchange rate of the chinese yuan against the us dollar 
while there have been no official decisions made  or timetables established  current press reports indicate that it is possible that some form of re evaluation is likely in fiscal currently  the chinese yuan has a fixed exchange rate against the us dollar 
if china adjusts the exchange rate or allows the value to float  we may experience changes in our cost of merchandise imported from china 
see notes to our consolidated financial statements 
interest rates our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates is limited to our cash  cash equivalents and debt 
based on our average invested cash balances and outstanding debt during fiscal  a increase in the average effective interest rate in fiscal would not have materially impacted our annual interest income or expense
