item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies our timely preparation of financial reports and related disclosures requires us to use estimates and assumptions that may cause actual results to be materially different from our estimated results 
specifically  we use estimates when accounting for depreciation  amortization  cost per copy contract contingencies  useful lives for intangible assets  and asset valuation allowances including those for bad debts  inventory  and deferred income tax asset valuation allowances 
our most critical accounting policies include the following contract contingencies our office products business  which we sold in september  leased equipment usually for a sixty month period to countywide education systems and sold the lease to third party leasing companies 
under this program the school system was billed on a monthly  quarterly or annual basis at a specified rate for each copy they make 
the cost per copy charged to the school system was designed to cover the equipment cost  supplies except for paper and staples  service  and a finance charge 
prior to the sale of the office products business  on a quarterly basis  on a program by program basis  we projected an expected outcome over the life of the program 
we used historical copy usage to predict the number of copies to be made over the remaining life of the program 
we adjusted this estimate of the number of expected future copies based on known factors that would influence copy rates in each program 
we used historical service and supply costs incurred on each program to estimate future service and supply costs on a per copy basis 
we adjusted these estimated costs for known factors that would impact service and supplies in the future 
we also estimated any other costs expected to be incurred such as depreciation on rental equipment 
on programs where the sum of the estimated future costs exceeded the expected future revenue  we recognized a provision for of the expected losses for these programs 
intangible assets we determine the utility of goodwill and trademarks based on estimated future cash flows and test for impairment in accordance with applicable accounting pronouncements 
we estimate future cash flows based on historical performance and our knowledge of known factors likely to impact future cash flows 
inventories inventories are recorded at the lower of cost or market value 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on our estimated forecast and demand requirements for the next twelve months 
actual demand and market conditions may be different from those projected by our management 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue under our current boot contract when the boots are inspected and accepted by the government s quality assurance representative qar  thereby transferring ownership to the government 
pursuant to the contract  the boots become government owned property after inspection and acceptance by the qar 
the boots are transferred and stored in our warehouse  which is a designated storage facility approved by the government  and accounted for as bill and hold sales in accordance with securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves us estimating our actual current exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as leasing activity  allowances  and depreciation  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance  which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations

weak demand for western and work boots partially offset this surge in net revenues as net revenues for this business declined by approximately million over the results posted for fiscal consolidated gross profit from continuing operations for fiscal amounted to million  up from for fiscal this growth in gross profit was primarily the result of increased net revenues 
as a percentage of net revenues  gross profit decreased from for fiscal to for fiscal primarily attributable to lower margins in the military boot business  which accounted for approximately of the overall sales mix

net revenues for the bar code business increased from million for fiscal to million for fiscal primarily as a result of improvement in the market for bar code products 
we expect revenues to continue to grow in fiscal with continued improvement in the bar code market and the introduction of a new bar code product in the second quarter of fiscal gross profit for the bar code business grew from million for fiscal to million for fiscal as a result of increased sales and improved profit margin 
gross profit as a percentage of net revenues was for fiscal as compared to for fiscal this improvement in gross profit percentage was primarily the result of increased sales of higher margin manufactured products in the overall bar code sales mix 
sg a and r d expenditures amounted to million for fiscal as compared to million for fiscal r d costs were up approximately  as efforts to complete development of the new bar code product intensified 
sg a expenses for sales salaries and commissions  marketing activities  travel costs  postage  and depreciation were lower as a result of effective cost containment measures

military boot sales to the government were million for fiscal as compared to million for fiscal the increase in net revenues for fiscal was partially offset by reduced foreign and commercial military boot sales 
gross profit grew from million for fiscal to million for fiscal primarily due to the increase in net revenues 
in august  the government approved an economic price adjustment for increased material costs based on a change in cost estimates from a contract in prior years  which contributed approximately  to the increase in gross profit 
as a percentage of net revenues  gross profit fell from for fiscal to for fiscal this decline in gross profit percentage was primarily the result of lower per unit selling prices and higher per unit manufacturing costs associated with training new production workers  higher subcontract costs  and difficulties encountered in producing multiple boot constructions 
sg a expenses for fiscal amounted to million as compared to million for fiscal this increase in sg a expenses was primarily the result of higher group health insurance costs  professional fees  and employee benefit expenses 
as a result of the above  operating profit for fiscal totaled million as compared to million for fiscal on september   the government notified us that we had been awarded a new contract the contract to produce direct molded sole military combat boots 
on september   the government exercised the first year option  which provides for a minimum and a maximum boot requirement of  pair and  pair  respectively 
the second year option ranges from a minimum of  pair to a maximum of  pair 
during the third quarter of fiscal  the us army changed its type i and type ii black desert hot weather boot specification from a single vulcanized outsole to a three layer outsole design 
this three layer outsole design can be made with our vulcanizing equipment 
our current contract with the government was modified to incorporate this new three layer outsole and we have produced boots that meet the new specifications 
we have been advised that the future option quantities against this contract  if they are invoked  will require this new design because this new three layer outsole construction is well liked and accepted by our troops 
our contracts with the government are subject to partial or complete termination under certain specified circumstances including  but not limited to  the following for the convenience of the government  for the lack of funding  and for our actual or anticipated failure to perform our contractual obligations 
if a contract is partially or completely terminated for its convenience  the government is required to negotiate a settlement with us to cover costs already incurred 
we have never had a contract either partially or completely terminated

forward looking statements in addition to historical information  this annual report includes certain forward looking statements as such term is defined in section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of important factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those projected  estimated  assumed or anticipated in any such forward looking statements include the effect of competitive products and pricing  risks unique to selling goods to the government including variation in the government s requirements for our products and the government s ability to terminate its contracts with vendors  loss of key customers  acquisitions  supply interruptions  additional financing requirements  our expectations about future government orders for military boots  loss of key management personnel  our ability to successfully develop new products and services  and the effect of general economic conditions in our markets 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes related to the aggregate million lines of credit and a term loan through our military boot business the term loan through our wholly owned subsidiary  dan post boot company was paid off in september 
as of july   there was no outstanding indebtedness under the lines of credit and approximately  was outstanding on the term loan 
we do not buy or sell derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
borrowings under these credit facilities described above bear interest at rates based upon the prime rate or the prime rate less a margin of one half percent offered by the applicable lender 
we have not entered into any swap agreements or engaged in any other hedging activities with respect to this variable rate indebtedness 
a increase in the interest rates under these credit facilities would increase annual interest expense by approximately  assuming that our aggregate borrowings under the credit facilities averaged  during a fiscal year
