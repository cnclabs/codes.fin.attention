inventory levels increase in march through june in anticipation of the peak shipping season 
the majority of shipments are made between june and august and the majority of cash receipts are collected from august through october 
quarterly results may also be materially affected by the timing of acquisitions  the timing and magnitude of costs related to such acquisitions  variations in costs of products sold  the mix of products sold and general economic conditions

inflation has had and is expected to have only a minor effect on the company s operating results and its sources of liquidity 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k for certain unaudited consolidated quarterly financial data for and significant accounting policies the accounting and reporting policies of the company conform to gaap 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
a summary of all of the company s significant accounting policies can be found in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
the company believes the following accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements prepaid catalog costs and amortization the company accumulates all direct costs incurred in the development  production and circulation of catalogs on the consolidated balance sheets until the related catalog is mailed  at which time they are amortized into selling and administrative expense over the estimated sales realization cycle of one year  using the straight line method 
goodwill the company adopted sfas no 
 business combinations sfas as of july  sfas requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations 
sfas specifies criteria that intangible assets acquired in a business combination must meet to be recognized and reported separately from goodwill 
the company also adopted the provisions of sfas  effective january  under sfas  goodwill is no longer subject to amortization over its estimated useful life 
instead  sfas requires that goodwill be evaluated for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired  by applying a fair value based test and  if impairment occurs  the amount of impaired goodwill must be written off immediately 
the company evaluates goodwill for impairment based on the expected future cash flows or earnings projections 
goodwill is deemed impaired if the discounted cash flows or earnings projections generated do not substantiate the carrying value 
the estimation of such amounts requires significant management judgment with respect to revenue and expense growth rates  changes in working capital and selection of an appropriate discount rate  as applicable 
the use of different assumptions would increase or decrease discounted future operating cash flows or earnings projections and could  therefore  change impairment determination 
the company has evaluated its goodwill at december  and  and determined that there has been no impairment of goodwill 
defined benefit plans the company accounts for the benefits under its salaried and hourly defined benefit pension plans using actuarial methods required by sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions sfas 
this model uses an attribution approach that generally spreads individual events over the service lives of the employees in the plans 
examples of events are plan amendments and changes in actuarial assumptions such as discount rate  expected return on plan assets and rate of compensation increases 
the principle underlying the required attribution approach is that employees render service over their service lives on a relatively consistent basis and  therefore  the statement of earnings effects of pension benefits are earned in  and should be expensed in  the same pattern 
in calculating net periodic benefit cost and the related benefit obligation  the company is required to select certain actuarial assumptions 
these assumptions include discount rate  expected return on plan assets and rate of compensation increases 
the discount rate assumptions reflect the prevailing market rates for long term  high quality  fixed income debt instruments that  if the obligation was settled at the measurement date  would provide the necessary future cash flows to pay the benefit obligation when due 
the company uses long term historical actual return experience with consideration of the expected investment mix of the plans assets  as well as future estimates of long term investment returns to develop its assumptions of the expected return on plan assets 
the rate of compensation increases are based on historical experience and the company s long term plans for such increases 
in  a basis point decline in the discount rate assumptions caused a decline in the funded status of the company s salaried and hourly pension plans 
consequently  the company s accumulated benefit obligation for both plans exceeded the fair market value of the plan assets for these plans at december  as required by sfas  the company recorded a non cash  after tax  net charge of million to the consolidated statements of stockholders equity and comprehensive earnings in the fourth quarter of this charge did not impact the company s pension expense  earnings or cash contribution requirements in taxes at december   the consolidated balance sheet contains a net deferred tax asset of approximately million  net of a valuation allowance of approximately million  related primarily to federal net operating tax loss carryforwards 
during  the valuation allowance decreased million 
the realizability of this asset is dependent upon the company s generation of approximately million in future taxable income and the ability to retain its federal net operating tax loss carryforward position 
as of december   the company had federal net operating tax loss carryforwards of approximately million 
based upon projected future operating results  federal net operating tax loss carryforwards of million are expected to be utilized to offset future federal taxable income through the remaining million of federal net operating tax loss carryforwards are expected to expire unused 
however  events may limit the use of all or a portion of these federal net operating tax loss carryforwards  thus potentially resulting in a higher tax liability for the company in the future 
the net deferred tax asset  including the valuation allowance  at december  is subject to future adjustment based upon changes in management s evaluation of the realizability of the deferred tax asset 
revenues customarily applying fob shipping point terms  the company recognizes revenue upon shipment of products to its customer  which corresponds to the time when risk of ownership transfers 
the point of shipment is typically from one of the distribution centers or  on occasion  a vendor s location as a drop shipment 
all drop shipment sales are recorded at gross selling price 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas 
sfas requires the company to record the fair value of an asset retirement obligation as a liability in the period in which it incurs a legal obligation associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets that result from the acquisition  construction  development and or normal use of the assets 
the company also records a corresponding asset that is depreciated over the life of the asset 
subsequent to the initial measurement of the asset retirement obligation  the obligation will be adjusted at the end of each period to reflect the passage of time and changes in the estimated future cash flows underlying the obligation

 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
sfas requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan

sfas is effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  the adoption of sfas did not have a material effect on the company s financial statements for in november  the eitf issued issue no 
 accounting for consideration received from a vendor by a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products eitf  effective for fiscal periods beginning after december  eitf requires cash consideration received from a vendor be recognized in the customer s financial statements as a reduction to cost of sales  unless certain limited conditions are met 
if these specific requirements related to individual vendors are met  the consideration is accounted for as a reduction in the related expense category  such as selling and administrative expense 
the adoption of eitf did not have a material effect on the company s financial statements for in december  the fasb issued a revised interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities interpretation r  which addresses how a business enterprise should evaluate whether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity through means other than voting rights and accordingly should consolidate the entity 
interpretation r replaces interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  which was issued in january the company will be required to apply interpretation r to interests in variable interest entities vie created after december  for variable interests in vies created before january   the interpretation will be applied beginning on january  for any vies that must be consolidated under interpretation r that were created before january   the assets  liabilities and noncontrolling interests of the vie initially would be measured at their carrying amounts with any difference between the net amount added to the balance sheet and any previously recognized interest being recognized as the cumulative effect of an accounting change 
if determining the carrying amounts is not practicable  fair value at the date interpretation r first applies may be used to measure the assets  liabilities and noncontrolling interest of the vie 
the adoption of interpretation r is not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity sfas 
sfas establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
it requires an issuer to classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability or an asset in some circumstances 
an issuer previously classified many of those instruments as equity 
sfas is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective for interim periods beginning after june  the adoption of sfas did not have a material effect on the company s financial statements for forward looking statements the company believes that this annual report on form k may contain forward looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of these forward looking statements include statements regarding liquidity and are based on management s current expectations and are subject to a number of uncertainties and risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or suggested in such forward looking statements 
the company cautions investors that there can be no assurance that actual results or business conditions will not differ materially from those projected or suggested in such forward looking statements as a result of various factors including  but not limited to  the following i the ability of the company to obtain financing and additional capital to fund its business strategy on acceptable terms  if at all  ii the ability of the company on a timely basis to find  prudently negotiate and consummate additional acquisitions  iii the ability of the company to manage any to be acquired companies  iv the ability of the company to retain and utilize its federal net operating tax loss carryforward position  and v general economic conditions 
as a result  the company s future development efforts involve a high degree of risk

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as described below  credit risk and interest rate risk are the primary sources of market risk in the company s accounts receivable and long term borrowings 
qualitative credit risk the company provides credit in the normal course of business to its customers  which are primarily educational institutions or distributors 
no single customer accounted for more than of sales in  or the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and maintains allowances for potential credit losses and generally does not require collateral to support its accounts receivable balances 
interest rate risk changes in interest rates can potentially impact the company s profitability and its ability to realize assets and satisfy liabilities 
interest rate risk is resident primarily in long term borrowings  which typically have variable interest rates based on prime or libor rates 
assuming no other change in financial structure  an increase of in the company s variable interest rate for long term borrowings would decrease pre tax earnings by approximately 
million 
this amount is determined by considering a increase in interest on the average long term borrowings estimated to be outstanding in quantitative the company s long term borrowings as of december  are as follows in millions  except percentage data maturity maturity less greater than one than one year year amount weighted average interest rate fair market value the fair market value of long term borrowings equals the face amount of long term borrowings outstanding because the underlying rate of interest on substantially all of the company s debt is variable based upon prime or libor rates
