overview u 
s 
steel is the largest integrated steel producer in north america and has a broad and diverse mix of products and customers 
u 
s 
steel uses iron ore  coal  coke  and steel scrap to produce a wide range of steel products  concentrating on value added steel products for customers with demanding technical applications in the automotive  appliance  container  industrial machinery  construction and oil and gas industries 
in addition to its domestic facilities  u 
s 
steel has significant operations in central europe through u 
s 
steel kosice ussk  located in slovakia  and u 
s 
steel balkan ussb  located in serbia 
u 
s 
steel s financial results are primarily determined by the combined effects of shipment volume  selling prices  production costs  and value added product mix  since these products typically provide a higher profit margin than more commodity driven steel products 
the primary drivers for u 
s 
steel are economic conditions in the united states  europe and  to a lesser extent  other steel consuming regions  the levels of worldwide steel production and consumption  pension and other postretirement benefits opeb costs  and raw material iron ore  coal  coke  steel scrap and zinc and energy natural gas and electricity costs 
the most important issue affecting u 
s 
steel will be its ability to successfully implement the strategy described below 
some of the other key issues which will impact the global steel industry  and u 
s 
steel in particular  include the recent volatility of steel prices  the recent steep increase in the cost of purchased raw materials  the level of unfunded pension and opeb liabilities  the magnitude and durability of the world economic recovery which appears to be in progress  and the impact of production and consumption of steel in china  which has led to much of the recent volatility in steel raw material supplies and global steel pricing 
imports to the united states have declined recently  but could increase rapidly depending on the relative strength of the dollar and market pricing and consumption in the united states versus other regions 
strategy u 
s 
steel s strategy is to continue to grow its value added capabilities  expand its global business platform and reduce its costs 
u 
s 
steel took the following major steps in in implementing this strategy 
on may   u 
s 
steel acquired out of bankruptcy substantially all of the integrated steelmaking assets of national steel corporation national 
see note to the financial statements for further information regarding the acquisition 
the facilities that were acquired included two integrated steel plants  granite city works in granite city  illinois  and great lakes works in ecorse and river rouge  michigan  the midwest plant in portage  indiana  procoil company llc procoil in canton  michigan  a percent equity interest in double g coatings company  lp double g near jackson  mississippi  the taconite pellet operations in keewatin  minnesota  and the delray connecting railroad company delray in michigan 
this acquisition increased annual domestic raw steel production capability to million tons 

table of contents u 
s 
steel and the united steelworkers of america uswa reached a five year labor agreement that was effective upon the completion of the national acquisition and which covers both u 
s 
steel and former national employees 
this agreement allowed for a workforce restructuring aimed at achieving a percent productivity improvement  expanded profit based variable compensation  provided cost sharing mechanisms for employee and retiree healthcare expenses  and provided a joint mechanism to consider further acquisitions of steel and steel related assets in north america 
on september   u 
s 
steel acquired out of bankruptcy sartid ad in bankruptcy  an integrated steel company located in the union of serbia and montenegro  and certain of its subsidiaries collectively sartid 
u 
s 
steel is operating these facilities as ussb 
see note to the financial statements for further information regarding the acquisition 
this acquisition increased annual european raw steel production capability to million tons 
on june   u 
s 
steel completed the sale of its coal mines and related assets mining sale 
see note to the financial statements for further information regarding the sale 
in a non monetary transaction in november  u 
s 
steel s plate mill at gary works was exchanged for a pickling line located in east chicago  indiana 
this was u 
s 
steel s only plate mill 
however  u 
s 
steel still produces plate in coil on its hot strip mills at gary works and at its european operations 
straightline source straightline was closed to new business effective december   and will be shut down in after existing contractual obligations are fulfilled and inventories are depleted 
critical accounting estimates management s discussion and analysis of u 
s 
steel s financial condition and results of operations is based upon u 
s 
steel s financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting standards generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at year end  and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the year 
management regularly evaluates these estimates  including those related to the carrying value of property  plant and equipment  valuation allowances for receivables  inventories and deferred income tax assets  liabilities for deferred income taxes  potential tax deficiencies  environmental obligations  potential litigation claims and settlements  and assets and obligations related to employee benefits 
management estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
accordingly  actual results may differ materially from current expectations under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes that the following are the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements 
pensions and opeb the recording of net periodic benefit costs credits for defined benefit pensions and opeb are based on  among other things  assumptions of the expected annual return on plan assets  discount rate  escalation or other changes in retiree health care costs and plan participation levels 
changes in the assumptions or differences between actual and expected changes in the present value of liabilities or assets of u 
s 
steel s plans could cause net periodic benefit costs to increase or decrease materially from year to year as discussed below 
u 
s 
steel bases its estimate of the annual expected return on plan assets on the historical long term rate of return experienced by u 
s 
steel s plan assets  the investment mix of plan assets between debt  equities and other investments  and its view of market returns expected in the future 
based on a review of these factors  u 
s 
steel 
table of contents has decreased the expected annual return on pension plan assets from percent in to percent beginning with the september  remeasurement 
this decrease in the expected return will negatively affect the return on asset component of net periodic pension costs by approximately million in as compared to net periodic pension cost  excluding multiemployer plans  is expected to total million in as compared to million before workforce reduction charges in a percentage point increase or decrease in the expected return on plan assets for would have decreased or increased the expected net periodic pension cost by million 
u 
s 
steel determines the discount rate applied to pension and opeb obligations at each year end or required interim period based on a number of external barometers used to measure the status of high quality bond rates consistent with the expected payout period of the obligations 
based on this evaluation at december   u 
s 
steel lowered the discount rate used to measure both pension and opeb obligations from percent as of the prior measurement at september   to percent 
lower discount rates increase the actuarial losses of the plans and will unfavorably impact net periodic benefit costs by approximately million for pensions in principally due to the impact of required amortization amounts  which in recent years prior to had not been a significant component of benefit costs 
total opeb costs in are expected to be approximately million  excluding multiemployer plans 
a percentage point increase in the discount rate would have decreased the estimated net periodic pension and opeb costs by approximately million and million  respectively 
a percentage point decrease in the discount rate would have increased the estimated net periodic pension and opeb costs by approximately million and million  respectively 
as of december   a percentage point increase in the discount rate would have decreased pension and opeb liabilities by million and million  respectively 
a percentage point decrease in the discount rate would have increased pension and opeb liabilities by million and million  respectively 
u 
s 
steel determines the escalation trend in per capita health care costs based on historical rate experience under u 
s 
steel s insurance plans and through consultation with health care experts 
assumed health care cost trend rates no longer have a significant effect on the amounts reported for us steel s health care plans  other than the benefit plan offered to retired mineworkers  since a cost cap was negotiated in with the uswa union which freezes all retiree medical costs after the base year 
most salaried benefits are limited to flat dollar payments that are not affected by escalation 
for measurement purposes  u 
s 
steel has assumed an initial escalation rate of percent for this rate is assumed to decrease gradually to an ultimate rate of percent in and remain at that level thereafter 
a percentage point increase in the escalation trend would have increased expected net periodic opeb costs by approximately million in a percentage point decrease in the escalation trend would have decreased expected net periodic opeb costs by approximately million in changes in the assumptions for expected annual return on plan assets and the discount rate do not impact the funding calculations used to derive minimum funding requirements for the pension plans 
for further cash flow discussion  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition  cash flows and liquidity liquidity 
asset impairments asset impairments are recognized when the carrying value of those productive assets exceeds their aggregate projected undiscounted cash flows 
these undiscounted cash flows are based on management s long range estimates of market conditions and the overall performance associated with the individual asset or asset grouping 
if future demand and market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  or if the probability of disposition of the assets differs from that previously estimated by management  additional asset write downs may be required 
taxes u 
s 
steel records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in the event that u 
s 
steel were to determine that it would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should u 
s 
steel determine that it 
table of contents would not be able to realize all or part of its deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
the amount of net deferred tax assets recorded as of december   was million  net of an established valuation allowance of million 
see note to the financial statements 
u 
s 
steel expects to generate future taxable income to realize the benefits of these deferred tax assets 
u 
s 
steel makes no provision for deferred us and certain foreign income taxes on the undistributed earnings of ussk and other consolidated foreign subsidiaries because management intends to permanently reinvest such earnings in foreign operations 
as of december   the amount of undistributed earnings was approximately million 
if circumstances change and it is determined that earnings will be remitted in the foreseeable future  a charge of up to million could be required 
u 
s 
steel records liabilities for potential tax deficiencies 
these liabilities are based on management s judgment of the risk of loss should those items be challenged by taxing authorities 
in the event that u 
s 
steel were to determine that tax related items would not be considered deficiencies or that items previously not considered to be potential deficiencies could be considered as potential tax deficiencies as a result of an audit  tax ruling or other positions or authority an adjustment to the liability would be recorded through income in the period such determination was made 
environmental remediation u 
s 
steel provides for remediation costs and penalties when the responsibility to remediate is probable and the amount of associated costs is reasonably determinable 
remediation liabilities are accrued based on estimates of known environmental exposures and are discounted in certain instances 
u 
s 
steel regularly monitors the progress of environmental remediation 
should studies indicate that the cost of remediation is to be more than previously estimated  an additional accrual would be recorded in the period in which such determination was made 
as of december   total accruals for environmental remediation were million 
segments during  u 
s 
steel had five reportable operating segments flat rolled products flat rolled  u 
s 
steel europe usse  tubular products tubular  real estate and straightline 
in addition  the results of several operating segments that do not constitute reportable segments were combined and disclosed in the other businesses category 
the national acquisition changed the composition of the flat rolled segment and other businesses as described below  but did not result in a change in u 
s 
steel s reportable segments 
effective with the mining sale  other businesses are no longer involved in the mining  processing and sale of coal 
effective with the acquisition of sartid  the ussk segment was renamed usse and includes the operating results of ussb 
effective with the third quarter of  the composition of the flat rolled segment was changed to include the results of the coke operations at clairton works and gary works  which were previously reported in other businesses 
this change reflected u 
s 
steel s recent management consolidations 
effective with the fourth quarter of  benefit expenses for current retirees are separately identified and are no longer allocated to the reportable segments and other businesses 
these expenses include pensions  health care  life insurance and any profit based expenses for the benefit of retirees 
benefit expenses for active employees continue to be allocated to the reportable segments and other businesses 
furthermore  u 
s 
steel changed its methodology for allocating certain corporate costs 
see note to the financial statements for details 
these changes were made so that the operating results of u 
s 
steel s reportable segments will better reflect their current contribution and so that u 
s 
steel s segment results will be more comparable to those of its primary competitors who do not have significant retiree obligations 
comparative results for and have been conformed to the current year presentation 

table of contents the flat rolled segment includes the operating results of u 
s 
steel s domestic integrated steel mills and equity investees involved in the production of sheet  tin mill products and strip mill plate  as well as all domestic coke production facilities

prior to the mining sale on june   other businesses were involved in the mining  processing and sale of coal 
effective may   other businesses include the operating results of the keewatin  minnesota taconite pellet operations and delray  which were acquired from national 

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of income the principal drivers of u 
s 
steel s financial results are price  volume  costs and product mix 
to the extent that these factors are affected by industry conditions and the overall economic climate  revenues and income will reflect such conditions 
revenues and other income dollars in millions revenues by product sheet and semi finished steel products plate and tin mill products tubular products raw materials coal  coke and iron ore a other b income loss from investees net gains on disposal of assets other income total revenues and other income a revenue from the sale of coal ceased with the mining sale on june  b includes revenue from the sale of steel production by products  transportation services  steel mill products distribution  the management of mineral resources  the management and development of real estate  and engineering and consulting services 
total revenues and other income in increased  million compared to the increase primarily reflected higher shipment volumes for domestic sheet and tin products due to the national acquisition  increased prices and shipment volumes for usse and increased prices for domestic sheet products 
the improvement also reflected higher prices and volumes on commercial coke shipments  increased shipments of slabs and increased shipments for straightline 
these were partially offset by lower coal revenue due to the mining sale  lower plate revenue due in part to the disposition of the gary plate mill  and lower commercial shipments of taconite pellets 
net gains on disposal of assets in included million resulting from the timber contribution to the pension plan 
other income in included million from the sale of coal seam gas interests 
other income in included million from a federal excise tax refund 
total revenues and other income in increased by million from primarily due to higher shipments and average realized prices for domestic sheet products  the absence of the million impairment of receivables primarily from republic  which was included in  increased straightline shipments as a result of a full year of operations  and higher average realized prices for ussk  which were partially due to foreign exchange effects 
these were partially offset by reduced domestic tubular and plate shipment volumes 
pension and opeb costs pension benefit costs  which are included in income loss from operations  totaled million in  compared to pension credits of million in and million in the cost in included million of settlement  curtailment and termination benefit charges  which are included in the workforce reduction charge described below in items not allocated to segments 
the credit in included million of settlement charges  which comprise the workforce reduction charge also described below in items not allocated to segments 
excluding these charges  the increase of million in compared to was primarily due to a lower return on assets  a decline in the expected return on asset assumption and a lower discount rate 
the credit in included million of termination and settlement charges due principally to a non union voluntary early retirement program offered in conjunction with the separation and a 
table of contents shutdown of a majority of the fairless plant 
excluding settlement and termination charges  net periodic pension credits reflected a reduction from to of million primarily due to a lower return on assets and a lower discount rate 
opeb costs  which are also included in income loss from operations  totaled million in  compared to million in and million in costs in included million of curtailment charges  which are included in the workforce reduction charge described below 
the increase in compared to  excluding those charges  was primarily due to the addition of liabilities for national employees  changes in rate of retirement assumptions and a lower discount rate 
the increase of million from to was primarily due to higher medical claim costs and a higher assumed escalation trend applied to those claim costs 
for additional information on pensions and other postretirement benefits  including defined contribution plans  see note to the financial statements 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses were million in  compared to million in the increase in was primarily due to higher pension and other postretirement benefit costs as previously discussed  increased compensation expense related to stock appreciation rights  and higher expenses at usse due mainly to unfavorable effects of foreign currency exchange rate differences and increased business development expenses 
these were partially offset by the favorable effect in of the absence of the impairment of retiree medical cost reimbursements receivable from republic  which occurred in selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million in compared to the increase in was primarily due to the decrease in the pension credit and higher postretirement benefit costs as previously discussed  the impairment of remaining retiree medical cost reimbursements receivable from republic  increased legal and consulting expenses primarily due to the section trade cases and potential industry consolidation  and the expansion of straightline 

table of contents restructuring charges restructuring charges of million in consisted primarily of the workforce reduction charge of million  costs related to the straightline shutdown totaling million and million of the asset impairments  all of which are reflected in the following table under other items not allocated to segments

b in excess of facility repair costs 
segment results for flat rolled flat rolled recorded a segment loss of million in  compared to a loss of million in the decreased loss was primarily due to higher average realized prices and favorable effects resulting from ongoing cost improvement programs  the national acquisition and workforce reductions 
these were partially offset by increased prices for raw materials  natural gas and utilities  higher employee benefit costs  increased costs for repair outages  and costs associated with the august power outage  which interrupted operations in michigan and ohio 
the segment loss for flat rolled of million in reflected an improvement of million from the substantially decreased loss was primarily due to improved operating efficiencies  higher average realized prices and shipment volumes for sheet products  lower energy costs and cost saving initiatives  partially offset by lower results from coke operations 

table of contents segment results for usse usse segment income for the full year was million  an increase of million from the improvement was primarily due to higher average realized prices as a result of favorable exchange rate effects and price increases  as well as higher shipment volumes 
prior to september   usse shipments included those realized under toll conversion agreements with sartid and  effective september   included all shipments from sartid  now ussb 
these improvements were partially offset by the unfavorable effect on costs of changes in foreign exchange rates  costs associated with the conversion and facility management agreements with sartid  which were terminated in conjunction with the acquisition  and post acquisition operating losses at ussb including effects from a day strike 
usse segment income for was million  a decrease of million compared to the decrease was primarily due to the unfavorable effect of changes in foreign exchange rates on costs  higher freight costs  costs associated with the conversion and facility management agreements with sartid  and business development expenses associated with sartid and other expansion opportunities in europe 
these were partially offset by higher average realized prices  which were in part due to favorable exchange rate effects 
the net currency exchange effect on total year income from operations was not material 
segment results for tubular the segment loss for tubular in reflected a decline of million from primarily due to lower average realized prices for seamless products and higher natural gas prices  partially offset by increased shipment volumes for seamless products and income from the sale of delta 
the tubular segment recorded a loss of million for  compared to income of million in the decline was primarily due to lower shipment volumes and lower average realized prices for tubular products 
segment results for real estate real estate segment income for and was million 
increased coal seam gas royalties were offset by lower real estate sales 
real estate segment income for was million  compared with million in the decrease primarily reflected lower mineral interest royalties 
segment results for straightline straightline had a segment loss of million for  reflecting a decline of million compared to the increased losses resulted mainly from higher sales volumes at negative margins 
straightline recorded a segment loss of million in  its first full year of operations  compared with a loss of million in for the period following the start up of operations on october  results for other businesses the loss for other businesses for reflected a decline of million from income of million in the decrease mainly reflected lower results from taconite pellet operations due primarily to reduced shipment volumes  lower results from coal operations mainly due to the mining sale on june   and lower results for transportation services 
income for other businesses for was million  a significant improvement from s loss of million 
the increase primarily reflected higher income from taconite pellet and coal operations 

table of contents items not allocated to segments stock appreciation rights resulted in million of compensation expense accrued in  due primarily to the percent increase in u 
s 
steel s stock price during the fourth quarter of these stock appreciation rights were issued over the last ten years and allow the holders to receive cash and or common stock equal to the excess of the fair market value of the common stock over the exercise price 
costs related to straightline shutdown consisted of the write down of fixed assets and certain employee benefit costs resulting from the shutdown of straightline  which will be completed in workforce reduction charges totaling million in related to u 
s 
steel s ongoing operating and administrative cost reduction programs and consisted of curtailment expenses of million for pensions and million for other postretirement benefits related to employee reductions under the transition assistance program tap for union employees excluding former national employees retiring under the tap  other retirements  layoffs and asset dispositions  million for early retirement cash incentives related to the tap  pension settlement losses of million due to a high level of retirements of salaried employees  termination benefit charges of million primarily for enhanced pension benefits provided to u 
s 
steel employees retiring under the tap  and million for the cost of layoff unemployment benefits provided to non represented employees 
the workforce reduction charge of million in reflected pension settlement losses related to retirements of personnel covered under the non union qualified pension plan and the non tax qualified excess and supplemental pension plans for executive and senior management 
asset impairments of million in resulted from a non monetary asset exchange with international steel group  which was completed effective november   and the impairment of a cost method investment 
asset impairments in and were for charges related to reserves established against receivables exposure from financially distressed steel companies  primarily republic 
asset impairments in also included million of charges resulting from the impairment of an intangible asset related to the five year agreement for ltv to supply u 
s 
steel with pickled hot bands entered into in conjunction with the acquisition of ltv s tin mill products business 
this impairment followed the discontinuation of ltv operations at east chicago 
gain on timber contribution to pension plan reflected a million gain resulting from the excess of fair value over net book value for timber cutting rights valued at million  which u 
s 
steel voluntarily contributed to its defined benefit pension fund in december insurance recoveries related to uss posco fire represent u 
s 
steel s share of insurance recoveries in excess of facility repair costs for the cold reduction mill fire at uss posco  which occurred in may the final payment was received in december federal excise tax refund represents the recovery of black lung excise taxes that were paid on coal export sales during the period through during  u 
s 
steel received cash and recognized pre tax income of million  which is included in other income on the statement of operations 
of the million received  million represented interest 
net interest and other financial costs net interest and other financial costs were million in  compared to million in and million in the million increase in was primarily due to interest on the new senior notes and an increase in interest for tax deficiencies  partially offset by a favorable million adjustment related to prior years taxes and more favorable changes in foreign currency effects 
the decrease of million in as compared with was primarily due to lower average debt levels following the december  value transfer of million from marathon  as well as a favorable change in foreign currency effects 
these were 
table of contents partially offset by the absence in of a favorable million adjustment related to prior years taxes  which occurred in the foreign currency effects were primarily due to remeasurement of ussk and ussb net monetary assets into the us dollar  which is their functional currency  and resulted in net gains of million and million in and  respectively  and a net loss of million in income taxes the income tax benefit in was million  compared with benefits of million in and million in the tax benefit in included a million favorable effect relating to an adjustment of prior years taxes  compared to million in and million in the tax benefit in included a million deferred tax benefit associated with the transtar reorganization 
the increase in the tax benefit in compared to was primarily due to increased pre tax losses for domestic operations  including increased benefit costs  while the decrease in the tax benefit from to was primarily due to reduced pre tax losses from domestic operations 
as of december   u 
s 
steel had net federal  state and foreign deferred tax assets of million  million and million  respectively 
the amount of net domestic deferred tax assets determined to be realizable was measured by calculating the tax effect of tax planning strategies that are estimated to generate approximately billion in taxable income 
tax planning strategies include actions that are prudent and feasible  and that management ordinarily might not take  but would take  if necessary to realize a deferred tax asset  unless the need to do so is eliminated in future years 
these tax planning strategies include the implementation of the previously announced plan to dispose of non strategic assets  the sale of non integral domestic and foreign operating assets as well as the ability to elect alternative accounting methods 
based on this assessment  as of december   the company determined that it is more likely than not that million of such assets will be realized  therefore resulting in a valuation allowance of million 
the slovak income tax act provides an income tax credit  which is available to ussk if certain conditions are met 
in order to claim the tax credit in any year  percent of ussk s sales must be export sales and ussk must reinvest the tax credits claimed in qualifying capital expenditures during the five years following the year in which the tax credit is claimed 
the provisions of the slovak income tax act permit ussk to claim a tax credit of percent of ussk s tax liability for years through and percent for the years through management believes that ussk fulfilled all of the necessary conditions for claiming the tax credit for the years for which it was claimed and anticipates meeting such requirements in as a result of claiming these tax credits and management s intent to reinvest earnings in foreign operations  virtually no income tax provision is recorded for ussk income 
in october  a tax credit limit was negotiated by the slovak government as part of the accession treaty governing slovakia s entry into the european union eu 
the treaty limits to million the total tax credit to be granted to ussk during the period through the impact of the tax credit limit is expected to be minimal since slovak tax laws have been modified and tax rates have been reduced since the acquisition of ussk 
the treaty also places limits upon ussk s flat rolled production and export sales to the eu  allowing for modest growth each year through the limits upon export sales to the eu take effect upon slovakia s entry into the eu  which is expected to occur in may a question has recently arisen with respect to the effective date of the production limits 
slovak republic representatives have stated their belief that the treaty intended that these limits take effect upon entry into the eu  whereas the european commission has taken the position that the flat rolled production limitations apply as of discussions between representatives of slovakia and the european commission are ongoing  but u 
s 
steel has not seen discernable progress in these talks to date 
although it is not possible to predict the outcome of those discussions  a settlement could take many forms including a reduction in ussk s tax credit  a payment for taxes based on a portion of production for years and or the acceleration of the restrictions upon ussk s flat rolled production and or sales into the eu 
at this time  it is not possible to predict the impact of such a settlement upon u 
s 
steel s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 

table of contents the bush administration is continuing discussions at the organization of economic cooperation and development oecd aimed at the reduction of inefficient steel production capacity and the elimination and limitation of certain subsidies to the steel industry throughout the world 
it is possible that these discussions could result in the adoption of an oecd agreement which could negatively impact ussk s tax credit

usse raw steel production was million net tons in  million net tons in and million net tons in usse s raw steel production averaged percent of capability in  compared to percent in and percent in usse s capability utilization in was negatively affected by the partial period inclusion of ussb as only about a third of ussb s annual raw steel design capability was operational 
achievement of higher operational levels will require improved operating practices and an extensive rehabilitation and capital spending program 
the domestic steel industry is restructuring after many years of oversupply and low prices attributable largely to excess imports  which resulted in significant temporary or permanent capacity closures starting in late and led to the introduction of trade remedies announced by president bush on march   under section of the trade act of the combination of capacity closures  trade restrictions and the imposition of tariffs led to a recovery of steel prices from year lows in late and early the trade remedies announced by president bush on march   were removed by executive proclamation effective december   prior to running their full term of three years 
upon announcing termination of the section relief  the administration committed to continuing and improving a steel import monitoring system that will assist the domestic steel industry in identifying steel import problems in a timely manner 
u 
s 
steel intends to monitor imports closely and file anti dumping and countervailing duty petitions if unfairly traded imports adversely impact  or threaten to adversely impact  financial results 
the negative impact of removing the tariffs has been mitigated by a number of factors including the relative value of the dollar  significant increases in ocean freight and an increase in the global demand for steel 

table of contents steel imports to the united states accounted for an estimated percent of the domestic steel market in  compared to percent in and percent in during  two events will occur that may have a significant effect on the amount of steel imports that will be allowed to enter the united states 
the international trade commission will commence a five year review required by rules of the world trade organization to determine whether antidumping findings against hot rolled steel from japan  russia and brazil should be continued 
also  the comprehensive steel trade agreement with russia  under which russia has voluntarily limited the quantity of its exports to the united states of steel products that are not covered by antidumping orders  will expire in july 
in response to the termination of the us section proceedings  on december   the european commission announced the termination of the definitive safeguard measures imposed on september  the european union eu safeguard proceedings  which were similar to the section proceedings  involved quota tariff measures restricting the import of certain steel products into the eu 
usse had been impacted by the quota tariff measures on four products non alloy hot rolled coils  hot rolled strip  hot rolled sheet and cold rolled flat products 
annual shipment quotas were set for all four products and tariffs imposed if the quotas were exceeded 
the measures were scheduled to expire on march   however  they would have ceased to impact ussk upon slovakia s accession into the eu  which is expected to occur on may  during  safeguard measures  similar to the eu measures  were also imposed by poland on march and hungary on march 
to date  those measures have not been terminated 
in light of market opportunities elsewhere  usse s experience operating under these measures and the fact that the measures will cease to affect ussk upon eu accession by slovakia  poland and hungary  it appears unlikely that these measures will have a material adverse effect on usse s operating profit during management s discussion and analysis of financial condition  cash flows and liquidity financial condition sfas no 
employer s accounting for pensions provides that if  at any plan measurement date  the fair value of plan assets is less than the plan s accumulated benefit obligation abo  the sponsor must record a minimum liability at least equal to the amount by which the abo exceeds the fair value of the plan assets and any pension asset must be removed from the balance sheet 
the sum of the liability and pension asset is offset by the recognition of an intangible asset and or as a direct charge to stockholders equity  net of tax effects 
such adjustments have no direct impact on earnings per share or cash 
at december   the fair value of plan assets for u 
s 
steel s pension plans was billion 
based on asset values as of december   the abo exceeded the fair value of plan assets by million 
consequently  required minimum liability adjustments were recorded  resulting in the recognition of an intangible asset of million and a total cumulative net charge against equity of  million at december  current assets at year end increased million from year end primarily due to increased trade receivables and inventory balances related to the national acquisition 
the increase also reflected higher cash and cash equivalents

long term debt at december   was  million  million higher than year end the increase in debt was primarily due to the issuance of million of senior notes in may for discussion  see liquidity 
the increase also reflected additional capital lease obligations 
deferred income tax liabilities at december   reflected a decrease of million from december  the change primarily resulted from the establishment of federal and state deferred tax assets  which were previously discussed  in excess of deferred income tax liabilities 
employee benefits at december   decreased million from year end employee benefits for both periods included the net pension liability related to an additional minimum liability adjustment for defined benefit pension plans 
on november   the overfunded main non union defined benefit pension plan which was reported in pension assets at year end was merged into the underfunded main union defined benefit pension plan 
employee benefits at year end were lower than the amount recorded for the union plan by itself a year earlier since the surplus of assets over the liabilities of the non union plan offset some of the shortfall of the union plan once merged 
this decrease was partially offset by the addition of liabilities related to union employees at the acquired national facilities

steel s ability to incur debt  or make capital expenditures above certain limits  to sell assets used in the production of steel or steel products or incur liens on assets  and to limit dividends and other restricted payments if the amount available for borrowings drops below certain levels 
the fixed charge coverage ratio test in the inventory facility is calculated as the ratio of operating cash flow to cash charges as defined in the agreement of not less than times on the last day of any fiscal quarter 
this coverage ratio must be met if availability  as defined in the agreement  is less than million

steel s ability to make restricted payments 
restricted payments under the indentures include the declaration or payment of dividends on capital stock  the purchase  redemption or other acquisition or retirement for value of capital stock  the retirement of any subordinated obligations prior to their scheduled maturity  and the making of any investments other than those specifically permitted under the indentures 
in order to make restricted payments  u

if these covenants are breached or if u 
s 
steel fails to make payments under its material debt obligations or the receivables purchase agreement  creditors would be able to terminate their commitments to make further loans  declare their outstanding obligations immediately due and payable and foreclose on any collateral 
this may also cause a termination event to occur under the receivables purchase agreement and a default under the senior notes

steel from marathon  may be declared immediately due and payable 
if that occurs  u 
s 
steel may not be able to satisfy such obligations 
in addition  if marathon loses its investment grade ratings  certain of these obligations will be considered indebtedness under the senior notes indentures and for covenant calculations under the inventory facility

steel accrues an annual cost for these benefit obligations under plans covering its active and retiree populations in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
these obligations will require corporate cash in future years to the extent that trust assets are restricted or insufficient and to the extent that company contributions are required by law or union labor agreement 
amounts in the years through reflect our current estimate of corporate cash outflows and are net of the use of funds available from asset trusts 
the accuracy of this forecast of future cash flows depends on various factors such as actual asset returns  the mix of assets within the asset trusts  medical escalation and discount rates used to calculate obligations  the availability of surplus pension assets allowable for transfer to pay retiree medical claims and company decisions or voluntary employee benefit association restrictions that impact the timing of the use of trust assets 
also  as such  the amounts shown could differ significantly from what is actually expended and  at this time  it is impossible to make an accurate prediction of cash requirements beyond five years

s 
steel s business will continue to generate sufficient operating cash flow or that external financing sources will be available in an amount sufficient to enable u

increases in interest rates can increase the cost of future borrowings and make it more difficult to raise capital

steel has incurred and will continue to incur substantial capital  operating and maintenance  and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations 
in recent years  these expenditures have been mainly for process changes in order to meet clean air act obligations  although ongoing compliance costs have also been significant 
to the extent these expenditures  as with all costs  are not ultimately reflected in the prices of u 
s 
steel s products and services  operating results will be reduced 
u 
s 
steel believes that its major domestic integrated steel competitors are confronted by substantially similar conditions and thus does not believe that its relative position with regard to such competitors is materially affected by the impact of environmental laws and regulations 
however  the costs and operating restrictions necessary for compliance with environmental laws and regulations may have an adverse effect on u 
s 
steel s competitive position with regard to domestic mini mills and some foreign steel producers and producers of materials which compete with steel  which may not be required to undertake equivalent costs in their operations 
in addition  the specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number of factors  including the age and location of its operating facilities and its production methods 
ussk is subject to the laws of slovakia

ussk has also entered into an agreement with the slovak government to bring its facilities into eu environmental compliance  and expects to do so by ussb is subject to the laws of the union of serbia and montenegro  which are currently more lenient than either the eu or us standards  but this is expected to change over the next several years in anticipation of possible eu accession 
an environmental baseline study is being conducted at ussb s facilities 
under the terms of the acquisition  ussb will be responsible for only those costs and liabilities associated with environmental events occurring subsequent to the completion of that study

steel is a defendant in  active cases in which  as of december   approximately  plaintiffs have filed claims alleging injury resulting from exposure to asbestos 
almost all of these cases 
table of contents involve multiple defendants typically from fifty to more than one hundred defendants 
over  or more than percent  of the plaintiffs in cases in which u 
s 
steel is a defendant are in cases filed in mississippi  ohio and texas  jurisdictions which permit filings with massive numbers of plaintiffs 
based upon our experience in such cases  the actual number of plaintiffs who ultimately assert claims against u 
s 
steel is likely to be a small fraction of the total number of plaintiffs 
while u 
s 
steel has excess casualty insurance  these policies have multi million dollar self insured retentions 
to date  u 
s 
steel has not received any payments under these policies relating to asbestos claims 
in most cases  this excess casualty insurance is the only insurance applicable to asbestos claims 
on march   a jury in madison county  illinois returned a verdict against u 
s 
steel for million in compensatory damages and million in punitive damages 
u 
s 
steel believes that the court erred as a matter of law by failing to find that the plaintiff s exclusive remedy was provided by the indiana workers compensation law 
u 
s 
steel believes that this issue and other errors at trial would have enabled u 
s 
steel to succeed on appeal 
however  in order to avoid the delay and uncertainties of further litigation and the posting of a large appeal bond in excess of the amount of the verdict  u 
s 
steel settled this case for an amount which was substantially less than the compensatory damages award and which represented a small fraction of the total award 
this settlement is reflected in the results for the quarter ended march  management views the verdict and resulting settlement in the madison county case as aberrational  and believes that the likelihood of similar results in other cases is remote  although not impossible 
u 
s 
steel has not experienced any material adverse change in its ability to resolve pending claims as a result of the madison county settlement 
it is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of asbestos related lawsuits  claims and proceedings due to the unpredictable nature of personal injury litigation 
despite this uncertainty  and although u 
s 
steel s results of operations and cash flows for a given period could be adversely affected by asbestos related lawsuits  claims and proceedings  management believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on u 
s 
steel s financial condition 
among the factors considered in reaching this conclusion are that u 
s 
steel has been subject to a total of approximately  asbestos claims over the past years that have been administratively dismissed or are inactive due to the failure of the plaintiffs to present any medical evidence supporting their claims  that over the last several years  the total number of pending claims has generally declined  that it has been many years since u 
s 
steel employed maritime workers or manufactured electric cable  and u 
s 
steel s history of trial outcomes  settlements and dismissals  including such matters since the madison county jury verdict and settlement in march the foregoing statements of belief are forward looking statements 
predictions as to the outcome of pending litigation are subject to substantial uncertainties with respect to among other things factual and judicial determinations  and actual results could differ materially from those expressed in these forward looking statements 
u 
s 
steel is the subject of  or a party to  a number of pending or threatened legal actions  contingencies and commitments involving a variety of matters  including laws and regulations relating to the environment  certain of which are discussed in note to the financial statements 
the ultimate resolution of these contingencies could  individually or in the aggregate  be material to the u

outlook for compared with fourth quarter results  first quarter shipments for the flat rolled segment are expected to remain strong with prices improving 
however  results will be negatively affected by continued increases in raw material and energy costs 
for full year  flat rolled shipments are expected to increase by about percent to approximately million tons due mainly to a full year of shipments from the acquired national assets 
previously announced price increases of per ton for sheet products and percent for tin mill 
table of contents products were effective january  the company announced a per ton surcharge on all flat rolled products effective february   which will remain in effect until further notice 
the company also announced additional increases of per ton for hot rolled products and hot strip mill plate  and increases of per ton for cold rolled and coated sheet products  effective april  given current and expected worldwide steel market conditions  further price increases are likely 
late in the fourth quarter of  u 
s 
steel declared force majeure on contractual coke shipments from clairton works because one of its major coal suppliers declared force majeure on coal shipments following a mine fire 
the global coke shortage was further aggravated by these events and is forcing certain domestic steelmakers to curtail production  which has contributed to upward pressure on domestic steel prices 
u 
s 
steel purchases percent of its domestic coal requirements and has entered into contracts at currently competitive market prices to purchase adequate supplies of coal in and  assuming timely delivery  currently expects to return clairton works to full production by the end of the first quarter 
u 
s 
steel has been able to purchase additional coke and currently does not expect to materially reduce its steel production due to raw material constraints 
for the usse segment  first quarter prices are expected to be higher than in s fourth quarter  but are expected to be offset by higher costs for raw materials and slightly lower production volumes in slovakia due to the lingering effects of operational difficulties with a blast furnace during the fourth quarter of operations in serbia are still in their initial ramp up and are expected to reach percent of capability later in the first quarter 
as a result  usse shipments in are projected to increase by about percent to approximately million net tons 
price increases of euros per metric ton were announced for flat rolled products  effective january  further price increases of a minimum of euros per metric ton were announced for flat rolled products  effective april  the tubular segment is expected to benefit from increased shipments and prices in the first quarter compared to s fourth quarter 
full year shipments are expected to rise by almost percent to million tons 
effective december  tubular announced price increases for certain products ranging from to per ton 
effective january  tubular announced additional price increases of to per ton 
this segment also should benefit in from the new quench and temper line at lorain pipe mills  which reached full production capability during the fourth quarter of based on preliminary actuarial information for  the company expects annual net periodic pension costs excluding multiemployer plans to be million million for employees and million for current retirees  compared to million in excluding multiemployer plans and workforce reduction charges 
the expected increase is mainly due to a lower market related value of plan assets  average asset return assumptions that have been reduced from percent to percent  and changes in rate of retirement assumptions 
also  the funded status of the projected pension benefit obligation declined from an underfunded position of billion at year end to an underfunded position of billion at year end opeb costs excluding multiemployer plans are expected to be million million for employees and million for current retirees  compared to million in excluding muiltiemployer plans and workforce reduction charges 
the estimated reduction in opeb expense compared to primarily reflects assumed changes to retiree participation in company sponsored prescription drug programs based on future benefits under the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of  which became law on december   and under cost sharing mechanisms negotiated with the united steelworkers of america uswa earlier in at december   u 
s 
steel s benefit obligation for opeb was billion  a reduction of approximately billion from the amount at the end of  excluding the billion obligation increase recorded according to federal statute following the sale of coal assets in the second quarter of depending upon profitability in  u

table of contents this outlook contains forward looking statements with respect to market conditions  operating costs  shipments and prices  and employee benefit costs 
some factors  among others  that could affect market conditions  costs  shipments and prices for both domestic operations and usse include global product demand  prices and mix  global and company steel production levels  plant operating performance  the timing and completion of facility projects  natural gas prices and usage  raw materials availability and prices  changes in environmental  tax and other laws  the resumption of operation of steel facilities sold under the bankruptcy laws  employee strikes  power outages  and us and global economic performance and political developments

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk management opinion concerning derivative instruments u 
s 
steel uses commodity based and foreign currency derivative instruments to manage its price risk 
management has authorized the use of futures  forwards  swaps and options to manage exposure to price fluctuations related to the purchase of natural gas  heating oil and nonferrous metals and also certain business transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
derivative instruments used for trading and other activities are marked to market and the resulting gains or losses are recognized in the current period in income from operations 
while u 
s 
steel s risk management activities generally reduce market risk exposure due to unfavorable commodity price changes for raw material purchases and products sold  such activities can also encompass strategies that assume price risk 
management believes that the use of derivative instruments  along with risk assessment procedures and internal controls  does not expose u 
s 
steel to material risk 
the use of derivative instruments could materially affect u

steel s non derivative financial instruments is provided in the following table as of december non derivative financial instruments a fair value b incremental increase in fair value c fair value b incremental increase in fair value c dollars in millions financial assets investments and long term receivables d financial liabilities long term debt e f a fair values of cash and cash equivalents  receivables  notes payable  accounts payable and accrued interest approximate carrying value and are relatively insensitive to changes in interest rates due to the short term maturity of the instruments 
accordingly  these instruments are excluded from the table 
b see note to the financial statements for carrying value of instruments 
c reflects  by class of financial instrument  the estimated incremental effect of a hypothetical decrease in interest rates at december   and december   on the fair value of u 
s 
steel s non derivative financial instruments 
for financial liabilities  this assumes a percent decrease in the weighted average yield to maturity of u 
s 
steel s long term debt at december   and december  d for additional information  see note to the financial statements 
e includes amounts due within one year 
f fair value was based on market prices where available  or estimated borrowing rates for financings with similar maturities 
for additional information  see note to the financial statements 
at december   u 
s 
steel s portfolio of long term debt was comprised primarily of fixed rate instruments 
therefore  the fair value of the portfolio is relatively sensitive to effects of interest rate fluctuations 
this sensitivity is illustrated by the million increase in the fair value of long term debt assuming a hypothetical percent decrease in interest rates 
however  u 
s 
steel s sensitivity to interest rate declines and corresponding increases in the fair value of its debt portfolio would unfavorably affect u 
s 
steel s results and cash flows only to the extent that u 
s 
steel elected to repurchase or otherwise retire all or a portion of its fixed rate debt portfolio at prices above carrying value 
foreign currency exchange rate risk u 
s 
steel  primarily through usse  is subject to the risk of price fluctuations due to the effects of exchange rates on revenues and operating costs  firm commitments for capital expenditures and existing assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than us dollars  in particular the euro  the slovak koruna and the serbian dinar 
u 
s 
steel has not generally used derivative instruments to manage this risk 
however  u 
s 
steel has made limited use of forward currency contracts to manage exposure to certain currency price fluctuations 
at december   u 
s 
steel had open euro forward sale contracts for both us dollars total notional value of approximately million and slovak koruna total notional value of approximately million 
a percent increase in the december  euro forward rates would result in a million charge to income 
safe harbor u 
s 
steel s quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk include forward looking statements with respect to management s opinion about risks associated with u 
s 
steel s use of derivative instruments 
these statements are based on certain assumptions with respect to market prices and industry supply of and demand for steel products and certain raw materials 
to the extent that these assumptions prove to be inaccurate  future outcomes with respect to u 
s 
steel s hedging programs may differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements
