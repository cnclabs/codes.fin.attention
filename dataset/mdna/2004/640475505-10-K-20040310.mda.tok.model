item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations company background we are a leading provider of supply chain management solutions for the healthcare industry 
through a combination of technology  information and services  our web based supply chain management solutions are designed to enable efficient collaboration among hospitals and suppliers  helping them to reduce operational inefficiencies and lower costs 
the healthcare supply chain has a number of characteristics  including its large size  high degree of fragmentation  reliance on disparate technologies  dependence on manual processes and highly complex pricing structures  which have led to major inefficiencies 
these inefficiencies lead to slower  error prone transactions and increased overhead and costs for suppliers and hospitals 
in addition  the participants in the healthcare industry are under significant competitive and cost pressures and are seeking ways to increase efficiencies in their supply chain to improve their overall margins 
our web based solutions make it easier for the participants in the healthcare supply chain  principally hospitals  suppliers and gpos  to improve communication  receive comprehensive and accurate information  improve day to day operations  accelerate order and contract implementations  enhance strategic planning and gain organization wide visibility into supply chain activities 
using our solutions  these organizations can improve efficiencies  increase revenue  reduce costs and improve capital allocation 
strategic relationships in  we entered into a year strategic outsourcing and operating agreement  or outsourcing agreement  with vha  uhc  novation and healthcare purchasing partners international  llc  or hppi 
under the outsourcing agreement  we agreed to provide specific functionality to marketplace novation  novation s e commerce marketplace 
novation agreed to act as our exclusive agent to negotiate agreements with suppliers to offer their equipment  products  supplies and services through marketplaces sponsored by novation or hppi  including marketplace novation 
vha  uhc  hppi and novation each agreed not to develop or promote any other internet based exchange for the acquisition or disposal of products  supplies  equipment or services by healthcare provider organizations 
in connection with the outsourcing agreement  we issued in july million and million shares of our common stock to vha and uhc  respectively 
we also issued warrants to vha and uhc  allowing vha and uhc the opportunity to earn up to million and  additional shares of our common stock  respectively  over a four year period by meeting specified performance targets 
these performance targets are based upon the historical purchasing volume of vha and uhc member healthcare organizations that sign up to use marketplace novation 
in october  we exchanged vha s warrant for million restricted shares of our common stock and  in january  we exchanged the unexercised portion of uhc s performance warrant  to purchase  shares of our common stock  for  restricted shares of our common stock 
both vha s and uhc s restricted shares are subject to forfeiture if the performance targets contained in their original warrants are not met 
as of december   vha and uhc had earned a significant amount of the restricted shares that are subject to forfeiture  and we expect them to earn substantially all of the total restricted shares by the expiration of the four year period in june we have amended and restated the outsourcing agreement from time to time 
under the current agreement  the fourth amended and restated outsourcing and operating agreement  or fourth amended agreement  effective august we and novation have agreed to a fee level that is based on the percentage of marketplace volume  including supply chain data captured for marketplace novation member purchases but not facilitated by our connectivity solution 
this fee level is determined based on a tiered fee structure under which the incremental fee per dollar of marketplace volume decreases as the marketplace volume increases  the payments novation is required to make under the fee level provision are subject to quarterly maximums 
during  we generated sufficient marketplace volume to earn the quarterly maximum payments  which totaled million for the year ended december  beginning in the first 
table of contents quarter of fiscal  the quarterly maximum payment is million in each quarter through the expiration of the initial term of the fourth amended agreement in march under previous versions of the outsourcing agreement  the quarterly maximums were dependent on revenue generated by novation  we agreed to share revenue with novation in certain instances  including revenue related to the distribution or licensing of software and other technology solutions 
to date  no such revenue sharing has been triggered and we do not expect to share any revenue in the foreseeable future  novation s rights to view data from any customer are restricted to data from novation and hppi sponsored marketplaces only  we have primary responsibility for recruiting  contracting and managing relationships with suppliers regarding their use of supply chain solutions through marketplace novation and sole responsibility for generating revenue from those suppliers  and we must continue to meet detailed service level and functionality requirements  including new and enhanced functionality  for marketplace novation 
in january  we entered into stock purchase agreements with vha  uhc and i technologies  inc  under which these entities purchased a total of million shares of our common stock at a price of per share 
we raised a total of million prior to costs associated with the sale of the shares  which were million  including an advisory fee to our investment bankers 
in april  we entered into a revolving credit agreement with vha  which has subsequently been amended 
funds that we borrow under this credit agreement bear interest at the prime rate plus per year and are secured by substantially all of our assets 
any amounts outstanding under this line of credit  both principal and interest  are due and payable on december   if not repaid sooner 
the line of credit agreement also contains provisions that could potentially reduce the maximum we could borrow under the credit agreement in the event we entered into certain types of other debt or equity financing arrangements 
in december  we repaid all amounts outstanding under the line of credit  including accrued interest  and amended the line of credit to reduce its capacity from the original million to million 
during the years ended december   and  the fees paid to us by novation totaled million  million and million  respectively 
the fees paid to us by novation in each of the last six quarters  including the quarter ended december   were limited by the quarterly maximums in those periods 
based on the levels of marketplace volume we are currently achieving  we expect that the fees we earn from novation will continue to be limited by the quarterly maximums  above which additional volume will not result in increased fees 
as a result  we expect to receive million in fees from novation in acquisitions med contrax and med ecorp in july  we acquired substantially all of the assets of data management companies medcontrax and med ecorp 
medcontrax and med ecorp offered subscription based services that identified market opportunities  measured market shares and evaluated sales force performance and management  as well as provided subscription based contract management and administration products and services 
the total purchase price was million in cash 
the acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and  accordingly  the purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed on the basis of their respective fair values on the acquisition date 
in the allocation of the purchase price      and  were allocated to tangible assets  a proprietary database  developed technology  goodwill and acquired in process research and development  respectively 
the proprietary database and developed technology are being amortized over their estimated useful lives of three years and five years  respectively 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 goodwill is not being amortized  but is being assessed for impairment at least annually  or whenever an event or change in 
table of contents circumstance indicates that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
the  allocated to acquired in process research and development represented the estimated fair value  based on risk adjusted cash flows  related to incomplete research and development projects 
at the date of the acquisition  the development of these projects had not yet reached technological feasibility  and the research and development in progress had no alternative future use 
accordingly  the  was expensed as of the acquisition date 
the results of operations of medcontrax and med ecorp are included in our consolidated statements of operations from the date of acquisition 
revelocity in december  we acquired substantially all of the assets of revelocity  a developer of web based software products that provided supply chain management capabilities for hospitals and healthcare suppliers to help them streamline procurement processes  manage inventories  track project and patient costs  leverage bar coding efficiencies in internal distribution and share replenishment demand information 
the stock based portion of the consideration for the acquisition was contingent upon the amount of revenue generated by the acquired business from the date of acquisition through december  we issued an aggregate of  shares of our common stock valued at million as consideration for the acquisition 
these shares were valued as earned 
accordingly  the amount of goodwill recognized in this acquisition was adjusted as the additional shares were earned 
the purchase price also included forgiveness of a  note receivable from revelocity and the assumption of liabilities of  the total purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed on the basis of their respective fair values on the acquisition date 
in the initial allocation of the purchase price   million and million were allocated to tangible assets  developed technology and goodwill  respectively 
an additional  of goodwill was recorded in subsequent to the initial purchase price allocation as a result of the level of stock based contingent consideration earned 
the developed technology is being amortized over its estimated useful life of five years 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill is not being amortized  but is being assessed for impairment at least annually  or whenever an event or change in circumstance indicates that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
the results of operations of revelocity are included in our consolidated statements of operations from the date of acquisition 
other matters since inception  we have incurred significant losses and  as of december   had an accumulated deficit of million 
we have a limited operating history on which to base an evaluation of our business and prospects 
you must consider our prospects in light of the risks  expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in the early stages of development  particularly companies in new and rapidly evolving markets such as the market for web based supply chain management solutions for the healthcare industry 
to address these risks  we must  among other things  expand our customer base  enter into new strategic alliances  increase the functionality of our solutions  implement and successfully execute our business and marketing strategy  respond to competitive developments and attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel 
we may not be successful in addressing these risks  and our failure to do so could seriously harm our business 
critical accounting policies and estimates we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition  amortization period of capitalized partnership costs  estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable and notes receivable  estimating litigation reserves and other accrued liabilities  and valuation of goodwill and intangible assets 

table of contents revenue recognition we derive our revenue from the solutions we provide to our customers 
these solutions include neoforma oms  neoforma cms  neoforma dms and neoforma mms 
related party revenue 
related party revenue consists of fees paid by novation under the fee level provisions of the outsourcing agreement  as amended  in connection with neoforma oms and neoforma cms that we provide as part of marketplace novation  and hospital implementation fees earned by us when vha and uhc member hospitals that have contracted with us are connected to marketplace novation 
hospital implementation fees are generated from vha and uhc member hospitals that pay a one time fee for implementation services when we connect them to marketplace novation 
upon completion of the connection to marketplace novation  we recognize the implementation fees ratably over the period of our agreement with the hospitals  which is typically two to three years 
as a result of the application of emerging issues task force abstract  or eitf  no 
 we offset the amortization of capitalized partnership costs resulting from the equity consideration provided to related parties against the fees received from those related parties  thereby resulting in a reduction of the related party revenue reported 
as a result  our reported related party revenue does not reflect the level of fees received from related parties for those services 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the impact of the application of eitf no 
on our reported revenue 
non related party revenue 
non related party revenue consists primarily of services fees  subscription fees  transaction based fees and software license fees related to the sale and support of our solutions 
revenue is recognized when evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  fees are fixed or determinable and collection is probable 
services fees are primarily generated from suppliers  gpos and healthcare providers that purchase neoforma dms and neoforma cms and include data cleansing services  market intelligence services and contract administration and reporting services 
as our data cleansing services are generally provided on a project basis  with most projects taking in excess of days to complete  and given the inherent risks with regards to estimating costs  we recognize services fees paid by providers and gpos related to these types of agreements upon project completion 
services fees relating to market intelligence services and contract administration and reporting services are received for the delivery of specified reports or other data 
we recognize the services fees related to these agreements upon delivery of the reports or  for time based access to reports or data  over the period we provide that access to the customer under the agreement 
subscription based fees are generated from suppliers that pay a monthly  quarterly or annual subscription fee that is not based on marketplace volume in connection with the services we provide as part of neoforma oms and neoforma cms 
for these suppliers  we recognize these subscription fees ratably over the period of the subscription agreement  as that is the period over which the services are performed 
we also generate subscription fees through other agreements with suppliers that participate in marketplace novation that pay a periodic subscription fee calculated as a percentage of their periodic product sales under novation contracts 
for the majority of these suppliers  their novation contract sales information is generally not available for approximately days after the products are sold 
for these suppliers  we utilize estimates of their novation contract sales as a basis for recognizing revenue 
as our estimation process is based on historical novation contract sales data for each supplier  and as those estimates are updated monthly  we believe that we have adequately demonstrated the ability to reasonably estimate the basis for these fees for revenue recognition purposes 
as such  we recognize the revenue in the period that the contracted products are sold 
transaction based fees represent the negotiated percentage of the purchase price  or marketplace volume  of products in transactions between signed participants in marketplace novation that are purchased by hospitals utilizing our connection solution  neoconnect  in connection with the services we provide as part of neoforma 
table of contents oms and neoforma cms 
the gross marketplace value of a transaction is the price of a product as agreed to by the buyer and the supplier 
we recognize revenue for transaction fees on a net basis  as we do not believe that we act as a principal in connection with orders to be shipped or delivered by a supplier to a buyer because  among other things  we do not i establish the prices of products paid by buyers  ii take title to products to be shipped from the supplier to the buyer  nor do we take title to or assume the risk of loss of products prior to or during shipment  iii bear the credit and collections risk of the buyer to the supplier  or iv bear the risk that the product will be returned 
software license fees are generated primarily from suppliers and healthcare providers that license neoforma mms  either directly via the purchase of a license to the software or by entering into a subscription agreement with us whereby we provide them access to a hosted version of the software 
we also have generated software license revenue related to a technology license agreement we entered into in august with ghx 
the revenue related to this agreement is being recognized ratably over the three year term of the agreement 
we apply the provisions of statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition  as amended  to all transactions involving the sale of software products 
we recognize revenue from the sale of software licenses when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been delivered  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is probable 
for contracts with multiple obligations eg  license  maintenance and other services  revenue is allocated to each component of the contract using the residual method based on the price when sold separately 
we recognize revenue allocated to maintenance fees  including amounts allocated from product revenue  for ongoing customer support and product updates ratably over the period of the maintenance contract 
payments for maintenance fees are generally made in advance and are non refundable 
for revenue allocated to consulting services  and consulting services sold separately  such as training  we recognize revenue as the related services are performed 
revenue from hosted services is recognized as the services are performed 
amortization period of capitalized partnership costs capitalized partnership costs consist of the fair value of common stock and restricted common stock issued and capitalized in connection with our outsourcing agreement  as amended  with novation  vha  uhc and hppi 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of both the outsourcing agreement  as amended  and the related stock that has been issued and capitalized 
the initial shares of common stock issued to vha and uhc in connection with the outsourcing agreement were capitalized at their fair value on the date of issuance and are being amortized ratably over the estimated useful life of the agreement 
at the time of issuance  management estimated the useful life of the year agreement to be five years for accounting purposes 
the primary basis for the five year estimate was the significant risk associated with whether this new relationship would continue for the full year term of the agreement in the form in which it was originally contemplated  represented among others  by we were obligated to meet numerous functionality deliverables  many of which had never been built before  the healthcare e commerce market did not exist and we had not yet connected our first hospital or first supplier  the technology that we were obligated to build was wholly unproven  and certain contractual terms  such as voting arrangements  had a term of five years  while others were expected to only provide a temporary benefits  such as exclusivity rights 
management periodically assesses the useful life of this asset to ensure that any changes in our relationship with novation  vha and uhc  or any changes in the broader market conditions that may impact the useful life of the agreement  are factored into our estimate of the useful life of the agreement and the resulting amortization 
as of december   management continued to believe that the initial estimated useful life of the agreement of five years was appropriate given the remaining uncertainty with regards to the continuing high level of 
table of contents performance and future functionality deliverables required of us under the terms of the outsourcing agreement  as amended 
estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable and notes receivable our management must make estimates of the collectability of both our accounts receivable and our notes receivable 
management analyzes accounts receivable and historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
as of december   our total accounts receivable balance was million  net of allowance for doubtful accounts of  management also analyzes the financial condition of debtors for which we hold notes receivable based on all available information 
if the financial condition of our customers or debtors were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances might be required 
as of december   our notes receivable balance was million  against which no allowance has been provided 
estimating litigation reserves and other accrued liabilities management s estimate of the liability related to our pending litigation is based on claims and other information known to us and management s assessment of the probability of loss 
as additional information becomes available  we reassess and revise our estimates as appropriate 
revisions in our estimates of the potential liability could materially impact our results of operation and financial position in the period such revisions are made 
as of december   we had accrued  for potential liabilities related to our pending litigation 
valuation of goodwill and intangible assets we assess the impairment of intangible assets  which currently consist of capitalized partnership costs and acquired database  developed technology and customer lists  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following loss of a major supplier or strategic partner  significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  or a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of the intangible asset 
if we determine that the carrying value of an intangible asset may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we will measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
capitalized partnership costs  net of amortization  and acquisition related intangible assets  net of amortization  amounted to million and million  respectively  as of december  in addition  we assess goodwill for impairment at least annually and whenever an event or change in circumstance indicates that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following our market capitalization falls below our net book value  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  
table of contents unanticipated competition  or the testing for recoverability under statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
of a significant asset group within a reporting unit 
if we determine that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable based upon our annual impairment test or the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we would determine the fair value of our reporting unit utilizing discounted cash flows and relative market multiples for comparable businesses 
we would then compare the fair value of our reporting unit to its carrying value 
if this evaluation indicated that impairment might exist for the reporting unit  we would then compare the carrying amount of goodwill in the reporting unit to the implied fair value of the goodwill to determine the amount of any impairment loss 
goodwill amounted to million at december  results of operations overview as our operations have grown  the fees we receive from customers and our recognized revenue have also increased 
our fees from related parties increased from million in to million in and to million in however  as a result of the application of eitf no 
 under which we offset related party revenue by amortization of partnership costs  we eliminated  and of related party revenue in  and  respectively see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the impact of the application of eitf no 

our reported revenue increased from to and from to in  and  one single customer represented  and  respectively  of our revenue 
because of the impact of eitf no 
on our related party revenue  our total revenue growth has been a result of increases in non related party revenue 
in as compared to  this growth in non related party revenue was primarily due to increases in revenue from solutions we sell to suppliers and from sales of neoforma dms to hospitals 
we expect certain revenue trends that our business has experienced in the past two years to continue in in  we expect our revenue to continue to grow as a result of increases in non related party revenue from sales of our solutions to hospital  gpo and supplier customers 
in addition  we expect that the fees we generate in connection with our related party relationship in will be fully offset by amortization of partnership costs  resulting in zero reported related party revenue during the year 
additionally  under the terms of the fourth amended agreement  there is a scheduled decrease in the quarterly maximum payments from novation  which total million in as compared to million in based on the levels of marketplace volume we are currently achieving  we expect the fees we earn from novation will continue to be limited to the quarterly maximums 
as a result  we expect lower total fees from related parties in as compared to under the terms of the fourth amended agreement  additional marketplace volume above a certain level does not result in incremental fees to us from novation 
while our revenue has increased over the last three years  our operating expenses have decreased significantly over that same period 
in  we incurred a total of million in expenses related to amortization of intangibles assets  amortization of partnership costs  write off of purchased software  restructuring  impairment of intangibles  impairment of assets held for divestiture and write down of non marketable investments 
in and  these expenses totaled million and million  respectively 
further  amortization of deferred compensation decreased from million in to million and million in and  respectively 
in addition to the decreases in these expenses over the last three years  we have improved our operational execution and the use of our resources 
despite the decrease in total expenses over the past three years  we have made a number of investments to support our growth  primarily in personnel  and the number of our employees increased from as of december  to a high of as of november the growth in the number of our employees resulted in increases in total salaries we paid to our employees in both and however  as a result of reduced bonus levels in 
table of contents as compared to  our total payroll costs were flat in relative to at the beginning of  we completed an internal reorganization  under which we reallocated a significant portion of our workforce to more directly facing customer positions  resulting in certain operating expense categories declining and selling and marketing expenses increasing in as compared to additionally  during the year  we made investments in selling and marketing and product development to enhance our solutions and to grow our non related party revenue  resulting in increases in expenses in these categories during at the end of  to lower our overall costs and to enable us to invest in certain areas to support our anticipated growth  we reduced the size of our workforce by approximately individuals 
in  we do not expect our operating expenses to continue to decrease as they have in prior years 
we expect total operating expenses to be relatively flat in as compared to  and we expect a decrease in depreciation expense to be offset by an increase in amortization of partnership costs classified as an operating expense 
the expected reduction in depreciation is the result of certain large software licenses acquired in being fully depreciated as of december  the expected increase in amortization of partnership costs classified as an operating expense is the result of the anticipated decrease in fees from related parties  which will result in a decrease in the amount of the offset to the gross amortization of partnership costs

as a result of the adoption of eitf no 
 amortization of partnership costs resulting from the equity consideration issued to vha and uhc  the owners of novation  is classified as an offset against related party revenue  as opposed to being classified as an operating expense  up to the lesser of such related party revenue or amortization of partnership costs in any given period 
due to the offset of million and million of amortization of partnership costs against related party revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively  there was no net related party revenue for either period

see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the impact of the application of eitf no 
during the remaining term of the fourth amended agreement  the quarterly maximums on the fees we may earn from novation are million per year 
as we expect gross amortization of partnership costs to be in excess of million in  we expect related party revenue to be in non related party revenue 
non related party revenue includes revenue earned from non related party healthcare providers  gpos and suppliers  including revenue from solutions sold to vha and uhc member hospitals outside the scope of the fourth amended agreement  as well as periods governed by previous versions of the agreement 
non related party revenue increased from to primarily due to increased revenue generated from suppliers related to their participation in marketplace novation  an increase in revenue related to the sale of a license to ghx to utilize portions of our neoconnect platform and revenue generated from our market intelligence and contract administration and reporting services for suppliers 
these market intelligence and contract administration and reporting services were introduced in connection with our acquisition of substantially all of the assets of medcontrax and med ecorp in july these increases in were partially offset by a decrease of million as a result of the divestiture of certain assets in late substantially all of the non related party revenue for was related to the divested assets 
additionally  revenue decreased by  from to as a result of the divestiture of our equipmd  inc operations in march in  non related party revenue increased as compared with  primarily due to increases in revenue generated from sales of our data cleansing services to hospitals and market intelligence services for suppliers  both components of neoforma dms  sales of our solutions to suppliers related to their participation in marketplace novation and from new revenue generated from neoforma mms

table of contents operating expenses cost of services year ended december  percentage change to to in thousands cost of services cost of services consists primarily of the costs to perform hospital and supplier implementation activities  personnel and other related costs associated with delivering neoforma dms and direct costs to obtain data for our solutions 
these expenditures consist primarily of technology costs  software licenses  salaries and other personnel expenses for our services personnel and fees for independent contractors and consultants and companies to which we outsource services 
the decrease in cost of services from to was primarily due to the fact that in the latter half of and in fiscal  our services group utilized fewer contractors and consultants  resulting in a reduction of the related expenses by million in additionally  the number of full time employees in our services group decreased from at the beginning of to as of december   although it subsequently increased to as of december  as a result  payroll related expenses decreased by million during as compared to the decrease in cost of services from to was primarily due to a decrease in payroll related costs of million due to a decrease in bonus levels and a  decrease in allocable expenses  including depreciation and deferred compensation amortization  allocated to cost of services

general and administrative expenses decreased from to primarily due to a million decrease in deferred compensation expense allocated to the general and administrative group and a million decrease in payroll related costs that were primarily a result of reduced bonus levels 
amortization of intangibles 
we amortize intangibles on a straight line basis over a period of three to five years 
amortization of intangibles decreased from million for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  during the fourth quarter of  we wrote down the intangible assets related to our acquisition of pharos technologies  inc  or pharos  and substantially all of the intangible assets relating to our acquisition of equipmd  operated as neomd  as a result of our plans to divest these non core operations 
as a result of our divestiture of these operations  we did not incur amortization expenses related to pharos and neomd after during  we recorded intangible assets  excluding goodwill  of million in connection with the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of medcontrax  med ecorp and revelocity 
the amortization of intangibles of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  related to these intangible assets 
the increase in amortization of intangibles from to was due to the fact that the medcontrax and med ecorp acquisitions occurred in july and the revelocity acquisition occurred in december we expect the amortization of these intangible assets in 
table of contents to be relatively flat as compared to  as these assets are being amortized on a straight line basis and represented a full year of amortization for all of these intangible assets 
amortization of partnership costs year ended december  percentage change to to in thousands gross amortization of partnership costs amortization of partnership costs offset against related party revenue amortization of partnership costs classified as an operating expense amortization of partnership costs represents the amortization of the shares of our common stock issued to vha and uhc

the value of the initial common stock issued is being amortized over a five year estimated useful life 
the restricted common stock is being valued  and the related valuation is being capitalized  as the shares are earned 
the capitalized partnership costs relating to the restricted common stock are being amortized over the term of the agreement with the healthcare organizations that resulted in the shares being earned  generally two to three years 
the decrease in amortization of partnership costs classified as an operating expense from to was the result of the increase in fees received from related parties as  under eitf no 
 amortization of partnership costs is classified as an offset against related party revenue  as opposed to being classified as an operating expense  up to the lesser of such related party revenue or amortization of partnership costs in any given period 
the decrease in amortization of partnership costs classified as an operating expense from to was due to a decrease in gross amortization of partnership costs 
the amortization of partnership costs reported as an operating expense is reflected as an adjustment to reconcile net loss to cash from operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows 
under eitf no 
 we account for the fees being paid by novation under the terms of the outsourcing agreement and subsequent amendments as if they were payments made for the equity consideration we provided to vha and uhc as opposed to payments for services 
as a result  the amortization of partnership costs that is offset against related party revenue is reported as a cash flow from financing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows 
although there were incremental partnership costs capitalized from the date we entered into the outsourcing agreement  as amended  through december  related to the earning of the restricted common stock by vha and uhc  certain of the capitalized partnership costs relating to the restricted stock earned by vha and uhc when the first hospitals signed up to participate in marketplace novation in had been fully amortized as of december  those partnership costs that had been fully amortized as of december  were generally capitalized at higher levels than those that have been capitalized in more recent periods due to the fact that i there has been a relatively lower number of restricted shares earned by vha and uhc during more recent periods and ii the capitalized value of each restricted share earned was higher in historical periods than in more recent periods 
as a result  the overall gross amortization of partnership costs associated with the restricted common stock decreased in the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  we expect the total gross amortization of partnership costs  excluding the impact of eitf  to decrease slightly in as compared to however  net of the offset of related party revenue required under eitf  we expect that amortization of partnership costs classified as an operating expense will increase in as compared to we expect this increase will be due to decreases in the level of related

amortization of deferred compensation year ended december  in thousands gross amortization of deferred compensation reversal of amortization of deferred compensation as a result of employee terminations amortization of deferred compensation deferred compensation represents the aggregate difference  at the date of grant  between the cost to the employee of equity based compensation and the estimated fair value of the underlying equity instrument 
in the case of stock options  deferred compensation is calculated as the difference between the exercise price of the option and the deemed fair value of the underlying stock on the date the option was granted 
we amortize deferred compensation from stock option grants on an accelerated basis over the vesting period of the underlying options  generally four years 
in connection with the grant of stock options to employees during fiscal  and  prior to our ipo  we recorded deferred compensation of million 
amortization of deferred compensation is reversed for any amounts recognized on options that do not vest due to employee terminations or employee attrition

amortization of deferred compensation is reversed for any amounts recognized on shares of restricted stock that do not vest due to employee terminations 
during the years ended december   
table of contents and  we recorded  and  respectively  in reductions of the deferred compensation as a result of employee terminations and the resulting forfeiture of restricted stock 
we recorded amortization of deferred compensation related to these shares of  million and million during the years ended december   and  respectively 
the remaining total deferred compensation of  at december  is expected to be amortized as follows  during fiscal and  during fiscal the amortization expense relates to options and restricted stock awarded to employees and officers in all operating expense categories 
the amount of amortization of deferred compensation has been separately allocated to these operating expense categories in the consolidated statements of operations 
we expect we will continue to use restricted stock grants as a means of compensation for employees in as we have in prior years 
as a result  we expect to capitalize and to amortize additional deferred compensation in related to those grants

equipmd was sold in the first quarter of no restructuring charges related to these operations were recorded during the years ended december  or impairment of intangibles 
impairment of intangibles represents the reduction of the carrying value of our investment in pharos to our estimate of its fair market value as of december  during fiscal  we were unsuccessful in our efforts to identify a buyer for the technology we acquired as part of our acquisition of pharos 
in addition  in the fourth quarter of  we terminated our use of the technology acquired 
based on these factors  we concluded that the carrying value of the intangible assets was not recoverable as of december  as a result  we recorded an impairment charge of million during the fourth quarter of to write off these intangible assets 
there were no such impairment charges during the years ended december  or impairment of assets held for divestiture

com  llc  formerly known as intramedix  llc  a privately held corporation 
due to uncertainties regarding the financial position of careportal  the resulting decline in the value of this investment and our belief that the decline in value was other than temporary in nature  we concluded that the investment in careportal had no future realizable value as of december  in december  we received notice from attainia  inc that it had completed a round of financing at an offering price less than the cost per share of our investment in attainia 
as such  we wrote down our investment in attainia by  during the year ended december  net gain loss on divested businesses

as a result of the termination of the acquisition  we expensed  in acquisition related costs that were previously capitalized during the due diligence and acquisition process  including legal advisory fees and 
table of contents financial and accounting fees  which no longer had any realizable future value 
as the termination occurred in november  we expensed all such costs in the fourth quarter of the year ended december  income taxes

these net operating loss carryforwards expire on various dates through a valuation allowance has been recorded for the entire deferred tax asset as a result of uncertainties regarding the realization of the asset due to our lack of earnings history 
federal and state tax laws impose significant restrictions on the amount of the net operating loss carryforwards that we may utilize in a given year 
under the tax reform act of  the amount of benefits from net operating loss carryforwards may be impaired or limited in certain circumstances

in and  we received  and million  respectively  in sublease payments from the corporation 
in late  this corporation notified us that due to financial difficulties  it would be unable to comply with the terms of its sublease commitment in and as a result  we entered into a settlement agreement with the corporation on january  whereby we retained the security deposits and other amounts securing the sublease obligation  received payment of an additional  from the corporation as a settlement and retained effectively all of the furniture and leasehold improvements present in the subleased space 
in addition  the corporation agreed to vacate the facility and release any claim on it as of that date

we have agreed to hold the other party harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations or covenants  or out of intellectual property infringement or other claims made against them 
these agreements may limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim 
in addition  we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors  and our bylaws contain similar indemnification obligations to our agents 
it is not possible to determine our maximum potential liability under these indemnification agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement 
historically  payments made by us under these agreements have not had a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
as discussed in note to the notes to consolidated financial statements  we adopted eitf no 
effective january  as a result of the application of eitf no 
 we have classified certain amortization costs associated with capitalized equity consideration provided to vha and uhc in connection with the outsourcing agreement  as amended  as an offset against related party revenue from vha  uhc and novation 
this treatment results in the offset of non cash amortization of partnership costs against related party revenue up to the lesser of such related party revenue or amortization of partnership costs in any period 
any amortization of partnership costs in excess of related party revenue in any period is classified as an operating expense and is reflected as an adjustment to reconcile net loss to cash from operating activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows 
under eitf no 
 we account for the fees being paid by novation under the terms of the outsourcing agreement  as amended  as if they were payments made for the equity consideration we provided to vha and uhc as opposed to payments for services 
as a result  the amortization of partnership costs that is offset against related party revenue is reported as a cash flow from financing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows 
net cash used in operating activities was million  million and million  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
net cash used in operating activities for the years ended december   and primarily related to cash utilized to fund net losses and changes in our working capital

net cash provided by financing activities for the years ended december  and primarily related to fees received from novation under the fee level provisions of the outsourcing agreement  as amended  partially offset by repayments of notes payable 
we currently anticipate that our available funds  consisting of cash and cash equivalents  combined with those funds we expect to generate in and funds available to us through our line of credit  will be sufficient to meet our anticipated needs for working capital and capital expenditures through at least the next months 
our future long term capital needs will depend significantly on the rate of growth of our business  the timing of expanded service offerings  the success of these services once they are launched and our ability to adjust our operating expenses to an appropriate level if the growth rate of our business is slower than expected 
hospitals and suppliers might not accept our business model of providing web based supply chain management solutions for the healthcare industry and  as a result  we may not succeed in increasing our revenue and controlling our expenses to the extent necessary to be cash flow positive during and beyond 
any projections of future long term cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty 
if our available funds and cash generated from operations are insufficient to satisfy our long term liquidity requirements  we might need to seek additional sources of funding  such as selling additional equity or debt securities or obtaining additional lines of credit 
we also might need to curtail expansion of our services  including reductions in our staffing levels and related expenses  or potentially liquidate selected assets 
if our management decides that it is in our best interest to raise cash to strengthen our balance sheet  broaden our investor base  increase the liquidity of our stock or for any other reason  we may decide to issue equity or debt  even if all of our current funding sources remain available to us 
if we issue additional securities to raise funds  those securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of the rights of our common stock and our stockholders may experience dilution 
we cannot be certain that additional financing will be available to us on favorable terms when required  or at all

table of contents factors that may affect future operating results the risks described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks not presently known to us  or that we currently deem immaterial  may also impair our business operations 
our business  financial condition or results of operations may be seriously harmed by any of these risks 
if participants in the healthcare supply chain do not accept our business model of providing solutions designed to improve efficiencies in the healthcare supply chain  demand for our solutions may not develop as we expect and the price of our common stock may decline we have focused our efforts on developing solutions that address the inefficiencies in the healthcare supply chain 
this business model is new and unproven and depends upon participants in this market adopting a new way of doing business and exchanging information 
participants  other than vha and uhc member hospitals  have been reluctant to accept our relatively new and unproven approach  which may not be consistent with their existing internal organization and procurement and sale processes 
some participants may prefer to use traditional methods of doing business  such as using paper catalogs and exchanging information in person or by phone 
if participants in the healthcare supply chain do not accept our business model  demand for our solutions may not develop as we expect  and the price of our common stock could decline 
our main source of business is derived from the solutions we provide through marketplace novation  and we rely on our relationship with novation  vha and uhc to drive participation in marketplace novation 
as a result  our business may be seriously harmed if these relationships are materially altered or terminated we derive the substantial majority of our fees from the solutions we provide through marketplace novation 
we have relied  and expect to continue to rely  significantly on our relationship with novation  vha and uhc to bring hospitals and suppliers to marketplace novation 
we rely on novation to assist us in attracting suppliers to marketplace novation and  if novation is unable to attract a sufficient number of suppliers  the value of marketplace novation to hospitals will be substantially decreased and our business will suffer 
we rely significantly on vha and uhc to assist us in recruiting and retaining hospitals to marketplace novation 
these partners use a variety of marketing initiatives and financial incentives to drive adoption and use of marketplace novation and our solutions by hospitals 
if these partners cease using such marketing initiatives and financial incentives  our ability to recruit hospitals to marketplace novation also may be seriously harmed 
under the fourth amended agreement  we must meet detailed functionality and service level requirements 
if we are unable to achieve these required levels of functionality within a required time period  we may be required to pay significant liquidated damages or the fourth amended agreement could be terminated  which would seriously harm our business and financial results 
our solutions and fee model are untested and their acceptance is not assured our solutions are either of recent introduction or are currently under development  and their acceptance by our existing and potential customers is therefore untested and uncertain 
our current business plan includes seeking a large portion of our revenue from participating suppliers 
obtaining the acceptance from such suppliers to pay our fees has proven difficult 
if suppliers do not accept our solutions or our fee model  it would have a serious negative impact on our business 
we have a history of losses  anticipate incurring losses in the foreseeable future and may never achieve profitability we have experienced losses from operations in each period since our inception  including a net loss of million for the year ended december  in addition  as of december   we had an accumulated 
table of contents deficit of million 
we have not achieved profitability  and we expect to continue to incur operating losses in future quarters  primarily as a result of costs relating to the amortization of the stock we issued to vha and uhc and the costs and expenses relating to executing our strategy of developing solutions and services to address healthcare supply chain inefficiencies 
we cannot assure you that we will ever be profitable 
our operating results are difficult to predict  and if we fail to meet the expectations of investors or securities analysts  the market price of our common stock will likely decline our operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and are difficult to predict because of a number of factors 
these factors include the fees we collect from suppliers  changes in the fees we charge users of our solutions  the number and timing of new suppliers that sign up to use our solutions and our ability to implement and train them  the timing of and expenses incurred in enhancing our solutions  the timing and size of any future acquisitions  the timing and size of neoforma dms deals  and the amount of related party revenue we offset by amortization of partnership costs 
fluctuations in our operating results may cause us to fail to meet the expectations of investors or securities analysts 
if this were to happen  the market price of our common stock would likely decline 
if our hospital and supplier customers refuse to provide us with consent to use their transaction data  severely restrict our use of their transaction data  decide to not participate in marketplace novation or decline to use our solutions because of concerns about potential release of such data to novation  our business strategy may not succeed we expect to derive a portion of our future revenue from information services that require the use of data from our hospital and supplier customers 
to execute on our data services strategy  we must be able to secure the consent of our customers to various uses of their data 
to secure such consent  we must be able to assure these customers that we will at all times protect the confidentiality of their data 
if we are unable to provide such assurance  or if we fail  or are perceived by our customers to have failed  to meet the levels of assurance that we provided  our ability to execute on our data services strategy may be seriously impaired 
in addition  we must be able to abide by various contractual provisions we have agreed to concerning our ability to aggregate and blind data in such a way that the data cannot be used to identify any participants to transactions underlying the data 
our inability to do so would potentially subject us to liability for contractual damages and seriously impair our data services strategy 
if potential customers are concerned about novation using their transaction data  they may decide to forgo use of our solutions  and this could seriously impair our ability to generate revenue in the future 
if we are unable to safeguard the security and privacy of the confidential information of our customers  these customers may discontinue using our solutions a significant barrier to the widespread adoption of e commerce is the secure transmission of personally identifiable information of internet users as well as other confidential information over public networks 
if any compromise or breach of security were to occur  it could harm our reputation and expose us to possible liability 
we support encrypted communications protocols and encrypt certain information on our servers to protect user information during transactions  and we employ a security consulting firm that periodically tests our security measures 
despite these efforts  a party may be able to circumvent our security measures and could 
table of contents misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions in our operations 
we may be required to make significant expenditures to protect against security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by any breaches and under certain contracts with customers would be liable for contractual damages due to security breaches 
if we are unable to enhance the functionality of our solutions  potential customers may not choose to utilize our solutions  which would harm our business if we do not maintain and expand the functionality and reliability of our solutions  potential customers may not use them 
we must continue to develop the capability to integrate our solutions with our hospital and supplier customers business processes and information systems 
we may incur significant expenses in developing these capabilities and may not succeed in developing them in a timely manner 
in addition  developing the capability to integrate some of our solutions with suppliers and hospitals enterprise software systems will require the continued cooperation of and collaboration with the companies that develop and market these systems 
suppliers and hospitals use a variety of different enterprise software systems provided by third party vendors or developed internally 
this lack of uniformity increases the difficulty and cost of developing the capability to integrate with the systems of a large number of hospitals and suppliers 
failure to provide this capability would limit the efficiencies that our solutions provide and may deter our hospital and supplier customers from using our solutions 
to realize the benefits of our agreement with novation  we are required to integrate the systems of the hospitals purchasing through novation s program 
if the future costs required to integrate these systems are substantially higher than we anticipated  based on our past experience  we may not realize the full benefits of these agreements 
if we were delayed or unable to integrate the systems of these hospitals  our financial situation would be adversely affected 
in addition  under our agreement with novation  we must meet detailed functionality and service level requirements 
to the extent we are unable to or are delayed in providing this functionality  we may be unable to attract hospitals and suppliers to use our solutions and our financial situation may be adversely affected 
we incur significant costs in developing and supporting our solutions and in integrating with hospitals and suppliers information systems  and we may never generate sufficient fees to offset these costs 
because our supply chain partners are also our stockholders or are affiliated with our stockholders  we may find it difficult to attract competing companies to use our solutions our supply chain partners are also our stockholders or are affiliated with our stockholders or have strategic relationships with us 
for example  vha and uhc  the owners of novation  owned million and million shares of our common stock  respectively  as of december  certain of the shares remain subject to restrictions 
as of december   vha and uhc owned and  respectively  of our outstanding shares of common stock assuming they earn all the remaining shares of restricted stock 
these relationships may deter other potential customers  particularly those that compete directly with novation  vha or uhc  from using our solutions due to perceptions of bias in favor of one party over another 
this could limit the array of solutions we offer  damage our reputation and limit our ability to maintain or increase the number of our customers 
our ability to earn fees in future periods from marketplace novation is limited by quarterly maximums  and  as a result  we must generate increased non related party revenue in order to grow our revenue we generate the substantial majority of our fees from marketplace novation 
our ability to earn fees from novation for the solutions we provide in connection with marketplace novation depends on several factors  and the fees are subject to limitation by quarterly maximums 
in  our fees were limited by these quarterly maximums 
we expect that our fees will be limited by these maximums in and our fees may continue to be limited by these maximums in future periods 
consequently  we must generate increased non related party revenue in order to grow our revenue 
in mid  we expect that the significant majority of the capitalized 
table of contents partnership costs will be fully amortized and  as a result  our gaap revenue will increase substantially from one quarter to the next 
however  we still believe that we must generate non related party revenue growth in order to show improved operational results 
if our systems are unable to provide acceptable performance as the use of our solutions increases  we could lose customers  which could harm our business and results of operations we have supported only a limited number and variety of transactions through our solutions compared to the number and variety we expect to process in the future 
our systems may not accommodate increased use while providing acceptable overall performance 
we must continue to expand and adapt our network infrastructure to accommodate increased use of our solutions by our customers  which will be expensive 
if our systems do not continue to provide acceptable performance as use by our customers increases  our reputation may be damaged and we may lose customers 
we expect that a significant portion of the products and services used by hospitals that are sold through marketplace novation will come from a limited number of key manufacturers and distributors  and the loss of a key manufacturer or distributor could result in a significant negative impact on the value of marketplace novation and consequently our business we expect that a significant portion of the products to be sold through and data and fees to be generated from marketplace novation will come as a result of the participation of a limited number of key manufacturers and distributors 
if any of these key manufacturers or distributors cease doing business with us  the fees we generate through marketplace novation could be significantly reduced  the value of marketplace novation to our hospital customers would be reduced and our ability to generate revenue producing data for our customers would also be reduced 
the connectivity agreement that we have with ghx expires in august  and unless this agreement is extended  we may have difficulty ensuring proper connectivity with certain of our supplier customers  or we may have to expend resources re connecting certain suppliers to marketplace novation we signed a three year connectivity agreement  as well as a three year license agreement  with ghx in this agreement will expire in august unless both we and ghx elect to extend it 
some of our supplier customers use ghx to connect to our hospital customers  and without an agreement with ghx  we may have to re establish connectivity with those suppliers  which would cause us to expend resources which may temporarily reduce our ability to collect transaction data and provide timely service to other customers 
we face significant competition  and if we are unable to compete effectively  we may be unable to maintain or expand the number of our customers and our financial position may be adversely affected the market for supply chain management solutions in healthcare is rapidly evolving and highly competitive 
because of the breadth of our solutions  which include order management  contract management  data management and materials management  we have a diverse set of competitors that compete with portions of our overall offering 
to best serve our customers  we sometimes collaborate with our competitors in one segment of the market while competing with them in others 
we believe that as our capabilities grow  we will continue to find areas of opportunity for both collaboration and competition with other companies in the market that target a segment of the overall healthcare supply chain 
our ability to manage these relationships to benefit our hospital  supplier and gpo customers is important to our success 
some of our current and potential competitors include online marketplaces or exchanges targeted at the healthcare supply chain  such as the supplier sponsored ghx  with whom we also have a strategic relationship  suppliers that have created their own offerings to provide supply chain management services to their customers  
table of contents software vendors that offer enterprise resource planning applications  including procurement  to the healthcare market  such as lawson  mckesson  oracle  peoplesoft and sap  gpos that are offering supply chain management services beyond traditional gpo services  such as broadlane and medassets  and companies that provide information solutions or information services to participants in the healthcare supply chain 
competition is likely to intensify as our market matures 
as competitive conditions intensify  our competitors may enter into strategic or commercial relationships with larger  more established healthcare  medical products or internet companies or with each other  secure services and products from suppliers on more favorable terms  devote greater resources to marketing and promotional campaigns  secure exclusive arrangements with hospitals that impede our sales and devote substantially more resources to web site and systems development and research and development 
our current and potential competitors services may achieve greater market acceptance than ours 
our current and potential competitors may have longer operating histories in the healthcare supply chain market  greater name recognition  larger customer bases or greater financial  technical and or marketing resources than we do 
as a result of these factors  our competitors and potential competitors may be able to respond more quickly to market forces  undertake more extensive marketing campaigns for their brands and services and make more attractive offers to hospitals and suppliers  potential employees and strategic allies 
in addition  new technologies may increase competitive pressures 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to expand our hospital and supplier base or retain our current hospitals and supplier customers 
we may not be able to compete successfully against our competitors  and competition could seriously harm our revenue  operating margins and market share 
if we are unable to obtain additional financing for our future capital needs  we may be unable to develop new solutions or enhance the functionality of our existing solutions  expand our operations  respond to competitive pressures or continue our operations as of december   we had million of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  million of restricted cash and no outstanding borrowings or notes payable 
we may need to raise additional funds within the next twelve months  notwithstanding the fact that our vha line of credit remains in place  if for example  we experience larger than anticipated operating losses or if we pursue acquisitions that contain a cash component 
we may try to obtain additional financing by issuing shares of our common stock or convertible debt  either of which could dilute our existing stockholders and may cause our stock price to decline 
if an event of default were to occur under the vha credit agreement  vha could terminate the credit agreement 
if this were to occur  we may need to obtain an alternate source of funding  such as another credit line or an equity or debt financing 
we believe that it would be difficult to obtain additional financing on favorable terms  if at all 
if we were unable to obtain alternate funding under these circumstances  our business would be seriously harmed 
we may make additional acquisitions which could harm our operating results  put a strain on our resources or cause dilution to our stockholders we may decide that it would be in our best interests to make acquisitions to acquire new technologies  enhance or expand our solutions or for other reasons 
integrating newly acquired organizations and technologies into our company could be expensive  time consuming and may strain our resources 
in addition  we may lose 
table of contents current customers if any acquired companies have relationships with competitors of our users 
consequently  we may not be successful in integrating any acquired businesses or technologies and may not achieve anticipated revenue and cost benefits 
in addition  future acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt  contingent liabilities or amortization expenses related to intangible assets  any of which could harm our business and could cause the price of our common stock to decline 
if we are not able to increase recognition of the neoforma brand name  our ability to attract users to our solutions will be limited we believe that recognition and positive perception of the neoforma brand name in the healthcare industry are important to our success 
we intend to continue to invest in marketing programs and initiatives to build the value of our brand 
however  such marketing programs and initiatives may be expensive and may not achieve our desired goal of increasing the positive awareness of the neoforma brand name 
even if recognition of our name increases  it may not lead to an increase in the number of our customers or revenue or offset the expenditures we incurred in increasing our name recognition 
if suppliers do not provide us with timely  accurate  complete and current information about their products and comply with government regulations  we may be exposed to liability or there may be a decrease in the adoption and use of our solutions if suppliers do not provide us in a timely manner with accurate  complete and current information about the products they offer  promptly update this information when it changes and provide us with accurate and timely invoicing data  our databases will be less useful to hospitals 
we cannot guarantee that the product information available from our solutions will always be accurate  complete and current  or that it will comply with governmental regulations 
this could expose us to liability if this incorrect information harms users of our services or results in decreased adoption and use of our solutions 
we also rely on suppliers using our solutions to comply with all applicable governmental regulations  including packaging  labeling  hazardous materials  health and environmental regulations and licensing and record keeping requirements 
any failure of our suppliers to comply with applicable regulations could expose us to civil or criminal liability or could damage our reputation 
if our contract counterparties do not supply us with the necessary data to populate our solutions  our solutions will lose value to our customers we have agreements with suppliers  distributors and other counterparties to populate our solutions with data  and if those suppliers  distributors or other counterparties terminated their agreements with us  we may not be able to provide the same quality or usefulness of solutions that we currently do 
if we could not provide this quality or usefulness  our customers may not value our solutions  and we would likely lose those customers 
if we are unable to attract qualified personnel or retain our executive officers and other key personnel  we may not be able to compete successfully in our industry our success depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified  experienced employees 
we may not be able to compete effectively to retain and attract employees 
as a result  our employees may seek employment with larger  more established companies or companies they perceive to have better prospects 
should we fail to retain or attract qualified personnel  we may not be able to compete successfully in our industry  and our business would be harmed 
we believe that our ability to successfully execute our business strategy will depend on the continued services of executive officers and other key employees 
our employees  including our executive officers  serve at will and may elect to pursue other opportunities at any time 
the loss of any of our executive officers or other key employees could harm our business 

table of contents our growth and organizational changes have placed a strain on our systems and resources  and if we fail to successfully manage any future growth and organizational changes  we may not be able to manage our business efficiently and may be unable to execute our business plans we have  in the past  grown rapidly and will need to continue to grow our business to execute our strategy 
our total number of employees grew from nine as of december  to as of december   although the number of employees has not grown consistently 
these changes  and the growth in the number of our customers and their use of our solutions  have placed significant demands on management as well as on our administrative  operational and financial resources and controls 
any future growth or organizational changes would likely cause similar  and perhaps increased  strain on our systems and controls 
if suppliers that use our solutions do not provide timely and professional delivery of products and services to their hospital customers  hospitals may not continue using our solutions through certain of our solutions  suppliers are responsible for delivering their products and services sold to hospitals 
currently  the significant majority of these products and services are sold through marketplace novation 
if these suppliers fail to make delivery in a professional  safe and timely manner  then our solutions will not meet the expectations of hospitals  and our reputation and brand will be damaged 
in addition  deliveries that are non conforming  late or are not accompanied by information required by applicable law or regulations could expose us to liability or result in decreased adoption and use of our solutions 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property  our competitors may gain access to our technology  which could harm our business we regard our intellectual property as critical to our success 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights  our business would be harmed 
we rely on trademark  copyright and trade secret laws to protect our proprietary rights 
we have registered several marks including neoforma and associated logos 
we have applied for a patent of our success tracker customer value product 
our trademark registration and patent applications may not be approved or granted  or  if granted  may be successfully challenged by others or invalidated through administrative process or litigation 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights  protect our trade secrets and determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others 
any resulting litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could seriously harm our business 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
we may be subject to intellectual property claims  and if we were to subsequently lose our intellectual property rights  we could be unable to operate our current business we may from time to time be subject to claims of infringement of other parties proprietary rights or claims that our own trademarks  patents or other intellectual property rights are invalid 
any claims regarding our intellectual property  with or without merit  could be time consuming and costly to defend  divert management attention and resources or require us to pay significant damages 
license agreements may not be available on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
in addition  there has been an increase in the number of patent applications related to the use of the internet to perform business processes 
enforcement of intellectual property rights in the internet sector will become a greater source of risk as the number of business process patents increases 
the loss of access to any key intellectual property right  including use of the neoforma brand name  could result in our inability to operate our current business 

table of contents our infrastructure and systems are vulnerable to natural disasters and other unexpected events  and if any of these events of a significant magnitude were to occur  the extent of our losses could exceed the amount of insurance we carry to compensate us for any losses the performance of our server and networking hardware and software infrastructure is critical to our business and reputation and our ability to process transactions  provide high quality customer service and attract and retain users of our solutions 
currently  our infrastructure and systems are located at one site in sunnyvale  california  which is an area susceptible to earthquakes 
we also have a limited fail over system located in atlanta  georgia 
our systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from human error  terrorist attacks  natural disasters  power loss  telecommunications failures  break ins  sabotage  computer viruses  intentional acts of vandalism and similar events 
we do not yet have a formal disaster recovery plan  although it is our intention to formulate one 
in addition  we may not carry sufficient business interruption insurance to compensate us for losses that could occur 
if we lose access to third party software incorporated in our solutions  we may not be able to use our solutions we currently rely on software that we have licensed from a number of software vendors 
we will continue to rely on commercial software vendors where appropriate to speed the delivery of our solutions  while reducing the costs of custom code development and maintenance 
these licenses may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
in addition  the licensors may not continue to support or enhance the licensed software 
in the future  we expect to license other third party technologies to enhance our solutions to meet evolving user needs or to adapt to changing technology standards 
failure to license  or the loss of any licenses of  necessary technologies could impair our ability to offer our solutions until equivalent software is identified  licensed and integrated or developed by us 
in addition  we may fail to successfully integrate licensed technology into our solutions or to adapt licensed technology to support our specific needs  which could similarly harm development and market acceptance of our solutions 
our failure to comply with applicable federal and state regulation of healthcare information could disrupt our operations  increase our operating costs and subject us to liability we are subject to federal and state laws regulating the receipt  storage and distribution of healthcare information  which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate our business 
laws governing the receipt  storage and distribution of health information exist at both the federal and state level 
the health insurance portability and accountability act of  or hipaa  and the implementing regulations from the department of health and human services  or hhs  mandate the use of standard transactions and identifiers  prescribed security measures and other provisions 
certain regulations of the food and drug administration  or fda  and the hospital conditions of participation for the medicare and medicaid programs require protection of and security for health information and appropriate patient access to such information 
some of the transactions using our solutions may involve surgical case kits or purchases of products for patient home delivery  these products may contain patient names and other protected health information subject to these laws governing the receipt  storage and distribution of protected health information 
it may be expensive to implement security or other measures designed to comply with the hipaa  fda and medicare confidentiality and security requirements or with any new legislation or regulations 
moreover  these and future laws may restrict or prevent us from delivering health information electronically 
if we fail to comply with these regulatory requirements  we could face a variety of civil fines and liabilities  associated costs of defense  increased costs of security  and costs of compliance with confidentiality requirements 
we may also be required to significantly curtail our use of data received  stored or distributed by our solutions 
in addition  because we represent and sometimes contractually warrant that our solutions meet these regulatory requirements  our success will also depend on other healthcare participants complying with these regulations 

table of contents our failure to comply with applicable federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws could subject us and our gpo partners and customers to civil and criminal liability and disrupt our operations a federal law commonly known as the medicare medicaid anti kickback law  and several similar state laws  prohibit payments that are intended to induce the acquisition  arrangement for or recommendation of the acquisition of healthcare products or services 
the application and interpretation of these laws are complex and difficult to predict and could constrain our financial and marketing relationships  including  but not limited to  our fee arrangements with suppliers or our ability to obtain supplier company sponsorship for our solutions 
the gpo industry has been the subject of a series of critical newspaper articles and has been investigated by the united states senate judiciary committee  which has set practice guidelines for the gpo industry 
because anything detrimental to the core business of our gpo partners could adversely impact our business  negative substantive findings by the senate judiciary committee  the justice department or other regulatory and enforcement bodies could potentially adversely affect our business and consequently our stock price 
in particular  violations of fraud and abuse laws are punishable by civil and criminal fines and penalties  which could result in restrictions on our operations  increased costs of compliance with remedies and restructuring of our financial arrangements with our gpo and supply chain partners 
if there are changes in the political  economic or regulatory healthcare environment that affect the purchasing practice or operation of hospitals  or our supply chain partners  our business and our stock price could be adversely affected the healthcare industry is highly regulated and is subject to changing political  economic and regulatory influences 
regulation of the healthcare organizations with which we do business could impact the way in which we are able to do business with these organizations 
in addition  factors such as changes in the laws described above regarding the regulation of healthcare information and the laws and policies governing reimbursement for healthcare expenses affect the purchasing practices and operation of hospitals and gpos 
changes in regulations affecting the healthcare industry  such as any increased regulation by hhs  the justice department or the fda of healthcare information or the purchase and sale of products used by hospitals and gpos could require us to make unplanned enhancements of our solutions or result in delays or cancellations of orders or reduce demand for our solutions 
federal and state legislatures have periodically considered programs to reform or amend the us healthcare system at both the federal and state level 
these programs may contain proposals to increase governmental involvement in healthcare  lower reimbursement rates or otherwise change the environment in which healthcare industry participants  including gpos and companies such as us  operate 
the restatement of some of our financial results may subject us to litigation because we restated our financial results for the first and second fiscal quarter of  as well as fiscal and  we could be subjected to litigation 
any claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming and costly to defend 
we may be subject to litigation for defects in products sold by suppliers using our solutions  and this product liability litigation may be costly and time consuming to defend because certain of our solutions facilitate the sale of products by suppliers  we may become subject to legal proceedings regarding defects in these products  even though we do not take title to these products 
any claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming and costly to defend 
securities class action lawsuits in which we have been named  relating to investment banking practices in connection with our initial public offering  may prove costly to defend  and if we are found liable  may expose us to financial liability greater than we are able to sustain in july  we were named as a defendant in two securities class action lawsuits filed in federal court in the southern district of new york relating to our ipo by stockholders who purchased our common stock during 
table of contents the period from january   to december  since that time  additional lawsuits have been filed asserting federal securities claims arising from our ipo 
the lawsuits also name certain of the underwriters for our ipo  merrill lynch  pierce  fenner smith  bear stearns and fleet boston robertson stephens  as defendants 
the lawsuits contain substantially identical allegations  which are that the prospectus and the registration statement for the ipo failed to disclose that the underwriters solicited and received excessive commissions from investors  and that some investors in the ipo agreed to buy more shares of our common stock in the secondary market  at predetermined prices  in a scheme to artificially inflate the price of our common stock 
although we have agreed to settle the suits  if the settlement is not finalized  the suits could be time consuming  costly to defend and require us to pay significant damages 
regulation of the internet is unsettled  and future regulations could inhibit the growth of e commerce and limit the market for our solutions a number of legislative and regulatory proposals under consideration by federal  state  local and foreign governmental organizations may lead to laws or regulations concerning various aspects of the internet  such as user privacy  taxation of goods and services provided over the internet and the pricing  content and quality of services 
legislation could dampen the growth in internet usage and decrease or limit its acceptance as a communications and commercial medium 
if enacted  these laws and regulations could limit the market for our solutions 
in addition  existing laws could be applied to the internet  including consumer privacy laws 
legislation or application of existing laws could expose companies involved in e commerce to increased liability  which could limit the growth of e commerce 
our stock price  like the stock prices of other technology companies  has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations  and  accordingly  our stock price may continue to be volatile  which could negatively affect your investment the trading price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly since our ipo in january and is significantly below the original offering price 
our public float and the daily trading volume of our common stock are relatively small  and an active public market for our common stock may not be sustained in the future 
many factors could cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate  including variations in our quarterly operating results  announcements of new accounting pronouncements or legal rules or regulations  announcements of technological innovations by us or by our competitors  introductions of new services by us or by our competitors  departure of key personnel  the gain or loss of significant strategic relationships or customers  changes in the estimates of our operating performance or changes in recommendations by securities analysts  and changes in the number of research analysts that follow our company 
because our public float and the daily trading volume of our common stock are relatively small  these factors could have a greater impact on our common stock than for companies for which a more active public market exists for their common stock 
in addition  stocks of technology companies have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated or disproportionate to these companies operating performance 
public announcements by companies in our industry concerning  among other things  their performance  accounting practices or legal problems could cause fluctuations in the market for stocks of these companies 
these fluctuations could lower the market price of our common stock regardless of our actual operating performance 

table of contents because vha and uhc collectively beneficially own a majority of our stock  they have substantial control over all matters requiring stockholder approval and significant sales of stock held by them could have a negative effect on our stock price as of december   vha and uhc beneficially owned and  respectively  of our outstanding common stock assuming they earn all the remaining shares of restricted stock 
as a result of their ownership positions  vha and uhc individually are able to significantly influence  and collectively are able to control  all matters requiring stockholder approval  including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions 
such concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company 
in addition  sales of significant amounts of shares held by either of vha and uhc or collectively  or the prospect of these sales  could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
by policy  we limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
as stated in our investment policy  we seek to ensure the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting default risk  market risk and reinvestment risk 
we mitigate default risk by investing in safe and high credit quality securities and by reviewing our portfolio monthly to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer  guarantor or depository 
our portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity 
because our investments mature within one year  a hypothetical change in interest rate of would not have a significant effect on the value of our investments and would reduce interest income by  the table below presents principal amounts and related weighted average interest rates by date of maturity for our investment portfolio in thousands fiscal years cash equivalents and short term investments fixed rate short term investments average interest rate
