overview we specialize in the sale of individual annuities 
under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  or gaap  premium collections for deferred annuities are reported as insurance policy liabilities instead of as revenues 
sources of revenues for products accounted for as insurance policy liabilities are net investment income  surrender charges deducted from the account balances of policyholders in connection with withdrawals  realized gains and losses on investments and call option income 
components of expenses for products accounted for as insurance policy liabilities are interest credited to account balances  amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs  and other operating costs and expenses 

table of contents earnings from products accounted for as insurance policy liabilities are primarily generated from the excess of net investment income earned over the interest credited to the policyholder  or the investment spread 
our investment spread is summarized as follows as of december net investment yield on invested assets weighted average effective crediting rate investment spread our profitability depends in large part upon the amount of assets under our management  investment spreads we earn on our policyholders account balances  our ability to manage our investment portfolio to maximize returns and minimize risks such as interest rate changes  defaults or impairment of assets  our ability to manage costs of the options purchased to fund the interest credits on our index annuities  our ability to manage the costs of acquiring new business principally commissions to agents and first year bonuses credited to policyholders and our ability to manage our operating expenses 
the weighted average effective credited rate represents interest on interest sensitive liabilities  including equity indexed annuities  offset by gains on call option assets used to hedge equity indexed annuity liabilities 
product profitability financial services the long term profitability of life insurance and annuity products depends on the accuracy of the actuarial assumptions that underlie the pricing of such products 
actuarial calculations for such insurance products  and the ultimate profitability of such products  are based on four major factors persistency  mortality  return on cash invested by the insurer during the life of the policy and expenses of acquiring and administering the policies 
interest spreads represent a major profit source on annuity and interest sensitive life products 
margins on these products are sensitive to interest rate fluctuations 
in general  we are able to maintain spreads by adjusting credited interest rates for changes in our earned rates  subject to competitive and timing constraints 
however  there are corollary effects of interest rate changes 
rising interest rates result in a decline in the market value of assets  and also tend to result in increased policyholder surrenders as other investment options become relatively more attractive 
the effect of increased surrenders is to reduce earnings over the long term 
current period earnings effect may vary depending on the level of surrender charges and deferred policy acquisition costs  or dac  and present value of future profits  or pvfp 
in addition  increasing interest rates give rise to disintermediation risk  the risk that assets must be sold at depressed values in order to fund increased surrender payments 
this risk is mitigated by properly matching assets and liabilities 
we seek to closely match the estimated duration of our invested assets to the expected duration of our liabilities 
when the estimated durations of assets and liabilities are similar  exposure to interest rate risk is minimized because a change in the value of assets should be largely offset by a change in the value of liabilities 
a significant mismatch of the durations of invested assets and liabilities could have an impact on our future financial results 
declining interest rates generally have little immediate effect on our investment earnings rates 
over time  as we invest positive cash flows at lower rates  our earned rates decline 
in such an environment  we attempt to adjust credited interest rates accordingly  subject to competitive pressures 
in most situations  this action allows us to maintain our margins 
however  the sustained period of low interest rates may impact future interest spreads  results of operations and financial condition 
the average expected remaining life of standard life s traditional life and annuity business in force at december  was years 
this calculation was determined based upon our actuarial models and assumptions as to expected persistency and mortality 
persistency is the extent to which insurance policies sold are maintained by the insured 
the persistency of life insurance and annuity products is a critical element of their profitability 
however  a surrender charge often applies in the early contract years and declines to zero over time 
life insurance policyholders sometimes do not pay premiums  thus causing their policies to lapse 
for the years  and standard life experienced total policy lapses  excluding surrenders  of  and of total 
table of contents policies in force at december of each year  respectively 
ongoing premiums are not required for annuity policies  so annuities do not experience policy lapses 
variances between actual and expected profits 
actual experience on purchased and produced insurance may vary from projections due to differences in renewal premiums collected  investment spreads  mortality costs  persistency  administrative costs and other factors 
variances from original projections  whether positive or negative  are included in net income as they occur 
to the extent that these variances indicate that future experience will differ from the estimated profits reflected in the capitalization and amortization of the pvfp and dac assets  current and future amortization rates may be adjusted 
product accounting present value of future profits 
in accordance with industry practice  when we purchase a block of existing insurance business  we assign a portion of the purchase price  pvfp  as the pre tax value of the business acquired 
the asset is the discounted value of future cash flows arising from the existing block of business 
the discount rate used is based upon many elements  such as yields generated on similar business  our cost of capital and the interest rate environment as of the purchase date 
discount rates used in determining our pvfp assets range from to 
after purchase  amortization of the asset occurs in proportion to profits emerging from the purchased policies 
the asset is amortized over the expected life of the block of business 
the percentages of expected net amortization of the beginning balance of the total pvfp asset as of december  are expected to be between and in each of the years through deferred policy acquisition costs 
insurance policies issued after the purchase date of a company will generate significant costs that vary directly with and relate to the acquisition of the new business 
under gaap  these acquisition costs on new policies are to be capitalized and recorded as dac 
for universal and interest sensitive life and annuity products  the dac asset is amortized in proportion to estimated gross profits over the life of the contract 
for immediate annuities  dac is amortized so as to produce a constant yield on the net policyholder liability 
virtually all of our dac is a result of writing annuity products 
amortization of dac related to operations was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in current year amortization expense resulted primarily from the emergence of gross profits from business sold in recent years and the acceleration of dac amortization due to dac unlocking 
future expected amortization of dac  assuming no new business after december  and current assumptions  is as follows in thousands gross amortization interest accumulation net amortization accounting for deferred annuities and universal and interest sensitive life products 
we primarily account for our deferred annuity  universal and interest sensitive life policy deposits in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises for certain long duration contracts and for realized gains and losses on the sale of investments 
under sfas no 
 a benefit reserve is established at the time of policy issuance in an amount equal to the deposits received 
thereafter  the benefit reserve is adjusted for any additional deposits  interest credited and partial or complete withdrawals 
revenues for annuities and universal and interest sensitive life policies  other than certain non interest sensitive annuities  consist of policy charges for surrenders and partial withdrawals  mortality and administration  and investment income earned 
these revenues do not include the annuity  universal and interest sensitive life policy deposits 
expenses related to these products include interest credited to policyowner account balances  operating costs for policy administration  amortization of dac and mortality costs in excess of account balances 
costs relating to the acquisition of new business  primarily commissions paid to agents  which vary with and are directly related to the production of new business  are deferred to the extent that such costs are recoverable from future profit margins 
at the time of issuance  the acquisition expenses  approximately of our initial annuity premium deposits are capitalized as dac 
in accordance with sfas no 
 dac with interest is amortized over the lives of the policies in a constant relationship to the present value of estimated future gross profits 

table of contents accounting for equity indexed annuities 
revenues and expenses for equity indexed annuities are recognized in accordance with the sfas no 
model  described above 
policy liabilities for equity indexed annuities are computed in accordance with sfas no 
 which requires that an equity indexed annuity liability be bifurcated into a host contract and a derivative contract 
the host contract liability is a book value liability providing for the equity indexed annuity policy s guaranteed benefits 
the derivative contract liability is a market value liability providing for the equity linked benefits available in the policy 
the derivative liability includes a liability for equity linked benefits accruing during the current contract year  as well as liability amounts for future equity benefits which have not yet been granted 
accounting for traditional life products 
traditional life insurance products are accounted as long duration insurance contracts in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises 
under sfas no 
 benefit reserves are actuarially calculated using the net level reserve method 
revenues consist of policy premiums and investment income on assets supporting policy liabilities 
expenses consist of policy benefits incurred  increases in policy liabilities  and operating costs for policy administration  and amortization of dac 
costs related to the acquisition of new business  primarily commissions paid to agents  which vary with and are directly related to the production of new business  are deferred to the extent that such costs are recoverable from future profit margins 
at the time of issuance  the acquisition expenses are capitalized as dac 
in accordance with sfas no 
 dac with interest is amortized over the lives of the policies in a constant relationship to policy premiums 
accounting for immediate annuities 
immediate annuities with no life contingent payments  which comprise the majority of our immediate annuities in force and the majority of new immediate annuity sales  are accounted as investment contracts in accordance with fas no 
revenues consist of investment income  and expenses consist of the imputed interest credits to policies as well as operating costs for policy administration 
an initial net premium policy liability is established as initial premium less acquisition costs 
the imputed credited rate is the rate  which equates this net premium to the guaranteed payments 
after issue  the liability changes by the amount of imputed interest credits and benefit payments 
for balance sheet purposes  this net premium liability is presented as a gross premium liability offset by a dac asset 
immediate annuities with payments contingent on the survival of the annuitant are accounted as limited payment contracts in accordance with fas no 
 with revenue recognition  expense recognition  and liabilities computed as described above for traditional life products 
critical accounting policies the accounting polices described below require us to make significant estimates and assumptions using information available at the time the estimates are made 
such estimates and assumptions significantly affect various reported amounts of assets and liabilities 
we have made estimates in the past that we believed to be appropriate but were subsequently revised to reflect actual experience 
if our future experience differs materially from these estimates and assumptions  our results of operations and financial condition could be affected 
accordingly  we consider them to be critical in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
a more detailed description of our accounting policies is included in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
investments the carrying value of our investment portfolio was billion in financial services at december  the accounting risks associated with these assets relate to the recognition of income  our determination of other than temporary impairments and our estimation of fair values 
we amortize premiums and discounts as yield adjustments over the contractual lives of fixed maturity securities 
we consider anticipated prepayments on mortgage backed securities in determining estimated future yields on such securities 
when we sell a security  we report the difference between the sales proceeds and amortized cost determined based on specific identification as an investment gain or loss 
we periodically evaluate whether the declines in fair value of our investments are other than temporary 
our evaluation consists of a review of qualitative and quantitative factors 
we also consider additional factors to determine whether the declines in fair value are other than temporary  such as downgrades of the security by a rating agency  deterioration in the financial condition of the issuer  and other publicly available issuer specific news or general market conditions 
for investments in companies with no quoted market price  we consider similar qualitative and quantitative 
table of contents factors and also take into account the cost of the investment  the type of investment  subsequent purchases of the same or similar investments  the current financial position and operating results of the company invested in  and such other factors as may be relevant 
declines in fair values of securities deemed to be other than temporary are recognized as a reduction of net income 
determining what constitutes an other than temporary decline involves significant judgment 
declines in fair value below cost not considered other than temporary in the current period could be considered other than temporary in a future period and reduce earnings to the extent of the write down 
estimated fair values for our investments are determined based on estimates from nationally recognized pricing services  broker dealer market makers  and internally developed methods 
our internally developed methods require us to make judgments about the security s credit quality  liquidity and market spread 
equity indexed call options are derivative instruments linked to the major stock indices s p index and djia index which are used to hedge the equity benefits of our equity indexed annuity products 
we purchase call options whose payoff characteristics mirror the equity benefits of our products 
these securities are carried at fair value and the change in fair value is included in net investment income 
dac and pvfp the combined balance of our dac and pvfp was million 
the recovery of these costs is dependent on the future profitability of the related business at december  each year  we evaluate the recoverability of the unamortized balance of the dac and pvfp 
we consider estimated future gross profits or future premiums  expected mortality or morbidity  interest earned and credited rates  persistency and expenses in determining whether the balance is recoverable 
if we determine a portion of the unamortized balance is not recoverable  it is charged to amortization expense 
the assumptions we use to amortize and evaluate the recoverability of the dac and pvfp involve significant judgment 
a significant revision to these assumptions will impact future financial results 
we recorded a charge of million and million for and  respectively  related to the acceleration of dac amortization due to dac unlocking 
goodwill and intangible assets the balance of our goodwill and intangible assets was million at december  the recovery of this asset is dependent on the fair value of the business to which it relates 
effective in  pursuant to sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
 goodwill is no longer amortized but is subject to annual impairment tests based on the estimated fair value of the business units 
there are numerous assumptions and estimates underlying the determination of the estimated fair value of these businesses 
different valuation methods and assumptions can produce significantly different results that could affect the amount of any potential impairment charge that might be required to be recognized 
a charge of million resulting from the impairment of goodwill from the adoption of sfas no 
was recorded in in the financial services segment 
income taxes our income tax expense includes deferred income taxes arising from temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and capital loss carryforwards 
we have gross deferred income tax assets of million at december  in assessing the realization of our deferred income tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that the deferred income tax assets will be realized 
the ultimate realization of our deferred income tax assets depends upon generating future taxable income during the periods in which our temporary differences become deductible and capital gains before our capital loss carryforwards expire 
we evaluate the recoverability of our deferred income tax assets by assessing the need for a valuation allowance on a quarterly basis 
if we determine that it is more likely than not that our deferred income tax assets will not be recovered  a valuation allowance will be established against some or all of our deferred income tax assets 
this could have a significant effect on our future results of operations and financial position 
a million valuation allowance has been provided on certain operating loss carryforwards in health services at december  we reached this conclusion after considering the availability of taxable income in prior carryback years  tax planning strategies  and the likelihood of future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and 
table of contents carryforwards 
differences between forecasted and actual future operating results could adversely impact our ability to realize our deferred income tax assets 
liabilities for insurance products the total balance of our liabilities for insurance products was billion at december  these liabilities are often payable over an extended period of time and the profitability of the related products is dependent on the pricing of the products and other factors 
differences between pricing assumptions and actual experience will impact future financial results 
we calculate and maintain reserves for the estimated future payment of claims to our policyholders based on actuarial assumptions 
these assumptions are generally best estimates  with moderate provision for adverse deviation 
many factors can affect the adequacy of these reserves and liabilities  such as economic and social conditions  inflation  changes in doctrines of legal liability and extra contractual damage awards 
therefore  the reserves and liabilities we establish are necessarily based on extensive estimates  assumptions and historical experience 
establishing reserves is an uncertain process  and it is possible that actual claims will materially exceed our reserves and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
our financial results depend significantly upon the extent to which our actual claims experience is consistent with the assumptions we used in determining our reserves and pricing our products 
if our assumptions with respect to future claims are incorrect  and our reserves are insufficient to cover our actual losses and expenses  we would be required to increase our liabilities  negatively affecting our operating results 
liabilities for loss contingencies related to legal proceedings we are involved in various legal proceedings in the normal course of business 
the ultimate outcome of these legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty 
we recognize an estimated loss from these loss contingencies when we believe it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
however  it is difficult to measure the actual loss that might be incurred related to legal proceedings 
the ultimate outcome of these lawsuits is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position based on our current understanding of the relevant facts and laws

table of contents general 
on a consolidated basis we reported net cash provided by operations of million and million for and  respectively 
although deposits received on our interest sensitive annuities and other financial products are not included in cash flow from operations under gaap  these funds are available 
cash provided by operations plus net deposits received  less net account balances returned to policyholders on interest sensitive annuities and other financial products  resulted in positive cash flow of million and million for and  respectively 
the decrease is primarily due to a decline in annuity premium deposits 
cash generated on a consolidated basis is available only to the extent that it is generated at the holding company level or is available through interest  dividends  management fees or other payments from our subsidiaries 
at december   we had parent company only cash and short term investments of 
million 
these funds are available for general corporate purposes 
our parent company only operating expenses  not including interest expense  were million and million for and  respectively 
contractual obligations 
in our day to day business activities  we incur certain commitments to make future payments under contracts such as operating leases and purchase orders 
maturities under these contracts are set forth in the following table as of december   in thousands payment due by period less than more than total year years years years long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations total payments include principal and interest off balance sheet arrangements 
we have no off balance sheet financing arrangements 
liquidity of financial services the principal liquidity requirements of standard life are its contractual obligations to policyholders  surplus debenture interest  dividends  management fees and rental fees to standard management and operating expenses 
the primary source of funding for these obligations has been cash flow from premium income  net investment income  investment sales and maturities and sales of annuity products 
these sources of liquidity for standard life significantly exceed scheduled uses 
liquidity is also affected by unscheduled benefit payments including death benefits  policy withdrawals and surrenders 
the amount of withdrawals and surrenders is affected by a variety of factors such as renewal interest crediting rates  interest rates for competing products  general economic conditions  standard life s am best rating and events in the industry that affect policyholders confidence 
in october  am best confirmed standard life s rating of b  or very good 
the policies and annuities issued by standard life contain provisions that allow policyholders to withdraw or surrender their policies under defined circumstances 
these policies and annuities generally contain provisions  which apply penalties or otherwise restrict the ability of policyholders to make such withdrawals or surrenders 
standard life closely monitors the surrender and policy loan activity of its insurance products and manages the composition of its investment portfolios  including liquidity  to ensure it has sufficient cash resources in light of such activity 
changes in interest rates may affect our incidence of policy surrenders and other withdrawals 
in addition to the potential effect on liquidity  unanticipated withdrawals in a changing interest rate environment could adversely affect our earnings if we were required to sell investments at reduced values to meet liquidity demands 
we manage our asset and liability portfolios in order to minimize the adverse earnings effect of changing market interest rates 
we seek assets that have duration characteristics similar to the liabilities that they support 
we also prepare cash flow projections and perform cash flow tests under various market interest rate scenarios to assist in evaluating liquidity needs and adequacy 
our us insurance subsidiaries currently expect available liquidity sources and future cash flows to be adequate to meet the demand for funds 

table of contents statutory surplus is computed according to rules prescribed by the naic as modified by the indiana department of insurance  or the state in which our insurance subsidiaries do business 
statutory accounting rules are different from gaap and are intended to reflect a more conservative perspective 
with respect to new business  statutory accounting practices require that acquisition costs primarily commissions and policy issue costs and reserves for future guaranteed principal payments and interest in excess of statutory rates  be expensed in the year the new business is written 
these items cause a reduction in statutory surplus or surplus strain in the year written for many insurance products 
we design our products to minimize such first year losses  and in none of our products cause a statutory loss in the year written 
our long term growth goals contemplate continued growth in our insurance businesses 
to achieve these growth goals  our us insurance subsidiaries will need to increase statutory surplus 
additional statutory surplus may be secured through various sources such as internally generated statutory earnings  infusions with funds generated through our debt or equity offerings  or mergers with other life insurance companies 
if additional capital is not available from one or more of these sources  we believe that we could reduce surplus strain through the use of reinsurance or through reduced writing of new business 
we believe that the operational cash flow of standard life will be sufficient to meet our anticipated needs for as of december   standard life had statutory capital and surplus for regulatory purposes of million 
as the annuity business produced by standard life increases  standard life expects to satisfy statutory capital and surplus requirements through statutory profits and through additional capital contributions by standard management 
net cash flow from operations on a statutory basis of standard life  after payment of benefits and operating expenses  was million and million for and  respectively 
the decrease is primarily due to a decline in annuity premium deposits 
if the need arises for cash  which is not readily available  additional liquidity could be obtained from the sale of invested assets 
liquidity of health services the principal liquidity requirements of our health services segment are its cost of goods sold  operating expenses  and future acquisitions 
the primary source of funding for these obligations has been cash flow from pharmaceutical sales  internal and external borrowings  and capital contributions form standard management 
the liquidity requirements of our health services segment have significantly exceeded cash flow from pharmaceutical sales 
we believe that the operational cash flow of our health services segment will not be sufficient to meet our anticipated operational needs for therefore  this segment is expected to continue to fund its cash needs through external borrowings and capital contributions from standard management 
factors that may affect future results we are currently considering a transaction that would significantly alter the nature of our business 
we have historically operated in the financial services segment as a holding company for insurance companies 
if we consummate the currently contemplated sale of standard life and exit the financial services segment  we would be operating solely in the health services segment  which we entered only two years ago 
to date  our health services operations have generated little revenue and have sustained significant losses 
in order to become profitable  our health services business will require additional capital expenditures 
there can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain sufficient funds  from operating cash flow or otherwise  to successfully operate and expand the business 
we have limited history operating in the health services segment and no assurance can be given that such operations will ever be profitable 
see recent developments on page the price of the company s common stock may demonstrate increased volatility upon the announcement of a proposed sale of standard life or upon the consummation of such a transaction and could decline below recent levels 
in the event of a significant and sustained decline  the company could be delisted from nasdaq 
the company s common stock may exhibit increased volatility upon the announcement or consummation of a transaction involving the sale of standard life 
depending upon investor acceptance of the proposed transaction  the price of the stock could decline below recent levels 
if such decline were severe and sustained  nasdaq could initiate action to delist the company s shares  which could further negatively impact the price and or marketability of the shares 

table of contents we are subject to a number of factors affecting its business  including intense competition in the industry and the ability to attract and retain agents  suppliers  clients and employees 
if we are unable to respond appropriately to any of these factors  business and financial results could suffer 
our operating results are affected by many factors  including competition  lapse rates  interest rates  maintenance of insurance ratings  changes in the regulatory environment with respect to pharmacy service providers  relationships with suppliers of inventory held in its health services division  relationships with large institutional clients  general governmental regulation and general business conditions  many of which are outside our control 
our financial services division operates in a highly competitive environment and is in direct competition with a large number of insurance companies  many of which offer a greater number of products through a greater number of agents and have greater resources 
in addition  we may be subject  from time to time  to new competition resulting from additional insurance carriers introducing products similar to those offered by us 
moreover  as a result of recent federal legislation  commercial banks  insurance companies  and investment banks may now combine  provided certain requirements are satisfied  and we can expect to encounter increased competition from these providers of financial services 
this competitive environment could result in lower premiums  loss of sales and reduced profitability 
we believe that the ability to compete is dependent upon  among other things  the ability to retain and attract independent general agents to market products and the ability to develop competitive products that also are profitable 
although management believes that good relationships with our independent general agents exist  competition for those agents among insurance companies is intense 
our independent general agents typically represent other insurance companies and may sell products that compete with its products 
sales of our annuity products and  therefore  our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected if we are unsuccessful in attracting and retaining independent agents and marketing organizations 
our health services segment operates in a highly competitive environment and is in direct and indirect competition with a number of other companies that operate in the pharmaceutical market space  including other retail  institutional and wholesale pharmacies  health insurers  health management organizations  pharmacy benefit managers and discount drug programs offered directly by pharmaceutical manufacturers 
in addition  the provision of drugs and pharmacy benefits is a highly dynamic and evolving business which is tied closely to changes in the medicare medicaid reimbursement environment  governmental entitlement program budget restrictions exercised at both the state and federal levels  cost controls imposed by third party payors in an attempt to exercise control over spiraling health care costs  and increasing competition from pharmacies operating outside the united states which ship drugs to us residents over the internet and using other distribution channels 
there are currently a number of active initiatives being pursued by local and national legislatures 
on december   president bush signed into law the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of  a comprehensive voluntary prescription drug benefit administered under medicare part d effective january  the new act also provides certain cost sharing government subsidies for individuals who might otherwise qualify for drug coverage under medicaid or similar government funded aid programs 
since a notable portion of our future institutional pharmacy business will be made available to medicare qualified patients who may qualify for this new benefit  it may have a substantial and lasting effect on the profitability of our business depending on how it and similar initiatives are administered by the government agencies charged with implementation 
since important elements of the new act relating to issues as formulary development  drug pricing and drug discount cards have yet to be finalized  it is impossible to predict the impact of the act on our profitability 
our success also depends upon the continued contributions of key officers and employees 
should one or more of these individuals leave or otherwise become unavailable for any reason  business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
financial results could suffer if our am best ratings are downgraded 
insurers compete with other insurance companies  financial intermediaries and other institutions on the basis of a number of factors  including the ratings assigned by am best 
am best assigns ratings labeled a through f superior  excellent  very good  fair  marginal  weak  poor  under regulatory supervision  and in liquidation 
standard life and dixie life have a rating of b very good and b fair  respectively  by am best 
am best s ratings represent their opinion based on a comprehensive quantitative and qualitative review of our financial strength  operating performance and market profile 
a rating of b is assigned by am best to companies 
table of contents that  in their opinion  have achieved very good overall performance when compared to the standards established by am best  and have a good ability to meet their obligations to policyholders over a long period of time 
a rating of b is assigned by am best to companies that  in their opinion  have achieved good overall performance when compared to the standards established by am best 
according to am best  these companies generally have an adequate ability to meet their obligations to policyholders  but their financial strength is vulnerable to unfavorable changes in underwriting or economic conditions 
in evaluating a company s financial and operating performance  am best reviews the company s profitability  leverage and liquidity as well as the company s book of business  the adequacy and soundness of its reinsurance  the quality and estimated market value of its assets  the adequacy of its reserves  and the experience and competence of its management 
am best reviews its ratings of insurance companies from time to time 
if the am best ratings were downgraded  sales of annuity products could be significantly impacted and the financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
changes in governmental regulation and legislation could have a substantial impact on our profitability 
our insurance subsidiaries are subject to substantial governmental regulation in each of the jurisdictions in which they conduct business 
changes in these regulations could have a significant impact on our profitability 
the primary purpose of these regulations is to protect policyholders  not investors 
these regulations are vested in governmental agencies having broad administrative power with respect to all aspects of our insurance business  including premium rates  policy forms and applications  marketing illustrations  dividend payments  capital adequacy and the amount and type of investments we may have 
the naic  and state insurance regulators continually reexamine existing laws and regulations and their application to insurance companies 
changes in the naic or state regulations  including  for example  changes in the risk based capital requirements  which are determined by the naic and state regulators  could affect the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends to us which could affect our ability to make payments upon our contractual obligations 
in addition  the federal government has become increasingly involved with insurance regulation in recent years  including the passage of the gramm leach bliley act  and more comprehensive federal legislation in this area is still being considered by congress 
federal legislation and administrative policies in several areas  including pension regulation  age and sex discrimination  financial services regulation and federal taxation  affect us specifically and the insurance business in general 
new state or federal laws or regulations  as well as a more strict interpretation of existing laws or regulations  may adversely affect our current claims exposure  adversely affect the profitability of our current and future products  and materially affect our future operations by increasing the costs of regulatory compliance 
we cannot predict the impact of future state or federal laws or regulations on our business 
see business of standard management regulatory factors 
our health subsidiary is also subject to substantial regulation at both the state and federal levels 
our ability to continue operating as a retail  mail order and institutional pharmacy is contingent upon our ability to maintain appropriate licenses in all the states in which they currently conduct business 
we are also required to comply with a comprehensive set of regulations under the federal health insurance portability and accountability act hipaa with respect to the privacy and security of patient health information and the method in which this information is electronically transmitted to payors and governmental agencies such as the agencies responsible for implementing the medicare and medicaid programs 
regulations implementing hipaa are still being disseminated  revised and actively reviewed as of the time of this writing 
it is possible that substantial changes in these regulations  or in the strictness of interpretation of these regulations  may adversely affect our relationships with our clients and materially affect our future operations by increasing the costs of regulatory compliance 
as with the insurance laws  we cannot predict the impact of future state or federal laws or regulations on its health services business 
under the internal revenue code of  as amended code  income tax payable by policyholders on investment earnings is deferred during the accumulation period of certain life insurance and annuity products 
the favorable tax treatment may give certain of our products a competitive advantage over other non insurance products 
on may   president bush signed the jobs and growth tax relief reconciliation act of  which reduces the federal income tax rates applicable to certain dividends and capital gains realized by individuals 
this legislation may lessen the competitive advantage of certain of our products relative to other investments that generate dividend or capital gain income 
as a result  demand for certain of our products that offer income tax deferral may be negatively affected 
additionally  congress has from time to time considered other legislation that would reduce or eliminate the relative benefits to policy owners of the deferral of taxation on the accretion of value within certain insurance products or might otherwise affect the taxation of insurance products and insurance companies 
in particular  president bush recently proposed legislation  currently under consideration by congress  that would increase the amount that taxpayers may contribute each year to individual retirement 
table of contents accounts  which provide deferral benefits similar to those offered by our tax deferral products 
to the extent that the code is revised in accordance with these proposals or otherwise in a manner that reduces the tax deferred status of insurance products  or reduces the taxation of  or expands the market for  competing products  all life insurance companies  including us  could be adversely affected 
interest rate fluctuations could negatively affect spread income 
significant changes in interest rates expose insurance companies to the risk of not earning anticipated spreads between the interest rate earned on investments and the credited interest rates paid on outstanding policies 
both rising and declining interest rates can negatively affect spread income 
although we develop and maintain asset liability management programs and procedures designed to preserve spread income in rising or falling interest rate environments  changes in interest rates could adversely affect these spreads 
our financial results are highly dependent on the financial condition of the companies in which we make investments and could suffer if the value of our investments decreases due to factors beyond our control 
our invested assets  approximately billion  represented approximately of our total assets at december  these investments are subject to customary risks of credit defaults and changes in market values 
in addition  the value of our investment portfolio depends in part on the financial condition of the companies in which we have made investments 
factors beyond our control  including interest rate levels  financial market performance  and general economic conditions may have a significant negative impact on our investment income and the value of our investment assets  which would have a material adverse affect on our financial condition 
our policy claims fluctuate from year to year  and future benefit payments may exceed our established reserves  which would cause our earnings to suffer 
our earnings are significantly dependent upon the extent to which the actual claims received by our subsidiaries is consistent with the actuarial assumptions we use in establishing reserves for the payment of benefit claims 
to the extent that the actual claims experience of our subsidiaries exceeds our established reserves  our operating income would be negatively affected  resulting in an adverse effect on our earnings 
volatility in benefit claims is common in the life insurance industry 
while our reserves have been sufficient to cover policy claims in the past and we attempt to limit the risk by carefully underwriting new policies and sharing risks with reinsurance companies  we may still experience a period of higher than anticipated benefit claims that exceeds our established reserves 
if this were to happen  it could result in increased operating losses 
because a significant portion of our annuity contracts are surrenderable  any substantial increase in the level of surrenders could negatively affect financial results 
as of december   approximately or billion of annuity contracts in force measured by statutory reserves were surrenderable 
approximately of those contracts or approximately million of annuity contracts in force measured by statutory reserves are surrenderable without charge 
changes in prevailing interest rates  ratings or other factors which result in or lead to significant levels of surrenders of existing annuity contracts could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
surrenders result in a reduction of invested assets that earn investment income and a reduction of policyholder account balances that credit interest 
our financial results could be materially adversely affected if our assumptions regarding the value of intangible assets proven to be incorrect 
included in our financial statements are certain assets that are primarily valued  for financial statement purposes  on the basis of management s assumptions 
these assets include items such as deferred policy acquisition costs  present value of future profits  intangibles  
table of contents goodwill  and organization and deferred debt issuance costs 
the assumptions are based upon  among others  interest rate spread and rates of mortality  surrender and lapse 
if  for instance  future mortality rates were higher than expected  projected margins would be lower and deferred policy acquisition cost amortization would increase 
the value of these assets reflected in our december  balance sheet totaled million  or of our assets 
although we have established procedures to periodically review the assumptions used to value these assets and determine the need to make adjustments  if our assumptions are incorrect and adjustments need to be made  our financial results could be materially adversely affected 
our profitability and ability to conduct business through our health subsidiary could be negatively impacted by a change in our relationships with our largest institutional clients 
a large portion of the present and future growth of our institutional pharmacy business is contingent upon our ability to acquire and retain long term contracts at favorable terms with institutional care facilities 
currently we have thirteen contractual relationships with large institutional clients and forty three relationships with smaller facilities 
we are presently attempting to grow and diversify the number  type and terms of these contracts  but a number of factors including the ability to favorably compete with respect to pricing  our relationships with drug and supplement manufacturers and suppliers  and the economic solvency and profitability of our institutional clients can impact our profitability and opportunities for future growth 
in addition  although we believe our current relationship with our institutional clients is strong  the loss of key institutional clients would materially affect the operation of our health services segment 
because our health services business model is relatively new and unproven  its limited operating history in this segment is not indicative of future performance  and this part of its business is difficult to evaluate 
because we have only recently entered the health services segment  it does not have an operating history upon which an investor can evaluate our prospects 
in attempting to implement our business model  we may need to significantly change our business operations  sales and implementation practices  customer service and support operations and management focus 
we are also facing new risks and challenges  including a lack of meaningful historical financial data upon which to plan future budgets  the need to develop strategic relationships and other risks described below continuing efforts to contain healthcare costs may reduce our future health services revenue 
the sales and profitability of the health services segment are affected by the efforts of healthcare payors to contain or reduce the cost of healthcare by lowering reimbursement rates  limiting the scope of covered services  and negotiating reduced or capitated pricing arrangements 
any changes which lower reimbursement levels under medicaid  medicare or private pay programs  including managed care contracts  could reduce our future revenue 
furthermore  other changes in these reimbursement programs or in related regulations could reduce its future revenue 
these changes may include modifications in the timing or processing of payments and other changes intended to limit or decrease the growth of medicaid  medicare or third party expenditures 
if we fail to comply with licensure requirements  fraud and abuse laws or other applicable laws  it may need to curtail operations  and could be subject to significant penalties 
our pharmacy business is subject to extensive and often changing federal  state and local regulations  and our pharmacy is required to be licensed in the states in which it is located or does business 
while we continuously monitor the effects of regulatory activity on its operations and believe we currently have all necessary pharmacy licenses  the failure to obtain or renew any required regulatory approvals or licenses could adversely affect the continued operation of the business 
the long term care facilities that contract for our services are also subject to federal  state and local regulations and are required to be licensed in the states in which they are located 
the failure by these long term care facilities to comply with these or future regulations or to obtain or renew any required licenses could result in our inability to provide pharmacy services to these facilities and their residents 
we are also subject to federal and state laws that prohibit some types of direct and indirect payments between healthcare providers 
these laws  commonly known as the fraud and abuse laws  prohibit payments intended to induce or encourage the referral of patients to  or the recommendation of  a particular provider of items or services 
violation of these laws can result in loss of licensure  civil and criminal penalties and exclusion from the medicaid  medicare and other federal healthcare programs 
if we or our client institutions fail to comply with medicaid and medicare reimbursement regulations  our health services revenue could be reduced  we could be subject to penalties and we could lose our eligibility to participate in these programs 

table of contents as of december   approximately of our health services pharmacy billings were directly reimbursed by government sponsored programs 
government sponsored programs include medicaid and  to a lesser extent  medicare 
our remaining billings are currently paid or reimbursed by individual residents  long term care facilities and other third party payors  including private insurers 
a portion of these revenues are indirectly dependent on government programs 
we anticipate that as the institutional pharmacy portion of our health services segment grows  direct reimbursement from government sponsored programs will become a material portion of our pharmacy billings 
the medicaid and medicare programs are highly regulated 
the failure  even if inadvertent  of us and or our client institutions to comply with applicable reimbursement regulations could adversely affect our reimbursement under these programs and our ability to continue to participate in these programs 
in addition  our failure to comply with these regulations could subject us to other penalties 
we are subject to additional risks relating to our acquisition strategy 
one component of our growth strategy contemplates our making selected acquisitions that will help grow the health services segment 
acquisitions involve inherent uncertainties 
these uncertainties include the effect on the acquired businesses of integration into a larger organization and the availability of management resources to oversee the operations of these businesses 
the successful integration of acquired businesses will require  among others consolidation of financial and managerial functions and elimination of operational redundancies  achievement of purchasing efficiencies  the addition and integration of key personnel  and the maintenance of existing business 
even though an acquired business may have experienced positive financial performance as an independent company prior to an acquisition  we cannot be sure that the business will continue to perform positively after an acquisition 
we also may acquire businesses with unknown or contingent liabilities  including liabilities for failure to comply with healthcare laws and regulations 
we have policies and procedures to conduct reviews of potential acquisition candidates for compliance with healthcare laws and to conform the practices of acquired businesses to its standards and applicable laws 
we also generally seek indemnification from sellers covering these matters 
we may  however  incur material liabilities for past activities of acquired businesses 
we cannot be sure of the successful integration of any acquisition or that an acquisition will not have an adverse impact on our results of operations or financial condition 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we seek to invest available funds in a manner that will maximize shareholder value and fund future obligations to policyholders and debtors  subject to appropriate risk considerations 
many of our products incorporate surrender charges  market interest rate adjustments or other features to encourage persistency 
approximately of the total insurance liabilities at december  had surrender penalties or other restrictions and approximately are not subject to surrender 
we also seek to maximize the total return on our investments through active investment management 
accordingly  we have determined that the entire portfolio of fixed maturity securities is available to be sold in response to changes in market interest rates  changes in relative values of individual securities and asset sectors  changes in prepayment risks  changes in credit quality outlook for certain securities  liquidity needs  and other factors 
profitability of many of our products is significantly affected by the spreads between interest yields on investments and rates credited on insurance liabilities 
although substantially all credited rates on annuity products may be changed annually subject to minimum guaranteed rates  changes in competition and other factors  including the impact of the level of surrenders and withdrawals  may limit the ability to adjust or to maintain crediting rates at levels necessary to avoid narrowing of spreads under certain market conditions 
as of december   the average yield  computed on the cost basis of the investment portfolio  was  and the average interest rate credited or accruing to total insurance liabilities was  excluding guaranteed interest bonuses for the first year of the annuity contract 
computer models were used to perform simulations of the cash flows generated from our existing business under various interest rate scenarios 
these simulations measured the potential gain or loss in fair value of interest rate sensitive financial instruments 
with such estimates  we seek to closely match the duration of assets to the duration of liabilities 
when the estimated duration of assets and liabilities are similar  exposure to interest rate risk is minimized because a change in the value of assets should be largely offset by a change in the value of liabilities 
at december   the option adjusted duration of fixed maturity securities and short term investments were approximately  and the option adjusted duration of insurance liabilities was approximately 
the option adjusted duration compares the change in the value of an asset or liability with a change in interest rates 
this means that if interest rates in general increased  the value of our asset portfolio would decrease by approximately 
if interest rates were to increase by from their december  levels  our fixed maturity securities and short term investments net of the corresponding changes in the values of cost of policies purchased  cost of policies produced and insurance liabilities would decline in fair value by approximately million 
the calculations involved in our computer simulations incorporate numerous assumptions  require significant estimates and assume an immediate change in interest rates without any management of the investment portfolio in reaction to such change 
consequently  potential changes in the value of our financial instruments indicated by the simulations will likely be different from the actual changes experienced under given interest rate scenarios  and the differences may be material 
because our investments and liabilities are actively managed  actual losses could be less than those estimated above
