item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the company for the years ended december   and and the related notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item herein 
executive summary we are engaged in the oilfield services industry and operate through six divisions baker atlas  baker oil tools  baker petrolite  centrilift  hughes christensen and inteq that we aggregate and refer to as the oilfield segment 
we manufacture and sell products and provide services used in the oil and natural gas industry  including drilling  formation evaluation  completion and production of oil and natural gas wells 
we have operations in over countries around the world  with headquarters in houston  texas 
previously we operated a process segment  which manufactured and sold process equipment for separating solids from liquids and liquids from liquids 
during  we signed a definitive agreement for the sale of bird machine bird  the remaining division in this segment 
we have reclassified the operating results for bird as discontinued operations and no longer operate in this segment 
our products and services are sold in highly competitive markets  and our revenues and earnings can be affected by changes in competitive prices  fluctuations in the level of activity in major markets  general economic conditions  foreign exchange fluctuations and governmental regulation 
we compete with the oil and natural gas industry s largest diversified oilfield services providers  as well as many small companies 
we believe that the principal competitive factors in our industry are product and service quality  availability and reliability  health  safety and environmental standards  technical proficiency and price 
we consider our key business drivers to include the rig count  oil and natural gas production levels and current and expected future energy prices 
in  we reported revenues of  million  an increase compared with income from continuing operations for was million  compared with million in included in income from continuing operations for are charges  net of tax  of million related to our share of the westerngeco restructuring charge and million related to the impairment of our investment in westerngeco 
included in income from continuing operations for is a charge  net of tax  of million related to our share of the westerngeco restructuring charge 
the increase in revenue was achieved despite cautious investment by our customers  shifting markets and strong competition 
even though oil and natural gas prices were relatively high in  oil and natural gas companies invested cautiously because of the conflict in the middle east and ongoing concerns about the economy 
on a worldwide basis  the average rig count for increased compared with the average rig count for most of this increase came from land rigs drilling for natural gas in north america 
drilling activity in the gulf of mexico and the north sea  historically among our strongest markets  declined during as deepwater operators re evaluated projects and the large diversified oil and natural gas companies in the north sea and gulf of mexico focused on new opportunities in other resource areas 
we believe that our critical success factors include having sufficient financial liquidity and resources to fund the various requirements of the business  managing our overall global manufacturing capacity to ensure proper production levels  ensuring workforce and asset levels are in place and in line with business needs  maximizing efficiencies in our manufacturing and service delivery processes  identifying  evaluating and implementing profit improvement strategies  introducing new technology  flawless execution at the well site  delivering unmatched value to our customers and overall cost management 
as begins  we remain focused on cost management and the introduction of new products 
we have created a long term strategy that is aimed at creating value for our stockholders throughout the business cycle and growing our business faster while achieving superior margins compared with our major competitors 
we share a common high performance culture  and we are aligning to execute our long term strategy 
our six divisions will continue to provide best in class technology  serving our traditional markets and new ones  while delivering unmatched value for our customers and maximizing returns for our stockholders 
business environment our business environment and its corresponding operating results are significantly affected by the level of energy industry spending for the exploration and production of oil and natural gas reserves 
an indicator for this spending is the rig count 
when drilling and workover rigs are active  many of the products and services provided by the oilfield services industry are required 
our products and services are used during the drilling and workover phases  as well as when the oil and natural gas wells are completed and during actual production of the hydrocarbons 
this spending by oil and natural gas companies is  in turn  influenced strongly by 
table of contents expectations about the supply and demand for oil and natural gas products and by current and expected prices for both oil and natural gas 
rig counts therefore generally reflect the relative strength and stability of energy prices 
rig counts we have been providing rig counts to the public since we gather all relevant data through our field service personnel  who obtain the necessary data from routine visits to the various rigs  customers  contractors or other outside sources 
this data is then compiled and distributed to various wire services and trade associations and is published on our website 
rig counts are compiled weekly for the us and canada and monthly for all international and us workover rigs 
published international rig counts do not include rigs drilling in certain countries  such as russia and onshore china  because this information is extremely difficult to obtain 
north american rigs are counted as active if  on the day the count is taken  the well being drilled has been started  drilling has not been completed and the well is anticipated to be of sufficient depth to be a potential customer of our drill bits 
in most international areas  rigs are counted as active if drilling operations have taken place for at least days during the month and if the well has not reached the target depth 
rigs that are in transit from one location to another  are rigging up  have been drilling less than days of the month  are being used in non drilling activities including production testing  completion and workover  or are not significant consumers of oilfield products and services are not included in the rig count 
in some active international areas where better data is available  a weekly or daily average of active rigs is taken 
our rig counts are summarized in the table below as averages for each of the periods indicated 
us land us offshore canada north america latin america north sea other europe africa middle east asia pacific outside north america worldwide us workover rigs us land and canadian rig counts increased and  respectively  in compared with due to the increase in drilling for natural gas 
the us offshore rig count decreased in compared with primarily related to a reduced level of spending by major diversified oil and natural gas companies who redirected a portion of their spending towards larger international projects 
outside north america  rig counts increased in compared with the rig count in latin america increased as spending by the mexican national oil company  pemex  drove rig count increases in mexico  offsetting strike related decreases attributed to the venezuelan national oil company  pdvsa 
the north sea rig count in decreased compared with following a decrease in compared with primarily driven by a decline in drilling activity in the uk sector 
major diversified oil and natural gas companies redirected spending towards other larger international projects  especially in russia and the caspian 
activity in the middle east continued to rise steadily with a increase in the rig count  following a increase in compared with rig counts in africa declined in compared with primarily as a result of political disruptions in nigeria and project delays in other parts of west africa 
rig activity in the asia pacific region was up in compared with primarily due to activity increases in india 
oil and natural gas prices generally  changes in the current price and expected future prices of oil or natural gas drive both customers expectations about their prospects from oil and natural gas sales and their expenditures to explore for or produce oil and natural gas 
accordingly  changes in these expenditures will normally result in increased or decreased demand for our products and services 
oil bloomberg 
table of contents west texas intermediate wti cushing crude oil spot price and natural gas bloomberg henry hub natural gas spot price prices are summarized in the table below as averages of the daily closing prices during each of the periods indicated 
oil prices bbl natural gas prices mmbtu oil prices averaged bbl in  the highest annual average in more than a decade 
oil prices rose to a high of bbl in early march due to low inventories  seasonally colder than normal weather  the disruption of venezuelan production by a general strike and concerns about the potential for significant supply disruptions as a result of military operations in the middle east 
oil prices fell to a low of bbl in late april as significant supply disruptions did not occur and the market reacted to the possibility of a more rapid than expected recovery in iraqi oil production 
oil prices then increased to and remained between bbl and bbl through the balance of the year  excluding september 
in september  concern rose again about a quicker than anticipated recovery in iraqi production in the fourth quarter of and early and oil prices dropped below bbl 
the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec reacted with a surprise million barrels per day quota cut in late september which sustained oil prices of bbl to bbl through the end of in early  oil prices are averaging between bbl and bbl due to colder than normal weather  low inventories and improving chinese and us economic growth expectations 
in february  opec again surprised the market with a million barrels per day quota cut and pledged to further reduce the current level of production in excess of agreed quotas by another million barrels per day 
during  natural gas prices averaged mmbtu  the highest level in two decades 
in early  natural gas traded between mmbtu and mmbtu  except for a two week period in late february when prices spiked to mmbtu 
natural gas storage levels at the beginning of the injection season  which runs from april to november  were at record low levels but high summer natural gas prices resulted in reduced industrial demand and allowed storage levels to increase 
natural gas prices remained above mmbtu until early july  when it became apparent that storage injections during the summer of could approach record levels and that storage would likely be full by the beginning of the winter withdrawal season 
prices weakened through the remainder of the injection season to a low of mmbtu in late october 
natural gas prices increased over the remainder of and are trading between mmbtu and mmbtu in early key risk factors our business is focused on providing products and services to the worldwide oil and natural gas industry  therefore  our risk factors are centered on those factors that impact the markets for oil and natural gas 
key risk factors currently influencing the worldwide oil and natural gas markets that could impact our outlook are discussed below 
production control the degree to which individual opec nations and other large oil and natural gas producing countries  including  but not limited to  mexico  norway and russia  are willing and able to control production and exports of oil  to decrease or increase supply and to support their targeted oil price while meeting their market share objectives 
key measures of production control include actual production levels compared with target or quota production levels  oil price compared with targeted oil price and changes in each country s market share 
global economic growth particularly the impact of the us and western european economies and the economic activity in japan  china  south korea and the developing areas of asia where the correlation between economic growth and energy demand is strong 
the strength of the us economy and economic growth in developing asia  particularly china  will be important in key measures include us and international economic output  global energy demand and forecasts of future demand by governments and private organizations 
oil and natural gas storage inventory levels a measure of the balance between supply and demand 
a key measure of us natural gas inventories is the storage level reported weekly by the us department of energy compared with historic levels 
key measures for oil inventories include us inventory levels reported by the us department of energy and american petroleum institute and worldwide estimates reported by the international energy agency 
ability to produce natural gas the amount of natural gas that can be produced is a function of the number of new wells drilled  completed and connected to pipelines as well as the rate of production and resulting depletion of existing wells 
advanced technologies  such as horizontal drilling  improve total recovery but also result in a more rapid production decline 
key measures include government and private surveys of natural gas production  company reported production  estimates of reservoir depletion rates and drilling and completion activity 

table of contents technological progress the design and application of new products that allow oil and natural gas companies to drill fewer wells and to drill  complete and produce wells faster  recover more hydrocarbons and or lower costs 
key measures also include the overall level of research and engineering spending by oilfield services companies and the pace at which new technology is both introduced commercially and accepted by customers 
maturity of the resource base the growing necessity for increased levels of investment and activity to support production from an area the longer it is developed 
key measures include changes in undeveloped hydrocarbon reserves in mature areas like the north sea  the us  canada and latin america 
pace of new investment the amount oil and natural gas companies choose to invest in emerging markets and any impact it has on their spending in areas where they already have an established presence 
access to capital the ability of oil and natural gas companies to access the funds necessary to carry out their exploration and production e p plans 
access to capital is particularly important for smaller independent oil and natural gas companies 
key measures of access to capital include cash flow  interest rates  analysis of oil and natural gas company leverage and equity offering activity 
energy prices and price volatility the impact of widely fluctuating commodity prices on the stability of the market and subsequent impact on customer spending 
while current energy prices are important contributors to positive cash flow at e p companies  expectations for future prices and price volatility are generally more important for determining future e p spending 
while higher commodity prices generally lead to higher levels of e p spending  sustained high energy prices can be an impediment to economic growth 
impact of energy prices and price volatility on demand for hydrocarbons short term price changes can result in companies switching to the most economic sources of fuel  prompting a temporary curtailment of demand  while long term price changes can lead to permanent changes in demand 
this results in the oilfield services industry being cyclical in nature 
key indicators include hydrocarbon prices on a btu equivalent basis and indicators of hydrocarbon demand  such as electricity generation or industrial production 
access to prospects the ability of oil and natural gas companies to develop economically attractive projects based on their expectations of future energy prices  required investments and resulting returns 
access to prospects may be limited because host governments do not allow access to the reserves or because another oil and natural gas company owns the rights to develop the prospect 
supply disruptions the loss of production and or delay of activity from key oil exporting countries  including but not limited to  iraq  saudi arabia and other middle eastern countries  nigeria and venezuela  due to political instability  civil unrest  labor issues or military activity 
in addition  adverse weather such as hurricanes could impact production facilities  causing supply disruptions 
weather the impact of variations in temperatures as compared with normal weather patterns and the related effect on demand for oil and natural gas 
a key measure of the impact of weather on energy demand is population weighted heating and cooling degree days as reported by the us department of energy and forecasts of warmer than normal or cooler than normal temperatures 
government regulations the costs incurred by oil and natural gas companies to conform to and comply with government regulations  including environmental regulations  may limit the quantity of oil and natural gas that may be economically produced 
industry outlook caution is advised that the factors described in forward looking statements and business environment could negatively impact our expectation for oil and natural gas demand  oil and natural gas prices and drilling activity 
oil inventories of crude oil and products were at record low levels as began  supporting oil prices of bbl to bbl 
oil prices are expected to decline throughout and average between bbl and bbl 
factors which could support prices at the upper end of this range include stronger than expected worldwide economic growth  especially in china and the us  the potential for supply disruptions in the middle east  africa or venezuela  the slower growth of russian exports due to export capacity bottlenecks and opec s desire and ability to maintain a higher price target to stabilize their purchasing power 
factors which could 
table of contents result in oil prices at the lower end of the range include slower than expected economic growth in the us and china  sooner than expected increases in iraqi production growth and increased production from opec members algeria  libya and nigeria  challenging the persian gulf members of opec to act as the swing producers 
natural gas in  prices are expected to trade between mmbtu and mmbtu 
natural gas could trade at the top of this range if weather is colder than normal  the us economy  particularly the industrial sector  exhibits greater than expected growth and continued levels of customer spending are not sufficient to support the growth of natural gas production 
prices could move to the bottom of this range if the us economic recovery is weaker than expected or weather is milder than expected 
during the summer  natural gas prices are expected to trade at a level necessary to curtail price sensitive demand and allow storage to refill 
customer spending based upon our discussions with major customers  review of published industry reports and our outlook for oil and natural gas prices described above  anticipated customer spending trends are as follows north america spending in north america  primarily towards developing natural gas supplies  is expected to increase approximately to in compared with outside north america customer spending  primarily directed at developing oil supplies  is expected to increase to in compared with total spending is expected to increase to in compared with drilling activity based upon our outlook for oil and natural gas prices and customer spending described above  our outlook for drilling activity  as measured by the baker hughes rig count  is as follows the north american rig count is expected to increase approximately to in compared with drilling activity outside of north america is expected to increase approximately to compared with company outlook we expect that will be a stronger year than  with revenues increasing to 
in our outlook for  we took into account the factors described herein 
in  and  revenues outside north america were  and of total revenues  respectively 
in  we expect revenues outside north america to continue this trend and to be between and of total revenues 
growth in our revenues should mirror the growth in customer spending 
our assumptions regarding overall growth in customer spending assume strong economic growth in the us and china and opec discipline  resulting in an oil price exceeding bbl 
our assumptions regarding customer spending in north america assume strong economic growth in the us and natural gas prices exceeding mmbtu 
in north america  we expect revenues to increase to in compared with  with the majority of the increase occurring in the second half of we expect spending on land based projects to continue to increase in following the trend evident in we also expect offshore spending in the gulf of mexico to be flat in compared with the normal weather driven seasonal decline in us and canadian spending in the first half of the year should result in sequentially softer revenues in the first and second quarters of outside north america  we expect revenues to increase to in compared with  continuing the multi year trend of modest growth in customer spending 
spending on large projects from national oil companies will reflect established seasonality trends  resulting in softer revenues in the first half of the year and stronger revenues in the second half 
in addition  customer spending should be affected by weather related reductions in the north sea in the first and second quarters of the middle east  latin america  caspian regions and russia are expected to demonstrate above average spending increases  resulting in increased revenue  while growth in revenues from the north sea may be below average 
our expectations for spending and revenue growth could decrease if prices fall below bbl for oil or mmbtu for natural gas or if there are disruptions in key oil and natural gas production markets  such as venezuela or nigeria 
in prior years  our profitability has been negatively affected by our share of westerngeco s operating results  which have been adversely affected by the continued weakness in the seismic industry 
we expect the operating results of westerngeco to improve in as compared with prior years  however  based on the trend of operating losses and weakness in the seismic industry in prior 
table of contents years  there is uncertainty regarding the future operating results of westerngeco 
information regarding westerngeco s profitability in is based on information that westerngeco has provided to us 
should this information not be accurate  our forecasts for profitability could be impacted  either positively or negatively 
based on the above forecasts  we believe that earnings per share in from continuing operations will be in the range of to 
this does not anticipate material changes in the prices that we charge for our products 
significant price increases or significantly better than expected results from westerngeco could cause earnings per share to reach the upper end of this range 
conversely  significant price decreases or significantly worse than expected results at westerngeco could result in earnings per share being at or below the bottom of this range 
our ability to improve pricing is dependent on demand for our products and services and our competitors strategies of managing capacity 
while the commercial introduction of new technology is an important factor in realizing price improvement  without pricing discipline throughout the industry as a whole  meaningful improvements in our prices are not likely to be realized 
additionally  significant changes in drilling activity outside our expectations could impact operating results positively or negatively 
we do business in approximately countries including about one half of the countries having the worst scores in transparency international s corruption perception index cpi survey for we devote significant resources to the development  maintenance and enforcement of our business code of conduct policy  our foreign corrupt practices act the fcpa policy  our internal control processes and procedures and other compliance related policies 
notwithstanding the devotion of such resources  and in part as a consequence thereof  from time to time we discover or receive information alleging potential violations of the fcpa and our policies  processes and procedures 
we conduct internal investigations of these potential violations and take appropriate action depending upon the outcome of the investigation 
we anticipate that the devotion of significant resources to compliance related issues  including the necessity for such internal investigations  will continue to be an aspect of doing business in a number of the countries in which oil and natural gas exploration  development and production take place and in which we are requested to conduct operations 
in order to provide products and services in some of these countries  we may in the future utilize joint ventures  sell products to distributors or otherwise modify our business approach in order to improve our ability to conduct our business in accordance with our business code of conduct 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
our significant accounting policies are described in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in certain respects  the application of our significant accounting policies in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures about contingent assets and liabilities 
we base these estimates and judgments on historical experience and other assumptions and information that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be perceived with certainty and accordingly  these estimates may change as new events occur  as more experience is acquired  as additional information is obtained and as the business environment in which we operate changes 
we have defined a critical accounting policy or estimate as one that is both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and requires us to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments or estimates about matters that are uncertain 
we believe the following are the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements as well as the significant estimates and judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of these policies 
we have discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit ethics committee of our board of directors and the audit ethics committee has reviewed the disclosure presented below 
allowance for doubtful accounts the determination of the collectibility of amounts due from our customers requires us to use estimates and make judgments regarding future events and trends  including monitoring our customers payment history and current credit worthiness to determine that collectibility is reasonably assured  as well as consideration of the overall business climate in which our customers operate 
inherently  these uncertainties require us to make frequent judgments and estimates regarding our customers ability to pay amounts due us in order to determine the appropriate amount of valuation allowances required for doubtful accounts 
provisions for doubtful accounts are recorded when it becomes evident that the customer will not be able to make the required payments at either contractual due dates or in the future 
over the last five years  reserves for doubtful accounts  as a percentage of total accounts receivable before reserves  have ranged from to 
at december  and  reserves for doubtful accounts totaled million  or  and million  or  of total accounts receivable before reserves  respectively 
we believe that our reserve for doubtful accounts is adequate to cover anticipated losses under current conditions  however  uncertainties regarding changes in the financial 
table of contents condition of our customers  either adverse or positive  could impact the amount and timing of any additional provisions for doubtful accounts that may be required 
a one percentage point change in this reserve would have had a pre tax impact of approximately million in inventory reserves inventory is a significant component of current assets and is stated at the lower of cost or market 
this requires us to record provisions and maintain reserves for excess or obsolete inventory 
to determine these reserve amounts  we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and compare them to estimates of future product demand  market conditions  production requirements and technological developments 
these estimates and forecasts inherently include uncertainties and require us to make judgments regarding potential outcomes 
over the last five years  inventory reserves  as a percentage of total inventories before reserves  have ranged from to 
at december  and  inventory reserves totaled million  or  and million  or  of gross inventory  respectively 
we believe that our reserves are adequate to cover anticipated losses under current conditions  however  significant or unanticipated changes to our estimates and forecasts  either adverse or positive  could impact the amount and timing of any additional provisions for excess or obsolete inventory that may be required 
a one percentage point change in this reserve would have had a pre tax impact of approximately million in impairment of long lived assets long lived assets  which include property  goodwill  intangible assets  investments in affiliates and certain other assets  comprise a significant amount of our total assets 
we make judgments and estimates in conjunction with accounting for these assets  including depreciation and amortization methods and useful lives 
additionally  the carrying values of these assets are reviewed for impairment periodically  and at least annually for goodwill  or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss is recorded in the period in which it is determined that the carrying amount is not recoverable 
this requires us to make judgments regarding long term forecasts of future revenues and costs related to the assets subject to review 
in turn  these forecasts are uncertain in that they require assumptions about demand for our products and services  future market conditions and technological developments 
significant and unanticipated changes to these assumptions could require a provision for impairment in a future period 
given the nature of these evaluations and their application to specific assets and specific times  it is not possible to reasonably quantify the impact of changes in these assumptions  however  based upon our evaluation of the current business climate in which we operate  we do not currently anticipate that any significant asset impairment losses will be necessary 
income taxes the liability method is used for determining our income taxes  under which current and deferred tax liabilities and assets are recorded in accordance with enacted tax laws and rates 
under this method  the amounts of deferred tax liabilities and assets at the end of each period are determined using the tax rate expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered 
valuation allowances are established to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in determining the need for valuation allowances  we have considered and made judgments and estimates regarding estimated future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
these estimates and judgments include some degree of uncertainty and changes in these estimates and assumptions could require us to adjust the valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets 
historically  changes to valuation allowances have been caused by major changes in the business cycle in certain countries and changes in local country law 
the ultimate realization of the deferred tax assets depends on the generation of sufficient taxable income in the applicable taxing jurisdictions 
we operate in more than countries under many legal forms 
as a result  we are subject to the jurisdiction of numerous domestic and foreign tax authorities  as well as to tax agreements and treaties among these governments 
our operations in these different jurisdictions are taxed on various bases actual income before taxes  deemed profits which are generally determined using a percentage of revenues rather than profits and withholding taxes based on revenue 
determination of taxable income in any jurisdiction requires the interpretation of the related tax laws and regulations and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events such as the amount  timing and character of deductions  permissible revenue recognition methods under the tax law and the sources and character of income and tax credits 
changes in tax laws  regulations  agreements and treaties  foreign currency exchange restrictions or our level of operations or profitability in each taxing jurisdiction could have an impact on the amount of income taxes that we provide during any given year 
our tax filings are subjected to audit by the tax authorities in most jurisdictions where we conduct business 
these audits may result in assessments of additional taxes that are resolved with the authorities or potentially through the courts 
we believe that these assessments may occasionally be based on erroneous and even arbitrary interpretations of local tax law 
resolution of these situations 
table of contents inevitably includes some degree of uncertainty  accordingly we provide taxes only for the amounts we believe will ultimately result from these proceedings 
we do not believe it is possible to reasonably estimate the potential impact of changes to the assumptions and estimates identified because the resulting change to our tax liability  if any  is dependent on numerous factors which cannot be reasonably estimated 
these include  among others  the amount and nature of additional taxes potentially asserted by local tax authorities  the willingness of local tax authorities to negotiate a fair settlement through an administrative process  the impartiality of the local courts  the sheer number of countries in which we do business  and the potential for changes in the tax paid to one country to either produce  or fail to produce  an offsetting tax change in other countries 
our experience has been that the estimates and assumptions we have used to provide for future tax assessments have proven to be appropriate 
however  past experience is only a guide  and the potential exists  however limited  that the tax resulting from the resolution of current and potential future tax controversies may differ materially from the amount accrued 
discontinued operations in the third quarter of  our board of directors approved and management initiated a plan to sell bird  the last remaining division of our former process segment 
in october  we signed a definitive agreement for the sale of bird and recorded charges totaling million  net of tax of million  which consisted of a loss of million on the write down of bird to fair value  million of severance and warranty accruals and a loss of million related to the recognition of cumulative foreign currency translation adjustments into earnings 
the sale closed in january and we received million in proceeds  which is subject to adjustment pending final completion of the purchase price 
we retained certain accounts receivable  inventories and other assets 
in december  we entered into exclusive negotiations for the sale of our interest in oil producing operations in west africa for million in proceeds 
the transaction was effective as of january   and resulted in a gain on sale of million  net of a tax benefit of million  recorded in the first quarter of we received million as a deposit in and the remaining million in april in november  we sold eimco process equipment eimco  a division of our former process segment  and recorded a loss on disposal of million  net of tax of million  which consisted of a loss of million on the write down to fair value and a loss of million related to the recognition of cumulative foreign currency translation adjustments into earnings 
we received total proceeds of million  of which million was held in escrow pending completion of final adjustments of the purchase price 
in  all purchase price adjustments were completed  resulting in the release of the escrow balance  of which million was returned to the buyer and million was received by us 
in  we also recorded an additional loss on sale due to purchase price adjustments of million  net of tax of million 
we have reclassified the consolidated financial statements for all prior periods presented to reflect these operations as discontinued 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item herein for additional information regarding discontinued operations 
results of operations the discussions below relating to significant line items are based on available information and represent our analysis of significant changes or events that impact the comparability of reported amounts 
where appropriate  we have identified specific events and changes that affect comparability or trends and  where possible and practical  have quantified the impact of such items 
the table below details certain consolidated statement of operations data and their percentage of revenues for  and  respectively 
revenues cost of revenues selling  general and administrative revenues revenues for were  million  an increase of compared with reflecting a increase in rig counts 
rig counts act as a leading indicator for our revenues because when rigs are active  many of our products and services are required 
our products and services are used during drilling operations and then subsequently during completion of the wells and also during production of the hydrocarbons 
revenues in north america  which accounted for of total revenues  increased compared with this increase reflects increased drilling activity in the us and canada  as evidenced by a increase in the 
table of contents north american rig count 
revenues outside north america  which accounted for of total revenues  increased compared with this increase reflects the improvement in international drilling activity  as evidenced by the increase in rig counts outside north america  primarily in latin america and the middle east  partially offset by decreased drilling activity in the north sea and africa 
during  pricing was not a significant contributor to our revenue growth  as deterioration in prices for certain product lines at our inteq division were partially offset by pricing improvement realized from our other product lines 
revenues for were  million  a decrease of compared with revenues in north america  which accounted for of total revenues  decreased compared with this decrease reflects lower activity in the us land and offshore operations and canada  as evidenced by a decrease in the north american rig count 
inclement weather in the gulf of mexico  including tropical storm isidore and hurricane lili  also contributed to the decline 
revenues outside north america  which accounted for of total revenues  increased compared with this increase reflects the improvement in drilling activity  particularly in the middle east and asia pacific  partially offset by weaker revenues in latin america due to the political and economic environments in argentina and venezuela and the impact of a labor strike in norway 
cost of revenues cost of revenues for was  million  an increase of compared with cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues was and for and  respectively 
the increase in cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues is primarily related to our inteq division 
in  inteq experienced the highest revenue growth of our divisions  however  margins deteriorated as they were impacted by increased downward pricing trends  increased repairs and maintenance r m costs for newly developed downhole rental tools and other nonrecurring costs 
we anticipate margins at inteq will improve in as a result of a stabilized pricing environment and improved cost control measures 
in addition  corrective action was taken related to the increased r m costs  which we anticipate will result in lower r m costs in a change in the geographic and product mix from the sale of our products and services also contributed to the increase in the cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues 
during  our revenue increases came predominantly from north america and our margins on revenues generated in north america are typically lower than margins generated outside of north america 
cost of revenues for was  million  a decrease of compared with cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues was and for and  respectively 
the increase in cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues was the result of our strategy not to significantly reduce our work force to match the reduced activity levels and a change in the geographic and product mix from the sale of our products and services 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative sg a expenses for were million  an increase of million  or compared with this increase was primarily due to an million increase in net costs related to corporate activities and an increase of approximately million in costs related to our self insurance programs that are not expected to recur in the future  offset by improvement in the impact of foreign exchange activity of million 
in  we anticipate corporate costs will continue to trend upward primarily due to compliance related expenditures 
sg a expenses for were million  an increase of million  or  compared with this increase was primarily due to the impact of the weakening us dollar resulting in increased foreign exchange losses of million  increased depreciation of the cost associated with the now substantially completed implementation of sap r  an enterprise wide accounting and business application software system  of million  and our strategy not to significantly reduce our work force to match current market activity levels 
reversals of restructuring charge in october  our board of directors approved a plan to substantially exit the oil and natural gas exploration business and we recorded restructuring charges of million  consisting of million of severance  million for costs to settle contractual obligations and a million loss for the write off of our undeveloped exploration properties in certain foreign jurisdictions 
the severance charges were for approximately employees  all of which have been terminated as of december  all of the accrued severance has been paid as of december  included in the costs to settle contractual obligations was million related to an oil and natural gas property in angola 
the property was sold in and we reversed the liability related to this contractual obligation 
also included in the costs to settle contractual obligations was million for the minimum amount of our share of project costs relating to our interest in an oil and natural gas property in colombia 
after unsuccessful attempts to negotiate a settlement with our joint venture partner  we decided to 
table of contents abandon further involvement in this project 
subsequently  in  a third party agreed to assume the remaining obligations in exchange for our interest in the project 
accordingly  we reversed million related to this obligation 
all contractual obligations associated with this plan have been paid as of december  impairment of investment in affiliate as a result of the continuing weakness in the seismic industry  we evaluated the carrying value of our investment in westerngeco and recorded an impairment loss of million in to write down the investment to its fair value 
the fair value was determined using a combination of a market value and discounted cash flows approach 
we were assisted in the determination of the fair value by an independent third party 
although not anticipated  further declines in the fair value of the investment in westerngeco would result in additional impairments 
we cannot predict if additional impairments of our investment in westerngeco will be necessary in the future because the environment in the seismic industry continues to be uncertain 
equity in income loss of affiliates equity in income loss of affiliates relates to our share of the income loss of affiliates accounted for using the equity method of accounting 
our most significant equity method investment is our interest in westerngeco 
during  the operating results of westerngeco continued to be adversely affected by the continuing weakness in the seismic industry 
as a result of this weakness  westerngeco recorded certain impairment and restructuring charges of million for impairment of its multiclient seismic library and rationalization of its marine seismic fleet 
our portion of these charges was million and is recorded in equity in income loss of affiliates 
equity in income loss of affiliates decreased million for compared with the decrease is primarily related to a million restructuring charge recorded by westerngeco for impairment of its multiclient library  reductions in workforce  closing land based seismic operations in the us lower states and canada and reducing its marine seismic fleet 
our portion of this charge was million and was recorded in equity in income loss of affiliates 
operating results for westerngeco are expected to improve in  however  based on the trend of operating losses and weakness in the seismic industry in prior years  there is uncertainty regarding the future operating performance of westerngeco 
included in equity in income loss of affiliates for was million related to the amortization of goodwill associated with equity method investments 
in conjunction with the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we discontinued the amortization of goodwill associated with equity method investments effective january  interest expense interest expense for decreased million compared with due to lower total debt levels  lower weighted average interest rates on our commercial paper and money market borrowings and increased amortization of deferred gains related to terminated interest rate swap agreements 
total debt levels decreased million primarily due to the repayment of million of long term debt in february the approximate weighted average interest rate on our commercial paper and money market borrowings was in compared with for the amortization of deferred gains related to terminated interest rate swap agreements reduced interest expense by million in compared with million in interest expense for decreased million compared with due to lower total debt levels resulting from cash flows from operations coupled with lower weighted average interest rates on our short term debt  commercial paper and interest rate swaps 
the approximate weighted average interest rate on short term debt and commercial paper was for compared with for income taxes our effective tax rates differ from the statutory income tax rate of due to state income taxes  differing rates of tax on international operations and higher taxes within the westerngeco venture 
during  we recognized an incremental effect of million of additional taxes attributable to our portion of the operations of westerngeco 
of this amount  million related to the reduction in the carrying value of our equity investment in westerngeco for which there was no tax benefit 
the remaining million arose from operations of the venture due to i the venture being taxed in certain foreign jurisdictions based on a deemed profit basis  which is a percentage of revenues rather than profits and ii unbenefitted foreign losses of the venture  which are operating losses and impairment and restructuring charges in certain foreign 
table of contents jurisdictions where there was no current tax benefit and where a deferred tax asset was not recorded due to the uncertainty of realization 
in and  the amount of additional taxes resulting from operations of the venture was million and million  respectively 
during  a current year benefit of million was recognized as the result of various refund claims filed in the us during  a million benefit was recognized as the result of the settlement of an irs examination related to our september  through september  tax years 
in  a benefit of million was recognized as a result of the settlement of the irs examination of certain through pre acquisition tax returns and related refund claims of western atlas inc our tax filings for various periods are subjected to audit by tax authorities in most jurisdictions where we conduct business 
these audits may result in assessments of additional taxes that are resolved with the authorities or potentially through the courts 
we believe that these assessments may occasionally be based on erroneous and even arbitrary interpretations of local tax law 
we have received tax assessments from various taxing authorities and are currently at varying stages of appeals and or litigation regarding these matters 
we have provided for the amounts we believe will ultimately result from these proceedings 
we believe we have substantial defenses to the questions being raised and will pursue all legal remedies should an unfavorable outcome result 
however  resolution of these matters involves uncertainties and there are no assurances that the outcomes will be favorable 
cumulative effect of accounting change on january   we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets 
sfas no 
requires that the fair value of a liability associated with an asset retirement obligation aro be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate can be made 
the liability for the aro is revised each subsequent period due to the passage of time and changes in estimates 
the associated retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset and subsequently depreciated over the estimated useful life of the asset 
the adoption of sfas no 
in resulted in a charge of million  net of tax of million  recorded as the cumulative effect of accounting change in the consolidated statement of operations 
in conjunction with the adoption  we recorded aro liabilities of million primarily for anticipated costs of obligations associated with the future disposal of power source units at certain of our divisions and refurbishment costs associated with certain leased facilities in europe and with a fleet of leased railcars and tanks 
on january   we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the adoption of sfas no 
required us to cease amortizing goodwill and to perform a transitional test of goodwill in each of our reporting units as of january  the reporting units were based on our organizational and reporting structure 
corporate and other assets and liabilities were allocated to the reporting units to the extent that they related to the operations of these reporting units 
valuations of the reporting units were performed by an independent third party 
the goodwill in both the eimco and bird operating divisions of the former process segment was determined to be impaired using a combination of a market value and discounted cash flows approach to estimate fair value 
accordingly  we recognized transitional impairment losses of million  net of tax of million in as the cumulative effect of accounting change in the consolidated statement of operations 
liquidity and capital resources our objective in appropriately financing our business is to maintain adequate financial resources and access to additional liquidity 
during the last three years  cash flows from operations have been our principal source of funding 
we anticipate that this trend will continue in we also have a million three year committed revolving credit facility that would provide an ample source of back up liquidity that would be available in the event of an unanticipated significant demand on cash flow that could not be funded by operations or short term borrowings 
our capital planning process is focused on utilizing cash flows generated from operations in ways that enhance the value of the company 
in  we used cash for a mix of activities including working capital needs  payment of dividends  repayment of debt  repurchase of common stock and capital expenditures 
in  we expect that this trend will continue  as we do not anticipate any additional material demands  commitments or other events that would require significant outlays of cash 

table of contents cash flows cash flows provided used by continuing operations by type of activity were as follows for the years ended december operating activities investing activities financing activities cash flow statements for companies with international operations that are local currency functional exclude the effects of the changes in foreign currency exchange rates that occur during any given year  as these are considered to be noncash changes and  as such  changes reflected in certain accounts on the cash flow statements may not reflect the changes in corresponding accounts on the consolidated balance sheets 
during  and  these changes in foreign currency exchange rates were significant and resulted in corresponding changes in the foreign currency translation adjustment account 
during  we revised our capital expenditure reporting procedures for certain rental tools and engineering prototype tools 
previously  amounts for these items were reported as transfers from inventory to property  plant and equipment  however  they will now be reported as capital expenditures 
in addition  depreciation related to certain of these tools that had not previously been included in total depreciation and amortization expense is now included in this caption 
the consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended december  and have been reclassified to give effect to this change 
there was no impact to the consolidated statements of operations or the consolidated balance sheets for any of the periods presented 
operating activities cash flows from operating activities have been relatively consistent during the last three years and we expect this trend to continue in we attribute the stability in our cash flow to successful management of working capital and consistent levels of income from continuing operations adjusted for non cash items 
cash flows from operating activities from continuing operations increased million in compared with the primary reason for this increase was improved operating performance  attributable to our increased revenues 
in addition  working capital decreased with the effect of increasing cash flows from operating activities 
the underlying drivers of the changes in working capital are as follows an increase in accounts receivable in used million in cash 
this was due to increases in revenue offset by a reduction in days sales outstanding defined as the average number of days our accounts receivable are outstanding of approximately two days 
a decrease in inventory in provided million in cash as we increased our focus on improving the utilization of inventory on hand 
an increase in accounts payable and accrued compensation and other accrued liabilities provided million in cash 
this was due to increased activity  increased employee compensation accruals  better management of our accounts payable and increased accruals for our self insurance programs 
these changes were partially offset by million more in income tax payments in compared with our pension contributions in were approximately million  an increase of approximately million compared with the prior year  due to the formation of a new us pension plan in in  we expect pension contributions to increase and to be between million and million 
cash flows from operating activities from continuing operations decreased million in compared with primarily due to decreased operating performance attributable to our decreased revenues 
in addition  working capital increased with the effect of decreasing cash flows from operating activities 
the underlying drivers of the changes in working capital are as follows a decrease in accounts receivable in provided million in cash primarily due to decreases in revenues as days sales outstanding remained unchanged in compared with 
table of contents a decrease in inventory in provided million in cash as we increased our focus on improving the utilization of inventory on hand 
a decrease in accounts payable and accrued compensation and other accrued liabilities in used million in cash 
this was due to decreased activity  decreased employee compensation accruals and the payment of million more in income taxes in compared with investing activities our principal recurring investing activity is the funding of capital expenditures to improve the productivity of operations 
expenditures for capital assets totaled million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the increase in capital expenditures in compared with is due to expenditures necessary to support our growth and operations 
the majority of these expenditures were for machinery and equipment and rental tools 
we made two acquisitions in having an aggregate purchase price of million  of which million was paid in cash 
as a result of these acquisitions  we recorded approximately million of goodwill and million of intangible assets through december  the purchase prices are allocated based on fair values of the acquisitions and may be subject to change based on the final determination of the purchase price allocation 
in addition  during  we invested million in affiliates  of which million related to the company s interest in the quantx wellbore instrumentation venture  which is engaged in the permanent in well monitoring market 
during  we made three acquisitions having an aggregate cash purchase price of million  net of cash acquired 
as a result of these acquisitions  we recorded approximately million of goodwill 
in addition  during  we invested million in luna energy  llc luna energy  a venture formed to develop  manufacture  commercialize  sell  market and distribute downhole fiber optic and other sensors for oil and natural gas exploration  production  transportation and refining applications 
we have a ownership interest in luna energy and account for this investment using the equity method of accounting 
in  we completed the sale of our interest in an oil producing property in west africa for million in proceeds 
we received a deposit of million in and the remaining million in during  we also disposed of our eimco division for million in proceeds 
we received million in proceeds in  with the remainder of the sales price held in escrow pending completion of final adjustments of the purchase price 
in  all purchase price adjustments were completed  resulting in the release of the escrow balance 
we received million and million was returned to the buyer 
proceeds from disposal of assets were million  million and million for  and  respectively 
these disposals relate to machinery  rental tools and equipment no longer used in operations that were sold throughout the year 
in january  we completed the sale of bird and received million in proceeds  which is subject to adjustment pending final completion of the purchase price 
in addition  in february  we completed the sale of our minority interest in petreco international and received proceeds of million  of which million is held in escrow pending the outcome of potential indemnification obligations pursuant to the sales agreement 
we do not believe the transaction is material to our financial condition or results of operations 
financing activities we had net borrowings of commercial paper and other short term debt of million during compared with net repayments of million and million in and  respectively 
we also repaid the million notes due february the repayment was funded with cash on hand  cash flow from operations and the issuance of commercial paper 
total debt outstanding at december  was  million  a decrease of million compared with december  the total debt to total capitalization defined as total debt plus stockholders equity ratio was at december  and at different times during  we entered into three separate interest rate swap agreements  each for a notional amount of million  associated with our notes due january these agreements had been designated and had qualified as fair value hedging instruments 
due to our outlook for interest rates  we terminated the three agreements and received payments totaling million 
each of the three agreements was terminated prior to entering into a new agreement 
the deferred gains are being amortized as a reduction of interest expense over the remaining life of the underlying debt security  which matures in january 
table of contents during  we terminated two interest rate swap agreements that had been entered into in prior years 
these agreements had been designated and had qualified as fair value hedging instruments 
upon termination  we received proceeds totaling million 
the deferred gains of million and million are being amortized as a reduction of interest expense over the remaining lives of the underlying debt securities  which mature in june and january  respectively 
we received proceeds of million  million and million from the issuance of common stock in  and  respectively  from the exercise of stock options and the issuance of stock through our employee stock purchase plan 
during  we were authorized by our board of directors to repurchase up to million of our common stock 
during  we repurchased million shares at an average price of per share  for a total of million 
during  we repurchased million shares at an average price of per share  for a total of million 
upon repurchase  the shares were retired 
we paid dividends of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
available credit facilities at december   we had million of credit facilities with commercial banks  of which million is a three year committed revolving credit facility the facility that expires in july the facility contains certain covenants which  among other things  require the maintenance of a funded indebtedness to total capitalization ratio a defined formula per the facility of less than or equal to  limit the amount of subsidiary indebtedness and restrict the sale of significant assets  defined as or more of total consolidated assets 
at december   we were in compliance with all the facility covenants  including the funded indebtedness to total capitalization ratio  which was 
there were no direct borrowings under the facility during the year ended december   however  to the extent we have outstanding commercial paper  our ability to borrow under the facility is reduced 
at december   we had no outstanding commercial paper 
if market conditions were to change and revenues were to be significantly reduced or operating costs could not be controlled  our cash flows and liquidity could be reduced 
additionally  it could cause the rating agencies to lower our credit rating 
we do not have any ratings triggers in the facility that would accelerate the maturity of any borrowings under the facility 
however  a downgrade in our credit ratings could increase the cost of borrowings under the facility 
also  a downgrade in our credit ratings could limit or preclude our ability to issue commercial paper 
should this occur  we would seek alternative sources of funding  including borrowing under the facility 
cash requirements we believe operating cash flows combined with short term borrowings  as needed  will provide us with sufficient capital resources and liquidity to manage our operations  meet contractual obligations  fund capital expenditures  repurchase common stock and support the development of our short term and long term operating strategies 
we currently expect that capital expenditures will be between million and million  excluding acquisitions 
the expenditures are expected to be used primarily for normal  recurring items necessary to support the growth of our business and operations 
in  we will repay the million notes due may and the million notes due june these repayments are expected to be funded with one or more of the following cash flows from operations  available cash on hand and commercial paper borrowings 
in  we also expect to make interest payments of approximately million to million 
this is based on our current expectations of debt levels during we have authorization remaining to repurchase up to million in common stock 
we may continue to repurchase our common stock in depending on the price of our common stock  our liquidity and other considerations 
we anticipate paying dividends of per share of common stock in however  our board of directors is free to change the dividend policy at any time 
during  we estimate that we will contribute approximately million to million to our pension plans and make benefit payments related to postretirement welfare plans of approximately million 
we anticipate making income tax payments of approximately million to million in 
table of contents we do not believe that there are any other material trends  demands  commitments  events or uncertainties that would have  or are reasonably likely to have  a material impact on our financial condition and liquidity 
other than previously discussed  we currently have no information that would create a reasonable likelihood that the reported levels of revenues and cash flows from operations in are not indicative of what we can expect in the future 
the following table summarizes our aggregate contractual cash obligations as of december  in millions payments due by period less than after total year years years years total debt operating leases purchase obligations other long term liabilities reflected on balance sheet under gaap total amounts represent the expected cash payments for our long term debt and do not include any unamortized discounts  deferred issuance costs or deferred gains on terminated interest rate swap agreements

new accounting standards effective january   we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets 
sfas no 
requires that the fair value of a liability associated with an asset retirement obligation aro be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
the liability for the aro is revised each subsequent period due to the passage of time and changes in estimates 
the associated retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset and subsequently depreciated over the life of the asset 
the adoption of sfas no 
in resulted in a charge of million  net of tax of million  recorded as the cumulative effect of accounting change in the consolidated statement of operations 
in conjunction with the adoption  we recorded aro liabilities of million primarily for anticipated costs of obligations associated with the future disposal of power source units at certain of our divisions and refurbishment costs associated with certain leased facilities in europe and with a fleet of leased railcars and tanks 

table of contents in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin requires disclosures by a guarantor in its financial statements about obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued and requires a guarantor to recognize  at the inception of certain guarantees  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
the adoption of the provisions of fin relating to the initial recognition and measurement of guarantor liabilities  which were effective for qualifying guarantees entered into or modified after december   did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 
we adopted the new disclosure requirements in in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
an entity is subject to the consolidation rules of fin and is referred to as a variable interest entity vie if the entity s equity investors lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its operations without additional financial support 
in december  the fasb issued modifications to fin fin r  resulting in multiple effective dates based on the nature as well as the creation date of a vie 
we are completing our evaluation of the provisions of the original fin and fin r and do not expect the adoption to have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities  which amends and clarifies the accounting for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities under sfas no 
sfas no

fas fsp  accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of  which provides temporary guidance concerning the recently enacted medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of the act 
sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  requires presently enacted changes in laws that will take effect in future periods to be taken into account in measuring current period postretirement benefit cost and the accumulated projected benefit obligation apbo 
fsp allows companies that sponsor affected postretirement benefit plans to elect to defer recognizing the effects of the act on postretirement benefit expense and on the apbo pursuant to sfas no 
we have elected to defer accounting for the effects of the act until related party transactions in conjunction with the formation of westerngeco in november  we entered into an agreement with schlumberger whereby a cash true up payment will be made by either of the parties to the venture based on a formula comparing the ratio of the net present value of sales revenue from each party s contributed multiclient seismic libraries during the four year period ending november  and the ratio of the net book value of those libraries as of november  the maximum payment that either party will be required to make as a result of this adjustment is million 
in the event that future sales from the contributed libraries continue in the same relative percentages incurred through december   we currently estimate that schlumberger will make a payment to us in the range of million to million 
any payment to be received by us will be recorded as an adjustment to the carrying value of our investment in westerngeco 
in november  we also entered into an agreement with westerngeco whereby westerngeco subleased a facility from us for a period of ten years at then current market rates 
in and  we received payments of million and million  respectively  from westerngeco related to this lease 
in conjunction with the formation of westerngeco  we transferred a lease on a seismic vessel to the venture 
we were the sole guarantor of this lease obligation 
during  the lease and guarantee were terminated as a result of the purchase of the seismic vessel by westerngeco 
at december  and  net accounts receivable from affiliates totaled million and million  respectively 
there were no other significant related party transactions

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s we are exposed to certain market risks that are inherent in our financial instruments that arise in the normal course of business 
we may enter into derivative financial instrument transactions to manage or reduce market risk but do not enter into derivative financial instrument transactions for speculative purposes 
a discussion of our primary market risk exposure in financial instruments is presented below 
indebtedness we are subject to interest rate risk on our long term fixed interest rate debt 
commercial paper borrowings  other short term borrowings and variable rate long term debt do not give rise to significant interest rate risk because these borrowings either have maturities of less than three months or have variable interest rates 
all other things being equal  the fair market value of debt with a fixed interest rate will increase as interest rates fall and will decrease as interest rates rise 
this exposure to interest rate risk is managed by borrowing money that has a variable interest rate or using interest rate swaps to change fixed interest rate borrowings to variable interest rate borrowings 
at december   we had fixed rate debt aggregating  million and variable rate debt aggregating million 
the following table sets forth  as of december  and  the principal cash flow requirements for our indebtedness  which bear a fixed rate of interest and are denominated in us dollars  and the related weighted average effective interest rates by expected maturity dates dollar amounts in millions 

table of contents thereafter total as of december  long term debt weighted average effective interest rates as of december  long term debt weighted average effective interest rates fair market value of fixed rate long term debt was  million at december  and  million at december  includes the effect of the amortization of deferred gains on terminated interest rate swap agreements 
interest rate swap agreements at different times during  we entered into three separate interest rate swap agreements  each for a notional amount of million  associated with our notes due january these agreements had been designated and had qualified as fair value hedging instruments 
due to our outlook for interest rates  we terminated the three agreements and received payments totaling million 
each of the three agreements was terminated prior to entering into a new agreement 
the deferred gains are being amortized as a reduction of interest expense over the remaining life of the underlying debt security  which matures in january during  we terminated two interest rate swap agreements that had been entered into in prior years 
these agreements had been designated and had qualified as fair value hedging instruments 
upon termination  we received proceeds totaling million 
the deferred gains of million and million are being amortized as a reduction of interest expense over the remaining lives of the underlying debt securities  which mature in june and january  respectively 
foreign currency and foreign currency forward contracts we conduct operations around the world in a number of different currencies 
the majority of our significant foreign subsidiaries have designated the local currency as their functional currency 
as such  future earnings are subject to change due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates when transactions are denominated in currencies other than our functional currencies 
to minimize the need for foreign currency forward contracts to hedge this exposure  our objective is to manage foreign currency exposure by maintaining a minimal consolidated net asset or net liability position in a currency other than the functional currency 
at december   we had entered into several foreign currency forward contracts with notional amounts aggregating million to hedge exposure to currency fluctuations in various foreign currencies  including the british pound sterling  the norwegian krone  the euro  the brazilian real and the argentine peso 
the contracts are designated and qualify as fair value hedging instruments 
based on quoted market prices as of december  for contracts with similar terms and maturity dates  we recorded a gain of million to adjust these foreign currency forward contracts to their fair market value 
this gain offsets designated foreign exchange losses resulting from the underlying exposures and is included in selling  general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of operations 
at december   we had entered into a foreign currency forward contract with a notional amount of million to hedge exposure to fluctuations in the british pound sterling 
the contract was a cash flow hedge 
based on year end quoted market prices for contracts with similar terms and maturity dates  no asset or liability was recorded as the forward price was substantially the same as the contract price 
the counterparties to the forward contracts are major financial institutions 
the credit ratings and concentration of risk of these financial institutions are monitored on a continuing basis 
in the unlikely event that the counterparties fail to meet the terms of a foreign currency contract  our exposure is limited to the foreign currency rate differential
