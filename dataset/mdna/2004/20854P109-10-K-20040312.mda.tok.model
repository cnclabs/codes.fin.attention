item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation general consol energy incurred a loss before income taxes and before effect of change in accounting principle of million  recognized income tax benefits of million and recognized a million income adjustment for the effect of change in accounting for mine closing  reclamation  and gas well closing costs resulting in a net loss of million for the twelve months ended december  consol energy incurred a loss before income taxes of million and recognized income tax benefits of million  resulting in net income of million for the twelve months ended december total coal sales for the twelve months ended december  were million tons  including our portion of sales by equity affiliates  of which million tons of sales were produced by consol energy operations  by our equity affiliates or sold from inventory of company produced coal  including coal sold from inventories and produced by equity affiliates 
this compares with total coal sales of million tons for the twelve months ended december   of which million tons were produced by consol energy operations or sold from inventory of company produced coal including coal sold from inventories and produced by equity affiliates 
the decrease in tons sold primarily is related to lower company coal production in the period to period comparison 
consol energy produced million tons  including our portion of production at equity affiliates in the period compared to million tons  including our portion of production at equity affiliates in the period 
the decrease in tons produced is primarily due to the closure of the dilworth  humphrey and windsor mines  where economically mineable reserves were depleted in the last quarter of the decrease was also attributable to the sale of the assets at the cardinal river and line creek mines in february and the idling of the rend lake mine in due to market conditions 
coal inventories  including our portion of inventories at equity affiliates  were million tons at december  compared to million tons at december  sales of coalbed methane gas  including our share of the sales from equity affiliates were billion gross cubic feet in the period compared to billion gross cubic feet in the period 
the increased sales volume is primarily due to higher production volumes as a result of our on going drilling program 
our average sales price for coalbed methane gas  including our portion of sales from equity affiliates  was per thousand cubic feet in the period compared to per thousand cubic feet in the period 
the increase in average sales price was driven by concerns for levels of natural gas in storage at the beginning of the year and by concerns over intermediate term supplies of gas in the united states 
in december  consol energy adopted a shareholder rights plan designed to ensure that all shareholders receive fair value for their common shares in the event of a proposed takeover and to guard against the use of partial tender offers or other coercive tactics to gain control of the company without offering fair value to consol energy shareholders 
in december  standard and poor s lowered consol energy s rating of our long term debt to bb th lowest out of rating categories 
standard and poor s defines an obligation rated bb as less vulnerable to nonpayment than other speculative issues 
however  the rating indicates that an obligor faces major ongoing uncertainties or exposure to adverse business  financial  or economic conditions  which could lead to the obligor s inadequate capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation 
the negative sign shows relative standing within the rating category 
at the same time  standard and poor s placed consol energy s senior unsecured debt rating on creditwatch with negative implications 
in december  moody s investor service lowered its rating of consol energy s long term debt from ba to ba th lowest out of rating categories 
the rating remains under review for possible further downgrade 
bonds which are rated ba are considered to have speculative elements  their future cannot be considered as well assured 
often the protection of interest and principal payments may be very moderate  and thereby not well safeguarded during both good and bad times over the future 
uncertainty of position characterizes bonds in this class 
the modifier indicates that the obligation ranks in the lower end of its generic rating category 
a security rating is not a recommendation by a rating agency to buy  sell or hold securities 
the security rating may be subject to change 
in january   consol energy announced that it intended to sell the stock in its wholly owned subsidiary cnx australia pty limited to certain affiliates of amci  inc for million  the assumption of approximately million of debt  and associated interest rate swaps and foreign currency hedges 
cnx australia pty limited  through its wholly owned subsidiary consol energy australia pty limited  owns a interest in the glennies creek mine in new south wales  australia with its joint venture partner maitland main collieries pty limited  an affiliate of amci  inc agreements were finalized on february  and are expected to result in a pre tax gain of approximately million 
in january  a special committee of the board of directors of consol energy completed its investigation of allegations against certain directors and officers of the company contained in an anonymous letter sent to the united states securities and exchange commission 
the special committee found no evidence of fraud or malfeasance and no evidence to suggest that consol energy s publicly issued financial statements were incorrect 
in january  consol energy s board of directors elected three new independent members to the board 
they were william e 
davis  a power industry executive  william p 
powell  an investment banker  and joseph t 
williams  a former oil and gas industry executive 
in february  consol energy s former majority shareholder  rwe ag  closed on a previously announced private placement sale of its remaining million shares of consol energy common stock 
on september and   rwe closed on a previously announced sale of million shares of consol energy common stock 
on the same dates  consol energy closed on a previously announced sale of million primary shares of its common stock  increasing the total shares of common stock outstanding to million and reduced rwe s initial majority interest from to 
on october   rwe closed on the sale of million shares of consol energy common stock 
that sale reduced rwe s ownership to million shares  or 
in february  as a result of the sale of the remaining shares of consol energy common stock held by rwe ag and pursuant to the terms of the placement agreement  dated september   by and among consol energy  friedman  billings  ramsey co  inc and rwe rheinbraun ag  the remaining two directors representing rwe ag  berthold bonekamp and dr 
rolf zimmerman  resigned from the consol energy board of directors 
also in february  raj k 
gupta  a former oil and gas industry executive  was elected to the board of directors of consol energy 
he will serve until the next election of directors at the annual meeting of shareholders 
change in fiscal year consol energy changed its fiscal year from a fiscal year ending june to a calendar year ending december consol energy had a transitional fiscal period ending december  consol energy s first full fiscal year ending december was the year that started january  and ended december  consol energy undertook this change in order to align its fiscal year with that of rwe ag  its majority shareholder at that time 
results of operations twelve months ended december  compared with twelve months ended december  all dollar amounts in charts reported in millions net income net income changed primarily due to the following items period period dollar variance percentage change gas sales coal sales produced and purchased other sales and other income total revenue coal cost of goods sold produced and purchased gas cost of goods sold other cost of goods sold total cost of goods sold depreciation  depletion and amortization interest expense other total costs earnings loss before income taxes income taxes earnings loss before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle cumulative effect of change in accounting principle net income loss net income loss for the period was lower than the period primarily due to increased cost of goods sold and lower income tax benefits  offset  in part  by higher revenues and lower depreciation  depletion and amortization 
the increase in cost of goods sold was mainly attributable to higher retiree medical costs and salaried pension expenses  increased gas volumes and royalty costs related to gas sales  and costs related to mine fires at the loveridge mine and mine tax benefits were lower in the period primarily due to the tax effect of the current year s sale of the company s canadian assets 
the higher sales revenues are primarily attributable to the increased gas volumes sold in the period compared to the period 
depreciation  depletion and amortization expense declined primarily as a result of the equipment at the dilworth mine and the related preparation plant becoming fully depreciated prior to the period  coinciding with the closure of the mine due to economically depleted reserves 
revenue period period dollar variance percentage change sales produced coal produced coal related party total produced coal purchased coal gas industrial supplies other total sales freight revenue freight revenue related party total freight revenue other income total revenue and other income the decrease in company produced coal sales revenue was due mainly to the reduction in volumes sold during the period substantially offset by increased average sales price per ton 
period period variance percentage change produced tons sold in millions average sales price per ton the decrease in tons sold is related to the closure of the dilworth  humphrey and windsor mines  where economically mineable reserves were depleted in the last quarter of the decrease in tons sold was also attributable to the sale of the assets at the cardinal river mine in february and the idling of the rend lake mine in due to market conditions 
expected coal production in the fourth quarter of was also impacted by unfavorable mining conditions at enlow fork mine  mill creek mine and mine  a roof fall along the west beltline at the bailey mine  equipment problems at vp and jones fork mines and flooding along the ohio river 
these decreases in tonnage were offset  in part  by increased sales of company produced coal primarily at the mcelroy mine and  to a lesser extent  at several other mines 
the increased tonnage at the mcelroy mine is attributable to the mine running for the full year compared to being idled for two months of the year 
the mcelroy mine increase is also attributable to the preparation plant expansion that was completed in the last quarter of the reductions in company produced coal sales revenue were substantially offset by the increase in average sales price per ton sold 
the increase in average sales price primarily reflects higher prices negotiated in the second half of the decrease in company purchased coal sales revenue was due mainly to a decrease in average sales price per ton of purchased coal 
period period variance percentage change purchased tons sold in millions average sales price per ton the reduced average sales price is primarily due to sales of purchased coal in at prices under commitments made during periods of lower prices as compared to sales of coal purchased under commitments made during a period of higher prices 
the reduced sales price is also due to consol energy purchasing and selling a lower quality coal in the period compared to the period 
the increase in gas sales revenue was primarily due to a higher average sales price per thousand cubic feet and increased volumes sold in the period compared to the period 
period period variance percentage change gas sales volumes in billion gross cubic feet average sales price per thousand cubic feet including effects of derivative transactions the gas market price increases were largely driven by the overall supply demand imbalance that depleted united states storage levels by the end of march and the subsequent need to refill that storage prior to the start of the next winter heating season 
consol energy enters into various physical gas supply transactions with our gas marketers  selling gas under short term multi month contract nominations generally not exceeding one year 
consol energy has also entered into eight float for fixed gas swap transactions and two float for collar gas swap transactions that qualify as financial cash flow hedges  which exist parallel to the underlying physical transactions 
in  these cash flow hedges represented of our total produced sales volumes at an average price of per thousand cubic feet 
these cash flow hedges are expected to represent of our estimated produced sales volumes at an average price of per thousand cubic feet 
consol energy sold of its gas sales volumes in the period at an average price of per thousand cubic feet compared to of its gas sales volumes in the period at per thousand cubic feet under contracts agreed to in prior periods 
higher sales volumes were a result of wells coming on line from the ongoing drilling program  which allowed consol energy to take advantage of increased demand 
the decrease in revenues from the sale of industrial supplies was due to reduced sales volumes 
freight revenue  outside and related party  is based on weight of coal shipped  negotiated freight rates and method of transportation ie  rail  barge  truck  etc 
used for the customers to which consol energy contractually provides transportation services 
freight revenue is the amount billed to customers for transportation costs incurred 
other income consists of interest income  gain or loss on the disposition of assets  equity in earnings of affiliates  service income  royalty income  derivative gains and losses  rental income and miscellaneous income 
period period dollar variance percentage change gain on sale of assets royalty income equity in loss of affiliates foreign currency derivative harbor maintenance fee refund contract settlement other miscellaneous total other revenue the increase in gain on sale of assets primarily was related to the expiration in the period of an option granted to a third party to purchase property for which consol energy received nonrefundable proceeds of million and gains from the sale of surplus equipment 
royalty income increased due primarily to third parties producing more tonnage from consol owned property in the period to period comparison 
the decrease in equity losses of affiliates is due mainly to the absence of million in losses incurred in attributable to a coal equity affiliate  line creek mine  that was sold in february the decrease is also attributable to an equity affiliate s sale of property in the period that resulted in a gain of which our portion was approximately million 
these changes were offset  in part by million of additional losses in the period due to a coal equity affiliate s  glennies creek mine  coal recovery rate being lower due to a rock intrusion in the coal seam 
foreign currency derivative gains are related to the foreign currency hedge contracts entered into on july  to permit consol energy australia pty cea to purchase australian dollars at a fixed exchange rate 
cea entered into these hedges in order to minimize exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
consol energy sold its interest in the glennies creek mine as of february  as part of the transaction  the purchaser will assume cea s debt related to glennies creek mine and the associated hedging arrangements 
other income also includes a million refund received from the federal government for harbor maintenance fees imposed by federal statute that was declared unconstitutional 
we have pursued claims for these fees since  and we do not expect other refunds related to these claims 
the increases in other income were partially offset in the period compared to the period due to million of income related to a contract settlement which occurred in the period 
an additional million increase in other income was due to various transactions that occurred throughout both periods  none of which were individually material 
costs period period dollar variance percentage change cost of goods sold and other charges produced coal purchased coal gas industrial supplies closed and idle mines other total cost of goods sold increased cost of goods sold and other charges for company produced coal was due mainly to the increased cost per unit of produced coal sold  offset  in part  by reduced sales tons 
period period variance percentage change produced tons sold in millions average cost of goods sold and other charges per ton average cost of goods sold and other charges per ton for produced coal increased due mainly to increased medical expenses for retired employees and increased salaried pension expenses 
retiree medical and salaried pension expenses are actuarially determined based on several assumptions as discussed in critical accounting policies and in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this form k for the year ended december  cost per ton for produced coal also increased due to higher supply cost per unit 
these increases in costs were offset  in part  by reduced company produced sales volumes 
purchased coal cost of goods sold and other charges decreased due primarily to a reduction in the average cost per ton and reduced volumes of purchased coal sold 
period period variance percentage change purchased tons sold in millions average cost of goods sold and other charges per ton the reduced average cost of purchased coal is primarily due to purchasing coal in the period under commitments made during the prior year when prices were lower 
the lower average cost of purchased coal is also attributable to consol energy purchasing and reselling a lower quality coal in the period compared to the period 
gas cost of goods sold and other charges increased due to increased average cost per thousand cubic feet sold and increased volumes 
period period variance percentage change gas sales volumes in billion gross cubic feet average cost per thousand cubic feet the increase in average cost per thousand cubic feet of gas sold was attributable to a increase per thousand cubic feet in royalty expense 
royalty expense increased primarily due to the increase in average sales price per thousand cubic feet in the period compared to the period 
the increase is also due to additional employees  additional contractor maintenance cost and additional power charges attributable to the increased number of wells in production in the period to period comparison 
gas cost of goods sold and other charges also increased due to the increased volumes sold in the period as discussed previously 
we currently plan to drill approximately wells in the twelve month period ending december  variable costs on a per unit basis are not anticipated to increase as a result of the drilling program  although  due to the uncertainty of costs such as maintenance  contract labor  and corporate overhead  the incremental impact of the drilling program on per unit costs for cannot be reasonably predicted 
industrial supplies cost of goods sold decreased due to reduced sales volumes 
closed and idle mine cost decreased primarily due to approximately million of expense related to mines that were idled for all or part of the period that were operating in the period  or that were closed in the period 
these mines include idled loveridge  shoemaker  mcelroy  and humphrey which was closed 
closed and idle mine cost also decreased approximately million due to the reduction of workforce at rend lake mine in the period related to the mine being placed on long term idle status pending market conditions 
these costs also decreased approximately million due to differences in the engineering survey adjustments related to mine closing and reclamation compared to the engineering survey adjustments 
the additional million decrease in closed and idle mine cost was due to various miscellaneous transactions which occurred throughout both periods  none of which were individually material 
the decreases in closed and idle mine cost were offset  in part  by approximately million of additional mine closing and reclamation expenses related to changes in the method of accounting for these liabilities 
in january  consol energy adopted the statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
under this statement  the interest accretion related to the discounted portions of mine closing  reclamation and gas well closing liabilities  previously reported as interest expense  are now reported as operating expenses 
under the previous method of accounting for mine closing  reclamation and gas well closing obligations  the estimated obligations for closed mines were fully accrued and adjusted annually as the estimates were updated by engineers 
miscellaneous cost of goods sold and other charges increased due to the following items period period dollar variance percentage change loveridge fire mine eighty four fire litigation settlements and contingencies cardinal river severance and pension cost supply inventory write downs miscellaneous transactions in february  loveridge mine experienced a fire near the bottom of the slope entry that is used to carry coal from the mine to the surface 
the costs of extinguishing the fire are estimated to be approximately million attributable to cost of goods sold and other charges and other related expenses are estimated to be approximately million  net of expected insurance recovery applicable to both the cost of goods sold and other expenses 
in late december  the mine had begun the process of developing a new underground area that would be mined with longwall mining equipment that was expected to be installed later in the fire has delayed this installation until march in january  eighty four mine experienced a fire along several hundred feet of the conveyor belt entry servicing the longwall section of the mine 
the fire was extinguished approximately two weeks later 
on january   the mine resumed production on a limited basis with continuous mining machines  while repairs continued on the belt entry 
the fire caused damage to the roof support system  the conveyor belt and the steel framework on which the belt travels 
repairs took several weeks to complete and are estimated to cost approximately million attributable to cost of goods sold and other related charges and million attributable to other expenses  net of expected insurance recovery applicable to both the cost of goods sold and to other expenses 
longwall coal production  which accounts for the majority of coal normally produced at the mine resumed on february litigation settlements and contingencies increased over the prior year due to various contingent loss accruals related to various individual contingencies  waste management accruals and asbestos claims in both periods  none of which are individually material 
consol energy owned a interest in cardinal river until february  when it and related assets were sold 
cardinal river mine severance and pension accruals are attributable to the costs for which consol energy remains responsible following the sale of the mine s assets 
supply inventory write downs reflect adjustments made to supply inventories that are unique to the equipment used at locations where the mining activities have ceased  such as the dilworth and rend lake mines 
cost of goods sold and other charges also increased due to various miscellaneous transactions which occurred throughout both periods  none of which are individually material 
freight expense is based on weight of coal shipped  negotiated freight rates and method of transportation ie  rail  barge  truck  etc 
used for the customers to whom consol energy contractually provides transportation 
freight expense is billed to customers and the revenue from such billing equals the transportation expense 
period period dollar variance percentage change freight expense selling  general and administrative costs have increased due to the following items period period dollar variance percentage change wages and salaries other post employment and pension costs professional consulting and other purchased services other total selling  general and administrative wages and salaries for selling  general and administrative employees have increased primarily due to merit increases  promotions and new hires throughout the period 
in december  consol energy implemented a reduction in workforce program primarily focused on reducing the number of positions in the selling  general and administrative areas to better align with its current business strategy 
this program is expected to reduce approximately positions and approximately million of wages  salaries and benefits in the administrative functions in the period 
other post employment and pension costs have increased due mainly to increased medical expenses for retired employees and changes in actuarial assumptions used for pension 
retiree medical and salaried pension expenses are actuarially determined based on several assumptions as discussed in critical accounting policies and in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this form k for the year ended december  costs of professional consulting and other purchased services have increased in the period primarily due to services provided in relation to a special investigation into matters alleged in an anonymous letter and transactions in connection with the reduction by rwe rheinbraun  the former controlling stockholder  of its percentage ownership in the company 
other selling  general and administrative costs increased primarily due to director and officer insurance costs incurred in the period 
consol energy officers and directors were previously insured under the rwe ag general liability policy 
depreciation  depletion and amortization has decreased due to the following items period period dollar variance percentage change coal gas other total depreciation  depletion and amortization the decrease in coal depreciation  depletion and amortization was primarily attributable to the equipment at the dilworth mine and the related preparation plant becoming fully depreciated prior to the period to coincide with the closure of the mine due to economically depleted reserves and other mine equipment becoming fully depreciated in the period 
the decrease also relates to lower units of production financial depletion due to lower production volumes in the period compared to the period 
decreases in coal depreciation  depletion and amortization were offset  in part  by a million increase due to the depreciation of the assets recorded in relation to the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas no 

sfas no 
requires depreciation of the capitalized asset retirement cost 
the depreciation of these assets is generally determined on a units of production basis over the life of the producing asset 
the decrease in gas depreciation  depletion and amortization was primarily due to a higher ratio of gas production coming from mine gob areas which have lives generally less than twelve months long 
as a result the costs to produce these areas are expensed instead of capitalized and then amortized 
this gob gas production is not included in the calculation of units of production depreciation or depletion for capitalized gas costs 
the reduction in gas depreciation  depletion and amortization was offset  in part  by additional depreciation attributable to new assets placed in service during the period and additional depletion and depreciation related to the increased volumes from other than gob wells produced during the period 
the reductions were also offset  in part  by a million increase due to the depreciation of the assets recorded in relation to the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas no 

sfas no 
requires depreciation of the capitalized asset retirement cost 
the depreciation of these assets is generally determined on a units of production basis over the life of the producing asset 
the increase in other depreciation  depletion and amortization was primarily due to additional depreciation on the integrated information technology system installed to support business processes 
the system was implemented in stages beginning in january and was substantially completed in august interest expense has decreased primarily due to the following items period period dollar variance percentage change mine closing  reclamation and gas well closing liabilities commercial paper other total interest expense interest accretion on the discounted portions of mine closing  reclamation and gas well closing liabilities changed due to the implementation of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
under this statement  the interest accretion related to the discounted portions of mine closing  reclamation and gas well closing liabilities  previously reported as interest expense  are now reported as operating expense 
interest expense on commercial paper decreased primarily due to a million reduction in the weighted average principal amount of commercial paper outstanding and a per annum reduction in the weighted average interest rate on amounts outstanding in the period 
as of july  consol energy was no longer able to participate as a seller of commercial paper due to standard and poor s lowering its rating of our long term debt to bb 
subsequently  consol energy s debt ratings have been lowered by standard and poor s and moody s 
see discussion in general management discussion and analysis on this form k 
other interest expense increased due primarily to a million increase in interest expense related to the million principal amount of notes due in  which were issued in march and therefore were not outstanding for the entire period 
this increase was offset  in part  by a million reduction in interest expense due to the reduction of long term debt through scheduled debt repayments 
taxes other than income decreased primarily due to the following items period period dollar variance percentage change payroll taxes property and other taxes capital stock and franchise tax production taxes total taxes other than income payroll taxes have decreased primarily due to the closure or idling of several mines in the period to period comparison 
dilworth  rend lake and humphrey mines were not operating in the period and  therefore  the average number of employees was lower in the period compared to the period 
decreased property and other taxes are attributable to the adjustment of prior year estimated accruals to the actual amounts paid in the period 
capital stock and franchise tax has been reduced in the period due to the impacts of merging several consol energy companies over the past several years 
increased production taxes are primarily due to higher severance taxes attributable to higher gas production volumes and associated sales price in the period compared to the period 
this increase was offset  in part  by decreased black lung excise taxes related to the lower coal production volumes 
restructuring costs restructuring costs of approximately million in the period primarily represent the severance dollars paid related to the december reduction in workforce program implemented by consol energy 
the program was primarily focused on reducing the number of positions in the selling  general and administrative areas and is expected to reduce approximately positions and approximately million of wages  salaries and benefits in the administrative functions in the period 
also included in the restructuring costs are severance amounts paid throughout for positions that have been eliminated by consol energy management in an effort to reduce costs and realign the company s selling  general and administrative functions with today s company strategies 
export sales excise tax resolution consol energy is no longer required to pay certain excise taxes on export sales 
we have received refunds and related interest in the period for our claims for the years to upon receipt of these refunds  we have adjusted our estimate of interest receivable to the amounts received 
this adjustment resulted in additional income of million in the period 
a receivable for the claims for the years to is still outstanding 
there is no interest receivable related to these claims 
income taxes period period variance percentage change earnings loss before income taxes tax expense benefit effective income tax rate consol energy s effective tax rate is sensitive to changes in annual profitability and percentage depletion 
the effective tax rate changed from the effective rate primarily due to the tax effect of the current year s sale of the company s canadian assets 
another significant cause of the change was due to provision to return adjustments recorded in see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this form k for additional information 
cumulative effect of changes in accounting for mine closing  reclamation and gas well closing costs effective january   consol energy adopted sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  as required 
consol energy reflected a gain of approximately million  net of a tax cost of approximately million 
at the time of adoption  total assets  net of accumulated depreciation  increased approximately million and total liabilities increased approximately million 
the amounts recorded upon adoption are dependent upon a number of variables  including the estimated future retirement costs  estimated proved reserves  assumptions involving profit margins  inflation rates and the assumed credit adjusted risk free interest rate 
previous accounting standards generally used the units of production method to match estimated retirement costs with the revenues generated by the producing assets 
in contrast  sfas no 
requires depreciation of the capitalized asset retirement cost and accretion of the asset retirement obligation over time 
the depreciation will generally be determined on a units of production basis  whereas the accretion to be recognized will escalate over the life of the producing assets  typically as production declines 
because of the long lives of the underlying producing assets  the impact on net income in the near term is not expected to be material 
twelve months ended december  compared with twelve months ended december  unaudited net income consol energy s net income for the twelve months ended december  was million compared with million for the twelve months ended december  pre tax income for the period was million including million related to the recognition of the export sales excise tax resolution 
consol energy had a pre tax loss of million in the period 
lower net income for was also the result of a million ton reduction in volumes of company produced coal sold 
the decrease in tons sold was due primarily to lower demand for coal in the period 
demand was weak primarily due to the continued sluggish united states economy and the lingering effect of higher than normal customer inventory levels 
the decrease in tons sold was also due to the deferral of shipments by our customers during the year to later periods and reduced volumes from requirements contracts 
decreases in net income also resulted from lower average sales prices per million british thermal unit of coalbed methane gas sold in the period compared to the period 
the average sales price was per million british thermal units for the year to date period  a  or decrease compared to the per million british thermal unit in the period 
the decrease in average sales price was primarily due to reduced demand for gas in the industrial sector and lower demand for gas during the winter heating season that resulted in high levels of gas in storage 
net income also decreased due to increased cost of goods sold related to the increase in gas volumes sold 
costs also increased due to additional closed and idle mine costs  additional purchased coal costs and increases in miscellaneous cost of goods sold and other operating charges 
these decreases were offset  in part  by income tax benefits recognized in the period compared to tax expense recognized in the period 
the income tax benefit was due mainly to a pre tax loss for the period compared to pre tax income in the period without a comparable reduction in percentage depletion tax benefits 
decreases in net income were also offset  in part  by higher volumes of gas sold as a result of the august  acquisition of the remaining interest in pocahontas gas partnership 
gas sales volumes were billion cubic feet in the period  a  or billion cubic feet increase from the period 
average sales price per ton of company produced coal sold also increased which offset  in part  the reduction to net income 
the average sales price for company produced coal was in the period compared to in the period 
the increase of  or  reflects the higher prices negotiated in s more favorable coal market 
revenue sales decreased million  or to  million for the twelve months ended december  from  million for the twelve months ended december  revenues from the sale of company produced coal decreased million  or  to  million in the period from  million in the period 
the decrease in company produced coal sales revenues was due mainly to a decrease in the volume of company produced coal sold 
produced coal sales volumes were million tons in the period  a million ton  or  decline from the million tons sold in the period 
the decrease in tons sold was due primarily to lower demand for coal in the period 
demand was weak primarily due to the continued sluggish united states economy and the lingering effect of higher than normal customer inventory levels 
the decrease in tons sold was also due to the deferral of shipments by our customers during the year to later periods and reduced volumes from requirements contracts 
the decrease in tons sold was offset  in part  by increases in the average sales price per ton of company produced coal sold 
the average sales price for company produced coal was in the period compared to in the period 
the increase of  or  reflects the higher prices negotiated in s more favorable coal market 
revenues from the sale of industrial supplies decreased million  or  to million in the period from million in the period primarily due to reduced sales volumes 
during the fiscal year ended june   the physical assets and operations associated with industrial and store management sites were sold 
the sale did not have a material impact on consol energy s financial position  results of operations or cash flow 
fairmont supply continues to operate service centers 
these decreases in revenues were partially offset by increased revenues from the sale of coalbed methane gas 
revenues from the sale of gas increased million  or to million in the period from million in the period 
the increase was due mainly to higher volumes of gas sold as a result of the august  acquisition of the remaining interest in pocahontas gas partnership 
sales volumes were billion cubic feet in the period  a  or billion cubic feet increase from the period 
the increase in sales volumes was offset  in part  by lower average sales prices in the period compared to the period 
the average sales price was per million british thermal units for the year to date period  a  or decrease compared to the per million british thermal unit in the period 
the decrease in average sales price was primarily due to reduced demand for gas in the industrial sector and lower demand for gas during the winter heating season that resulted in higher levels of gas in storage in the beginning of the period compared to the period 
revenues from the sale of purchased coal increased million  or  to million in the period from million in the period primarily due to increased average sales prices 
the average sales price per ton of purchased coal increased  or  to in the period compared to in the period 
the increase in price per ton reflects the higher prices negotiated in s more favorable coal market 
this increase was offset  in part  by reduced sales volumes 
sales volumes decreased million tons  or  to million tons in the period compared to million tons in the period 
the decrease in tons sold was due primarily to lower demand for coal in the period 
demand was weak primarily due to the continued sluggish united states economy and the lingering effect of higher than normal customer inventory levels 
freight revenue  outside and related party  decreased million  or  to million in the period from million in the period 
freight revenue is based on weight of coal shipped  negotiated freight rates and method of transportation eg  rail  barge or truck used for the customers to which consol energy contractually provides transportation services 
freight revenue is the amount billed to customers for transportation costs incurred 
other income  which consists of interest income  gain or loss on the disposition of assets  equity in earnings of affiliates  service income  royalty income  rental income and miscellaneous income  was million in the period compared to million in the period 
the decrease of million  or  was primarily due to the million reduction in equity in earnings of affiliates 
this was mainly due to the august  purchase of the remaining interest in pocahontas gas partnership and the remaining interest in the cardinal states gathering company 
as a result of the acquisition  consol energy owns of these entities and began to account for them as fully consolidated subsidiaries 
before the acquisition  consol energy accounted for these companies using the equity method 
other income also decreased by million as a result of various transactions that occurred throughout both periods  none of which was individually material 
these decreases in other income were offset  in part  by a million income adjustment related to a coal contract settlement consol energy received in the period 
costs cost of goods sold and other operating charges decreased million  or  to  million in the period from  million in the period 
cost of goods sold for company produced coal decreased million  or to  million in the period from  million in the period 
the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the volume of company produced coal sold 
the decrease in tons sold was due primarily to lower demand for coal in the period 
demand was weak primarily due to the continued sluggish united states economy  and the lingering effect of higher than normal customer inventory levels 
the decrease in tons sold was also due to the deferral of shipments by our customers during the year to later periods and reduced volumes from requirements contracts 
the reduced cost of goods sold and other charges related to volume  was offset  in part  by a increase in the cost per ton sold of company produced coal 
the increase in cost primarily relates to employee benefit costs and supply costs 
the rise in employee benefit costs is primarily due to increased medical costs and increased post employment benefit costs 
post employment benefit costs are calculated actuarially and have increased due to changes in assumptions  including discount rate and mortality tables used in this calculation 
see critical accounting policies for a discussion of other post employment benefits 
cost of goods sold for industrial supplies decreased million  or  to million in the period from million in the period 
the decrease in costs is related to reduced sales volumes resulting from the sale of industrial and store management sites that took place in the period 
fairmont supply continues to operate service centers 
coal property holding costs decreased million  or  to million in the period from million in the period 
the decrease was primarily due to leasehold surrenders that occurred in the period 
these decreases in cost of goods sold and other costs were offset  in part  by increased cost of goods sold for gas operations 
gas operations cost of goods sold increased million  or  to million in the period from million in the period 
the increase was due mainly to a increase in the volume of gas sold as a result of the august  acquisition of the remaining interest in pocahontas gas partnership 
the increase in volume was offset  in part  by a  or reduction in the cost per million british thermal units sold 
the average cost per million british thermal units sold was in the period compared to in the period 
the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the cost of gob well drilling and lower royalty expense 
gob wells are drilled in previously mined areas of underground coal mines 
royalty expenses decreased per british thermal unit primarily due to the decrease in average sales price per british thermal unit in the period compared to the period 
cost of goods sold for closed and idled mine costs increased million  or  to million in the period from million in the period 
the increase is primarily due to million related to locations that were closed or idled during a portion of the period that were in operation during the period 
this increase was offset  in part  by a decrease of million related to mine closing and reclamation liability adjustments as a result of updated engineering survey adjustments for closed and idled locations 
survey adjustments resulted in million of expense recognized in the period compared to million of income in the period 
cost of goods sold for purchased coal increased million  or  to million in the period from million in the period 
the increased costs were primarily due to an increase of  or  in the average cost per ton of purchased coal  offset  in part  by a decrease of million tons  or  decrease in the volume of purchased tons sold 
the average cost per ton of purchased coal was in the period compared to in the period 
miscellaneous cost of goods sold and other operating charges increased million  or  to million in the period from million in the period 
the increase is due mainly to million of equipment removal cost in the period compared to million in the period 
the increase in the period was also due to million of contribution expense related to the donation of property to the conservation fund and million of expense to recognize an allowance for doubtful accounts related to trade receivables 
bank fees also increased million in the period related to the renegotiation of our revolving credit facility 
the new facility replaces the previous agreement  which expired on september  and allows for an aggregate of million of commercial paper principal and letters of credit to be issued 
miscellaneous cost of goods sold and other operating charges also increased million due to various miscellaneous transactions that occurred throughout both periods  none of which were individually material 
these increases in cost of goods sold and other charges were offset  in part  by an million reduction in incentive compensation expense 
expense for this item was reduced in the period because performance targets for were not achieved 
miscellaneous costs of goods sold and other operating charges also includes million of expense for various contingent loss accruals related to asbestos  waste management site and various other contingencies in both the period and the period 
freight expense decreased million  or  to million in the period from million in the period 
freight expense is based on weight of coal shipped  negotiated freight rates and method of transportation eg  rail  barge or truck used for the customers that consol energy contractually provides transportation 
freight expense is billed to customers and the revenue from such billings equals the transportation expense 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million in the period from million in the period 
administrative expenses increased million due to additional wages  salaries and other costs related to executive severance which occurred in the period and increased medical costs in the period 
an increase of million was primarily due to expenses for training  licensing fees and professional consulting related to the conversion to a new integrated information technology system provided by sap ag to support business processes 
implementation of the system was completed in at an estimated total cost of million  a portion of which was capitalized 
these increases were offset  in part  by a million decrease in selling costs due to the reduction of sales employees at fairmont supply related to the sale of industrial and store management sites that took place in the period 
fairmont supply continues to operate service centers 
depreciation  depletion and amortization expense increased million  or  to million in the period compared to the million in the period 
the increase was primarily due to the august  acquisition of the remaining interest in pocahontas gas partnership and the remaining interest in the cardinal states gathering company 
in the period  these entities were reported as fully consolidated 
in the period  these entities were reported on the equity basis 
depreciation and amortization also increased due to more coal assets being placed in service in the period 
these increases were offset  in part  by lower financial depletion related to the reduced production levels in the period compared to the period 
interest expense increased million  or  to million in the period compared to million in the period 
this was due primarily to million of additional interest expense related to the march  issuance of million of notes due in the interest on the notes is payable march and september of each year commencing september  this increase was offset  in part  by a million reduction in interest expense related to commercial paper 
the reduction was due primarily to a million reduction in the average levels of commercial paper outstanding during the period compared to the period  along with a decrease of per annum in average interest rates in the period to period comparison 
interest expense was also reduced million due to the reduction of long term debt through scheduled payments 
taxes other than income increased million  or  to million in the period compared to million in the period 
the increase was due primarily to increased black lung excise taxes  real estate and personal property taxes and state reclamation fee taxes in the period compared to the period 
in the period  due to certain black lung excise taxes being declared unconstitutional  million of prior year accruals  which were not paid and were no longer owed  were reversed 
the increase in certain taxes was offset by million due to the reduction of million tons of production in the period compared to the period 
real estate and personal property taxes increased million in the period compared to the period 
this increase was due to million of additional taxes related to the properties owned by windsor coal company  southern ohio coal company  central ohio coal company  pocahontas gas partnership and cardinal states gathering company which were acquired in real estate and personal property taxes also increased million due to expanded permitting at our mining locations 
the remaining million increase in real estate and personal property taxes was related to several transactions throughout the and periods  none of which were individually material 
these increases in taxes other than income were offset  in part  by a million reduction in payroll taxes 
the reduction in payroll taxes is primarily due to reduced employee counts as a result of several mines being idled during the period 
taxes other than income also decreased million as a result of various transactions throughout the and periods  none of which were individually material 
consol energy is no longer required to pay certain excise taxes on export coal sales 
we have filed claims with the internal revenue service seeking refunds for these excise taxes that were determined to be unconstitutional and were paid during the period through during the period  we recognized million of pre tax earnings net of other charges and million of interest income related to these claims 
during the period  we recognized million of interest income related to these claims 
in the period  million has been collected on these claims 
a million receivable remains in other receivables at december  income taxes income taxes represent a million benefit in the period compared to million of expense in the period 
the decrease in tax expense was due mainly to a pre tax loss of million in the period compared to pre tax income of million in the period without a comparable reduction in percentage depletion tax benefits 
our effective tax rate is sensitive to changes in annual profitability and percentage depletion 
the effective rate was in the period compared to in the period 
although we suffered a loss for the year  the percentage depletion deduction allowed for tax purposes did not have a corresponding reduction 
historically  the annual depletion benefit has been approximately million 
the combination of this benefit and a pre tax loss resulted in our effective tax rate 
additional detail is provided in note of notes to consolidated financial statements included as item in part ii of this annual report on form k  as amended 
income taxes were also reduced due to adjusting the provision for income taxes at the time the returns are filed 
these adjustments decreased income tax expense by million in the period and increased income tax expense million for the period 
in the period  consol energy also received a million federal income tax benefit from a final agreement resolving disputed federal income tax items for the years to six months ended december  compared with six months ended december  unaudited net income consol energy s net income for the six months ended december  was million compared with million for the six months ended december  the decrease of million was primarily due to lower prices for natural gas caused by general market declines and higher cost per ton of produced coal mined caused principally by adverse mining conditions and mechanical problems 
the effects of lower prices for natural gas and higher coal production costs were offset  in part  by a reduction in income tax expense due to a pre tax loss in the transitional period along with changes in percentage depletion allowances and higher volumes of gas sold 
revenue sales decreased million  or to million for the six months ended december  from million for the six months ended december revenues from the sale of coalbed methane gas and gathering fees decreased million  or to million in the transitional period from million in the six month period 
this decrease was due mainly to a decrease in average sales price for the period 
average sales price for the transitional period was per million british thermal unit compared to per million british thermal unit for the six months ended december  the decrease in sales price was offset  in part  by higher volumes as a result of the august  acquisition of the remaining interest in pocahontas gas partnership 
sales volumes were billion cubic feet in the transitional period  an increase of billion cubic feet  or from the six month period 
revenues from the sale of industrial supplies decreased million  or  to million in the transitional period from million in the six month period 
the decrease was due primarily to the sale of the physical assets  inventory and operations associated with industrial and store management sites during the six month period 
the sale did not have a material impact on consol energy s financial position  results of operations or cash flow 
these decreased revenues were partially offset by increased revenues from the sale of company produced coal 
revenues from the sale of company produced coal increased million  or  to million in the transitional period from million in the six month period 
the increase in produced coal sales revenues was due mainly to an increase of  or  in the average sales price per ton sold 
the average sales price was in the transitional period compared to in the six month period 
the increase in average sales price was due primarily to demand increases and low inventory levels at coal producers 
the increase in average sales price was partially offset by a million ton  or  decrease in the volume of produced tons sold in the transitional period compared to the six month period 
produced coal sales volumes were million tons in the transitional period compared to million tons in the six month period 
the decreased sales volumes were due primarily to the decline in production as a result of the suspension of longwall production at mine early in july mine restarted longwall production in early december at production levels equal to full production levels in the months before production problems were encountered 
this start was approximately one month earlier than originally projected 
production shortages were encountered at several other consol energy mines due to mechanical and geological difficulties 
these production declines were offset by the production at several of the mines acquired from american electric power on july  revenues from the sale of purchased coal decreased million  or  to million in the transitional period from million in the six month period 
sales volumes decreased to million tons in the transitional period from million tons in the six month period 
the decreased volumes were partially offset by a increase in the price per ton of purchased coal sold 
the average sales price per ton of purchased coal was in the transitional period compared to in the six month period 
freight revenue  outside and related party  decreased million  or  to million in the transitional period from million in the six month period 
freight revenue is the amount billed to customers for transportation costs incurred 
other income  which consists of interest income  gain or loss on the disposition of assets  equity in earnings of affiliates  service income  royalty income  rental income and miscellaneous income  was million in the transitional period compared to million in the six month period 
the decrease of million  or  was primarily due to the reduction in equity in earnings of affiliates 
the reduction in equity in earnings of affiliates was primarily due to the august  purchase of the remaining interest in pocahontas gas partnership and the remaining interest in the cardinal states gathering company 
as a result of the acquisition  consol energy owns of these entities and began to account for them as fully consolidated subsidiaries 
before the acquisition  consol energy accounted for these companies using the equity method 
costs cost of goods sold and other operating charges increased million  or  to million in the transitional period from million in the six month period 
cost of goods sold for company produced coal increased million  or to million in the transitional period from million in the six month period 
the increase was primarily due to a increase in the cost per ton sold of company produced coal  offset slightly by a decrease in the volume of tons of company produced coal sold 
the increased cost per ton produced is primarily due to a decline in productivity as measured in tons produced per manday 
manday is a term used to describe the scheduled hours worked per person per day 
this term is sometimes used to determine productivity of our mining complexes 
tons produced per manday were in the transitional period compared to in the six month period 
the decline in productivity is mainly due to several mines experiencing mechanical and geological difficulties in the transitional period 
cost of goods sold for gas operations increased million  or  to million in the transitional period from million in the six month period 
the increase in gas costs was due primarily to higher volume of gas sold as a result of the acquisition of the remaining interest in pocahontas gas partnership on august  sales volumes were billion cubic feet in the transitional period compared to billion cubic feet in the six month period 
the cost per million british thermal units sold remained stable at in the transitional period compared to in the six month period 
cost of goods sold for purchased coal remained consistent at million in the transitional period compared to the six month period 
cost of goods sold for closed and idled mine costs increased million to million in the transitional period from million in the six month period 
the increase is due primarily to a million income adjustment for mine closing and perpetual care liabilities being recognized in the six month period 
the adjustment was the result of updated engineering studies and cost projections for closed and idled locations 
the increase was also due to additional costs related to the closing or idling of loveridge  meigs and mine in the transitional period compared to the six month period 
cost of goods sold for industrial supplies decreased million  or  to million in the transitional period from million in the six month period 
the decrease in costs is related to reduced sales volumes resulting from the sale of industrial and store management sites 
freight expense decreased million  or  to million in the transitional period from million in the six month period 
freight expense is billed to customers and the revenue from such billings equals the transportation expense 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million  or  to million in the transitional period from million in the six month period 
the decrease was due primarily to decreased professional consulting fees 
professional consulting fees were reduced due to the completion of the review of business processes and information technology systems supporting those processes that took place in the period 
depreciation  depletion and amortization expense remained stable at million for the transitional period and the six month period 
interest expense decreased by million  or  to million in the transitional period compared to million in the six month period 
the decrease was due primarily to lower average debt levels outstanding during the transitional period compared to the six month period  along with a decrease of per annum in average interest rates reflecting more favorable interest rates 
lower average debt levels resulted from the cash received in the acquisition of the windsor coal company  southern ohio coal company and central ohio coal company from american electric power being used to reduce the outstanding amount of commercial paper in july thereafter  we increased the outstanding amount of commercial paper by the issuance of approximately million of commercial paper beginning in august to finance the acquisition of the remaining interest in pocahontas gas partnership and the remaining interest in the cardinal states gathering company 
also  in december  approximately million of commercial paper was issued to finance the acquisition of a joint venture in glennies creek mine 
interest expense is expected to increase during as a result of the refinancing of short term debt with long term notes with the interest rate of per annum 
taxes other than income increased million  or  to million in the transitional period compared to million in the six month period 
the increase was due primarily to increased excise taxes  severance taxes and payroll taxes in the transitional period 
these costs increased primarily due to the acquisition of the windsor coal company  southern ohio coal company and central ohio coal company from american electric power 
consol energy is no longer required to pay certain excise taxes on export coal sales 
we have filed claims with the internal revenue service seeking refunds for these excise taxes that were determined to be unconstitutional and were paid during the period through during the transitional period  we recognized a million reduction to the expected interest receivable amount recognized in the twelve months ended june  due to the change in the estimate of recoverable amounts 
income taxes income taxes were a million benefit in the transitional period compared to million of expense in the six month period 
the decrease of million was due mainly to a pre tax loss of million in the transitional period with little loss of percentage depletion tax benefits 
our effective tax rate is sensitive to changes in annual profitability and percentage depletion 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and at the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting period 
note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
actual results could differ from those estimates upon subsequent resolution of identified matters 
management believes that the estimates utilized are reasonable 
the following critical accounting policies are materially impacted by judgments  assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
other post employment benefits consol energy has historically provided retiree health benefits to employees that retire with at least ten years of service and have attained age effective august   the eligibility requirement for salaried employees was changed to either twenty years of service and age  or fifteen years of service and age our retiree health plans provide benefits to approximately  of our former employees and their eligible dependents 
eligibility requirements for hourly employees have not changed from consol energy s historical requirements 
in addition to the change in eligibility requirements  other changes have been made to the medical plan which covers eligible salaried employees and retirees 
these changes include a new cost sharing structure where essentially all participants contribute of plan costs 
annual cost increases in excess of are paid entirely by the plan participants 
after our review  various actuarial assumptions  including discount rate  expected trend in health care costs and per capita costs  are used by our independent actuary to estimate the cost and benefit obligations for our retiree health plan 
the discount rate is determined each year at the measurement date normally three months before the year end date 
the discount rate is an estimate of the current interest rate at which the other post employment benefit liabilities could be effectively settled at the measurement date 
in estimating this rate  consol energy looks to rates of return on high quality  fixed income investments that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized ratings agency 
for the twelve months ended december   the discount rate used to calculate the period end liability and the following year s expense was 
the discount rate for the twelve months ended december  used to calculate the period end liability and the following year s expense was 
changes to interest rates for the rates of returns on instruments that could be used to settle the actuarially determined plan obligations introduce substantial volatility to our costs 
per capita costs on a per annum basis for other post retirement benefits were assumed to be  at december  this was an increase over the per capita cost on a per annum basis at december  if the actual increase in per capita cost of medical services or other post retirement benefits are significantly greater or less than the projected trend rates  the per capita cost assumption would need to be adjusted annually  which could have a significant effect on the costs and liabilities recognized in the financial statements 
the estimated liability recognized in the financial statements at december  was billion compared to billion at december  for the twelve months ended december   we paid approximately million for other post employment benefits  most of which were paid from operating cash flow 
significant increases in health and prescription drug costs for hourly retirees could have a material effect on consol energy s operating cash flow 
the effect on consol energy s cash flow from operations for salaried employees has been limited to approximately annually due to the cost sharing provision added to the benefit plan in on december   the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of the act was signed into law 
the act introduces a prescription drug benefit under medicare medicare part d as well as a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to medicare part d 
as permitted by recently issued accounting guidance  as of december   consol energy will defer accounting for the effects of the act in the measure of its accumulated postretirement benefit obligation apbo and the effect of the offset to plan costs 
specific guidance with respect to accounting for the effects of the act has not been issued 
specific authoritative guidance  when issued  could require consol energy to change previously reported information 
the impacts of the law change are currently being evaluated and are expected to result in a decrease of the apbo of million 
recognition of the subsidy as an offset to annual plan costs are preliminarily expected to be in the range of million 
coal workers pneumoconiosis consol energy is responsible under the federal coal mine health and safety act of  as amended  for medical and disability benefits to employees and their dependents resulting from occurrences of coal workers pneumoconiosis disease 
consol energy is also responsible under various state statutes for pneumoconiosis benefits 
after our review  our independent actuaries calculate the actuarial present value of the estimated pneumoconiosis obligation based on assumptions regarding disability incidence  medical costs  mortality  death benefits  dependents and discount rates 
the discount rate is determined each year at the measurement date normally three months before the year end date 
the discount rate is an estimate of the current interest rate at which the coal workers pneumoconiosis liabilities could be effectively settled at the measurement date 
in estimating this rate  consol energy looks to rates of return on high quality  fixed income investments that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized ratings agency 
for the twelve months ended december   the discount rate used to calculate the period end liability and the following year s expense was 
the discount rate for the twelve months ended december  used to calculate the period end liability and the following year s expense was 
in january  the united states department of labor amended the regulations implementing the federal black lung laws to give greater weight to the opinion of a claimant s treating physician  expand the definition of black lung disease and limit the amount of medical evidence that can be submitted by claimants and respondents 
the amendments also alter administrative procedures for the adjudication of claims  which according to the department of labor  results in streamlined procedures that are less formal  less adversarial and easier for participants to understand 
these and other changes to the federal black lung regulations could result in changes in assumptions used in our actuarial determination of the liability  including interest  disability and mortality assumptions 
our experience to date related to these changes is not sufficient to determine the impact of these changes 
these changes could significantly increase our exposure to black lung benefit liabilities 
the estimated liability recognized in the financial statements at december  was approximately million compared to million at december  at december   the fair value of plan assets for coal workers pneumoconiosis was million 
our historical policy has been to pay for these claims from operating cash flow  and not to fund specific amounts into restricted accounts 
in  a trust fund valued at approximately million was acquired as part of our acquisition of rochester pittsburgh coal company 
in  as part of a contract renegotiation  we acquired an additional million that was placed into the trust for coal workers pneumoconiosis 
as part of the acquisition of several mining companies from american electric power in  an additional million was placed into a trust fund for coal workers pneumoconiosis 
after internal revenue service approval  these funds have been used to pay all of consol energy s coal workers pneumoconiosis benefits 
this fund will be exhausted early in  at which time we plan to resume paying these benefits from operating cash flow 
for the twelve months ended december   we paid coal workers pneumoconiosis benefits of approximately million  of which approximately million was paid from operating cash flow 
salaried pensions consol energy has non contributory defined benefit retirement plans covering substantially all employees not covered by multi employer retirement plans 
the benefits for these plans are based primarily on years of service and employees compensation near retirement 
after our review  our independent actuaries calculate the actuarial present value of the estimated retirement obligation based on assumptions including rates of compensation  mortality rates  retirement age and interest rates 
for the year ended december   compensation increases are assumed to range from to depending on age classification 
this assumption was also used in the twelve months ended december  retirement rate assumptions and mortality assumptions were unchanged for the year ended december  retirement rate assumptions begin at for employees at age and increases gradually to for employees at age the discount rate is determined each year at the measurement date normally three months before the year end date 
the discount rate is an estimate of the current interest rate at which the retirement plans could be effectively settled at the measurement date 
in estimating this rate  consol energy looks to rates of return on high quality  fixed income investments that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized ratings agency 
for the twelve months ended december  the discount rate used to calculate the period end liability and the following year s expense was 
the discount rate for the twelve months ended december  used to calculate the period end liability and the following year s expense was 
changes to any of these assumptions introduce substantial volatility to our costs 
the estimated liability at december  was million compared to million at december  due to the negative actuarial return on plan assets  the difference in the accumulated benefit obligation and the plan assets at december  of approximately million was recognized as a minimum pension liability 
at december   the minimum pension liability was approximately million 
consol energy expects to contribute approximately million to the pension plan in the consol energy salaried plan allows for lump sum distributions at the employees election 
according to statement of financial accounting standard no 
 employers accounting for settlements and curtailments of defined benefit pension plans and for termination benefits  if the lump sum distributions made for the plan year  which is october to september  exceed the total of the service cost and interest cost for the plan year settlement accounting is required 
if this trigger event were to occur  consol energy would need to recognize in the current year s earnings an adjustment equaling the unrecognized actuarial gain or loss resulting from each individual who received a lump sum in that year 
generally  due to the lower interest rates currently being used to calculate lump sum distributions  the impact would be to recognize actuarial losses 
if this settlement accounting is triggered  the adjustment could materially impact net income 
workers compensation workers compensation is a system by which individuals who sustain employment related physical injuries or occupational diseases are compensated for their disabilities  medical costs  and on some occasions  for the costs of their rehabilitation 
workers compensation will also compensate the survivors of workers who suffer employment related deaths 
the workers compensation laws are administered by state agencies with each state having its own set of rules and regulations regarding compensation that is owed to an employee that is injured in the course of employment 
consol energy accrues for this type of liability by recognizing cost when the event occurs that gives rise to the obligation  ie  when it is probable that the liability has been incurred and the cost can be reasonably estimated 
to assist in the determination of this estimated liability consol energy utilizes the services of third party administrators in various states in which we do business to determine the liability that exists for workers compensation 
these third parties provide information that facilitates the estimation of the liability based on their knowledge and experience concerning similar past events 
the estimated liability recognized in the financial statements at december   including the current portion  was approximately million compared to million at december  consol energy s policy has been to provide for workers compensation benefits from operating cash flow 
no funding has been provided to cover these benefits 
for the twelve months ended december   we made payments for workers compensation benefits of approximately million  all of which was paid from operating cash flow 
consol energy changed its method of accounting for workers compensation effective january  prior to the change  the company recorded its workers compensation liability on an undiscounted basis 
under the new method  the company will record the liability on a discounted basis  which will be actuarially determined using various assumptions  including discount rate and future cost trends 
consol energy believes this change is preferable since it will align the accounting with the company s other long term employee benefit obligations  which are recorded on a discounted basis 
additionally  it will provide a better comparison with the company s industry peers  the majority of which record the workers compensation liability on a discounted basis 
the change will be reflected as a cumulative effect from a change in accounting in the quarter ended march  according to accounting principles board opinion abp no 
 accounting changes 
the effect of the change is expected to result in an income adjustment of approximately million  net of approximately million of deferred tax expense 
the workers compensation liability will decrease approximately million and deferred tax assets will be reduced by approximately million as a result of this accounting change 
reclamation and mine closure obligations the surface mining control and reclamation act establishes operational  reclamation and closure standards for all aspects of surface mining as well as most aspects of deep mining 
consol energy accrues for the costs of current mine disturbance and final mine closure  including the cost of treating mine water discharge where necessary 
estimates of our total reclamation and mine closing liabilities  which are based upon permit requirements and consol energy engineering expertise related to these requirements  including the current portion  were approximately million at december  this liability is reviewed annually by consol energy management and engineers 
the estimated liability can significantly change if actual costs vary from assumptions or if governmental regulations change significantly 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas no 
requires that the fair value of an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
the present value of the estimated asset retirement costs is capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset 
asset retirement obligations primarily relate to the closure of mines and gas wells and the reclamation of land upon exhaustion of coal and gas reserves 
changes in the variables used to calculate the liabilities can have a significant effect on the mine closing  reclamation and gas well closing liabilities 
the amounts of assets and liabilities recorded are dependent upon a number of variables  including the estimated future retirement costs  estimated proven reserves  assumptions involving profit margins  inflation rates  and the assumed credit adjusted risk free interest rate 
sfas no 
requires depreciation of the capitalized asset retirement cost and accretion of the asset retirement obligation over time 
the depreciation will generally be determined on a units of production basis  whereas the accretion to be recognized will escalate over the life of the producing assets  typically as production declines 
contingencies consol energy is currently involved in certain legal proceedings 
we have accrued our estimate of the probable costs for the resolution of these claims 
this estimate has been developed in consultation with legal counsel involved in the defense of these matters and is based upon an analysis of potential results  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
we do not believe these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position 
it is possible  however  that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to these proceedings 
deferred taxes consol energy accounts for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 
which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax basis of recorded assets and liabilities 
sfas no 
also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
at december   consol energy has deferred tax assets in excess of deferred tax liabilities of approximately million 
the deferred tax assets are evaluated periodically to determine if a valuation allowance is necessary 
state net operating loss carry forwards of million have been fully reserved due to the uncertainty of realizing the benefits of these carry forwards 
however  consol energy is currently exploring several tax planning strategies that may allow a portion or all of the benefit to be recognized 
no other valuation allowance has been recognized because consol energy has determined that it is more likely than not that all of these deferred tax assets will be realized 
significant management judgment is required in determining the need  if any  for a valuation allowance to be recorded against the deferred tax assets 
consol energy s need for a valuation allowance is based on both positive and negative evidence regarding its ability to generate sufficient future regular taxable income to realize its deferred tax assets 
for the year ended december   our principal evaluation focused on if  and when  consol energy would return to being a regular versus an alternative minimum taxpayer 
positive evidence included the level of sales and pricing currently being negotiated under fixed price contracts  the projected reversal of certain temporary book to tax differences  particularly minimum tax preference items and the ability to employ various tax planning strategies if required 
negative evidence included the book and tax losses generated in recent periods and the inability to achieve forecasted results in the recent periods 
consol energy concluded that the deferred tax assets  other than the state net operating losses generated  were more likely than not realizable 
through its evaluation  consol energy forecasts to begin paying regular tax and utilizing the alternative minimum deferred tax asset within five years 
our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions  our ability to successfully execute our business strategy and other factors 
these changes  if any  may require possible valuation allowances to be recognized 
these allowances could materially impact net income in the period they were to be recognized 
coal and gas reserve values there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities and values of economically recoverable coal and gas reserves  including many factors beyond our control 
as a result  estimates of economically recoverable coal and gas reserves are by their nature uncertain 
information about our reserves consists of estimates based on engineering  economic and geological data assembled and analyzed by our staff 
the majority of our gas reserves have been reviewed by independent experts  ralph e 
davis associates  inc and data and consulting services  a division of schlumberger 
none of our coal reserves have been reviewed by independent experts 
some of the factors and assumptions which impact economically recoverable reserve estimates include geological conditions  historical production from the area compared with production from other producing areas  the assumed effects of regulations and taxes by governmental agencies  assumptions governing future prices  and future operating costs 
each of these factors may in fact vary considerably from the assumptions used in estimating reserves 
for these reasons  estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of coal and gas attributable to a particular group of properties  and classifications of these reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of future net cash flows  may vary substantially 
actual production  revenues and expenditures with respect to our reserves will likely vary from estimates  and these variances may be material 
certain trends and uncertainties in addition to the trends and uncertainties described in item i of this annual report on form k under coal operations competition  gas operations competition and regulations and in critical accounting policies and elsewhere in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation  consol energy is subject to the trends and uncertainties set forth below 
consol energy has a significant amount of debt compared to its stockholders equity  which limits its flexibility  imposes restrictions on the company and could hinder the company s ability to compete and meet future capital and liquidity needs 
at december   consol energy had outstanding approximately million in aggregate principal amount of indebtedness  including capital leases  and total stockholders equity of million 
consol energy has become leveraged as a result of its policy of paying dividends 
since  the company has paid dividends aggregating billion  approximately the amount of its aggregate net income for the same period 
the degree to which consol energy is leveraged could have important consequences to the company  including the following a portion of the company s cash flow must be used to pay interest on its indebtedness and therefore is not available for use in the company s business  the company s indebtedness increases its vulnerability to changes in general economic and industry conditions  the company s ability to obtain additional financing for working capital  capital expenditures  general corporate purposes or other purposes could be impaired  because some of the company s borrowings are short term or at variable rates of interest  it is vulnerable to interest rate fluctuations  which could result in it incurring higher interest expenses if interest rates increase  and the company s failure to comply with covenants and restrictions contained in the terms of its borrowings could lead to a default which could cause all or a significant portion of its debt to become immediately payable 
stockholders equity was reduced by comprehensive losses of approximately million in  million in and million in these losses relate primarily to the recognition of a minimum pension liability as a result of the negative return on plan assets for non contributory defined benefit retirement plans covering substantially all employees not covered by multi employer retirement plans 
consol energy s minimum pension liability generally is calculated annually and reflects a number of factors including conditions in the stock markets and interest rates 
the company cannot predict whether it will be required to recognize such losses in the future 
further comprehensive losses would reduce the company s stockholders equity and possibly preclude the company paying dividends  which likely would adversely affect the company s stock price 
for these and other reasons  consol energy may not pay dividends at the same levels as in recent periods or at all 
the sec has informed consol energy that it is conducting an inquiry regarding certain matters  which may include allegations contained in an anonymous letter that certain directors and senior executive officers have misappropriated corporate funds and other assets and engaged in other illegal or inappropriate activities 
consol energy received a copy of an anonymous letter addressed to the sec and delivered to its independent auditors  pricewaterhousecoopers llp 
the letter  and other anonymous letters received subsequently  contain numerous allegations including assertions that certain directors and senior executive officers have misappropriated corporate funds and other assets and engaged in other illegal or inappropriate activities 
consol energy has been informed that the sec commenced an informal  non public inquiry in october regarding certain matters  which may be related to the anonymous letter 
if the sec determined to bring action against consol energy  it could have a material adverse effect upon consol energy  its financial statements and the value of consol energy s common stock 
consol energy reported losses in recent periods and consol energy may incur losses in future periods 
consol energy reported a net loss of million in the twelve months ended december  although consol energy reported net income for each of the twelve months ended december   the six months ended december  and the twelve months ended june   net income was attributable to income tax benefits in the periods ended december  and and benefited substantially from an export sales excise tax resolution in the twelve months ended june  for the twelve months ended december  and and the six months ended december   consol incurred losses before income tax benefits of million  million and million  respectively 
the company s results reflect a number of factors in each period 
for example  a decrease in tons of coal produced and tons of coal sold as a result of higher than usual customer inventory levels  decreased average sales price for gas in the industrial sector and lower demand for gas during the winter heating season resulted in high levels of gas storage 
during the fourth quarter of  results were adversely affected by production problems at a number of mines 
these and other conditions  including conditions beyond the company s control  could continue to affect its business  and the company may incur losses in the future 
if consol energy determines that some or all of its deferred tax assets will not be realized then it will need to reduce its deferred tax assets which could materially reduce the company s operating results and stockholders equity and possibly preclude dividend payments 
consol energy accounts for its income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax basis of recorded assets and liabilities 
statement of financial accounting standard no 
also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
at december   consol energy had deferred tax assets in excess of deferred tax liabilities of approximately million 
the deferred tax assets are evaluated periodically to determine if a valuation allowance is necessary 
realization of consol energy s deferred tax assets is principally dependent upon its achievement of projected future coal and non coal mining regular taxable income 
consol energy s judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions  its ability to continue to successfully execute its business strategy and other factors 
these changes  if any  may require possible valuation allowances to be recognized 
these allowances could materially reduce consol energy s operating results and stockholders equity and possibly preclude dividend payments  which likely would adversely affect the price of consol energy common stock 
consol energy may need substantial additional financing in order for it to fund its operations  capital expenditures and to meet other obligations 
consol energy has announced that it will incur approximately million to million for capital expenditures during for maintenance of production and expansion projects 
consol energy  along with other participants in the coal industry  has been informed by insurance companies that they no longer will provide surety bonds for workers compensation and other post employment benefits without collateral 
as a result  consol energy has satisfied these obligations by providing letters of credit or other assurances of payment 
however  the issuance of letters of credit under the company s bank credit facilities reduces amounts that it can borrow under its bank credit facilities for other purposes  including to fund operations and capital expenditures 
cash generated by operations may not be sufficient to fund the company s currently planned capital expenditures and to provide the collateral necessary to meet workers compensation and other post employment benefits performance obligations 
for these and other reasons  consol energy may need substantial additional financing 
consol energy cannot be certain that it will be able to raise additional financing  as required  or that any financing  if available  will be on terms acceptable to the company 
debt financing would increase the company s interest expense  reducing operating results  and could include covenants that are more restrictive than those in its current financings  including limitations on the payment of dividends and on the incurrence of additional debt 
the issuance of additional equity could be dilutive to consol energy s existing stockholders 
if consol energy cannot obtain financing  it could reduce capital expenditures  particularly for expansion projects 
such a reduction in spending for these projects  however  could adversely affect future performance 
consol energy may be unable to comply with restrictions imposed by its senior credit facility which could result in a default under these agreements 
consol energy s senior credit facility imposes a number of restrictions on the company 
a failure to comply with these restrictions could adversely affect consol energy s ability to borrow under its senior credit facility or result in an event of default under these agreements and its other debt 
the company s senior credit facility contains financial and other covenants that create limitations on its ability to  among other things  borrow the full amount under its senior credit facility or incur additional debt  and requires consol energy to maintain various financial ratios and comply with various other financial covenants 
these financial covenants include a funded debt ratio that requires that consol energy maintain a ratio of total indebtedness for borrowed money as of the last day of each quarter to total earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  excluding any extraordinary gains or losses for the four quarters ended on that date of not more than to and a ratio for the last four consecutive quarters of total earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization and excluding any extraordinary gains or losses  to total interest payable including amortization of debt discount on indebtedness for borrowed money of not less than to a covenant also limits capital expenditures to million for the fiscal year ending december  and million for the fiscal year ending december  consol energy s ability to comply with these restrictions depends upon its operating results  which recently have deteriorated from earlier periods  and it may be unable to comply with these covenants and other restrictions in its senior credit facility 
in the event of a default  consol energy s lenders could terminate their commitments to the company and declare all amounts borrowed  together with accrued interest and fees  immediately due and payable 
if this were to occur  the company might not be able to pay these amounts or the company might be forced to seek an amendment to its debt agreements which could make the terms of these agreements more onerous for the company 
failure to comply with these restrictions  even if waived by the company s bank lenders  also could adversely affect the company s credit ratings  which could increase the costs of debt financings to the company and impair its ability to obtain additional debt financing 
consol energy s credit ratings have recently been downgraded to a sub investment grade rating  which could adversely affect its costs and expenses 
in december  standard and poor s classed consol energy s long term debt as bb th lowest out of rating categories 
the rating indicates that an obligor faces major ongoing uncertainties or exposure to adverse business  financial  or economic conditions  which could lead to the obligor s inadequate capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation 
the negative sign shows relative standing within the rating category 
at the same time  standard and poor s placed consol energy s senior unsecured debt rating on credit watch with negative implications 
in december  moody s investor service classed consol energy s long term debt as ba th lowest out of rating categories 
the rating remains under review for possible further downgrade 
bonds that are rated ba are considered to have speculative elements  their future cannot be considered as well assured 
the protection of interest and principal payments on debt rated ba is considered moderate  and thereby not well safeguarded during both good and bad times 
uncertainty of ability to repay characterizes bonds in this class 
the modifier indicates that the obligation ranks in the lower end of its generic rating category 
the downgrading of consol energy s credit ratings could adversely affect consol energy s ability to borrow and result in more restrictive borrowing terms  including increased borrowing costs  more restrictive covenants and the extension of less open credit 
this in turn could affect the company s operational flexibility 
consol energy may not be able to maintain its competitive position because coal and gas markets are highly competitive and are affected by factors beyond consol energy s control 
consol energy competes with coal producers in various regions of the united states for domestic sales  and it competes both with domestic and foreign coal producers for sales in international markets 
demand for the company s coal by its principal customers is affected by the price of competing coal and alternative fuel supplies  including nuclear  natural gas  oil and renewable energy sources  such as hydroelectric power 
consol energy sells coal to foreign electricity generators and to the more specialized metallurgical coal market  both of which are significantly affected by international demand and competition 
a significant decline in the prices consol energy receives for its coal and gas could adversely affect the company s operating results and cash flows 
consol energy s results of operations are highly dependent upon the prices it receives for its coal and gas  which are closely linked to consumption patterns of the electric generation industry and certain industrial and residential patterns where gas is the principal fuel 
extended or substantial price declines for coal or gas would adversely affect the company s operating results for future periods and the company s ability to generate cash flows necessary to improve productivity and expand operations 
for example  in  and  demand for coal decreased because of the warm winters in the northeastern united states 
this resulted in increased inventories that caused pricing decreases 
natural gas prices have been volatile 
consol energy may not be able to produce sufficient amounts of coal to fulfill its customers requirements  which could harm the company s customer relationships 
consol energy may not be able to produce sufficient amounts of coal to meet customer demand  including amounts that the company is required to deliver under long term contracts 
consol energy s inability to satisfy its contractual obligations could result in its customers initiating claims against the company 
the company s inability to satisfy demand could otherwise harm its relationships with its customers 
if the coal or gas industry experiences overcapacity in the future  consol energy s profitability could be impaired 
during the mid s and early s  a growing coal market and increased demand for coal attracted new investors to the coal industry  spurred the development of new mines and resulted in added production capacity throughout the industry  all of which led to increased competition and lower coal prices 
increases in coal prices similarly could encourage the development of expanded capacity by new or existing coal producers 
any overcapacity could reduce coal prices in the future 
increased prices for gas typically stimulate additional exploration and often result in additional supplies brought to market 
increased gas supply could reduce gas prices in the future 
if customers do not extend existing contracts or enter into new long term contracts for coal  the stability and profitability of consol energy s operations could be affected 
during the twelve months ended december   approximately of the coal consol energy produced was sold under contracts with terms of one year or more 
if a substantial portion of consol energy s long term contracts are modified or terminated  the company would be adversely affected if the company is unable to replace them or if its new contracts were not at the same level of profitability 
the profitability of the company s long term coal supply contracts depends on a variety of factors  which vary from contract to contract and fluctuate during the contract term  and includes the company s production costs and other factors 
price changes  if any  provided in long term supply contracts are not intended to reflect the company s cost increases  and therefore increases in its costs may reduce the company s profit margins 
in addition  in periods of declining market prices  provisions for adjustment or renegotiation of prices and other provisions may increase the company s exposure to short term coal price volatility 
as a result  consol energy may not be able to obtain long term agreements at favorable prices compared to either market conditions  as they may change from time to time  or the company s cost structure and long term contracts may not contribute to the company s profitability 
consol energy depends on two customers for a significant portion of its revenues and the loss of either one of these customers could adversely affect the company 
during the twelve months ended december   two customers accounted for approximately of consol energy s total revenue and one customer  allegheny energy  alone accounted for approximately of its total revenue 
the company s business and operating results could be adversely affected if either one of these customers does not continue to purchase the same amount of coal or gas as it has purchased from the company in the past or on terms  including pricing  it has under existing agreements 
some of consol energy s long term contracts require it to supply all of its customers coal needs 
if these customers coal requirements decline  the company s operating results may be adversely affected 
consol energy has requirements contracts with certain customers which require it to supply all of those customers coal needs but allow the customers to defer or vary the amount of coal that they accept 
for example  during  the reduction in the amount required by certain of these customers contributed to the reduction in the company s earnings when the company could not find alternative customers at the same price and volume levels 
if these or other customers with requirements contracts need less coal in the future  it could adversely affect the company s operating results 
the creditworthiness of consol energy s customer base has declined 
consol energy s ability to receive payment for coal or gas sold depends on the creditworthiness of its customers 
in general  the creditworthiness of the company s customers has declined 
if this trend were to continue  the number of customers with acceptable credit profiles could decline 
the bankruptcy of a customer could result in a loss of revenue for coal or gas already shipped  or in adverse changes to consol energy s sales contracts being imposed by the courts 
consol energy may not be able to accomplish acquisitions effectively  which requires it to outbid competitors  obtain financing on acceptable terms and integrate acquired operations 
the energy industry is a rapidly consolidating industry  with many companies seeking to consummate acquisitions and increase their market share 
in this environment  consol energy competes and will continue to compete with many other buyers for acquisitions 
some of those competitors may be able to outbid the company for acquisitions because they have greater financial resources 
as a result of these and other factors  future acquisitions may not be available to the company on attractive terms 
consol energy s ability to consummate any acquisition will be subject to various conditions  including the negotiation of satisfactory agreements and obtaining necessary regulatory approvals and financing 
once any acquisition is completed  the company may not be able to achieve expected operating benefits through cost reductions  increased efficiency and integration with the company s existing operations 
as a result  the company s operating results may be adversely affected 
disputes with consol energy s customers concerning contracts can result in litigation  which could result in it paying substantial damages or incurring loss of revenues 
from time to time  consol energy has disputes with company customers over the provisions of long term contracts relating to  among other things  coal quality  pricing and quantity 
the company may not be able to resolve any future disputes in a satisfactory manner  which could result in the company paying substantial damages or suffering reduced revenues 
coal mining is subject to conditions or events beyond consol energy s control  which could cause its quarterly or annual results to deteriorate 
consol energy s coal mining operations are predominantly underground mines 
these mines are subject to conditions or events beyond consol energy s control that could disrupt operations  affect production and the cost of mining at particular mines for varying lengths of time and have a significant impact on the company s operating results 
these conditions or events have included variations in thickness of the layer  or seam  of coal  amounts of rock and other natural materials intruding into the coal seam and other geological conditions  equipment failures or repair  fires and other accidents  and weather conditions 
consol energy faces numerous uncertainties in estimating its economically recoverable coal reserves  and inaccuracies in the company s estimates could result in lower than expected revenues  higher than expected costs and decreased profitability 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities and values of economically recoverable coal reserves  including many factors beyond the company s control 
as a result  estimates of economically recoverable coal reserves are by their nature uncertain 
information about the company s reserves consists of estimates based on engineering  economic and geological data assembled and analyzed by the company s staff 
none of the company s coal reserve estimates has been reviewed by independent experts 
some of the factors and assumptions which impact economically recoverable reserve estimates include geological conditions  historical production from the area compared with production from other producing areas  the assumed effects of regulations and taxes by governmental agencies  assumptions governing future prices  and future operating costs 
each of these factors may in fact vary considerably from the assumptions used in estimating reserves 
for these reasons  estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of coal attributable to a particular group of properties  and classifications of these reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of future net cash flows  may vary substantially 
actual production  revenues and expenditures with respect to the company s reserves will likely vary from estimates  and these variances may be material 
as a result  the company s estimates may not accurately reflect its actual reserves 
the exploration for  and production of  gas is an uncertain process with many risks 
the exploration for and production of gas involves numerous risks 
the cost of drilling  completing and operating wells for coalbed methane or other gas is often uncertain  and a number of factors can delay or prevent drilling operations or production  including unexpected drilling conditions  pressure or irregularities in formations  equipment failures or repairs  fires or other accidents  adverse weather conditions  pipeline ruptures or spills  and shortages or delays in the availability of drilling rigs and the delivery of equipment 
consol energy s future drilling activities may not be successful  and the company cannot be sure that its drilling success rates will not decline 
unsuccessful drilling activities could result in higher costs without any corresponding revenues 
also  consol energy may not be able to obtain any options or lease rights in potential drilling locations that it identifies which  among other things  could prevent it from producing gas at potential drilling locations 
the coal beds from which consol energy produces methane gas frequently contain water which may hamper the company s ability to produce gas in commercial quantities 
the amount of coalbed methane that can be commercially produced depends upon the coal quality  the original gas content of the coal seam  the thickness of the seam  the reservoir pressure  the rate at which gas is released from the coal  and the existence of any natural fractures through which the gas can flow to the well bore 
however  coal beds frequently contain water that must be removed in order for the gas to detach from the coal and flow to the well bore 
the company s ability to remove and dispose of sufficient quantities of water from the coal seam will determine whether or not it can produce gas in commercial quantities 
disruption of rail  barge and other systems which deliver consol energy s coal  or of pipeline systems which deliver consol energy s gas  or an increase in transportation costs could make the company s coal or gas less competitive 
coal producers depend upon rail  barge  trucking  overland conveyor and other systems to provide access to markets 
disruption of transportation services because of weather related problems  strikes  lock outs or other events could temporarily impair the company s ability to supply coal to customers and adversely affect its profitability 
transportation costs represent a significant portion of the delivered cost of coal and  as a result  the cost of delivery is a critical factor in a customer s purchasing decision 
increases in transportation costs could make the company s coal less competitive 
the marketability of the company s gas production partly depends on the availability  proximity and capacity of pipeline systems owned by third parties 
unexpected changes in access to pipelines could adversely affect the company s operations 
government laws  regulations and other legal requirements relating to protection of the environment and health and safety matters increase consol energy s costs of doing business and may restrict its operations 
consol energy is subject to laws  regulations and other legal requirements enacted or adopted by federal  state and local  as well as foreign  authorities relating to protection of the environment and health and safety matters  including those legal requirements that govern discharges of substances into the air and water  the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes  the cleanup of contaminated sites  groundwater quality and availability  plant and wildlife protection  reclamation and restoration of mining properties after mining is completed and control of surface subsidence from underground mining 
complying with these requirements  including the terms of the company s permits  has had  and will continue to have  a significant effect on its costs of operations and competitive position 
in addition  consol energy could incur substantial costs  including clean up costs  fines and civil or criminal sanctions and third party damage claims for personal injury  property damage  wrongful death  or exposure to hazardous substances  as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental laws 
for example  consol energy incurs and will continue to incur significant costs associated with the investigation and remediation of environmental contamination under the federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act superfund and similar state statutes and has been named as a potentially responsible party at superfund sites in the past 
the company s costs for these matters  which currently relate predominantly to one site  could exceed the company s current accruals  which were million at december  to date  consol energy has spent million for remediation of this waste disposal site and related expenses 
the discovery of additional contaminants or the imposition of additional clean up obligations or other liabilities could result in substantially greater costs than the company has estimated 
consol energy must obtain governmental permits and approvals for mining operations  which can be a costly and time consuming process and result in restrictions on its operations 
regulatory authorities exercise considerable discretion in the timing and scope of permit issuance 
requirements imposed by these authorities may be costly and time consuming and may result in delays in the commencement or continuation of exploration or production operations 
for example  consol energy often is required to prepare and present to federal  state and local authorities data pertaining to the effect or impact that proposed exploration for or production of coal may have on the environment 
further  the public may comment on and otherwise engage in the permitting process  including through intervention in the courts 
accordingly  the permits consol energy needs may not be issued  or if issued  may not be issued in a timely fashion  or may involve requirements which restrict the company s ability to conduct its mining operations or to do so profitably 
the characteristics of coal may make it difficult for coal users to comply with various environmental standards related to coal combustion 
as a result  they may switch to other fuels  which would affect the volume of consol energy s sales 
coal contains impurities  including sulfur  mercury  chlorine and other elements or compounds  many of which are released into the air when coal is burned 
stricter environmental regulations of emissions from coal fired electric generating plants could increase the costs of using coal thereby reducing demand for coal as a fuel source  the volume of our coal sales and price 
stricter regulations could make coal a less attractive fuel alternative in the planning and building of utility power plants in the future 
for example  in order to meet the federal clean air act limits for sulfur dioxide emissions from electric power plants  coal users may need to install scrubbers  use sulfur dioxide emission allowances some of which they may purchase  blend high sulfur coal with low sulfur coal or switch to other fuels 
each option has limitations 
lower sulfur coal may be more costly to purchase on an energy basis than higher sulfur coal depending on mining and transportation costs 
the cost of installing scrubbers is significant and emission allowances may become more expensive as their availability declines 
switching to other fuels may require expensive modification of existing plants 
because higher sulfur coal currently accounts for a significant portion of consol energy s sales  the extent to which power generators switch to low sulfur fuel could materially affect the company if it cannot offset the cost of sulfur removal by lowering the delivered costs of the company s higher sulfur coals on an energy equivalent basis 
other new and proposed reductions in emissions of mercury  sulfur dioxides  nitrogen oxides  particulate matter or greenhouse gases may require the installation of additional costly control technology or the implementation of other measures  including trading of emission allowances and switching to other fuels 
for example  the environmental protection agency recently proposed separate regulations to establish mercury emission limits nationwide and to reduce the interstate transport of fine particulate matter and ozone through reductions in sulfur dioxides and nitrogen oxides through the eastern united states 
the environmental protection agency continues to require reduction of nitrogen oxide emissions in eastern states and the district of columbia and will require reduction of particulate matter emissions over the next several years for areas that do not meet air quality standards for fine particulates 
in addition  congress and several states are now considering legislation to further control air emissions of multiple pollutants from electric generating facilities and other large emitters 
these new and proposed reductions will make it more costly to operate coal fired plants and could make coal a less attractive fuel alternative to the planning and building of utility power plants in the future 
to the extent that any new or proposed requirements affect the company s customers  this could adversely affect its operations and results 
consol energy has significant reclamation and mine closure obligations 
if the assumptions underlying our accruals are materially inaccurate  we could be required to expend greater amounts than anticipated 
the surface mining control and reclamation act establishes operational  reclamation and closure standards for all aspects of surface mining as well as most aspects of deep mining 
consol energy accrues for the costs of current mine disturbance and of final mine closure  including the cost of treating mine water discharge where necessary 
estimates of the company s total reclamation and mine closing liabilities  which are based upon permit requirements and the company s experience  were million at december  on january   consol energy adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas to account for the costs related to the closure of mines and gas wells and the reclamation of the land upon exhaustion of coal and gas reserves 
this statement requires the fair value of an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
the present value of the estimated asset retirement costs is capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset 
as a result of this change in accounting principle  the company recognized a gain of million  net of a tax cost of million 
at the time of adoption  total assets  net of accumulated depreciation  increased approximately million  and total liabilities increased approximately million 
these amounts recorded upon adoption are dependent upon a number of variables  including the estimated future retirement costs  estimated proven reserves  assumptions involving profit margins  inflation rates  and the assumed credit adjusted risk free interest rates 
furthermore  these obligations are unfunded 
if these accruals are insufficient or the company s liability in a particular year is greater than currently anticipated  the company s future operating results could be adversely affected 
federal  state and local authorities extensively regulate consol energy s gas production activities 
the gas industry is subject to extensive legislation and regulation  which is under constant review for amendment or expansion 
any changes may affect  among other things  the pricing or marketing of gas production 
state and local authorities regulate various aspects of gas drilling and production activities  including the drilling of wells through permit and bonding requirements  the spacing of wells  the unitization or pooling of gas properties  environmental matters  safety standards  market sharing and well site restoration 
if consol energy fails to comply with statutes and regulations  it may be subject to substantial penalties  which would decrease its profitability 
deregulation of the electric utility industry could have unanticipated effects on consol energy s industry 
deregulation of the electric utility industry will enable purchasers of electricity to shop for the lowest cost suppliers 
if consol energy s electric power generator customers become more sensitive to long term price or quantity commitments in a more competitive environment  it may be more difficult for the company to enter into long term contracts and could subject the company s revenue stream to increased volatility which may adversely affect the company s profitability 
deregulation of the power industry may have other consequences for the company s industry  such as efforts to reduce coal prices  which may have a negative effect on the company s operating results 
the passage of legislation responsive to the framework convention on global climate change or similar governmental initiatives could result in restrictions on coal use 
the united states and more than other nations are signatories to the framework convention on global climate change which is intended to limit or capture emissions of greenhouse gases  such as carbon dioxide 
in december  in kyoto  japan  the signatories to the convention established a binding set of emissions targets for developed nations 
although the specific emissions targets vary from country to country  the united states would be required to reduce emissions to of levels over a five year budget period from through if the kyoto protocol or other comprehensive legislation focusing on greenhouse gas emissions is enacted by the united states  it could have the effect of restricting the use of coal 
other efforts to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and federal initiatives to encourage the use of natural gas also may affect the use of coal as an energy source 
consol energy is subject to the federal clean water act and similar state laws which impose treatment  monitoring and reporting obligations 
the federal clean water act and corresponding state laws affect coal mining operations by imposing restrictions on discharges into regulated waters 
permits requiring regular monitoring and compliance with effluent limitations and reporting requirements govern the discharge of pollutants into regulated waters 
new requirements under the clean water act and corresponding state laws could cause the company to incur significant additional costs that adversely affect the company s operating results 
consol energy has significant obligations for long term employee benefits for which it accrues based upon assumptions which  if inaccurate  could result in the company being required to expend greater amounts than anticipated 
consol energy provides various long term employee benefits to inactive and retired employees 
the company accrues amounts for these obligations 
at december   the current and non current portions of these obligations included post retirement medical and life insurance billion  coal workers black lung benefits million  and workers compensation million 
however  if the company s assumptions are inaccurate  it could be required to expend greater amounts than anticipated 
these obligations are unfunded  except for coal workers black lung benefits  of which approximately was funded at december  in addition  several states in which the company operates consider changes in workers compensation laws from time to time 
such changes  if enacted  could increase the company s benefit expense 
if lump sum payments made to retiring salaried employees pursuant to consol energy s defined benefit pension plan exceed the total of the service cost and the interest cost in a plan year  consol energy would need to make an adjustment to operating results equaling the unrecognized actuarial gain or loss resulting from each individual who received a lump sum payment in that year  which may result in an adjustment that could materially reduce operating results 
consol energy s defined benefit pension plan for salaried employees allows such employees to receive a lump sum distribution in lieu of annual payments when they retire from consol energy 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for settlements and curtailments of defined benefit pension plans for the terminations benefits  requires that if the lump sum distributions made for a plan year  which for consol energy is october to september  exceed the total of the service cost and interest cost for the plan year  consol energy would need to recognize for that year s results of operations an adjustment equaling the unrecognized actuarial gain or loss resulting from each individual who received a lump sum in that year 
if lump sum payments exceed the total of the service cost and the interest cost  the adjustment could materially reduce operating results 
new regulations have expanded the definition of black lung disease and generally made it easier for claimants to assert and prosecute claims  which could increase consol energy s exposure to black lung benefit liabilities 
in january  the united states department of labor amended the regulations implementing the federal black lung laws to give greater weight to the opinion of a claimant s treating physician  expand the definition of black lung disease and limit the amount of medical evidence that can be submitted by claimants and respondents 
the amendments also alter administrative procedures for the adjudication of claims  which  according to the department of labor  results in streamlined procedures that are less formal  less adversarial and easier for participants to understand 
these and other changes to the federal black lung regulations could significantly increase consol energy s exposure to black lung benefits liabilities 
in recent years  legislation on black lung reform has been introduced but not enacted in congress 
it is possible that this legislation will be reintroduced for consideration by congress 
if any of the proposals included in this or similar legislation are passed  the number of claimants who are awarded benefits could significantly increase 
any such changes in black lung legislation  if approved  may adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
fairmont supply company  a subsidiary of consol energy  is a co defendant in various asbestos litigation cases which could result in making payments in the future that are material 
one of consol energy s subsidiaries  fairmont supply company  which distributes industrial supplies  currently is named as a defendant in approximately  asbestos claims in state courts in pennsylvania  ohio  west virginia  maryland  new jersey and mississippi 
because a very small percentage of products manufactured by third parties and supplied by fairmont in the past may have contained asbestos and many of the pending claims are part of mass complaints filed by hundreds of plaintiffs against a hundred or more defendants  it has been difficult for fairmont to determine how many of the cases actually involve valid claims or plaintiffs who were actually exposed to asbestos containing products supplied by fairmont 
in addition  while fairmont may be entitled to indemnity or contribution in certain jurisdictions from manufacturers of identified products  the availability of such indemnity or contribution is unclear at this time and  in recent years  some of the manufacturers named as defendants in these actions have sought protection from these claims under bankruptcy laws 
fairmont has no insurance coverage with respect to these asbestos cases 
to date  payments by fairmont with respect to asbestos cases have not been material 
however  payments in the future with respect to pending or future asbestos cases could be material to the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows of consol energy 
consol energy has been informed by insurance companies that  unless provided with collateral  they no longer will issue surety bonds that it and other coal mining companies are required by law to obtain 
various federal or state laws and regulations require consol energy to obtain surety bonds or to provide other assurance of payment for certain of the company s long term liabilities including mine closure or reclamation costs  workers compensation and other post employment benefits 
consol energy  along with other participants in the coal industry  has been informed by insurance companies that they no longer will provide surety bonds for workers compensation and other post employment benefits without collateral 
the company has satisfied its obligations under these statutes and regulations by providing letters of credit or other assurances of payment 
however  letters of credit can be significantly more costly to the company than surety bonds 
the issuance of letters of credit under the company s bank credit facilities also reduces amounts that it can borrow under its bank credit facilities for other purposes 
consol energy and certain of its officers are defendants in one or more purported class action lawsuits alleging the defendants issued false and misleading statements to the public that could result in consol energy making substantial payments 
on october   a complaint was filed in the united states district court for the western district of pennsylvania on behalf of seth moorhead against consol energy  j 
brett harvey and william j 
lyons 
the complaint alleges  among other things  that the defendants violated sections b and a of the exchange act and rule b promulgated under the exchange act and that during the period between january  and july  the defendants issued false and misleading statements to the public that failed to disclose or misrepresented the following  among other things a that consol energy utilized an aggressive approach regarding its spot market sales by reserving of its production to that market  and that by increasing its exposure to the spot market  consol energy was subjecting itself to increased risk and uncertainty as the price and demand for coal could be volatile  b that consol energy was experiencing difficulty selling the production that it had allocated to the spot market  and  nonetheless  consol energy maintained its production levels which caused its coal inventory to increase  c that consol energy s increasing coal inventory was causing its expenses to rise dramatically  thereby weakening the company s financial condition  and d that based on the foregoing  defendants positive statements regarding consol energy s earnings and prospects were lacking in a reasonable basis at all times and therefore were materially false and misleading 
the complaint asks the court to award unspecified damages to plaintiff and award plaintiff reasonable costs and expenses incurred in connection with this action  including counsel fees and expert fees 
two other class action complaints have purportedly been filed in the united states district court for the western district of pennsylvania against consol energy and certain officers and directors 
consol energy has not yet been served with either purported complaint 
if consol energy is not successful in defending one or more of these lawsuits it may have to make substantial payments to the plaintiffs 
consol energy s rights plan may have anti takeover effects that could prevent a change of control 
on december   consol energy adopted a rights plan which  in certain circumstances  including a person or group acquiring  or the commencement of a tender or exchange offer that would result in a person or group acquiring  beneficial ownership of more than of the outstanding shares of consol energy common stock  would entitle each right holder to receive  upon exercise of the right  shares of consol energy common stock having a value equal to twice the right exercise price 
for example  at an exercise price of per right  each right not otherwise voided would entitle its holders to purchase worth of shares of consol energy common stock for assuming that shares of consol energy common stock had a per share value of at such time  the holder of each right would be entitled to purchase ten shares of consol energy common stock for  or a price of per share  one half its then market price 
this and other provisions of consol energy s rights plan could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire the company  which could hinder stockholders ability to receive a premium for consol energy stock over the prevailing market prices 
consol energy s share price may decline due to shares eligible for future sale 
a total of  shares of our common stock recently have been registered for resale by stockholders who purchased the shares in private placement in september and october by consol energy and its other principal stockholder rwe rheinbraun 
this substantially exceeds the approximately million shares held by stockholders other than rwe before september   the date that it initially sold shares in a private offering 
therefore  the number of shares potentially available for trading in the public markets has significantly increased since september  we cannot predict the effect  if any  that future sales of shares of our common stock  or the availability of such shares for sale  would have on the market price prevailing from time to time 
sales by holders of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market  or the perception that such sales could occur  could adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock 
a reduction in the market price of our common stock could impair our ability to raise additional capital through future public offerings of our equity securities 
consol energy is a holding company and conducts substantially all of its operations through subsidiaries 
the company s ability to service its debt and pay dividends to holders of its common stock will depend upon it receiving distributions or similar payments from its subsidiaries 
dividends are discretionary 
because substantially all of consol energy s operations are conducted through subsidiaries  its cash flow and  therefore  its ability to service its debt and pay dividends to holders of its common stock primarily depends upon the earnings of the company s subsidiaries and the distribution of those earnings to  or upon loans or other payments of funds by those subsidiaries to  consol energy 
the subsidiaries of the company are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation to pay any amounts due pursuant to the company s debt securities or to make any funds available to consol energy for the payment of dividends or otherwise 
in addition  the payment of dividends and the making of loans and advances to the company by its subsidiaries may be subject to statutory or contractual restrictions  will be contingent upon the earnings of those subsidiaries and subject to various business considerations 
consol energy may not continue to pay dividends 
the declaration and payment of dividends by consol energy is subject to the discretion of consol energy s board of directors  and is under their continuing review 
the payment of dividends may be limited by the terms of additional financing 
consol energy may not pay dividends in the future 
liquidity and capital resources consol energy generally has satisfied its working capital requirements and funded its capital expenditures and debt service obligations from cash generated from operations and proceeds from borrowings 
in the past  a principal source of borrowings had been the issuance of commercial paper 
in july  standard and poor s lowered its rating of our long term debt to bb th lowest out of rating categories with a rating outlook of stable 
standard and poor s defines an obligation rated bb as less vulnerable to nonpayment than other speculative issues 
however  the rating indicates that an obligor faces major ongoing uncertainties or exposure to adverse business  financial  or economic conditions  which could lead to the obligor s inadequate capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation 
the plus sign shows relative standing within the rating category 
at the same time  standard and poor s placed consol energy s senior unsecured debt rating on creditwatch with negative implications 
as a result of the lower debt rating  consol energy was no longer able to participate as a seller in the commercial paper market 
consol energy believes alternative sources of short term borrowing  including consol energy s senior revolving credit facility and the accounts receivable securitization facility described below  are available and sufficient to replace funding previously provided by the issuance of commercial paper 
in december  standard and poor s lowered consol energy s rating of our long term debt to bb th lowest out of rating categories 
standard and poor s defines an obligation rated bb as less vulnerable to nonpayment than other speculative issues 
however  the rating indicates that an obligor faces major ongoing uncertainties or exposure to adverse business  financial  or economic conditions  which could lead to the obligor s inadequate capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation 
the negative sign shows relative standing within the rating category 
at the same time  standard and poor s placed consol energy s senior unsecured debt rating on creditwatch with negative implications 
in december  moody s investor service lowered its rating of consol energy s long term debt from ba to ba th lowest out of rating categories 
the rating remains under review for possible further downgrade 
bonds which are rated ba are considered to have speculative elements  their future cannot be considered as well assured 
often the protection of interest and principal payments may be very moderate  and thereby not well safeguarded during both good and bad times over the future 
uncertainty of position characterizes bonds in this class 
the modifier indicates that the obligation ranks in the lower end of its generic rating category 
a security rating is not a recommendation by a rating agency to buy  sell or hold securities 
the security rating may be subject to change 
in september  consol energy completed a day million senior secured revolving loan agreement 
the new agreement replaced a day bank credit facility of million that expired september  the day million facility under the new agreement was terminated on september  upon receipt of proceeds from the sale by consol energy of common stock in a private placement

the multi year senior credit facility  as amended  provides for an aggregate of million that may be used for letters of credit and borrowings for other corporate purposes 
interest is based at consol energy s option  upon the prime base rate or london interbank offered rates libor plus a spread  which is dependent on its credit rating 
the multi year senior revolving credit facility  as amended  has various covenants  including covenants that limit our ability to dispose of assets and merge with another corporation 
we are also required to maintain a ratio of total consolidated indebtedness to twelve month trailing earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  depletion and amortization ebitda of not more than to  measured quarterly 
this ratio was to at december  in addition  we are required to maintain a ratio of twelve months trailing ebitda to interest expense and amortization of debt of no less than to  measured quarterly 
this ratio was to at december  at december   these two financial covenants would have limited consol energy s additional borrowing capacity at an average interest rate of to approximately million

the capital expenditure limit is million  million and million for the twelve months ending december   and  respectively

in april  consol energy and certain of its us subsidiaries entered into a receivables facility with financial institutions for the sale on a continuous basis of eligible trade accounts receivable that will provide  on a revolving basis  up to million of short term funding 
consol energy formed cnx funding corporation  a wholly owned  special purpose  bankruptcy remote subsidiary  for the sole purpose of buying and selling eligible trade receivables generated by certain subsidiaries of consol energy 
under the receivables facility  consol energy and certain subsidiaries  irrevocably and without recourse  sell all of their eligible trade accounts receivable to cnx funding corporation 
cnx funding corporation then sells  on a revolving basis  an undivided percentage interest in the pool of eligible trade accounts receivable to financial institutions and their affiliates  while maintaining a subordinated interest in a portion of the trade receivables 
consol energy has agreed to continue servicing the sold receivables for the financial institutions for a fee based upon market rates for similar services 
the cost of funds are consistent with commercial paper rates plus a charge for administrative services paid to the financial institution 
the receivables facility expires in at december   eligible accounts receivable total approximately million  of which the subordinated retained interest was approximately million

consol energy believes that cash generated from operations and its borrowing capacity will be sufficient to meet its working capital requirements  anticipated capital expenditures other than major acquisitions  scheduled debt payments  anticipated dividend payments in and to provide required letters of credit 
nevertheless  the ability of consol energy to satisfy its working capital requirements  debt service obligations  to fund planned capital expenditures or pay dividends will depend upon its future operating performance  which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions in the coal and gas industries and other financial and business factors  some of which are beyond consol energy s control

 consolidation of variable interest entities  to expand upon and strengthen existing accounting guidance that addresses when a company should include in its financial statements the assets  liabilities and activities of another entity 
in general  a variable interest entity is a corporation  partnership  trust  or any other legal structure used for business purposes that either a does not have equity investors with voting rights or b has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities 
interpretation no 
requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entities activities  is entitled to receive a majority of the variable interest entities residual returns  or both 
the interpretation also requires disclosures about variable interest entities that the company is not required to consolidate  but in which it has a significant variable interest 
the consolidation requirements of interpretation no 
applied immediately to variable interest entities created after january  effective october   the fasb elected to defer the effective date until the first fiscal year or interim period that begins after december  for variable interest entities in which an enterprise is acquired before february  as of december   management believes that consol energy does not have any variable interest entities  therefore  there is no impact from the adoption of this standard

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in addition to the risks inherent in operations  consol energy is exposed to financial  market  political and economic risks 
the following discussion provides additional detail regarding consol energy s exposure to the risks of changing natural gas prices  interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
consol energy is exposed to market price risk in the normal course of selling natural gas production and to a lesser extent in the sale of coal 
consol sells coal under both short term and long term contracts with fixed price and or indexed price contracts that reflect market value 
consol energy uses fixed price contracts  collar price contracts and derivative commodity instruments that qualify as cash flow hedges under statement of financial accounting standards no 
to minimize exposure to market price volatility in the sale of natural gas 
our risk management policy strictly prohibits the use of derivatives for speculative positions 
consol energy has established risk management policies and procedures to strengthen the internal control environment of the marketing of commodities produced from its asset base 
all of the derivative instruments are held for purposes other than trading 
they are used primarily to mitigate uncertainty and volatility and cover underlying exposures 
consol energy s market risk strategy incorporates fundamental risk management tools to assess market price risk and establish a framework in which management can maintain a portfolio of transactions within pre defined risk parameters 
consol energy believes that the use of derivative instruments along with the risk assessment procedures and internal controls does not expose consol energy to material risk 
the use of derivative instruments could materially affect consol energy s results of operations depending on interest rates  exchange rates or market prices 
however  we believe that use of these instruments will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or liquidity 
for a summary of accounting policies related to derivative instruments  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
sensitivity analyses of the incremental effects on pre tax income for the twelve months ended december  of a hypothetical percent and percent change in natural gas prices  foreign exchange and interest rates for open derivative instruments as of december  are provided in the following table incremental decrease in pre tax income assuming a hypothetical price  exchange rate or interest rate change of in millions natural gas a foreign currency b interest rates c a consol energy remains at risk for possible changes in the market value of these derivative instruments  however  such risk should be mitigated by price changes in the underlying hedged item 
the effect of this offset is not reflected in the sensitivity analyses 
consol energy entered into derivative instruments to convert the market prices related to portions of the through anticipated sales of natural gas to fixed prices 
the sensitivity analysis reflects an inverse relationship between increases in commodity prices and a benefit to earnings 
when commodity prices increase  pretax income decreases 
the fair value of these contracts was a loss of million net of million deferred tax 
we continually evaluate the portfolio of derivative commodity instruments and adjust the strategy to anticipated market conditions and risks accordingly 
b consol energy uses foreign currency contracts to fix the costs of anticipated australian dollar capital expenditures 
the us dollar notional amount of all foreign currency contracts was million as of december  the sensitivity analysis reflects a direct correlation between increases in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar and a benefit to earnings 
when foreign currency exchange rates increase relative to the us dollar  pre tax income increases 
the fair value of these contracts resulted in million of income in the period 
c consol energy uses interest rate swaps to hedge the interest rate risk exposure of forecasted interest payments on consol energy australia pty ltd s  one of consol energy s subsidiaries  outstanding variable rate debt 
these agreements effectively convert variable rate debt into fixed rate debt 
the fair value of these contracts was a loss of million net of million deferred tax 
the use of these contracts is monitored by consol energy s executive management and treasury group 
consol energy is exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by counterparties 
the credit worthiness of counterparties is subject to continuing review 
consol energy s interest expense is sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates in the united states 
at december   consol energy had outstanding million aggregate principal amount of debt under fixed rate instruments and million aggregate principal amount of debt under variable rate instruments 
consol energy s primary exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to its commercial paper program in which consol energy was unable to participate after july  and its senior revolving credit facility 
at december   consol energy had no commercial paper outstanding and had an aggregate of million outstanding on the senior revolving credit facility 
consol energy s commercial paper and senior revolving facility bore interest at a weighted average rate of during the twelve months ended december  at december   consol energy had an aggregate of million in commercial paper outstanding 
consol energy s commercial paper bore interest at an average rate of during the twelve months ended december  a basis point increase in the average rate for consol energy s commercial paper and senior revolving facility would have decreased the twelve months ended december  net income by approximately million 
a basis point increase in the average rate for consol energy s commercial paper would have decreased consol energy s twelve months ended december  net income by approximately million 
the fair value of consol energy s financial instruments is set forth in note and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
almost all of consol energy s transactions are denominated in us dollars  and  as a result  it does not have material exposure to currency exchange rate risks 
consol energy uses foreign currency contracts to fix the costs of anticipated australian dollar capital expenditures 
consol energy does not have a material exposure to currency exchange rate risks other than for these foreign currency contracts
