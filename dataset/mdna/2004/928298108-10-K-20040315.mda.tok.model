item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview sales for the year ended december  were billion compared to sales of billion for the year ended december  net earnings for the year ended december  were million or per share  compared with a net loss for the year ended december  of million or per share 
earnings for the year ended december  were impacted by restructuring and severance costs of million  a loss on extinguishment of debt of million  a loss on long term purchase commitments of million  and a write down of tantalum inventories on hand to market value of million  offset by a gain on an insurance claim of million 
these items and their tax related consequences had a negative effect on earnings per share 
the year ended december  included charges for restructuring  inventory write downs  a loss on purchase commitments and other charges of million resulting in a reduction of in net earnings per share 
following a difficult and  in which the electronic components business generally was depressed both in the united states and much of the world  market conditions remained difficult in first half of in the latter half of the year  we noted substantial improvement of the general economic outlook worldwide 
we have seen a rapid acceleration of demand in electronics in all regions  in almost all market segments  beyond pure seasonality and stock replenishment 
we noted  in particular  strength in automotive products  computers and mobile phones 
the economic recovery began in the actives business  consistent with historical trends and as seen in the third quarter of the passives business is also showing indications of recovery 
pricing pressure has started to abate in the active products markets  but its presence continues to be felt in the passive segment  particularly for commodity products 
capacity utilization is a reflection  in part  of product demand trends 
we were approaching full capacity in most of our active facilities during the latter half of the year 
we are working to alleviate capacity constraints in the active segment by addressing production bottlenecks in our fabrication facilities  expanding our backend operations and expanding and broadening our foundry activities 
capacity utilization showed some improvement in the passive segment during  where capacity for resistors and inductors ranged from to  while in the capacitor lines it averaged around 
despite these positive trends  operating results for remained depressed because of pricing pressures 
average selling prices continued to decline during in both the passive and active segments  though considerably less rapidly in the second half of the year 
operating results for the first half of also suffered from the severe acute respiratory syndrome  or sars  outbreak  particularly in the active segment which does a substantial portion of its business in asia 
financial metrics we utilize several financial measures and metrics to evaluate the performance and assess the future direction of our business 
these key financial measures and metrics include sales  end of period backlog  the book to bill ratio  and inventory turnover 
we also monitor changes in average selling prices 
end of period backlog is one indicator of future sales 
however  if demand falls below customers forecasts  or if customers do not control their inventory effectively  they may cancel or reschedule the shipments that are included in our backlog  in many instances without the payment of any penalty 
therefore  the backlog is not necessarily indicative of the results of future periods 
another important indicator of demand in our industry is the book to bill ratio  which is the ratio of the amount of product ordered during a period as compared with the product that we ship during that period 
a book to bill ratio that is greater than one indicates that our orders are building and that we are likely to see increasing revenues in future periods 
conversely  a book to bill ratio that is less than one is an indicator of declining demand and may foretell declining sales 
we also focus on our inventory turnover as a measure of how well we are managing our inventory 
we define inventory turnover for a financial reporting period as our cost of products sold for that period divided by our average inventory for the period 
a higher level of inventory turnover reflects more efficient use of our capital 
in  inventory turnover improved to from in  which we attribute to somewhat improved selling conditions and enhanced selling efficiencies implemented during the year 
exclusive of tantalum and palladium write downs  inventory turnover would have been approximately in as compared to in the quarter to quarter trends in these financial metrics can also be an important indicator of the likely direction of our business 
the following table shows sales  the end of period backlog and the book to bill ratio for our business as a whole during the five quarters beginning with the fourth quarter of and through the fourth quarter of th quarter st quarter nd quarter rd quarter th quarter sales      end of period backlog      book to bill ratio includes    and  attributable to bccomponents for the first  second  third and fourth quarters of  respectively 
management believes that these trends are an encouraging indication of broad based demand into  in all of our major markets and all geographic areas 
pricing in our industry is volatile 
during  we experienced significant declines in average selling prices  particularly in the first half of the year in our actives business 
prices stabilized in the second half of the year  and we expect relatively stable pricing to continue into segments vishay operates in two segments  passive components and active components 
we are the leading manufacturer of passive components in the united states and europe 
these components include resistors  capacitors  inductors  strain gages and load cells 
we include in this segment our measurements group  which manufactures and markets strain gages  load cells  transducers  instruments and weighing systems 
the core components of these devices are resistors that are sensitive to various types of mechanical stress 
we are also one of the world s leading manufacturers of active electronic components  also referred to as discrete semiconductors 
these include transistors  diodes  rectifiers  certain types of integrated circuits and optoelectronic products 
our active segment includes our owned subsidiary  siliconix 
the passive components business had historically predominated at vishay until the purchase of general semiconductor in november  after which the lead position shifted to the active business 
with the acquisition of bccomponents in december  revenues from our active and passive businesses are essentially split evenly between the segments 
for  approximately of our revenues were attributable to our passive business and to our active business 
the passive and active segments of our business have historically responded differently to phases of the business cycle 
having strong capabilities in both areas not only gives us a broad line of products to offer our customers  it also smoothes  to some extent  the business swings that we experience 
when business slows down  active components are usually first to feel the effects of the downturn that are later experienced by passive components 
similarly  when business begins to increase  our semiconductor products usually lead the recovery  followed some time later by resistors  inductors and capacitors 
results for the second half of are indicative of these past trends  where we saw improvements in active products beginning in the third quarter  which was followed by improvements in our passive products in the fourth quarter 
we expect these trends to continue into the following table shows sales and book to bill ratios broken out by segment for the five quarters beginning with the fourth quarter of through the fourth quarter of th quarter st quarter nd quarter rd quarter th quarter passive components sales      book to bill ratio active components sales      book to bill ratio includes    and  attributable to bccomponents for the first  second  third and fourth quarters of  respectively 
cost management we place a strong emphasis on reducing our costs 
one way we do this is by moving production to the extent possible from high labor cost markets  such as the united states and western europe  to lower labor cost markets  such as israel  mexico  the republic of china taiwan  the people s republic of china and eastern europe 
the percentage of our total headcount in lower labor cost countries is a measure of the extent to which we are successful in implementing this program 
this percentage was at the end of  as compared to at the end of  at the end of  and at the end of we continue to target improvement in this area as we proceed with the integration of the business of bccomponents  acquired in december the long term target remains between and of our headcount in lower labor cost countries 
we are placing particular emphasis on cost reduction in our capacitor lines  which have been hardest hit by the recent market downturn and where the business continues to suffer from worldwide overcapacity 
in  we completed the transfer of our power capacitor production from western europe to the czech republic and began moving our molded tantalum capacitor business to the people s republic of china 
we also began to consolidate our existing film capacitor line within the business of bccomponents 
israeli government incentives our production facilities in israel benefit from incentives offered by the israeli government for creation of jobs and capital investment in that country 
these benefits take the form of government grants and reduced tax rates that are lower than those in the united states 
these reduced tax rates apply to projects specifically approved by the israeli government and  depending on project size  are available for periods of ten or fifteen years 
due to the write downs of inventories and the losses on long term purchase commitments in and  the application of the israeli tax rates rather than united states tax rates resulted in an increase in net loss of million in and a decrease in net earnings of million in in  lower tax rates in israel  as compared to the statutory rate in the united states  resulted in an increase in net earnings of million 
israeli government grants are awarded to specific projects 
these grants are intended to promote employment in israel s industrial sector and are conditioned on the recipient maintaining certain prescribed employment levels 
grants are paid when the related projects become operational  and the israeli government approves the project 
israeli government grants  recorded as a reduction in the costs of products sold  were million  million and million in the years  and  respectively 
at december   our balance sheet reflected million in deferred grant income 
during the second quarter of  the government of israel informed us that since the headcount in our israeli subsidiaries decreased significantly over the previous months  the government intended to withhold up to million grant otherwise due to us 
the grant  which was made by the israeli government under an economic stimulus program  was conditioned in part on the employment levels at certain of our israeli facilities 
the israeli government argued that we had not maintained employment at the required minimum levels 
during the fourth quarter of  we settled our dispute with the government of israel  and the government agreed to continue making grant payments to us 
under the terms of the settlement with the israeli government  vishay is required to employ at least an additional  employees in israel over the next three years in order to preserve its eligibility for the government grant 
we have hired an additional  employees to date and expect to comply with these requirements 
we therefore recorded a catch up adjustment of approximately million of grant income for the fourth quarter of and reversed the allowances against the grant and deferred income reflected on the september  balance sheet 
if we were no longer able to maintain the required level of employment in the future  we could be required to return some grant funds that were previously awarded to us 
the effect of the return of these funds would be to reduce our income in future years 
also  if the current business climate continues  we might not initiate new projects that qualify for grants or reduced tax rates or the israeli government could curtail or eliminate the programs from which we have benefited in the past 
write downs of inventory and purchase commitments tantalum is the principal material used in the manufacture of tantalum capacitors 
we generally purchase this metal in powder or wire form  although in and early  when we perceived possible supply shortages  we also stockpiled quantities of tantalum ore 
in july and november of  we entered into purchase contracts with cabot corporation for tantalum powder and wire that committed us to minimum purchases of these materials at fixed prices through we regularly utilize tantalum powder and wire in the production of tantalum capacitors but have not used our stockpile of tantalum ore since palladium is a precious metal used in the production of multi layer ceramic capacitors that we purchase under short term contracts 
in  as a result of the general downturn in the electronics business  we experienced a significant decrease in capacitor sales 
prices of tantalum ore  powder and wire and of palladium also experienced significant declines 
accordingly  we recorded write downs of our raw material inventories of these metals including million for tantalum ore  million for tantalum wire and powder and million for palladium 
in june  following initiation of a lawsuit by cabot regarding its tantalum supply contracts with vishay  we agreed with cabot to modify the contracts  including reducing prices  providing for purchases at regular intervals and extending one of the contracts through in the fourth quarter of  our management concluded that the depressed prices for tantalum were not attributable to temporary imbalances in distributor inventories for tantalum capacitors and that the prices for tantalum were likely to remain at their currently depressed levels for the foreseeable future 
also during the fourth quarter  one of our competitors settled its dispute with cabot regarding long term tantalum purchase commitments at prices that we understand are in the same range as the prices under our june settlement with cabot 
our management therefore concluded that it was unlikely to obtain further price concessions from cabot 
accordingly  we determined that it was appropriate to accrue a loss on our purchase commitments under our supply contracts with cabot to reflect the difference between the prices that we are required to pay under the contracts and current market prices for tantalum 
for the same reasons  we also determined to further write down our raw material inventories of tantalum ore  powder and wire 
these charges amounted to approximately million for the purchase commitments and million for inventory 
in  we also recorded a write down of million on palladium inventories 
prices for tantalum continued to decline in we recorded write downs of million to reduce tantalum inventories to current market value  and a loss on purchase commitments for future delivery of tantalum of million 
in addition  we recorded a write down of million of palladium inventory in the first quarter of the raw materials write downs have the effect of improving gross margins in subsequent periods by reducing cost of goods sold as inventory is utilized 
this effect cannot be quantified in any specific reporting period  however  because of the large number of affected products and the impracticality of tracking raw material inventory usage on a product by product basis 
we anticipate  based on current and foreseeable demand for tantalum capacitors  that our minimum purchase commitments under the contracts with cabot will substantially exceed our requirements over the terms of the contracts 
see contractual commitments below 
also  we do not anticipate utilizing our stockpile of tantalum ore at any time in the foreseeable future 
tantalum ore  powder and wire have an indefinite shelf life  therefore  we believe that we will eventually utilize all of the material in our inventory or purchased under the contracts 
based on usage currently expected in  our purchase commitments represent approximately years of usage 
we have little visibility of the demand for our tantalum capacitor products beyond twelve months 
it is almost certain that our actual requirements of tantalum will differ from those projected  and likely that the difference will be material 
foreign currency in  we realized approximately of our revenues from customers outside the united states 
any third party sales not using the us dollar as the functional currency must be reported in the local currency and be translated at the weighted average exchange rate 
this translation has an impact on the net sales line of the consolidated statements of operations and also on the expense lines of the consolidated statements of operations 
we generally do not purchase foreign currency exchange contracts or other derivative instruments to hedge our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations 
critical accounting policies and estimates our significant accounting policies are summarized in note to our consolidated financial statements 
we identify here a number of policies that entail significant judgments or estimates 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue on product sales during the period when the sales process is complete 
this generally occurs when products are shipped to the customer in accordance with terms of an agreement of sale  title and risk of loss have been transferred  collectibility is reasonably assured and pricing is fixed or determinable 
we have agreements with distributors that historically provided limited rights of product return 
beginning in  we modified these arrangements to allow distributors a limited credit for unsaleable products  which we term a scrap allowance 
consistent with industry practice  we also have a stock  ship and debit program whereby we consider  and grant in our discretion  requests by distributors for credits on previously purchased products that remain in distributors inventory  to enable the distributors to offer more competitive pricing 
in addition  we have contractual arrangements whereby we provide distributors with protection against price reductions that we initiate after sale of product to the distributor and prior to resale by the distributor 
we record end of period accruals for each of the programs based upon our estimate of future credits under the programs that will be attributable to sales recorded through the end of the period 
we calculate reductions of revenue attributable to each of the programs during any period by computing the change in the accruals from the prior period and adding the credits actually given to distributors during the period under the programs 
these procedures require the exercise of significant judgments  but we believe they enable us to estimate reasonably future credits under the programs 
recording and monitoring of these accruals takes place at our subsidiaries and divisions  with input from sales and marketing personnel and review  assessment and  if necessary  adjustment by corporate management 
while our subsidiaries and divisions utilize different methodologies based on their individual experiences  all of the methodologies take into account sales to distributors during the relevant period  inventory levels at the distributors  current and projected market trends and conditions  recent and historical activity under the relevant programs  changes in program policies  and open requests for credits 
these are the elements that management considers relevant  and  in our judgment  the different methodologies provide us with equally reliable estimates upon which to base our accruals 
we do not track the credits that we record against specific products sold from distributor inventories  so as to directly compare revenue reduction for credits recorded during any period with credits ultimately awarded in respect of products sold during that period 
nevertheless  we believe that we have an adequate basis to assess the reasonableness and reliability of our estimates 
accounts receivable our receivables represent a significant portion of our current assets 
we are required to estimate the collectibility of our receivables and to establish allowances for the amount of receivables that will prove uncollectible 
we base these allowances on our historical collection experience  the length of time our receivables are outstanding  the financial circumstances of individual customers  and general business and economic conditions 
inventories we value our inventories at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined under the first in first out method and market based upon net realizable value 
the valuation of our inventories requires our management to make market estimates 
for instance  in the case of tantalum powder  we estimate market value by obtaining current quotations from available sources of supply 
for work in progress goods  we are required to estimate the cost to completion of the products and the prices at which we will be able to sell the products 
for finished goods  we must assess the prices at which we believe the inventory can be sold 
as noted  we recorded write downs of our tantalum and palladium inventories in and inventories are also adjusted for estimated obsolescence and written down to net realizable value based upon estimates of future demand  technology developments and market conditions 
estimates of restructuring and severance costs and purchase related restructuring costs in  we recorded restructuring costs of approximately million related to our existing businesses 
in  we recorded restructuring costs of approximately million related to our acquisitions and million related to our existing businesses 
our acquisition related restructuring costs included  among other things  costs related to our acquisition of bccomponents in december our restructuring activities related to existing business were designed to reduce both our fixed and variable costs  particularly in response to the reduced demand for our products occasioned by the electronics industry downturn 
these included the disposition of fixed assets and the termination of employees 
acquisition related costs are included in the allocation of the cost of the acquired business and generally add to goodwill 
other restructuring costs are expensed during the period in which we determine that we will incur those costs  and all of the requirements for accrual are met 
because these costs are recorded based upon estimates  our actual expenditures for the restructuring activities may differ from the initially recorded costs 
if this happens  we will have to adjust our estimates in future periods 
in the case of acquisition related restructuring costs  this would generally require a change in value of the goodwill appearing on our balance sheet  but would not affect our earnings 
in the case of other restructuring costs  we could be required either to record additional expenses in future periods  if our initial estimates were too low  or to reverse part of the charges that we recorded initially  if our initial estimates were too high 
raw material write downs in and  we took charges against contractual commitments to purchase tantalum powder and wire through and wrote down our existing inventory of tantalum ore  powder and wire to present market value 
we did this because the current market prices of tantalum are substantially below the prices at which we are committed to purchase tantalum in the future under long term contracts and the prices at which we were carrying our tantalum raw materials inventory 
these actions involved significant judgments on our part  including decisions of whether to take these charges and write downs  their timing and their amount 
we made the decision to take the charges and write downs after our management concluded that the substantial fall off in the demand for tantalum capacitors was likely to continue for the foreseeable future 
combining this assessment with the worldwide over capacity in tantalum production  we could not foresee when tantalum prices might recover from their currently depressed levels 
although we believe that both the charges and write downs as well as their timing were appropriate under the circumstances  our visibility for future demand and pricing is limited and the judgments made by our management necessarily involved subjective assessments 
the write down of our current tantalum inventory and the charges with respect to our future tantalum commitments were calculated based on market prices for tantalum 
there is no established market on which tantalum raw materials are regularly traded and quoted 
we based our determination of current market price on quotations from two suppliers of these materials 
we cannot say that the prices at which we could currently enter into contracts for the purchase of tantalum would be the same as these quoted prices 
had we made other assumptions on current and future prices for tantalum  the amount of the inventory write downs and the charges against our purchase commitments would have been different 
if tantalum prices were to recover in the future  we would not reverse the write downs that we have taken on our raw materials inventory  so that our cost of materials will continue to reflect these write downs regardless of future price increases in tantalum 
this could have the effect of increasing the earnings that we realize in future periods from what they would have been had we not taken these actions until future raw material prices were known with certainty 
we could also be required to take further write downs and charges if tantalum prices experience further declines 
based upon similar considerations  we recorded write downs of our palladium inventory to market value in both and goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the cost of businesses acquired over the fair value of the related net assets at the date of acquisition 
goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually 
these tests will be performed more frequently if there are triggering events 
sfas no 
prescribes a two step method for determining goodwill impairment 
in the first step  we determine the fair value of the reporting unit using a comparable companies market multiple approach 
if the net book value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value  we would then perform the second step of the impairment test which requires allocation of the reporting unit s fair value to all of its assets and liabilities in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation  with any residual fair value being allocated to goodwill 
an impairment charge will be recognized only when the implied fair value of a reporting unit s goodwill is less than its carrying amount 
fair value of reporting units is determined using comparable company market multiples 
the comparable companies utilized in our evaluation are the members of our peer group utilized in the presentation of our stock performance in our annual proxy statement 
impairment of long lived assets we assess the impairment of our long lived assets  other than goodwill and tradenames  including property and equipment  and identifiable intangible assets subject to amortization  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired asset  changes in historical or projected operating performance and significant negative economic trends 
results of operations income statement captions as a percentage of sales and the effective tax rates were as follows year ended december costs of products sold gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses operating income loss earnings loss before income taxes benefit and minority interest net earnings loss effective tax rate reflects losses on purchase commitments of million and million during the years ended december  and net sales  gross profits and margins net sales for the year ended december  increased by million or over the prior year 
the increase primarily reflects the acquisitions of bccomponents in december  celtron technologies in october  blh and nobel in july and tedea huntleigh bv in september excluding these acquisitions  net sales increased million  or 
the weakening of the us dollar against foreign currencies for the year ended december   in comparison to the prior year  resulted in increases in reported sales of million 
net sales for the year ended december  increased by million or over the prior year 
this reflects a substantial increase in sales in the active segment  attributable in large measure to acquisitions reflected only partially in but fully in  partially offset by a continuing drop in sales in the passive segment in the weakening of the us dollar against foreign currencies for the year ended december   in comparison to the prior year  resulted in increases in reported sales of million 
we deduct  from the sales that we record to distributors  allowances for future credits that we expect to provide for returns  scrapped product and price adjustments under various programs made available to the distributors 
we make deductions corresponding to particular sales in the period in which the sales are made  although the corresponding credits may not be issued until future periods 
we estimate the deductions based on sales levels to distributors  inventory levels at the distributors  current and projected market trends and conditions  recent and historical activity under the relevant programs  changes in program policies and open requests for credits 
we recorded deductions from gross sales under our distributor incentive programs of million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively  or  as a percentage of gross sales   and  respectively 
actual credits issued under the programs for the years ended december    and  were approximately million  million  and million  respectively 
the increase in the incentives from is attributable primarily to the adverse business climate that developed following and the resulting pricing pressures that affected our distributors and the electronic component industry generally 
costs of products sold as a percentage of net sales for the year ended december  was as compared to for the prior year 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales for year ended december  was as compared to for the prior year 
price declines were offset in substantial part by volume increases and cost savings programs 
gross profit for reflects write downs of raw material inventory to lower of cost or market of million  which is included in cost of products sold  and an accrual of loss on long term purchase commitments of million 
gross profit for reflects a write down of raw material inventory to market value of million  which is included in cost of products sold  and an accrual of loss on long term purchase commitments of million 
costs of products sold as a percentage of net sales were for the year ended december  as compared to for the prior year 
gross profit  as a percentage of net sales  for the year ended december  was as compared to for the prior year 
gross profit for includes a write down of raw material inventory to market value of million  which is included in cost of goods sold  and accruals for losses on purchase commitments of million 
the erosion in overall profit margins in reflected the continuing weakness in the passive segment  offset in substantial part by improvements in the active segment 
both volume reduction and further declines in average selling prices contributed to the declining profit margins in the passive segment 
profit margins in the active segment benefited from higher volumes  even as average selling prices continued to decline in various product lines 
for the year ended december   gross profit reflected write downs of tantalum and palladium inventories of million 
see israeli government incentives regarding israeli government grants  which are recorded as a reduction in costs of products sold 
the following tables show sales and gross profit margins separately for our passive and active segments 
passive components year ended december net sales    gross profit margin net sales of passive components for the year ended december  increased million or as compared to the prior year 
without the acquisition of bccomponents  celtron technologies  blh and nobel  and tedea huntleigh  the passive components business sales would have increased by million or as compared to the prior year 
the organic increase in net sales is attributable to the volume increases in the resistor and inductor product lines  partially offset by price declines  and the positive impact of foreign currency exchange rates 
the average selling price was down versus the prior year 
our resistor and inductor business stabilized in and began an improvement in the latter part of that year which continued into our capacitor business  which was particularly hard hit during the recent global slowdown in the electronics industry  continues to experience the lingering effects of worldwide overcapacity in both production and supply 
however  with the slowing of the erosion in average selling prices that began in the fourth quarter of  the capacitor business appears to have stabilized and is showing modest signs of improvement 
gross margins were for the year ended december   as compared to negative for the prior year 
results for reflected average margins of for our resistor and inductor lines and for our capacitor lines 
margins were affected negatively by raw material related write downs in and  as market prices for these materials continued to decline 
during  we recorded write downs of million to reduce tantalum inventories to current market value  and a loss on purchase commitments for future delivery of tantalum of million 
in addition  we recorded a write down of million of palladium inventory 
in  we recorded a loss on long term purchase commitments of tantalum of million and write downs of million on tantalum and palladium inventories 
the raw material write downs have the effect of improving gross margins in subsequent periods by reducing cost of goods sold as inventory is utilized 
this effect cannot be quantified in any specific reporting period  however  because of the large number of affected products and the impracticality of tracking raw material inventory usage on a product by product basis 
we continue to implement cost reduction programs  particularly in our passives business  in order to reduce costs and thereby stabilize our margins 
we have initiated several significant cost reduction programs in all of our products lines  including facility combinations and shifts of production to lower cost regions  with particular emphasis on reducing headcount in high labor cost countries 
sixty nine percent of our labor force was in low labor cost countries as of december  the impact of these cost savings plans has been partially offset by the underutilization of capacity in the commodity products 
net sales of passive components for the year ended december  decreased by million or from comparable sales of the prior year 
the decrease in net sales was attributable to a combination of lower volume and a continuing slide in prices 
excluding the significant acquisition activity in our measurements group in  sales in the passive segment would have decreased by million or from the prior year 
gross profit margin in was negatively impacted by a loss on long term purchase commitments of tantalum of million and write downs of million on tantalum and palladium inventories 
even excluding the loss on long term purchase commitments  our capacitor business had negative average gross margins of in  compared with positive average gross margins of for resistors and capacitors 
the acquisition of bccomponents  a worldwide manufacturer of resistors and capacitors  in december had no material effect on the results for the passive segment 
active components year ended december net sales    gross profit margin net sales of the active components business for year ended december  increased by million  or  from sales of the comparable prior year period 
the active segment continued to experience pricing pressure in  especially during the first half of the year 
sales for the first half of actually decreased from the comparable period  primarily as a result of the sars outbreak in asia where siliconix sells approximately of its total sales 
the modest revenue growth for the year was fueled by a significant rebound in asian business during the second half  driven by demand for computer components and by distributors restocking inventories 
gross margins were for the year ended december  as compared to for the prior year 
margins were negatively impacted by product mix changes at siliconix  where there was a higher share of commodity products as compared to the comparable prior year periods 
also  because of capacity constraints that it has begun to experience  siliconix made greater use of subcontractors during  which has the effect of driving down margins 
siliconix s net sales for were million  compared to million in  a increase  and its gross profit margins declined from for to for net sales of the active components business for the year ended december  increased by million or from comparable sales of the prior year 
as detailed below  the increase was in substantial measure due to the acquisitions of general semiconductor and the infineon infrared business in  which were included in our results for all of but for only portions of it also reflects sales recovery at our existing semiconductor operations that began in the increased volume that we experienced in was offset to some extent by modest declines in average selling prices in various product lines 
the improvement in gross profit margins to from is attributable primarily to improvements at siliconix and to a lesser extent at our other semiconductor operations 
siliconix s net sales for were million as compared to million in  a increase  and its gross profit margins rose from for to for revenues in the active segment for included revenues of million from the infineon infrared business and general semiconductor  compared to revenues of million from these businesses in excluding the contribution of these acquisitions  net sales in would have increased by as compared to and gross profit margin would have been 
selling  general  and administrative expenses selling  general  and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were of net sales as compared to of net sales for the prior year 
this increase was mainly due to the costs associated with the acquisition and integration of bccomponents 
our continuing cost reduction initiatives referred to above also target selling  general  and administrative costs and offset  in part  the acquisition related increases in sg a margins 
selling  general  and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were of net sales as compared to of net sales for the prior year 
the higher percentage and amount in was due primarily to acquisition activity 
restructuring and severance costs our restructuring activities have been designed to cut both fixed and variable costs  particularly in response to the reduced demand for products occasioned by the electronics industry downturn beginning in these activities include the closing of facilities and the termination of employees 
beginning january   restructuring costs have been accounted for under sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
this statement requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
because costs are recorded based upon estimates  actual expenditures for the restructuring activities may differ from the initially recorded costs 
if the initial estimates are too low or too high  we could be required either to record additional expenses in future periods or to reverse previously recorded expenses 
we anticipate that we will realize the benefits of our restructuring through lower labor costs and other operating expenses in future periods 
we recorded restructuring and severance costs for the year ended december  of million  million of which was workforce reduction expense and million of which was fixed asset impairment 
the workforce reduction expense was comprised of termination costs for employees in europe  asia and the united states 
through the end of  we paid million of these workforce reduction costs  corresponding to the termination of employees 
the balance of workforce reduction expense remaining at december  is expected to be paid by the end of the fixed asset impairment related to facility closure 
as a result of restructuring activities initiated in  we expect an annual increase in gross profit of approximately million 
we recorded restructuring and severance costs for the year ended december  of million  of which million was workforce reduction expense and million was fixed asset impairment 
the workforce reduction expense was comprised of termination costs for  employees in europe  israel and the united states 
through the end of  we paid million of these workforce reduction costs  corresponding to the termination of  employees 
the balance of workforce reduction expense remaining at december  is expected to be paid in the fixed asset impairment related to facility closure 
we continue to realize annual cost savings associated with restructuring activities initiated in we recorded million in restructuring and severance costs for the year ended december   of which million was workforce reduction expense and million was fixed asset impairment 
the workforce reduction expense was comprised of termination costs for  employees in europe  israel and asia 
a balance of million of workforce reduction costs remaining at december  was paid in the fixed asset impairment related to facility closure 
we continue to realize annual cost savings associated with restructuring activities initiated in for additional detail on restructuring and severance costs  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
restructuring and severance costs are separate from plant closure  employee termination and similar integration costs we incur in connection with our acquisition activities 
these amounts are included in the costs of our acquisitions and do not affect earnings or losses on our statement of operations 
for a discussion of these costs  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
interest expense interest expense for the year ended december  increased by million  as compared to the prior year 
this increase was primarily a result of debt issued or assumed in the various acquisitions made in and the issuance in august of our million principal amount convertible subordinated notes due  net of debt repaid with the proceeds of these notes of million 
acquisition related debt included  in particular borrowings of million under our revolving credit facility and the issuance of million principal amount of unsecured loan notes  currently bearing interest at libor plus  in connection with the bccomponents acquisition in december the debt we repaid with the proceeds of our notes included approximately million principal amount of general semiconductor s convertible notes  approximately million accreted principal amount of liquid yield option tm notes lyons and million in borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
interest expense for the year ended december  increased by million compared to the prior year 
this increase was a result of higher average outstanding bank borrowings attributable to our acquisition activity  offset in part by somewhat lower interest rates 
other income expense we recorded a loss of million for extinguishment of debt during the year ended december  on the redemption of principal amount of the general semiconductor notes and the repurchase of million in accreted principal amount of our lyons 
also during  we recorded a gain of million on the receipt of insurance proceeds in excess of book value on account of the destruction of the thin film resistor facility of our electro films  inc subsidiary in providence  rhode island 
that facility has now been completely rebuilt into a state of the art production center 
no comparable losses or gains were recorded in the prior year 
excluding the items described above  other income was million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the prior year 
this decrease was primarily due to higher foreign exchange losses in foreign exchange losses of million were reported for as compared to foreign exchange losses of million for the comparable prior year period 
in  we also had losses of million on the disposal of property and equipment  compared to losses of million in interest income decreased by million for the year ended december  compared to the prior year  primarily due to lower interest rates 
we recognized a gain on expiration of an interest rate swap of million in  compared to a loss on ineffective interest rate swaps of million in additionally  included other income of approximately million received from the chinese government as an incentive for being a foreign partner in china 
other income for the year ended december  was million as compared to million for the prior year 
other income in both and consisted primarily of interest income  as well as gains on disposal of property and equipment and foreign exchange gains 
minority interest minority interest in earnings decreased by million for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year  primarily due to the decrease in net earnings of siliconix  of which we own 
minority interest increased by million for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year  primarily due to the increase in net earnings of siliconix 
income taxes the effective tax rate for the year ended december  was  reflecting tax expense  as compared to for the prior year  reflecting a tax benefit 
the effective tax rate in reflects the fact that we could not recognize for accounting purposes the tax benefit of losses incurred in certain jurisdictions  although these losses are available to offset future taxable income 
under applicable accounting principles  we may not recognize deferred tax assets for loss carryforwards in jurisdictions where there is a recent history of cumulative losses  where there is no taxable income in the carryback period  where there is insufficient evidence of future earnings to overcome the loss history and where there is no other positive evidence  such as the likely reversal of temporary timing differences  that would result in the utilization of loss carryforwards for tax purposes 
we enjoy favorable tax rates on our income in israel from specific approved projects 
the low rates  which generally are available for a period of ten or fifteen years  ordinarily result in greater earnings than what they would be if the israeli income was subject to statutory united states tax rates 
however  due to losses reported in israel  the low rates did not improve net earnings for and  respectively 
the effective tax rate for the year ended december  was  reflecting an income tax benefit  compared to for the prior year  reflecting income tax expense 
the low effective rate in is primarily a consequence of the losses before income taxes in low tax jurisdictions 
while we continue to benefit from low tax rates in israel  we recognized a large taxable loss in israel in  with the effect of reducing our overall tax benefit on our losses 
the more favorable israeli tax rates are applied to specific approved projects and are normally available for a period of ten or fifteen years see the discussion of our israeli tax benefits in overview israeli government incentives above 
comparatively  in  the high effective tax rate was due to low net earnings and the non tax deductibility of purchased research and development expense related to the general semiconductor acquisition 
financial condition and liquidity cash and cash equivalents were million at december   of which million belonged to siliconix 
of the remaining amount of million  approximately million is held by our non us subsidiaries 
our financial condition at december   continued to be strong  with a current ratio current assets to current liabilities of to  compared with a ratio of to at december  our ratio of long term debt  less current portion  to stockholders equity was to at december   compared to a ratio of to at december  the increase in long term debt ratio from december  reflects the debt issued in the third quarter of  net of debt repaid 
cash flows from operations were million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  during  accounts receivable attributable to our existing businesses and inventory levels continued to decline as a result of the lingering effects of the business slowdown that began in  although the drop was substantially less pronounced than in the prior year 
the increase in accounts receivable at december  versus december  was primarily due to the net sales of bccomponents  which was acquired in december net purchases of property and equipment for the year ended december  were million  as compared to million in the prior year 
the increase was primarily attributable to spending to expand capacity in the active business and to shift manufacturing to low labor cost regions in the passive business 
we used million in cash for acquisitions in  primarily for our acquisitions of bccomponents in december and other smaller acquisitions in our measurements group during the year 
the acquisitions were funded in part by our cash balances and in part from borrowings 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for discussion of these acquisitions 
purchase of businesses  net of cash acquired  of million  for the year ended december  represents payments made related to liabilities assumed from previous acquisitions 
our debt levels have increased significantly since this is primarily attributable to acquisition activity 
additionally  in  we issued million of convertible subordinated notes  using a majority of the proceeds to repay other higher interest rate debt 
in connection with the acquisition of bccomponents in december  we issued million principal amount of floating rate unsecured loan notes due the notes bear interest at libor plus through december  and at libor thereafter 
the interest payable on the notes may be further reduced to of libor after december  if the price of vishay common stock trades above a specified target price  as provided in the notes 
the notes are subject to a put and call agreement under which the holders may at any time put the notes to us in exchange for  shares of vishay common stock in the aggregate  and we may call the notes in exchange for cash or for shares of vishay common stock after years from the date of issuance 
on august   we sold million aggregate principal amount of convertible subordinated notes due and granted the initial purchasers an option to purchase  within days of the date of the offering memorandum relating to the notes  an additional million of the notes 
this option was exercised  and the additional million of notes was issued on september  the notes will pay interest semi annually 
holders may convert their notes into shares of vishay common stock  subsequent to the occurrence of certain conditions that had not occurred as of december   at a conversion price of per share 
this conversion price is the equivalent to a conversion rate of shares per  principal amount of notes 
the notes are subordinated in right of payment to all of our existing and future senior indebtedness and are effectively subordinated to all existing and future liabilities of its subsidiaries 
the notes will be redeemable at our option beginning august  at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest  if any 
holders of the notes will have the right to require us to repurchase all or some of their notes at a purchase price equal to of their principal amount of the notes  plus accrued and unpaid interest  if any  on august   august   august  and august  in addition  holders of the notes will have the right to require us to repurchase all or some of their notes upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a fundamental change 
on any required repurchase  we may choose to pay the purchase price in cash or shares of vishay common stock or any combination of cash and vishay common stock 
the proceeds of the offering of these convertible subordinated notes were used to repay other outstanding debt  as well as general corporate purposes 
the early extinguishment of the lyons and the general semiconductor notes  described below  resulted in a pretax loss of million in the third quarter of it is anticipated that the early extinguishment will reduce interest expense by million per year going forward 
we used approximately million of the proceeds of the offering of the convertible subordinated notes to repay amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility 
at the same time  we agreed with the lenders under this facility to an amendment and restatement of the agreement governing the facility 
the maximum availability under the facility  in light of our anticipated liquidity needs  was changed from million to million  and the final maturity of the facility was extended from june to may the restatement decreases our minimum tangible net worth requirement to million plus of net income without offset for losses and of net proceeds of equity offerings from july   eliminates the covenant on minimum earnings before interest and tax  permits securitization of up to million of non us accounts receivable  allows for the release of all collateral other than subsidiary stock and pledges by the company and its subsidiaries of intercompany notes under certain circumstances and creates an event of default upon the occurrence of a fundamental change as defined under our convertible subordinated notes 
at december   there were no borrowings outstanding under this credit facility 
our tangible net worth at the end of stood at million  which is million more than the minimum required under the related credit facility covenant 
we used approximately million of the proceeds of the offering of the convertible subordinated notes to fund the purchase of approximately million accreted principal amount million face amount of our liquid yield option tm notes lyons 
pursuant to the terms of the lyons  on june   the remaining holders of the lyons will have the right to put these notes to us for an aggregate purchase price of million 
holders may also put these notes to us on june   june   and june  at various prices set forth in the notes 
if these notes are put to us  we expect to be able to utilize our revolving credit facility or vishay common stock to finance the repurchase 
we used approximately million of the proceeds of the offering of the convertible subordinated notes to fund principal and premium in connection with the redemption of all of the outstanding convertible subordinated notes due of our general semiconductor subsidiary 
prior to redemption  there was million principal amount of the general semiconductor notes outstanding 
the notes were redeemed at a price of of their principal amount  plus accrued but unpaid interest to the date of redemption of million 
commercial commitments we maintain a secured revolving credit facility of million 
as of december   we had no amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility 
letters of credit totaling million  were issued under the revolving credit facility at december  at december   million was available under the credit facility 
borrowings under the revolving credit facility are secured by pledges of stock in certain significant subsidiaries and certain guarantees by significant subsidiaries 
the subsidiaries would be required to perform under the guarantees in the event that vishay failed to make principal or interest payments under the revolving credit facility 
if any subsidiary were to borrow under the credit facility  vishay would provide a similar guarantee with respect to the subsidiary 
the credit facility restricts us from paying cash dividends and requires us to comply with other covenants  including the maintenance of specific financial ratios 
at december   we had committed and uncommitted short term credit lines with various us and foreign banks aggregating approximately million  of which approximately million was unused 
contractual commitments as of december  we had contractual obligations as follows payments due by period in thousands total less than years years after year years long term debt     operating leases      expected pension funding   estimated costs to complete construction in progress   tantalum purchases    total      pursuant to the terms of the liquid yield option tm notes lyons  on june   the remaining holders of the lyons will have the right to put these notes to us for an aggregate purchase price of million 
holders may also put these notes to us on june   june   and june  at various prices set forth in the notes 
if these notes are put to us  we expect to be able to utilize our revolving credit facility or vishay common stock to finance the repurchase 
on december   the company and siliconix announced the signing of a memorandum of understanding with tower semiconductor for a long term manufacturing and supply arrangement between siliconix and tower 
pursuant to the terms of the memorandum of understanding  siliconix would place with tower orders valued at approximately million for the purchase of semiconductor wafers to be manufactured in tower s fab over a seven to ten year period  of which approximately million would be guaranteed and would be delivered over the three year period starting at the first anniversary of the definitive agreement 
siliconix would advance to tower million to be used for the purchase of additional equipment required to satisfy siliconix s orders  which would be credited towards the purchase price of the wafers 
the transaction is subject to the approval of both companies boards of directors  tower s lending bank and the israeli investment center and to the negotiation of definitive documentation 
while there can be no assurances that a definitive agreement will be reached  vishay and siliconix expect a definitive agreement to be signed during the first half of if a definitive agreement is not reached  vishay and siliconix will have no commitments related to this memorandum of understanding 
inflation normally  inflation does not have a significant impact on our operations as our products are not generally sold on long term contracts 
consequently  we can adjust our selling prices  to the extent permitted by competition  to reflect cost increases caused by inflation

 certain disclosures regarding non us pension plans and estimated future benefit payments for both us and us pension and other postretirement benefit plans will be delayed until safe harbor statement from time to time  information provided by us  including but not limited to statements in this report  or other statements made by or on our behalf  may contain forward looking information within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of such statements involve a number of risks  uncertainties and contingencies  many of which are beyond our control  which may cause actual results  performance or achievements to differ materially from those anticipated 
set forth below are important factors that could cause our results  performance or achievements to differ materially from those in any forward looking statements made by us or on our behalf 
factors related to our business generally our business is cyclical and the recent decline in demand in the electronic component industry may resume and may become more pronounced 
we and others in the electronic and semiconductor component industry have for the past several years experienced a decline in product demand on a global basis  resulting in order cancellations and deferrals  lower average selling prices  and a material and adverse impact on our results of operations 
this decline was primarily attributable to a slowing of growth in the personal computer and cellular telephone product markets 
we have seen indications of improvements in the economy and electronic and semiconductor component industry and expect improvements in however  such improvements in the economy and the electronic and semiconductor component industry may not materialize 
the slowdown may resume and may become more pronounced 
a slowdown in demand  as well as recessionary trends in the global economy  makes it more difficult for us to predict our future sales  which also makes it more difficult to manage our operations  and could adversely impact our results of operations 
we have incurred and may continue to incur restructuring costs 
to remain competitive  particularly when business conditions are difficult  we attempt to reduce our cost structure through restructuring activities 
this includes acquisition related restructuring  where we attempt to streamline the operations of companies we acquire and achieve synergies between our acquisitions and our existing business 
it also includes restructuring our existing businesses  where we seek to eliminate redundant facilities and staff positions and move operations  where possible  to jurisdictions with lower labor costs 
in  we recorded restructuring costs of approximately million related to acquisitions and million related to our existing businesses 
we incurred approximately million of additional restructuring and severance costs in and expect to continue to incur such expenses during in the past we have grown through acquisitions but this may not continue 
our long term historical growth in revenues and net earnings has resulted in large part from our strategy of expansion through acquisitions 
we cannot assure you  however  that we will identify or successfully complete transactions with suitable acquisition candidates in the future 
we also cannot assure you that acquisitions that we complete in the future will be successful 
if an acquired business fails to operate as anticipated or cannot be successfully integrated with our other businesses  our results of operations  enterprise value  market value and prospects could all be materially and adversely affected 
our debt levels have recently increased  which could adversely affect the perception in the financial markets of our financial condition 
our outstanding debt increased from approximately million at the end of to approximately million at the end of the marketplace could react negatively to our current debt levels which in turn could affect our share price and also make it more difficult for us to obtain financing in the future 
in june  holders of our liquid yield option tm notes lyons will have the right to put these notes to us at an aggregate price of approximately million 
we believe that  if necessary  we will have adequate cash resources to finance the purchase of any lyons that are put to us 
also  we may elect to pay all or part of the purchase price for the lyons that are put to us in shares of our common stock 
nevertheless  our obligation to purchase the lyons in june could be a cause of concern in the financial markets 
to remain successful  we must continue to innovate 
our future operating results are dependent on our ability to continually develop  introduce and market new and innovative products  to modify existing products  to respond to technological change and to customize certain products to meet customer requirements 
there are numerous risks inherent in this process  including the risks that we will be unable to anticipate the direction of technological change or that we will be unable to develop and market new products and applications in a timely fashion to satisfy customer demands 
if this occurs  we could lose customers and experience adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations 
future acquisitions could require us to issue additional indebtedness or equity 
if we were to undertake a substantial acquisition for cash  the acquisition would likely need to be financed in part through bank borrowings or the issuance of public or private debt 
this acquisition financing would likely decrease our ratio of earnings to fixed charges and adversely affect other leverage criteria 
under our existing credit facility  we are required to obtain the lenders consent for certain additional debt financing and to comply with other covenants including the application of specific financial ratios 
we are also restricted from paying cash dividends on our capital stock 
we cannot assure you that the necessary acquisition financing would be available to us on acceptable terms when required 
if we were to undertake an acquisition for equity  the acquisition may have a dilutive effect on the interests of the holders of our common stock 
our results are sensitive to raw material availability  quality and cost 
many of our products require the use of raw materials that are produced in only a limited number of regions around the world  may be available from only a limited number of suppliers  and may be subject to price volatility 
we are a major consumer of the world s annual production of tantalum 
tantalum  a metal purchased in powder or wire form  is the principal material used in the manufacture of tantalum capacitors 
there are currently three major suppliers that process tantalum ore into capacitor grade tantalum powder 
we also utilize palladium  a metal used to produce multi layered ceramic capacitors  which is currently found primarily in south africa and russia 
palladium is a commodity product subject to price volatility 
our results of operations may be materially and adversely affected if we have difficulty obtaining these raw materials  the quality of available raw materials deteriorates or there are significant price increases for these raw materials 
for periods in which the prices of these raw materials are rising  we may be unable to pass on the increased cost to our customers which would result in decreased margins for the products in which they are used 
for periods in which the prices are declining  we may be required to write down our inventory carrying cost of these raw materials  since we record our inventory at the lower of cost or market 
depending on the extent of the difference between market price and our carrying cost  this write down could have a material adverse effect on our net earnings 
we recorded write downs of our tantalum inventory in these years of million  million  and million in   and respectively  and write downs of our palladium inventory in these years of million  million  and million  respectively 
also  we took charges against our contractual commitments to purchase tantalum of million and million in and  respectively 
from time to time there have been short term market shortages of raw materials 
while these shortages have not historically adversely affected our ability to increase production of products containing tantalum and palladium  they have historically resulted in higher raw material costs for us 
we cannot assure you that any of these market shortages in the future would not adversely affect our ability to increase production  particularly during periods of growing demand for our products 
our backlog is subject to customer cancellation 
as of december   our backlog was million 
many of the orders that comprise our backlog may be canceled by our customers without penalty 
our customers may on occasion double and triple order components from multiple sources to ensure timely delivery when backlog is particularly long 
they often cancel orders when business is weak and inventories are excessive  a situation that we have experienced in the recent economic slowdown 
therefore  we cannot be certain the amount of our backlog does not exceed the level of orders that will ultimately be delivered 
our results of operations could be adversely impacted if customers cancel a material portion of orders in our backlog 
we face intense competition in our business  and we market our products to an increasingly concentrated group of customers 
our business is highly competitive worldwide  with low transportation costs and few import barriers 
we compete principally on the basis of product quality and reliability  availability  customer service  technological innovation  timely delivery and price 
the electronics components industry has become increasingly concentrated and globalized in recent years and our major competitors  some of which are larger than us  have significant financial resources and technological capabilities 
our customers have become increasingly concentrated in recent years  and as a result  their buying power has increased and they have had greater ability to negotiate favorable pricing 
this trend has adversely affected our average selling prices  particularly for commodity components 
we may not have adequate facilities to satisfy future increases in demand for our products 
our business is cyclical and in periods of a rising economy  we may experience intense demand for our products 
during such periods  we may have difficulty expanding our manufacturing to satisfy demand 
factors which could limit such expansion include delays in procurement of manufacturing equipment  shortages of skilled personnel and capacity constraints at our facilities 
if we are unable to meet our customers requirements and our competitors sufficiently expand production  we could lose customers and or market share 
this loss could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
future changes in our environmental liability and compliance obligations may harm our ability to operate or increase costs 
our manufacturing operations  products and or product packaging are subject to environmental laws and regulations governing air emissions  wastewater discharges  the handling  disposal and remediation of hazardous substances  wastes and certain chemicals used or generated in our manufacturing processes  employee health and safety labeling or other notifications with respect to the content or other aspects of our processes  products or packaging  restrictions on the use of certain materials in or on design aspects of our products or product packaging and responsibility for disposal of products or product packaging 
we establish reserves for specifically identified potential environmental liabilities which we believe are adequate 
nevertheless  we often unavoidably inherit certain pre existing environmental liabilities  generally based on successor liability doctrines 
although we have never been involved in any environmental matter that has had a material adverse impact on our overall operations  there can be no assurance that in connection with any past or future acquisition we will not be obligated to address environmental matters that could have a material adverse impact on our operations 
in addition  more stringent environmental regulations may be enacted in the future  and we cannot presently determine the modifications  if any  in our operations that any such future regulations might require  or the cost of compliance with these regulations 
in order to resolve liabilities at various sites  we have entered into various administrative orders and consent decrees  some of which may be  under certain conditions  reopened or subject to renegotiations 
our products may experience a reduction in product classification levels under various military specifications 
we have qualified certain of our products under various military specifications  approved and monitored by the united states defense electronic supply center  and under certain european military specifications 
these products are assigned certain classification levels 
in order to maintain the classification level of a product  we must continuously perform tests on the product and the results of these tests must be reported to governmental agencies 
if any of our products fails to meet the requirements of the applicable classification level  that product s classification may be reduced to a lower level 
a decrease in the classification level for any of our products with a military application could have an adverse impact on the net sales and earnings attributable to that product 
factors relating to vishay s operations outside the united states we obtain substantial benefits by operating in israel  but these benefits may not continue 
we have increased our operations in israel over the past several years 
the low tax rates in israel applicable to earnings of our operations in that country  compared to the rates in the united states  have had the effect of increasing our net earnings  although this was not the case in and also  we have benefited from employment incentive grants made by the israeli government 
recently  the israeli government suspended payment on one of these grants after we were forced to lay off a significant number of employees as a result of the current economic downturn 
although we reached agreement with the israeli government to resume payment on this grant  there can be no assurance that we will maintain our eligibility for this or other existing project grants 
there can also be no assurance in the future the israeli government will continue to offer new grant and tax incentive programs applicable to us or that  if it does  such programs will provide the same level of benefits we have historically received or that we will continue to be eligible to take advantage of them 
any significant increase in the israeli tax rates or reduction or elimination of the israeli grant programs that have benefited us could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
we attempt to improve profitability by operating in countries in which labor costs are low  but the shift of operations to these regions may entail considerable expense 
our strategy is aimed at achieving significant production cost savings through the transfer and expansion of manufacturing operations to and in countries with lower production costs  such as israel  mexico  portugal  the czech republic  malaysia  the republic of china taiwan and the people s republic of china 
in this process  we may experience under utilization of certain plants and factories in high labor cost regions and capacity constraints in plants and factories located in low labor cost regions 
this under utilization may result initially in production inefficiencies and higher costs 
these costs include those associated with compensation in connection with work force reductions and plant closings in the higher labor cost regions  and start up expenses  manufacturing and construction delays  and increased depreciation costs in connection with the initiation or expansion of production in lower labor cost regions 
as we implement transfers of certain of our operations we may experience strikes or other types of labor unrest as a result of lay offs or termination of our employees in high labor cost countries 
we are subject to the risks of political  economic and military instability in countries outside the united states in which we operate 
we have operations outside the united states  and approximately of our revenues during were derived from sales to customers outside the united states 
some of the countries in which we operate have in the past experienced and may continue to experience political  economic and military instability or unrest 
these conditions could have an adverse impact on our ability to operate in these regions and  depending on the extent and severity of these conditions  could materially and adversely affect our overall financial condition and operating results 
in particular  current tensions in the middle east could adversely affect our business operations in israel and elsewhere 
our business was affected by the outbreak of sars in and the effects of that outbreak may linger 
the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome  or sars  that began in the people s republic of china adversely affected our business during the first six months of  particularly in asia where we derived approximately and of our revenue in and  respectively 
this impact included disruptions in the operations of our customers  a slowdown in customer orders and reduced sales in certain end markets 
if an outbreak of sars or like disease were to recur on a comparable scale in asia  we could experience similar disruptions to our business 
general economic and business factors in addition to the factors relating specifically to our business  a variety of other factors relating to general conditions could cause actual results  performance  or achievements to differ materially from those expressed in any of our forward looking statements 
these factors include o overall economic and business conditions  o competitive factors in the industries in which we conduct our business  o changes in governmental regulation  o changes in tax requirements  including tax rate changes  new tax laws  and revised tax law interpretations  o changes in generally accepted accounting principles or interpretations of those principles by governmental agencies and self regulatory groups  o interest rate fluctuations  foreign currency rate fluctuations  and other capital market conditions  and o economic and political conditions in international markets  including governmental changes and restrictions on the ability to transfer capital across borders 
also  we operate in a continually changing business environment  and new factors emerge from time to time 
other unknown and unpredictable factors also could have material adverse effects on our future results  performance  or achievements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk disclosure our cash flows and earnings are subject to fluctuations resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
we manage our exposure to these market risks through internally established policies and procedures and  when deemed appropriate  through the use of derivative financial instruments 
our policies do not allow speculation in derivative instruments for profit or execution of derivative instrument contracts for which there are no underlying exposures 
we do not use financial instruments for trading purposes and we are not a party to any leveraged derivatives 
we monitor our underlying market risk exposures on an ongoing basis and believe that we can modify or adapt our hedging strategies as needed 
we are exposed to changes in us dollar libor interest rates on our floating rate revolving credit facility 
at december   there were no amounts outstanding under this facility 
on a selective basis  we from time to time enter into interest rate swap or cap agreements to reduce the potential negative impact increases in interest rates could have on our outstanding variable rate debt
