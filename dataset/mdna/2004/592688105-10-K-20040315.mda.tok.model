item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under results of operations by operating segment for detailed results by segment and geographic region 
we manufacture a wide variety of precision instruments and provide value added services to our customers 
our principal products and principal services are set forth above 
given the inherently global nature of our business  the above description of our products  customers and distribution  sales and services  research and development  manufacturing and other elements of our business apply  for the most part  to each of our segments 
in some instances particular products are targeted for particular segments but none of these are material in nature to the entire business or an individual segment 
backlog  seasonality our manufacturing turnaround time is generally sufficiently short so as to permit us to manufacture to fill orders for most of our products  which helps to limit inventory costs 
backlog is therefore generally a function of requested customer delivery dates and is typically no longer than one to two months 
our business has historically experienced a slight amount of seasonal variation  particularly the high end laboratory instruments business 
traditionally  sales in the first quarter are slightly lower than  and sales in the fourth quarter are slightly higher than  sales in the second and third quarters 
fourth quarter sales have historically generated approximately of our sales 
this trend has a somewhat greater effect on income from operations than on net sales because fixed costs are spread evenly across all quarters 
employees as of december   we had approximately  employees throughout the world  including approximately  in europe   in north and south america  and  in asia and other countries 
we believe our employee relations are good  and we have not suffered any material employee work stoppage or strike during the last five years  except for a strike in early at our bethune  france facility  which has been closed 
labor unions do not represent a meaningful number of our employees 
intellectual property we hold over  patents and trademarks  primarily in the united states  switzerland  germany  the united kingdom  france  japan and china 
our products generally incorporate a wide variety of technological innovations  some of which are protected by patents of various durations 
products are generally not protected as a whole by individual patents  and as a result  no one patent or group of related patents is material to our business 
we have numerous trademarks  including the mettler toledo name and logo  which are material to our business 
we regularly protect against infringement of our intellectual property 
regulation our products are subject to various regulatory standards and approvals by weights and measures regulatory authorities 
all of our electrical components are subject to electrical safety standards 
we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable regulations 
approvals are required to ensure our instruments do not impermissibly influence other instruments  and are themselves not affected by other instruments 
in addition  some of our products are used in legal for trade applications  in which prices based on weight are calculated  and for which specific weights and measures approvals are required 
although there are a large number of regulatory agencies across our markets  there is an increasing trend toward harmonization of standards  and weights and measures regulation is harmonized across the european union 
our products may also be subject to special requirements depending on the end user and market 
for example  laboratory customers are typically subject to good laboratory practices glp  industrial customers to good manufacturing practices gmp  pharmaceutical customers to us food and drug administration fda regulations  and customers in food processing industries may be subject to hazard analysis and critical control point haccp regulations 
products used in hazardous environments may also be subject to special requirements 
environmental matters we are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate 
we own or lease a number of properties and manufacturing facilities around the world 
like many of our competitors  we have incurred  and will continue to incur  capital and operating expenditures and other costs in complying with such laws and regulations in both the united states and abroad 
we are currently involved in  or have potential liability with respect to  the remediation of past contamination in certain of our facilities in both the united states and abroad 
our subsidiary  hi speed checkweigher  is subject to an administrative consent order from the new jersey department of environmental protection that provides for the remediation of a former manufacturing site in landing  new jersey 
under the terms of the stock purchase agreement between gei international corporation and the predecessor to hi speed  gei assumed all responsibility for the administrative consent order and to date has performed and paid for all action it requires 
in addition  certain of our present and former facilities have or had been in operation for many decades and  over such time  some of these facilities may have used substances or generated and disposed of wastes which are or may be considered hazardous 
it is possible that these sites  as well as disposal sites owned by third parties to which we have sent wastes  may in the future be identified and become the subject of remediation 
accordingly  although we believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental requirements and to date we have not incurred material expenditures in connection with environmental matters  it is possible that we could become subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future that could result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations  or competitive position in the market 
competition our markets are highly competitive 
weighing and analytical instruments markets are fragmented both geographically and by application  particularly the industrial and food retailing markets 
as a result  we face numerous regional or specialized competitors  many of which are well established in their markets 
in addition  some of our competitors are divisions of larger companies with potentially greater financial and other resources than our own 
taken together  the competitive forces present in our markets can impair our operating margins in certain product lines and geographic markets 
we expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their products and to introduce new products with competitive prices 
although we believe that we have technological and other competitive advantages over many of our competitors  we may not be able to realize and maintain these advantages 
these advantages include our worldwide market leadership positions  our global brand and reputation  our track record of technological innovation  our comprehensive  high quality solution offering  our global sales and service offering  our large installed base of weighing instruments  and the fact that our revenue base is diversified by geographic region  product range and customer 
to remain competitive  we must continue to invest in research and development  sales and marketing and customer service and support 
we cannot be sure that we will have sufficient resources to continue to make these investments or that we will be successful in identifying  developing and maintaining any competitive advantages 
we believe that the principal competitive factors in developed markets for purchasing decisions are the product itself  application support  service support and price 
in emerging markets  where there is greater demand for less sophisticated products  price is a more important factor than in developed markets 
competition in the us laboratory market is also influenced by the presence of large distributors that sell not only our products but those of our competitors as well

see note to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our audited consolidated financial statements 
overview we operate a global business  with net sales that are diversified by geographic region  product range and customer 
we hold leading positions worldwide in many of our markets and attribute this leadership to several factors  including the strength of our brand name and reputation  our comprehensive solution offering  the quality of our global sales and service network  our continued investment in product development  our pursuit of technology leadership and our focus on capitalizing on opportunities in developed and emerging markets 
net sales in local currencies were flat in  compared to an increase of in as discussed in acquisition of rainin instrument below  includes the benefit of the rainin acquisition 
during  we continued to face a challenging world economy and political environment with conditions generally strong in asia  improving in the united states but remaining weak in europe 
specifically  we were affected by the unexpected softness in our biotech and pharmaceutical biopharma end user markets  particularly in our higher price point drug discovery product line 
biopharma firms are facing short term pressures such as new drug approval activity  heightened price regulation and industry consolidation 
however  we believe that the long term fundamentals of this market are strong  as demonstrated by compound annual growth rate in research and development spending over the last years 
an aging world population with more discretionary healthcare spending capacity drives the need for biopharma companies to improve both scale and productivity in new drug research and development  which often requires products that mitigate bottlenecks in chemistry oriented solutions  which mettler toledo can provide 
in our industrial markets  there is an accelerating trend of multinational companies investing in production in china to take advantage of cost savings 
although this provides a significant opportunity for our china operations  this manufacturing shift has a negative impact on our industrial related businesses in the us and europe 
in our retail end markets  spending patterns continued to be suppressed in europe after the significant euro conversion related investments by customers in and weak consumer confidence in major european economies 
in our us retail business  results were down relative to strong project activity 
in spite of these external challenges  we continued to build for the future by investing in strong new marketing programs to further penetrate our markets and leading customers  turning our record r d investments into new product launches  growing our chinese operations into our third largest global market  expanding our unique services offering and improving our cost structure 
looking forward to  we anticipate a gradual improvement in our customers spending patterns 
in asia we expect further strong economic growth  and in the us we expect the economic improvements experienced over the last several months to continue 
we remain concerned however about europe  where the major economies face low consumer confidence  a strong euro and lack of structural government reforms 
in terms of our key earnings growth drivers for  we expect to benefit from the introduction of new products 
this follows our significant investment in research and development over the last few years  particularly in respect of our industrial and laboratory end markets 
we also expect continued growth opportunities for most of our product lines in china  as our global customers develop in this region  and as we expand our geographic sales and service coverage 
we also anticipate further sales growth in our service business as we continue to extend our regulatory and compliance service offerings 
finally  we expect to generate a further million incremental savings from our cost reduction programs in more generally  we believe our sales growth over the next several years will come primarily from our solutions approach to the principal challenges facing our customer base 
these include the need for increased efficiency for example  in accelerating time to market for new products  achieving better yields  improving work processes and outsourcing non core activities  the desire to integrate information captured by instruments into management information systems  the drive for ever higher quality of our customers products and services  including the need to adhere to stringent regulatory and industry standards  and the move towards globalization in all major customer groups 
acquisitions are also an integral part of our growth strategy 
our acquisitions leverage our global sales and service network  respected brand name  extensive distribution channels and technological leadership 
we are particularly attracted to acquisitions that leverage these attributes or increase our solutions capability 
in addition  we continue to focus on the following end markets drug discovery  process analytics  food and drug packaging  and transportation and logistics 
non gaap financial measures we supplement our us gaap results with non gaap financial measures 
the principal non gaap financial measure we use is adjusted operating income 
we define adjusted operating income as gross profit less research and development  selling general and administrative expenses and restructuring charges  before amortization  interest  other charges and taxes 
the most directly comparable us gaap financial measure is net earnings 
we believe that adjusted operating income is important supplemental information for investors 
adjusted operating income is used internally as the principal profit measurement by our segments in their reporting to management 
we use this measure because it excludes amortization  interest  other charges and taxes  which are not allocated to the segments 
on a consolidated basis  we also believe adjusted operating income is an important supplemental method of measuring profitability 
it is used internally by senior management for measuring profitability  setting performance targets for managers and has historically been used as one of the means of publicly providing guidance on possible future results 
we also believe that adjusted operating income is an important performance measure because it provides a measure of comparability to other companies with different capital or legal structures which accordingly may be subject to disparate interest rates and effective tax rates  and to companies which may incur different amortization expenses or impairment charges related to intangible assets 
adjusted operating income is used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with us gaap 
adjusted operating income is not intended to represent operating income under us gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net earnings as an indicator of our performance because of the following limitations 
limitations of our non gaap measure  adjusted operating income our non gaap measure  adjusted operating income  has certain material limitations as follows o it does not include interest expense 
because we have borrowed money to finance some of our operations  interest is a necessary and ongoing part of our costs and has assisted us in generating revenue 
therefore any measure that excludes interest expense has material limitations  o it does not include taxes 
because payment of taxes is a necessary and ongoing part of our operations  any measure that excludes taxes has material limitations  o it excludes amortization expense and other charges 
because these items are recurring  any measure that excludes them has material limitations 
adjusted operating income should not be relied upon to the exclusion of us gaap financial measures  but reflects an additional measure of comparability and means of viewing aspects of our operations that  when viewed together with our us gaap results and the accompanying reconciliation to net earnings  provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business 
because adjusted operating income is not standardized  it may not be possible to compare with other companies non gaap financial measures having the same or a similar name 
we strongly encourage investors to review our financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure 
our adjusted operating income increased from million in to million in this performance was achieved while we continued to invest in product development and in our distribution and manufacturing infrastructure 
adjusted operating income includes restructuring charges of million in  million in and million in these charges are described more fully below 
a reconciliation of adjusted operating income to net earnings for to is included in results of operations below 
acquisition of rainin instrument in november  we acquired rainin instrument  based in california  usa 
rainin is a leading manufacturer of pipetting solutions used in pharmaceutical  biotech and medical research applications 
rainin has a market leadership position in north america  a truly differentiating technology and a broad patent portfolio in areas like electronic pipetting  ergonomic designs for pipettes and tip designs 
this acquisition further broadens our offering of instruments and solutions to the life sciences market and positions us to bring greater value to our customers 
assuming we acquired rainin as of the beginning of  the acquisition would have added sales of approximately million  adjusted operating income of approximately million  and diluted earnings per share of negative for on a pro forma basis 
cost reduction programs in  we recorded a restructuring charge of million million after tax associated primarily with headcount reductions and manufacturing transfers 
this charge comprised primarily severance and other related benefits and costs of exiting facilities  including lease termination costs and the write down of impaired assets 
as further described in note to our audited consolidated financial statements  during the three months ended june  we recorded a restructuring charge of million million after tax which comprised severance  asset write downs and other exit costs  primarily related to headcount reductions and manufacturing transfers 
as a result of these actions  we expect to eliminate approximately million of costs from the business 
we estimate that approximately million of these savings were realized in  million in  and a further million is expected in as noted in previous filings  in accordance with us gaap  the charge taken in the second quarter of related to the exit of our french manufacturing facility was limited to the minimum contractual payment required by french law 
during the three months ended march   we recorded a restructuring charge of million million after tax  related to the final union settlement on the closure of this facility 
this charge comprises the additional employee related costs resulting from final settlement of the social plan negotiated with the french workers council during the first quarter of we assess our accrual for restructuring activities on an ongoing basis 
during the three months ended september   we recorded a reduction in the restructuring accrual of million  included within other charges income  net  as a result of lower employee related charges than originally anticipated 
also  a restructuring charge of million was recorded during the three months ended september   related to an extension of manufacturing consolidation activities 
this charge comprised severance of million  included within other charges income  net  and inventory write downs of million  included within cost of sales 
the company s aforementioned restructuring programs and related accruals were substantially completed at december  results of operations the following table sets forth certain items from our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december   and amounts in thousands 
net sales    cost of sales    gross profit    research and development    selling  general and administrative    amortization    interest expense    other charges  net a    earnings before taxes    net earnings    adjusted operating income after restructuring charges b    a reconciliation of adjusted operating income to net earnings for the years ended december follows adjusted operating income after restructuring charges b    amortization    interest expense    other charges  net excluding restructuring charges provision for taxes    net earnings    a other charges  net consists primarily of charges related to our restructuring programs  interest income  gains losses from foreign currency transactions  gains losses from sales of assets and other items 
the  and amounts include restructuring charges of   and  respectively  related primarily to headcount reductions and manufacturing transfers 
b see non gaap financial measures above 
adjusted operating income is defined as gross profit less research and development  selling  general and administrative expenses and restructuring charges  before amortization  interest expense and other charges 
restructuring charges that have been included are the costs set forth in note a above 
results of operations consolidated net sales net sales were  million for the year ended december   compared to  million in and  million in in local currencies  this represents flat sales for and an increase of in the fluctuation of the us dollar versus our major trading currencies increased us dollar reported sales growth in and net sales in us dollars increased in  and in sales were affected by the unexpected softness in our biopharma end user market  particularly in our higher price point drug discovery product line 
spending patterns in our retail end markets continued to be suppressed in europe after the significant euro conversion related investments by customers in and down in the us relative to strong project activity 
these trends were partially mitigated by solid results in our industrial markets  particularly for packaging  and transportation and logistics products 
as discussed in acquisition of rainin instrument above  results for include the benefit of the rainin acquisition 
however  we also experienced a sharp decline in sales of our european retail products in  as a result of the euro conversion related investments by customers in excluding the impact of european retail products in both and  consolidated local currency sales growth would be in a discussion of sales by operating segment is included below 
as described in note to our consolidated financial statements  our net sales comprise product sales of precision instruments  and related services 
service revenues are primarily derived from regulatory compliance qualification  calibration  certification and repair services  much of which is provided under contracts  as well as sales of spare parts 
net sales of products declined in local currencies in and increased in  whereas service revenue including spare parts increased and in and respectively 
the higher service growth was generated by our consultative based value added services approach  including the provision of instrument qualification and asset management services and training  rather than via increased sales of spare parts 
gross profit gross profit as a percentage of net sales was for  compared to for and for improvements in the margin over the two year period reflect the benefits from our cost rationalization and product transfer initiatives  partially offset by adverse currency impacts 
on a constant currency basis relative to the prior year  gross margin as a percentage of net sales was for gross profit as a percentage of net sales for products was for  compared to for and for these improvements also reflect the benefits from our cost rationalization initiatives  offset by adverse currency impacts 
on a constant currency basis relative to the prior year  product gross margin as a percentage of net sales was for gross profit as a percentage of net sales for services including spare parts was for  compared to for and for the increase in the margin over the two years reflects the expansion of higher margin regulatory compliance service sales and improved productivity 
on a constant currency basis relative to the prior year  service gross margin as a percentage of net sales was for research and development and selling  general and administrative expenses research and development expenses as a percentage of net sales was for  compared to for and in in local currencies  research and development expenses increased in and in compared to the previous year 
the increase in is principally due to investments in our new laboratory  and transportation and logistics products 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to for  compared to for and for in local currencies  and adjusting for acquisitions  selling  general and administrative expenses increased in and in the increase in is principally due to higher medical plan costs in the us and higher marketing costs related to the roll out of our new laboratory products 
other charges income  net other charges income  net were million in  compared to million in and million in the  and amounts include the restructuring charges of million million after tax  million million after tax and million million after tax  comprising severance  asset write downs and other exit costs primarily related to headcount reductions and manufacturing transfers  described more fully in cost reduction programs above 
interest expense and taxes interest expense was million for  compared to million for both and the decrease in is principally due to reduced borrowing rates and lower average borrowings over the year 
in  reduced interest rates were offset by higher average borrowings used to fund the rainin acquisition 
the provision for taxes is based upon our effective tax rate for the related periods 
this rate was for  for and for the reduction from to reflects the effects of a restructuring of our european operations and other tax initiatives 
in addition  during the three months ended june  we recorded a one time tax gain of million related to the completion of a tax reorganization program and related tax audits 
during the fourth quarter of  we began a program of repatriating foreign subsidiary earnings to the united states in a tax efficient manner 
this program resulted in a repatriation of million of foreign earnings during and a further million in in addition  this program will result in the repatriation of million of foreign earnings over the next few years 
the repatriation of million created additional us taxable income resulting in the utilization of certain historical tax attributes related to our us operations and release of the related us federal deferred tax valuation allowance 
the repatriation of million also utilized certain historical us tax attributes 
the tax effects related to the future repatriation of million are also accrued 
earnings before taxes and net earnings earnings before taxes were million for  compared to million in and million in net earnings were million for  compared to million in and million in these results include the restructuring charge of million million after tax in  the restructuring charge of million million after tax and the one time tax gain of million in  and the restructuring charge of million million after tax in supplemental data adjusted operating income see non gaap financial measures above 
adjusted operating income gross profit less research and development  selling  general and administrative expenses and restructuring charges  before amortization  interest expense and other charges increased to million  or of net sales  for  compared to million  or of net sales in and million  or of net sales in adjusted operating income includes restructuring charges of million in  million in and million in in  adjusted operating income increased primarily as a result of the lower restructuring charge relative to the related benefits of our cost rationalization and product transfer initiatives and strong sales and manufacturing productivity improvements in china were offset by higher research and development costs and selling costs principally related to investments in new products  as well as higher medical plan costs in the us in  adjusted operating income decreased primarily due to recording a higher restructuring charge relative to and the aforementioned volume impact on european retail following the euro conversion related investments by customers in  partially offset by the benefit of the rainin acquisition 
a discussion of adjusted operating income by operating segment is included below 
results of operations by operating segment principal us operations net sales to external customers in our principal us operations segment decreased in  compared to an increase of in although not as significant as in europe  we experienced slightly lower sales in our laboratory business in the us in  due to reduced spending in our biopharma end market 
in addition  retail sales declined relative to strong project activity in these trends were partially offset by increased sales of packaging products 
the increase in is principally due to the rainin acquisition 
approximately of rainin s operations were based in the americas in adjusted operating income increased million in our principal us operations in  compared to an increase of million in the increase in is due primarily to the restructuring charge recorded in  of which million relates to this segment 
adjusted operating income in was also impacted by lower sales of laboratory and food retailing products  combined with higher medical plan costs relative to  partially offset by the impact of increased sales of packaging products and improved service profitability 
the increase in is due primarily to the rainin acquisition and improvements in service profitability partially offset by the impact of restructuring charges of million in and million in other western european operations including france  uk  italy and spain net sales in local currencies to external customers in our other western european operations segment decreased in  compared to a decrease of in the reduced sales in were principally due to lower spending in our biopharma and retail end markets 
these trends were partially mitigated by solid results for packaging and transportation and logistics products 
our european sales trends in were primarily the result of the decline in sales of our european retail products following the significant euro conversion related investments by customers in adjusted operating income increased million in our other western european operations segment in  compared to a decrease of million in the increase in is principally the result of a lower restructuring charge of million recorded in  compared to million recorded in also benefited from the related benefits of our cost rationalization and product transfer initiatives  partially offset by the impact of declines in sales of laboratory and retail products 
the decrease in was principally due to the aforementioned volume impact on european retail following the euro related investments by customers in  as well as the impact of the restructuring charges of million in and million in principal central european operations including germany net sales in local currencies to external customers in our principal central european operations segment decreased in  compared to a decrease of in similar to our other western european operations segment  the decline in was principally due to weakness in our laboratory and retail end markets  partially offset by solid results for packaging and transportation and logistics products 
the decline in was principally due to a reduction in post euro conversion retail sales 
adjusted operating income increased million in our principal central european operations segment in  compared to a decrease of million in the increase in is principally the result of the lower restructuring charge recorded in  of which million relates to this segment  and the related benefits from our cost rationalization and product transfer initiatives  partially offset by the impact of declines in sales of laboratory and retail products  while suffered from the aforementioned volume impact on european retail 
swiss r d and manufacturing operations net sales in local currencies to external customers in our swiss r d and manufacturing operations segment decreased in  compared to a decrease of in these declines are principally the result of reduced sales in our laboratory markets 
adjusted operating income decreased million in our swiss r d and manufacturing operations segment in  compared to a decrease of million in these declines were principally as a result of lower sales in our laboratory markets  and increased research and development costs in both years  as well as higher marketing costs in related to our new laboratory product launches 
asia as disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements  continued growth resulted in the company s reporting units in asia exceeding the quantitative threshold for disclosure as a separate operating segment during the three months ended december  net sales in local currencies to external customers in asia increased in  compared to an increase of in these results reflect strong sales performance in china for most of our product lines  partially offset by declines in japan 
as well as expanding our manufacturing capacity in china  we have also significantly increased our local sales and service resources in asia 
for example  our headcount in asia increased by to  in selling  general and administrative expenses increased in local currencies in asia in  reflecting the additional investment in this region and the strong sales performance 
adjusted operating income increased million in asia in  compared to an increase of million in  principally due to stronger sales and improved manufacturing productivity in china  partially offset by declines  primarily in japan 
other net sales in local currencies to external customers in our other operating segment increased in  compared to an increase of in these results reflect modest sales growth in countries such as russia and australia  and in eastern europe  partially offset by a decline in sales of our drug discovery products 
adjusted operating income increased million in our other operating segment in  compared to a decrease of million in these results reflect the impact of restructuring charges  offset by the impact of declines in sales of our drug discovery products 
in addition  was also negatively affected by the economic downturn in latin america 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity is our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operating activities to meet our obligations and commitments 
in addition  liquidity includes the ability to obtain appropriate financing 
therefore  liquidity cannot be considered separately from capital resources that consist of current and potentially available funds for use in achieving long range business objectives and meeting debt service commitments 
currently  our liquidity needs arise primarily from working capital requirements  capital expenditures  and acquisitions 
cash provided by operating activities totaled million in  compared to million in and million in the increase in resulted principally from improved management of operating assets and liabilities  partially offset by higher restructuring and tax payments 
included in cash provided by operating activities are voluntary incremental pension contributions of million to the us pension plan and million to the uk pension plan 
included in cash provided by operating activities is a voluntary contribution of million to the us pension plan 
in  similar to previous years  we expect to make normal employer pension contributions of million 
cash provided by operating activities also includes payments for restructuring and certain acquisition integration activities 
these amounts totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
during  we spent approximately million on acquisitions  including additional consideration related to earn out periods associated with acquisitions consummated in prior years 
the cash portions of these purchases were funded from cash generated from operations and additional borrowings 
we continue to explore potential acquisitions 
in connection with any acquisition  we may incur additional indebtedness 
in addition  the terms of certain of our acquisitions in and earlier years provide for possible additional earn out payments of up to million 
capital expenditures are a significant use of funds and are made primarily for machinery  equipment and the purchase and expansion of facilities 
our capital expenditures totaled million in  million in and million in capital expenditures in include spending of million associated with our new facility in china and in include spending of million associated with rainin s new facility in california 
we expect capital expenditures in to be slightly above we also expect capital expenditures to increase as our business grows  and to fluctuate as currency exchange rates change 
november refinancing on november   we closed a new five year million credit facility the million credit facility or the credit facility and completed the issuance of million seven year senior notes 
the proceeds from this refinancing were immediately used to repay all of the borrowings under our former credit agreement  which was then terminated 
credit facility agreement the million credit facility is provided by a group of financial institutions and has a bullet maturity in november it is not subject to any scheduled principal payments 
borrowings under the million credit facility bear interest at current market rates plus a margin which is based on our senior unsecured credit ratings currently bbb by standard poor s and baa by moody s  and is currently set at libor plus 
we must also pay utilization and facility fees that are tied to our credit ratings 
the million credit facility contains covenants including maintaining a ratio of debt to earnings before interest  tax  depreciation and amortization of less than to and an interest coverage ratio of more than to the new facility also places certain limitations on us including limiting the ability to grant liens or incur debt at a subsidiary level 
in addition  the million credit facility has several events of default including upon a change of control 
the credit facility is unsecured 
senior notes in november  we issued million of unsecured senior notes due november  the senior notes 
the senior notes rank equally with all our unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness 
interest is payable semi annually in may and november 
discount and issuance costs approximated million and are being amortized to interest expense over the seven year term of the senior notes 
at our option  the senior notes may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time at a redemption price equal to the greater of o the principal amount of the senior notes  or o the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon discounted to the redemption date on a semi annual basis at a comparable treasury rate plus a margin of the new seven year senior notes contain limitations on the ability to incur liens and enter into sale and leaseback transactions exceeding of our consolidated net worth 
at december   our consolidated debt  net of cash of million  was million 
in addition to the senior notes  we had borrowings of million under our credit facility and million under various other local arrangements 
also at december   we had million of availability remaining under the credit facility 
at december   approximately million of the borrowings under the credit facility and local working capital facilities were denominated in us dollars 
the balance of the borrowings under the credit facility and local working capital facilities were denominated in certain of our other principal trading currencies amounting to approximately million 
changes in exchange rates between the currencies in which we generate cash flow and the currencies in which our borrowings are denominated affect our liquidity 
in addition  because we borrow in a variety of currencies  our debt balances fluctuate due to changes in exchange rates 
at december   we are in compliance with all covenants set forth in our credit facility and senior notes agreements 
in addition  we do not have any downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity dates of our debt 
we currently believe that cash flow from operating activities  together with liquidity available under our credit facility and local working capital facilities  will be sufficient to fund currently anticipated working capital needs and capital spending requirements for at least several years  but there can be no assurance that this will be the case 
contractual obligations the following summarizes certain of our contractual obligations at december  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods 
we do not have significant outstanding letters of credit or other financial commitments 
payments due by period total less than year years years after years long term debt a    non cancelable operating leases b      purchase obligations c    total      a as described in note to the audited consolidated financial statements 
b as described in note to the audited consolidated financial statements 
c represents agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on the company 
we have purchase commitments for materials  supplies  services and fixed assets as part of the normal course of business 
due to the proprietary nature of many of our materials and processes  certain supply contracts contain penalty provisions 
we do not expect potential payments under these provisions to materially affect results of operations or financial condition 
this conclusion is based upon reasonably likely outcomes derived by reference to historical experience and current business plans 
share repurchase program on february   we announced a share repurchase program  commencing with an initial buyback of up to million over the two year period ending december  the repurchases will be made through open market transactions  and the timing will depend on the level of acquisition activity  business and market conditions  the stock price  trading restrictions and other factors 
we cannot assure you that we will repurchase shares representing the full value of the program over the two year period 
off balance sheet arrangements currently  we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that is material 
effect of currency on results of operations because we conduct operations in many countries  our operating income can be significantly affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
swiss franc denominated expenses represent a much greater percentage of our operating expenses than swiss franc denominated sales represent of our net sales 
in part  this is because most of our manufacturing costs in switzerland relate to products that are sold outside switzerland 
moreover  a substantial percentage of our research and development expenses  and general and administrative expenses are incurred in switzerland 
therefore  if the swiss franc strengthens against all or most of our major trading currencies eg  the eg dollar  the euro  other major european currencies and the japanese yen  our operating profit is reduced 
we also have significantly more sales in european currencies other than the swiss franc than we have expenses in those currencies 
therefore  when european currencies weaken against the us dollar and the swiss franc  it also decreases our operating profits 
accordingly  the swiss franc exchange rate to the euro is an important cross rate monitored by the company 
we estimate that a strengthening of the swiss franc against the euro would result in a decrease in our earnings before tax of million to million on an annual basis 
in addition to the effects of exchange rate movements on operating profits  our debt levels can fluctuate due to changes in exchange rates  particularly between the us dollar and the swiss franc 
based on our outstanding debt at december   we estimate that a weakening of the us dollar against the currencies in which our debt is denominated  would result in an increase of approximately million in the reported us dollar value of the debt 
taxes we are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions throughout the world 
our effective tax rate and tax liability will be affected by a number of factors  such as the amount of taxable income in particular jurisdictions  the tax rates in such jurisdictions  tax treaties between jurisdictions  the extent to which we transfer funds between jurisdictions  earnings repatriations between jurisdictions and changes in law 
generally  the tax liability for each taxpayer within the group is determined either i on a non consolidated non combined basis or ii on a consolidated combined basis only with other eligible entities subject to tax in the same jurisdiction  in either case without regard to the taxable losses of non consolidated non combined affiliated legal entities 
as a result  we may pay income taxes to certain jurisdictions even though on an overall basis we incur a net loss for the period 
our effective tax rates for the years ended december   and were approximately  and respectively  as described in interest expense and taxes above 
environmental matters we are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate 
we own or lease a number of properties and manufacturing facilities around the world 
like many of our competitors  we have incurred  and will continue to incur  capital and operating expenditures and other costs in complying with such laws and regulations in both the united states and abroad 
we are currently involved in  or have potential liability with respect to  the remediation of past contamination in certain of our facilities in both the united states and abroad 
our subsidiary  hi speed checkweigher  is subject to an administrative consent order from the new jersey department of environmental protection that provides for the remediation of a former manufacturing site in landing  new jersey 
under the terms of the stock purchase agreement between gei international corporation and the predecessor to hi speed  gei assumed all responsibility for the administrative consent order and to date has performed and paid for all action it requires 
in addition  certain of our present and former facilities have or had been in operation for many decades and  over such time  some of these facilities may have used substances or generated and disposed of wastes which are or may be considered hazardous 
it is possible that these sites  as well as disposal sites owned by third parties to which we have sent wastes  may in the future be identified and become the subject of remediation 
accordingly  although we believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental requirements and to date we have not incurred material expenditures in connection with environmental matters  it is possible that we could become subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future that could result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
inflation inflation can affect the costs of goods and services that we use 
the competitive environment in which we operate limits somewhat our ability to recover higher costs through increased selling prices 
moreover  there may be differences in inflation rates between countries in which we incur the major portion of our costs and other countries in which we sell products  which may limit our ability to recover increased costs 
we remain committed to operations in china and eastern europe  which have experienced inflationary conditions 
to date  inflationary conditions have not had a material effect on our operating results 
however  as our presence in china and eastern europe increases  these inflationary conditions could have a greater impact on our operating results 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have only limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and do not use them for trading purposes 
we have entered into foreign currency forward contracts to economically hedge short term intercompany balances with our international businesses and a portion of our swiss franc euro exposure on a monthly basis 
such contracts limit our exposure to both favorable and unfavorable currency fluctuations 
a sensitivity analysis to changes in the us dollar and swiss franc on these foreign currency denominated contracts indicates that if the us dollar and swiss franc uniformly worsened by against all of our currency exposures  the fair value of these instruments would decrease by million at december   as compared with million at december  any resulting changes in fair value would be offset by changes in the underlying hedged balance sheet position 
the sensitivity analysis assumes a parallel shift in foreign currency exchange rates 
the assumption that exchange rates change in parallel fashion may overstate the impact of changing exchange rates on assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency 
we also have other currency risks as described under effect of currency on results of operations above 
we have entered into certain interest rate swap agreements 
these contracts are more fully described in note to our audited consolidated financial statements 
the market value of these contracts as at december  and was million and negative million  respectively 
based on our agreements outstanding at december   a basis point increase in interest rates would result in a decrease in the net aggregate market value of these instruments of million  as compared with an increase of million at december  conversely  a basis point decrease in interest rates would result in a million increase in the net aggregate market value of these instruments  as compared with a net reduction of million at december  any change in fair value would not affect our consolidated statement of operations unless such agreements and the debt they hedge were prematurely settled 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our audited consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to pensions and other post retirement benefits  inventories  intangible assets  income taxes  revenue and warranty costs 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our audited consolidated financial statements 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note to our audited consolidated financial statements 
employee benefit plans the net periodic pension cost for and projected benefit obligation as at december  were million and million respectively for our us pension plans  and million and million respectively for our international pension plans 
the net periodic post retirement cost for and projected benefit obligation as at december  for our us post retirement medical benefit plan were million and million respectively 
pension and post retirement benefit plan expense and obligations are developed from assumptions in actuarial valuations 
these assumptions include the discount rate and expected return on plan assets 
in accordance with us gaap  actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods 
while management believes the assumptions used are appropriate  differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our plan obligations and future expense 
the expected rates of return on the various defined benefit pension plans assets are based on the asset allocation of each plan and the long term projected return of those assets  which represent a diversified mix of us and international corporate equities and government and corporate debt securities 
in april  we froze our us defined benefit pension plan and discontinued our retiree medical program for certain current and all future employees 
consequently  no significant future service costs will be incurred on these plans 
for  the average return on assets assumption was for the us plan and for the international plans 
a change in the rate of return of would impact annual benefit plan expense by approximately million after tax 
the discount rates for defined benefit and post retirement plans are set by benchmarking against high quality corporate bonds 
for  the average discount rate assumption was for the us plans and for the international plans  representing a weighted average of local rates in countries where such plans exist 
a change in the discount rate of would impact annual benefit plan expense by approximately million after tax 
in and  we made voluntary incremental funding payments of million and million respectively  to reduce the underfunded status of the us and us pension plans 
as a result  we do not expect to make any significant required pension funding payments  other than normal employer contributions  during the next two years 
however  if the equity markets do not mirror expected rates of return  in the future  we could be required to make additional cash funding payments or adjust the million additional minimum pension liability recorded at december  the company also has employee stock option plans which are accounted for under the intrinsic value recognition and measurement provisions of accounting principles opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and related interpretations 
as stock options have been issued with exercise prices equal to the market value of the underlying shares on the grant date  no compensation cost has resulted 
note to the audited consolidated financial statements provides supplemental information  including pro forma earnings and earnings per share  as if the company had accounted for options based on the fair value method prescribed by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
that methodology yields an estimate of fair value based in part on a number of management estimates  including future volatility and estimated option lives 
changes in these assumptions could significantly impact the estimated fair value of stock options 
inventory as at december   net inventories were million 
we record our inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value 
cost  which includes direct materials  labor and overhead  is generally determined using the first in  first out fifo method 
the estimated market value is based on assumptions for future demand and related pricing 
excess and obsolete reserves are established based on forecast usage  orders and technological obsolescence 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  reductions in the value of inventory may be required 
goodwill and other intangible assets as at december   our consolidated balance sheet included goodwill of million and other intangible assets of million 
our business acquisitions typically result in goodwill and other intangible assets  which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment expense that we will incur 
the determination of the value of such intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized  but are evaluated for impairment annually in the fourth quarter  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired 
the annual evaluation is based on valuation models that estimate fair value based on expected future cash flows and profitability projections 
in preparing the valuation models we consider a number of factors  including operating results  business plans  economic conditions  future cash flows  and transactions and market place data 
there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and our judgment in applying them to the impairment analyses 
the significant estimates and assumptions within our fair value models include sales growth  controllable cost growth  perpetual growth  effective tax rates and discount rates 
our assessments to date have indicated that there has been no impairment of these assets 
our drug discovery reporting unit is sensitive to changes in biopharma capital spending 
as a result of aforementioned trends in this market  drug discovery experienced a double digit decline in revenue and profitability during however  the fair value of the company s drug discovery reporting unit exceeded its carrying value of million as of september  and december  in accordance with the provisions of sfas  the company will monitor the fair value of this reporting unit closely to determine if the business plan is being achieved 
for example  we will monitor whether the forecasted benefits of our drug discovery cost reduction programs are being realized  including the program of manufacturing site rationalization currently in progress 
should any of these estimates or assumptions in the preceding paragraphs not be accurate  or should we incur lower than expected operating performance or cash flows  we may experience a triggering event that requires a new fair value assessment for our reporting units  possibly prior to the required annual assessment 
these types of events and resulting analysis could result in impairment charges for goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets if the fair value estimate declines below the carrying value 
our amortization expense related to intangible assets with finite lives may materially change should our estimates of their useful lives change 
income taxes income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect management s assessment of actual future taxes to be paid on items reflected in the financial statements 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income  equity or goodwill in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of the net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
in and  provisions were made for us income taxes on certain undistributed earnings of non us subsidiaries as a decision was made to repatriate these earnings rather than permanently reinvest them 
if we decide to repatriate an amount of undistributed earnings in excess of those originally planned  we could be subject to additional income tax 
the significant assumptions and estimates described in the preceding paragraphs are important contributors to our ultimate effective tax rate for each year in addition to our income mix from geographical regions 
if any of our assumptions or estimates were to change  or should our income mix from our geographical regions change  our effective tax rate can be materially affected 
based on pre tax income of million for the year ended december   each increase of million in tax expense would increase our effective tax rate by 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when title to a product has transferred and any significant customer obligations have been fulfilled 
standard shipping terms are generally fob shipping point in most countries and accordingly  title transfers upon shipment 
for those few countries where title cannot legally transfer before delivery  we defer revenue recognition until delivery has occurred 
other than a few small software applications  mettler toledo does not sell its software products without the related hardware instrument as the software is embedded in the instrument 
the company s typical solution requires no significant production  modification or customization of the hardware or software that is essential to the functionality of the products 
revenues from service contracts are recognized ratably over the contract period 
warranty the company generally offers one year warranties on most of its products 
product warranties are recorded at the time revenue is recognized for certain product shipments 
while the company engages in extensive product quality programs and processes  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage and service costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
if we experience claims or significant cost changes in material  freight and vendor charges  our cost of goods sold could be affected
