critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those that are both important to the presentation of the company s financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  complex or subjective judgments 
set forth below is a summary of the accounting policies that management believes are critical to the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
this summary should be read in conjunction with the more complete discussion of the company s accounting policies included in note to the consolidated financial statements of the company 
revenue recognition the company records base rents on a straight line basis over the term of each lease 
the excess of rents recognized over amounts contractually due pursuant to the underlying leases is included in tenant receivables on the accompanying balance sheets 
most leases contain provisions that require tenants to reimburse a pro rata share of real estate taxes and certain common area expenses 
these amounts are recognized in the period the related expenses are incurred 
expense reimbursement payments generally are made monthly based on an estimated amount determined at the beginning of the year 
the difference between the actual amount due and the estimated amounts paid by the tenant throughout the year is billed or credited to the tenant 
allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance for doubtful accounts and mortgage notes receivable is established based on a quarterly analysis of the risk of loss on specific accounts 
the analysis places particular emphasis on past due accounts and considers information such as the nature and age of the receivables  the payment history of the tenants or other debtors  the financial condition of the tenants and management s assessment of their ability to meet their lease obligations  the basis for any disputes and the status of related negotiations  among other things 
management s estimates of the required allowance is subject to revision as these factors change and is sensitive to the effects of economic and market conditions on tenants  particularly those at retail centers 
it is the company s policy to maintain an allowance for future tenant credit losses of approximately of the deferred straight line rents receivable balance 
real estate land  buildings  property improvements  furniture fixtures and tenant improvements are recorded at cost 
expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred 
renovations and or replacements  which improve or extend the life of the asset  are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives 
properties are depreciated using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
the estimated useful lives are as follows buildings years property improvements years furniture fixtures years tenant improvements lease term the company is required to make subjective assessments as to the useful life of its properties for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation 
these assessments have a direct impact on the company s net income 
assessments by the company of certain other lease related costs are made when the company has a reason to believe that the tenant may not be able to perform under the terms of the lease as originally expected 
this requires management to make estimates as to the recoverability of such assets 
asset impairment on a periodic basis  management assesses whether there are any indicators that the value of the real estate properties and mortgage notes receivable may be impaired 
a property value is considered impaired only if management s estimate of current and projected operating cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges of the property over its remaining useful life is less than the net carrying value of the property 
such cash flow projections consider factors such as expected future operating income  trend and prospects  as well as the effects of demand  competition and other factors 
to the extent impairment has occurred  the loss is measured as the excess of the net carrying amount of the property over the fair value of the asset 
management does not believe that the value of any of its rental properties or mortgage notes receivable is impaired at october liquidity and capital resources at october   the company had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of million compared to million in the company also had million and million in short term investments as of october  and  respectively 
the company s cash positions and short term investments include the remaining proceeds from the sales of equity securities of the company during fiscal and the company s sources of liquidity and capital resources include its cash and cash equivalents  proceeds from bank borrowings and long term mortgage debt  capital financings and sales of real estate investments 
payments of expenses related to real estate operations  debt service  management and professional fees  and dividend requirements place demands on the company s short term liquidity 
the company expects to meet its short term liquidity requirements primarily by generating net cash from the operations of its properties 
the company believes that its net cash provided by operations will be sufficient to fund its short term liquidity requirements for fiscal and to meet its dividend requirements necessary to maintain its reit status 
in fiscal  and  net cash provided by operations amounted to million  million and million  respectively 
the increase in net cash from operating activities in fiscal reflects the additional operating income from a greater number of properties in the year 
cash dividends paid increased to million in compared to million in and million in the company expects to continue paying regular dividends to its stockholders 
these dividends will be paid from operating cash flows which are expected to increase due to property acquisitions and growth in operating income in the existing portfolio and from other sources 
the company derives substantially all of its revenues from tenants under existing leases at its properties 
the company s operating cash flow therefore depends on the rents that it is able to charge to its tenants  and the ability of its tenants to make rental payments 
the company believes that the nature of the properties in which it typically invests primarily grocery anchored neighborhood and community shopping centers provides a more stable revenue flow in uncertain economic times  in that consumers still need to purchase basic staples and convenience items 
however  even in the geographic areas in which the company owns properties  general economic downturns may adversely impact the ability of the company s tenants to make lease payments and the company s ability to re lease space as leases expire 
in either of these cases  the company s cash flow could be adversely affected 
capital resources the company expects to fund its long term liquidity requirements such as property acquisitions  repayment of indebtedness and capital expenditures through other long term indebtedness including indebtedness assumed in acquisitions  proceeds from sales of properties and or the issuance of equity securities 
the company believes that these sources of capital will continue to be available to it in the future to fund its long term capital needs  however  there are certain factors that may have a material adverse effect on its access to capital sources 
the company s ability to incur additional debt is dependent upon its existing leverage  the value of its unencumbered assets and borrowing limitations imposed by existing lenders 
the company s ability to raise funds through sales of equity securities is dependent on  among other things  general market conditions for reits  market perceptions about the company and its stock price in the market 
the company s ability to sell properties in the future to raise cash will be dependent upon market conditions at the time of sale 
in may  the company sold  shares of a new issue of series c cumulative preferred stock series c preferred stock for proceeds of million 
the preferred shares are redeemable at the option of the company after ten years 
the series c preferred stock issue entitles the holders to a cumulative dividend 
the company used a portion of the proceeds to purchase a shopping center in june the company intends to use the balance of the proceeds for property acquisitions 
in fiscal  the company sold  shares of its class a common stock for net proceeds to the company of million 
the net proceeds were used to repay million of outstanding revolving credit line indebtedness and the acquisitions of three properties 
in fiscal  the company sold  shares of its class a common stock for net proceeds of million of which million was received in fiscal the company also sold  shares of common stock and  shares of class a common stock in a private placement for proceeds of million 
the proceeds of these equity sales were used to complete the acquisitions of two properties  repay outstanding credit line borrowings and repurchase  shares of series b preferred stock at a cost of million 
the company is exposed to interest rate risk primarily through its borrowing activities 
there is inherent rollover risk for borrowings as they mature and are renewed at current market rates 
the extent of this risk is not quantifiable or predictable because of the variability of future interest rates and the company s future financing requirements 
at october   the company s contractual obligations for borrowings are as follows payments due by period amount less than year  to years  to years  after years  borrowings consist of  of fixed rate mortgage loan indebtedness with a weighted average interest rate of at october  the mortgage loans are secured by fourteen properties and have fixed rates of interest ranging from to 
the company may refinance certain of these borrowings  at or prior to maturity  through new mortgage loans on real estate 
the ability to do so  however  is dependent upon various factors  including the income level of the properties  interest rates and credit conditions within the commercial real estate market 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that such refinancing can be achieved 
at october   the company had a secured revolving credit facility with a bank which expires in fiscal and allows for borrowings up to million 
the secured line is collateralized by two properties having a net book value of million at october  the terms of the credit facility require a permanent reduction in the credit loan amount of  annually 
the company also has a million unsecured revolving line of credit with the same bank which expires in fiscal the revolving credit lines are available to finance the acquisition  management and or development of commercial real estate  refinance indebtedness and for working capital purposes 
extensions of credit under the unsecured credit line are at the bank s discretion and subject to the bank s satisfaction of certain conditions 
there were no borrowings during the year on either credit line and there were no outstanding borrowings at october  capital expenditures the company invests in its existing properties and regularly incurs capital expenditures in the ordinary course of business to maintain its properties 
the company believes that such expenditures enhance the competitiveness of its properties 
in fiscal  the company incurred million for capital expenditures including million related to tenant allowances and commissions in connection with the company s leasing activities 
the amounts of these expenditures can vary significantly depending on tenant negotiations  market conditions and rental rates 
the company expects to incur an additional million for known capital improvements and leasing costs in fiscal these expenditures are generally funded from operating cash flows or borrowings on its credit facilities 
acquisitions and sales the company seeks to acquire properties which are primarily shopping centers located in the northeastern part of the united states 
in fiscal  the company acquired four properties totaling  square feet in separate transactions for approximately million 
the properties were purchased with cash raised from sales of equity securities and consisted of the westchester pavilion in white plains  new york  a  square foot property for million  the orange meadows shopping center in orange  connecticut  a  square foot property for million  the greens farms plaza in westport  connecticut  a  square foot property for million and seven retail building units totaling  square feet in somers commons for million 
in fiscal  the company acquired a general partner interest in a shopping center in stamford  connecticut for million 
the property was acquired subject to a million first mortgage loan 
the company also purchased a shopping center in danbury  connecticut for million subject to a first mortgage loan of million and acquired the remaining interest in an office building that it did not own for a purchase price of million 
in fiscal  the company acquired two properties for million 
one property was acquired subject to a first mortgage loan of million 
in a prior year  the company s board of directors expanded and refined the strategic objectives of the company to refocus its real estate portfolio into one of self managed retail properties located in the northeast and authorized a plan to sell the company s non core properties in the normal course of business over a period of several years 
the non core properties consist of two distribution service facilities  one office building and one retail property all of which are located outside of the northeast region of the united states 
the company intends to sell its non core properties as opportunities become available 
the company s ability to generate cash from asset sales is dependent upon market conditions and will necessarily be limited if market conditions make such sales unattractive 
there were no sales of properties during fiscal at october   the non core properties total four properties with a net book value of approximately million 
funds from operations the company considers funds from operations ffo as defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit to be one supplemental financial measure of an equity reit s operating performance 
ffo is calculated as net income computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization  excluding gains or losses from sales of property and debt restructuring and after adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures 
ffo does not represent cash flows from operations as defined by gaap and should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of the company s operating performance or for cash flows as a measure of liquidity or its dividend paying capacity 
furthermore  ffo as disclosed by other reits might not be comparable to the company s calculation of ffo 
the table below provides a reconciliation of net income in accordance with gaap to ffo for each of the three years in the period ended october  amounts in thousands 
net income applicable to common and class a common stockholders    plus real property depreciation    amortization of tenant improvements and allowances    amortization of deferred leasing cost less adjustments for unconsolidated joint venture  gains on sales of real estate investments funds from operations applicable to common and class a common stockholders    net cash provided by used in operating activities    investing activities    financing activities    funds from operations for has been adjusted to conform with revised guidance provided by nareit regarding the calculation for ffo 
this revised guidance provides that amounts associated with preferred stock that has been redeemed or repurchased should be factored into the calculation of ffo 
as a result  the company has adjusted its fiscal ffo to include a  adjustment to record the excess of the carrying value over the cost to repurchase million of its series b preferred shares in that year in accordance with nareit s revised guidance 
the adjustment to fiscal ffo did not affect net income applicable to common and class a common stockholders in that year 
results of operations fiscal vs 
fiscal revenues revenues from operating rents increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the net increase in rents resulted primarily from i the acquisition of four properties in fiscal containing  square feet of leasable space  providing revenues of million in the year ii the full year impact related to two operating properties acquired in  providing incremental revenues of million in fiscal iii an increase in recoveries of property operating expenses and property taxes from tenants of  in fiscal and iv an overall increase in the leasing levels at the company s properties 
at october   the company s total portfolio was leased compared to leased in fiscal during fiscal  the company renewed or signed new leases totaling  square feet of space 
the company has leases totaling  square feet of leasable space or of total gla expiring in fiscal lease termination income of  represents a lease cancellation payment from a tenant who terminated its lease early 
this space was re leased during the year 
interest income in fiscal decreased due to the utilization of cash from the company s sale of  shares of class a common stock in fiscal the cash was used to acquire properties in fiscal expenses operating expenses  including depreciation and amortization increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal property expenses increased million from the incremental expense of recently acquired properties  which increased property expenses by million 
property expenses for properties owed during both periods increased from higher snow removal and property tax costs  which increased  and  respectively in fiscal interest expense increased to million from million principally from the full year impact of approximately million in first mortgage loans assumed in connection with property acquisitions in fiscal depreciation expense increased by million in fiscal from the additional depreciation on recent property acquisitions 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal due to increased compensation costs 
fiscal vs 
fiscal revenues revenues from operating leases increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase in revenues resulted from the addition of new rents from properties acquired and leasing of previously vacant space at properties owned in both years 
during fiscal and  the company acquired four properties which increased operating lease income by approximately million in fiscal in the company renewed or signed new leases totaling  square feet of space  however the overall leasing levels at the company s properties decreased to by the end of fiscal compared to leased at the end of fiscal the decrease in leasing levels reflected the loss of a tenant occupying  square feet at the company s five town plaza shopping center and a tenant occupying  square feet at the company s office property in southfield  michigan who re leased  square feet of its previously occupied space 
lease termination income of  in fiscal represents lease cancellation payments from tenants who terminated leases in the year 
interest income increased in fiscal from the investment of cash proceeds during the year into short term investments at generally lower yields and the addition of a million note receivable 
expenses total expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal property expenses increased to million from million principally from the incremental expense of new properties  which increased property expenses by million in fiscal property expenses for properties owned during and were generally unchanged 
snow removal costs decreased by approximately  which was largely offset by increases in property taxes and insurance costs 
interest expense increased from new mortgage loans totaling million assumed in connection with property acquisitions 
the increase in interest expense was partially offset by lower outstanding bank credit line borrowings during the year 
depreciation expense increased  from the additional expense related to property acquisitions in that year 
amortization expense decreased by  principally from the write off in fiscal of unamortized leasing commissions for tenants who vacated during the year 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal the increase was due primarily to increased compensation costs 
the company repurchased  shares of its series b preferred stock for  in a negotiated transaction with a holder of the preferred shares 
the company recorded the excess of the carrying value over the cost to repurchase the preferred shares of  as an increase in net income applicable to common and class a common stockholders 
inflation the company s long term leases contain provisions to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation on its operating results 
such provisions include clauses entitling the company to receive i scheduled base rent increases and ii percentage rents based upon tenants gross sales  which generally increase as prices rise 
in addition  the majority of the company s non anchor leases are for terms of less than ten years  which permits the company to seek increases in rents upon renewal at then current market rates if rents provided in the expiring leases are below then existing market rates 
most of the company s leases require tenants to pay a share of operating expenses  including common area maintenance  real estate taxes  insurance and utilities  thereby reducing the company s exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation 
environmental matters based upon management s ongoing review of its properties  management is not aware of any environmental condition with respect to any of the company s properties  which would be reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the company 
there can be no assurance  however  that i the discovery of environmental conditions  which were previously unknown  ii changes in law  iii the conduct of tenants or iv activities relating to properties in the vicinity of the company s properties  will not expose the company to material liability in the future 
changes in laws increasing the potential liability for environmental conditions existing on properties or increasing the restrictions on discharges or other conditions may result in significant unanticipated expenditures or may otherwise adversely affect the operations of the company s tenants  which would adversely affect the company s financial condition and results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to interest rate risk primarily through its borrowing activities 
there is inherent rollover risk for borrowings as they mature and are renewed at current market rates 
the extent of this risk is not quantifiable or predictable because of the variability of future interest rates and the company s future financing requirements 
as of october  and for the year then ended  the company had no outstanding borrowings under its bank line of credit arrangements 
during the year ended october   the average variable rate indebtedness during such period had a combined weighted average interest rate of 
had the weighted average interest rate been basis points higher  the company s net income would have been lower by approximately  in fiscal
